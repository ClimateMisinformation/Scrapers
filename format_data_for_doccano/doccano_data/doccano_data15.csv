The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) June 2015 results are out and once again the government-directed institute is  claiming the globe is at a record high temperature while the other independent global temperature datasets are telling a very different story.
The NOAA claims that the global surface temperature reached a new all-time record high with an anomaly +0.88°C – the warmest since recordkeeping began in 1880!
However measurements taken by satellite Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) show that although June 2015 indeed was a warm month at +0.39°C, it was only the 4th warmest June ever, and more than 30 other earlier months have seen greater positive anomalies.
Satellite data (revised) taken by the University of Alabama in Huntsville UAH show that the June 2015 temperature anomaly was +0.31°C, a warm month but not the hottest June ever as three other June months were as warm or warmer.
Moreover plots of the RSS and UAH data continue to show that global temperatures have been flat for now close to 20 years:

Even the Hadley Climate Research Unit (HadCrut) in England shows no temperature increase over the period.

Yet no one at the NOAA has gotten the idea that maybe their data and results have gone awry and that they’d be wise to look for what is causing it.
When asked what they thought of the NOAA June result, 2 expert meteorologists suggest that there’s probably more to it than faulty computational methodology and that it may have to do with scientists milking out the results they want.
When asked about the NOAA results, former Accuweather veteran meteorologist and now chief meteorologist at Weatherbell Analytics Joe Bastardi expressed serious doubts on the NOAA June results. In an e-mail he commented:
“NCEP real time data, computed every 6 hours from model input shows no such thing. It is available to the public at weatherbell.com/temperature.php. […] How is it the NCEP data, where NCEP is a part of NOAA, show no such warming? […]Moreover using NCEP data May, 2015, was the NINTH warmist, not the first, and June looks like 5th since 1998.”

2015, NOAA’s NCEP data show no records occurring.
Long-time meteorologist Joe D’aleo was more blunt about the suspicious NOAA data, writing that there’s probably on conflict of interest where the climate modelers also happen to be the data-crunchers. D’Aleo wrote in reply to an e-mail inquiry (my emphasis):
“The problem is that the same staff responsible for creating the reports about the climate (USGCRP, State of the Climate, EPA TSD, IPPC) and running some of the greenhouse models that project the scary scenarios (NOAA and downstream NASA) are also responsible for the databases that validate the forecasts. The actual data should be constructed independently of the forecasts with people who do not have a financial and personal interest in seeing their forecasts verify. Indeed we see in the independent datasets like the satellite and balloon based ones, widespread model failures.
There is a lot of control available for modelers to predict a desired result, and data source inconsistencies allow NOAA to be creative – and the result is a hybrid of data and models (with their adjustments like TOA, infilling and homogenization) to show whatever the puppet-masters in government require. It may be that some really believe in their science and work hard to mine the data, achieving a form of bias confirmation. In other cases it is ideologically or politically driven or a matter of job security.”no

No New Climate Targets Without Binding UN Climate Agreement, EU Energy Chief –

Measures to combat climate change may be causing more damage than current global warming, a former environment secretary has said. Owen Paterson, who was sacked in David Cameron’s reshuffle in July, attacked what he described as a “wicked green blob” of environmentalists for failing to explain the pause in global warming. –Matt Dathan, The Times, 28 September 2014
There has not been a temperature increase now for probably 18 years, some people say 26 years. So the pause is old enough to vote, the pause is old enough to join the army, the pause is old enough to pay its taxes. We were never told the pause was coming along, there are – as I understand it – about 30 different explanations for it and nobody explains why the pause is suddenly going to disappear and we’re going to get back on the track upwards. So I’m concerned that the measures being taken to counter projected dangers may actually be causing more damage now than those dangers. –Owen Paterson, The Times, 28 September 2014
Europe should only push ahead with its planned cuts to carbon emissions if the rest of the world agrees to a global climate change deal at a crunch summit in Paris next year, according to the EU’s energy chief. “If there is no binding commitment from countries as India, Russia, Brazil, the US, China, Japan and South Korea, whose governments are responsible for some 70% of global emissions, I think it is not really smart to have a -40% target,” the EU’s outgoing energy commissioner, Gunther Oettinger, told an oil and gas conference in Brussels. –Arthur Neslen, The Guardian, 25 September 2014
In a blow to American hopes of reaching an international deal to fight global warming, India’s new environment minister said Wednesday that his country would not offer a plan to cut its greenhouse gas emissions ahead of a climate summit next year in Paris. The minister, Prakash Javadekar, said in an interview that his government’s first priority was to alleviate poverty and improve the nation’s economy, which he said would necessarily involve an increase in emissions through new coal-powered electricity and transportation. It would be at least 30 years, he said, before India would likely see a downturn in CO2 emissions. –Carol Davenport, The New York Times 24 September 2014
What cuts? That’s for more developed countries. The moral principle of historic responsibility cannot be washed away. India’s first task is eradication of poverty. Twenty percent of our population doesn’t have access to electricity, and that’s our top priority. We will grow faster, and our CO2 emissions will rise.  –Indian Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, The New York Times 24 September 2014
Two Nasa astronauts, whose photographs of Earth from space helped to start the environmental movement, believe the images have been “exploited” by campaigners against global warming. Charlie Duke, a member of the Apollo 16 mission in 1972 who took one of the blue marble images, told last week’s Starmus science festival in Tenerife: “Climate science is bogus. The world has got no warmer for more than 15 years. It is a great irony that the images taken on the Apollo missions have been used in this way. We helped to start it [the environment movement] but I do not agree with it.” Walter Cunningham, who flew on Apollo 7, said: “Climate science is one of the greatest scientific fiascos of all time.” –Jonathan Leake, The Sunday Times, 27 September 2014
Germany’s energy revolution—its energiewende—was supposed to blaze a trail, and show off a new way countries could meet their energy needs without wrecking their environment or the climate. It was an audacious experiment, but it’s hard to read much success out of it these days. It’s hard to imagine a worse set of outcomes for Germany — higher electricity prices, a rising reliance on the dirtiest fossil fuel around (coal), an accelerated phase out of one of the only zero-carbon baseload power sources around (nuclear), and a less diverse, less secure energy mix that leaves Germany exposed to the machinations of exporters like Russia. –Walter Russell Mead, The American Interest, 27 September 2014

From the National Science Foundation: Press Release 14-081 
Ancient ocean currents may have changed pace and intensity of ice ages
Climate scientists have long tried to explain why ice-age cycles became longer and more intense some 900,000 years ago, switching from 41,000-year cycles to 100,000-year cycles.


Slowing of currents may have flipped switch




About 950,000 years ago, North Atlantic currents, Northern Hemisphere ice sheets underwent changes.
Credit and Larger Version



June 26, 2014
Climate scientists have long tried to explain why ice-age cycles became longer and more intense some 900,000 years ago, switching from 41,000-year cycles to 100,000-year cycles.
In a paper published this week in the journal Science Express, researchers report that the deep ocean currents that move heat around the globe stalled or may have stopped at that time, possibly due to expanding ice cover in the Northern Hemisphere.
“The research is a breakthrough in understanding a major change in the rhythm of Earth’s climate, and shows that the ocean played a central role,” says Candace Major, program director in the National Science Foundation (NSF)’s Division of Ocean Sciences, which funded the research.
The slowing currents increased carbon dioxide (CO2) storage in the oceans, leaving less CO2 in the atmosphere. That kept temperatures cold and kicked the climate system into a new phase of colder, but less frequent, ice ages, the scientists believe.
“The oceans started storing more carbon dioxide for a longer period of time,” says Leopoldo Pena, the paper’s lead author and a paleoceanographer at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO). “Our evidence shows that the oceans played a major role in slowing the pace of the ice ages and making them more severe.”
The researchers reconstructed the past strength of Earth’s system of ocean currents by sampling deep-sea sediments off the coast of South Africa, where powerful currents originating in the North Atlantic Ocean pass on their way to Antarctica.
How vigorously those currents moved can be inferred by how much North Atlantic water made it that far, as measured by isotope ratios of the element neodymium bearing the signature of North Atlantic seawater.
Like tape recorders, the shells of ancient plankton incorporate these seawater signals through time, allowing scientists to approximate when currents grew stronger and when weaker.
Over the last 1.2 million years, the conveyor-like currents strengthened during warm periods and lessened during ice ages, as previously thought.
But at about 950,000 years ago, ocean circulation slowed significantly and stayed weak for 100,000 years.
During that period the planet skipped an interglacial–the warm interval between ice ages. When the system recovered, it entered a new phase of longer, 100,000-year ice age cycles.
After this turning point, deep ocean currents remained weak during ice ages, and ice ages themselves became colder.
“Our discovery of such a major breakdown in the ocean circulation system was a big surprise,” said paper co-author Steven Goldstein, a geochemist at LDEO. “It allowed the ice sheets to grow when they should have melted, triggering the first 100,000-year cycle.”
Ice ages come and go at predictable intervals based on the changing amount of sunlight that falls on the planet, due to variations in Earth’s orbit around the sun.
Orbital changes alone, however, are not enough to explain the sudden switch to longer ice age intervals.
According to one earlier hypothesis for the transition, advancing glaciers in North America stripped away soils in Canada, causing thicker, longer-lasting ice to build up on the remaining bedrock.
Building on that idea, the researchers believe that the advancing ice might have triggered the slowdown in deep ocean currents, leading the oceans to vent less carbon dioxide, which suppressed the interglacial that should have followed.
“The ice sheets must have reached a critical state that switched the ocean circulation system into a weaker mode,” said Goldstein.
Neodymium, a key component of cellphones, headphones, computers and wind turbines, also offers a good way of measuring the vigor of ancient ocean currents.
Goldstein and colleagues had used neodymium ratios in deep-sea sediment samples to show that ocean circulation slowed during past ice ages.
They used the same method to show that changes in climate preceded changes in ocean circulation.
A trace element in Earth’s crust, neodymium washes into the oceans through erosion from the continents, where natural radioactive decay leaves a signature unique to the land mass from which it originated.
When Goldstein and Lamont colleague Sidney Hemming pioneered this method in the late 1990s, they rarely worried about surrounding neodymium contaminating their samples.
The rise of consumer electronics has changed that.
“I used to say you could do sample processing for neodymium analysis in a parking lot,” said Goldstein. “Not anymore.”

"The UK’s carbon emissions have begun to rebound following the easing of Covid-19 lockdown measures, causing the “carbon savings” triggered by the coronavirus to halve within weeks. Greenhouse gas emissions from the energy and transport industries climbed last month as more people returned to work, raising demand for fossil fuels from record lows in April when strict lockdown measures were in place, according to new data. An analysis by Sia Partners, seen by the Guardian, shows that the UK’s carbon emissions fell by 36% in the first four weeks of the lockdown compared to the most recent official carbon emissions data collected in 2018. But by June Britain’s total emissions savings had dwindled to a 16% drop as more cars returned to its roads and demand for energy began to rise. Chloé Depigny, a senior manager at Sia Partners, said the data underlines the fragility of the UK’s short-term carbon savings during the coronavirus, and the need for ambitious fundamental changes to the economy if the government hopes to meet its long-term carbon targets. The data reveals that at the start of the lockdown Britain recorded a 90% collapse in carbon emissions from the aviation sector, a 60% fall in emissions from passenger vehicles and a 30% decline in emissions from Britain’s energy system. In the last month the emissions savings from road use shrank from 60% to 30% of typical levels, and the decrease from the energy system contracted from 30% to 15%. If lockdown measures are removed entirely by early October the total carbon savings from the coronavirus may erode to 10% below normal levels over the year as a whole, down 1 percentage point from the consulting firm’s previous full-year forecasts earlier this year. “In order to meet the UK’s net zero target by 2050 the UK needs to cut 12 megatonnes of CO2 every year – this is the equivalent of 3% of the emissions in 2018. So 10% is definitely a significant fall,” she said. “However, from a climate point of view if this only occurs in 2020 and normal emissions return in 2021 then these savings will mean only a very small dent to emissions in the end. We saw this in the 2008 financial crisis; emissions very quickly returned to pre-crisis levels,” she added. One of the greatest threats to the UK’s carbon savings this year is a surge in demand for road travel as more people opt to use passenger vehicles over public transport to avoid contact with the coronavirus. “This is one of the big uncertainties as we emerge from lockdown,” said Depigny. “If everyone is concerned about using public transport, and chooses to switch to using cars, then road emissions may well explode over the second half of the year, and could cause even a 10% emissions cut to disappear within a few months.” Another threat to carbon reductions in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak is the number of people who may continue to work from home during the winter months. The report predicts that the carbon footprint of British homes is expected to be 6% higher than normal in 2020 based on the assumption that many people working from home will make a gradual return to office spaces from October. But a second lockdown during the colder months could mean far higher residential carbon emissions than currently forecast, Depigny said. “We have been lucky that lockdown has happened during warm summer months. If there was a second lockdown during the winter, homes would rely on gas-heating to keep their homes warm all day, which would produce far more emissions than during the summer. It would probably counter most of the savings from less commuting,” she said."

"**The US Senate Commerce Committee has voted to subpoena the heads of Google, Facebook, and Twitter.**
It means that Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey face being quizzed by senators about their policies on different types of content.
One focus will be the legal protections they enjoy regarding what they leave up and take down on their platforms.
They are also likely to be challenged over controversies about privacy and misinformation.
Republicans and Democrats on the committee voted unanimously to summon the chief executives.
However, each side is likely to have different priorities - with some Republican members speaking about the alleged censorship of conservative views online, while Democrats focus on competition and misinformation.
""There has never been such an aggregation of power in the history of humankind as big tech enjoys today, with money and monopoly, power and the hubris that comes with the unchecked use of power,"" Republican Senator Ted Cruz said following the vote.
The subpoenas follow an earlier hearing in July when Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google's chiefs testified to a House committee about competition issues and claims of bias.
Currently, social media platforms and other websites are protected from prosecution under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
It means, in effect, that the platforms are not liable for what is posted by their users if they take things down once notified, unlike traditional newspaper publishers.
But the protection has been thrown back into the spotlight this year after President Trump argued it should no longer apply if social networks were engaged in ""an editorial role"" - such as when Twitter began adding warnings and labels to some of the president's tweets.
Democrats on the Commerce Committee had initially objected to their Republican colleagues' use of the subpoena power, but changed their minds for the vote on Thursday after the scope of the discussion was widened.
Mr Trump's Democratic rival in the forthcoming election, Joe Biden, has previously said Section 230 should be revoked, but for different reasons - what he called ""propagating falsehoods"".
The three chief executives had initially been invited to attend voluntarily, but declined.
The fresh summons is the latest regulatory headache for the tech giants, who face a raft of critical decisions by authorities in the coming weeks.
July's congressional hearing with the companies, plus Amazon, dealt with anti-trust issues, including allegations that they had deliberately eliminated smaller rivals in a quest for market dominance.
The congressional report into that event is expected to be published next week.
The US Department of Justice is understood to be in discussions with state attorneys general over a potential anti-trust case against Google over its practices - a legal action which could also begin as early as next week.
And similar actions are being pieced together abroad.
The European Union's draft version of a forthcoming law reportedly bans tech giants from giving their own products preferential treatment.
The draft of the Digital Services Act, seen by a number of news outlets, says that big tech ""gatekeepers"" may have to share user data with rivals to create an even playing field in some circumstances.
And in China, Reuters news agency reports that the country is preparing its own competition probe into Google over the Android phone operating system.
US sanctions on Huawei on national security grounds have created a challenge for the company - one of the world's biggest phone manufacturers - which says it will begin using its own non-Android operating system next year.
That decision is also expected this month."
"**It was perhaps the biggest collection of wealth and power ever gathered on one video call - and I'm not talking about the members of the House Judiciary Committee.**
In this week's Tech Tent podcast, I ask whether the Congressional hearing with the tech titans has done anything to curb the power of these immensely wealthy businesses.
Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Google's Sundar Pichai and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg are all accustomed to speaking without interruption, with their colleagues hanging on their every word.
But on Wednesday, each of them had to get used to being cut off, sometimes quite abruptly in mid-flow by congressmen and women impatient to get answers to questions about the abuse of market power within their allotted five minutes.
Mark Zuckerberg's tactic of starting every answer by saying: ""Congressman, that's a great question"" or ""Congresswoman, thanks for the opportunity"" seemed to irritate the lawmakers, perhaps understandably.
The Facebook boss's attempt to prevaricate was met with a bullish response from the committee chairman, New York Democrat Jerry Nadler, when he asked whether the company had grown by simply buying up competing start-ups, such as Instagram.
""Yes or no?"" he and his colleagues kept demanding of Zuckerberg, and the other chief executives.
When Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon quoted a report that Jeff Bezos had talked of treating business partners like a cheetah in pursuit of a sickly gazelle, the Amazon boss said he had no memory of that, and started to talk about his only focus being on customers.
Within seconds, the congresswoman was talking over him, pointing out that her time was running out and she needed an answer.
Like a number of his Republican colleagues, Congressman Jim Jordan, of Ohio, ignored anti-trust issues to press the tech leaders on allegations that their companies were biased against conservatives.
Sundar Pichai seemed taken aback when asked to guarantee that Google would not manipulate its technology to favour Joe Biden in the forthcoming election.
He started talking about how conservatives had more access to information from the search engine than ever, before being interrupted and then finally stumbling through a promise that Google would conduct itself in a neutral way.
By the end, you could almost hear the sighs of relief from the mighty foursome that the barrage of hostile questions was over.
Whether the Democrats or the Republicans prevail in November's elections, surely there are hard times ahead?
Tougher regulation, even the threat of break-ups from Joe Biden, or Donald Trump's revenge on his perceived social-media enemies, perhaps?
Not according to the stock market.
The day after the hearing, the four tech giants all posted quarterly results - and they had all shown remarkable resilience in the face of the pandemic.
""Breathtaking"", was how one analyst described Apple's results. Amazon's 40% growth in revenues was ""staggering"", said another. Tech shares raced to new record highs as the markets opened on Friday.
Now, you might think this new evidence of the wealth and power of these companies would make the politicians even more determined to clip their wings.
Don't bet on it.
Both Republicans and Democrats are increasingly focused on the trade war with China. Whatever the faults of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, they are American success stories - and damaging them at this sensitive time may be seen as unpatriotic."
"

Press Release: **New Conservative**



Standing with the farmers, New Conservative is committed to pushing back against the lunacy of the ETS and Carbon Zero commitments by this government.   
  
New Conservative is concerned the [Carbon Zero Bill ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/letter-to-the-editor-zero-carbon-bill/)will have little, if any, measurable benefits to New Zealand, while at the same time seriously impinge on the sustainability of our food and goods production.  
  
New Conservative has consistently stood behind its commitment to remove New Zealand from the Paris Accord and to abandon the ETS, diverting the billions of dollars lost overseas to developing real pollution solutions for our waterways, our air, and our land.  
  
The recent passing of the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act 2019, highlights the failure of this Government to represent the best interests of New Zealanders.   
  
“New Zealand is a nation of creative and brilliant minds who have led the world repeatedly with our innovative solutions. We are not a nation that needs to buy into international influences, but we are a nation that can take the lead and contribute to good environmental outcomes,” says Leighton Baker, New Conservative leader.   
  
New Zealand farming could already be net carbon zero if they were allowed to calculate all the carbon that is sequestered by all the plants that grow on their farms.  
  
“Instead of acknowledging the enormous efforts already made by the farming community, **this Government only includes[plantation forests](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/400000-a-year-for-doing-nothing/) in its calculations.** This neglects all the native plants, hedgerows, trees, crops etc on farms,” says Mr Baker.   
  
Mr Baker observes that ignoring the investment farmers have made is similar to expecting businesses to survive if they had to pay all the GST they collect to the government, but were unable to deduct GST already paid to suppliers.  
  
 **“We cannot make farmers accountable for all the CO2 they produce without deducting all that they sequester,”** adds Mr Baker.  
  
New Conservative is standing by the farmers and is determined to see that all New Zealanders are protected from being driven further away from pollution solutions by **unproven initiatives that have enormous financial impacts.  
**  
“New Zealand’s ‘nuclear free moment’ is when we stand up against pressures from larger powers to protect our way of life and prioritise what we value. That will be when we stand up for our sovereignty and refuse to be influenced by ineffective international agreements,” concludes Mr Baker.

"Over 12 days at the start of October 2019 eight people were killed, more than 1,300 injured and nearly 1,200 arrested after demonstrations became violent in Ecuador. The demonstrations focused on reversing the ending of fuel subsidies, which had been brought in as part of austerity measures backed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The protests only ended when president Lenín Moreno agreed to restore the subsidies. In the summer of 2016, the northern region of Venezuela was gripped by violence. The unrest was a result of a steep fall in oil prices, which led to severe shortages in food and basic necessities, as imports became unaffordable. Many were killed as they queued for food. When a man set himself on fire outside parliament in Cairo over the price of bread in 2011, ensuing protests led to the collapse of the government. And during riots in West Bengal, India, in 2007, 300 people were injured and two were shot dead by police as villagers raged against a corrupt food distribution system. So what links these seemingly unconnected international tragedies? Everyone needs food, fuel and water to live. It’s a fact of life. When these become scarce, it is inevitable that chaos follows – rioting, protest, death. This link to increases in death rate can be direct – through starvation or dehydration – or indirect, if they lead to a rise in suicide or violent social unrest. If indirect, there is usually a trigger which links back to the physical scarcity, lack of access to or mismanagement of these vital natural resources. This has, of course, always been the case. Scarce food, water or fuel has always led to death. And in modern times people have been lulled into a sense of security when it comes to scarcity – at least over much of the world. It is often assumed that things are better than they were, that there are more resources and improved international protocols for sharing those resources when things get tough. But is this really true? In the age of climate change, perhaps not. Climate change is only going to worsen the chaos attendant on resource shortage – and, therefore, death rates. Increases in extreme weather will have adverse impacts on food production and water availability. Indeed, they already are. Meanwhile, fossil fuel depletion and unstable exporting regions will lead to huge increases in the cost of energy. Future food, fuel and water prices are at the very least going to be more volatile.  This will mean that an increasing part of the world’s population will find it more and more difficult to access fundamental resources. A vulnerable and usually poorer population will face real threats to life and livelihood. Stress will then become heightened if an individual or community experiences injustice or is living in an increasingly fragile state, with little expectation that things will change for the better. Hopelessness or anger may manifest, resulting in a need for answers and action.  To avert unnecessary deaths, mitigate social unrest and effectively manage natural assets, governments and states must devise policies and early intervention programmes in disaster risk management and peace-building. This isn’t something that needs to happen in the future – it needs to happen now. This article is part of Conversation Insights
The Insights team generates long-form journalism derived from interdisciplinary research. The team is working with academics from different backgrounds who have been engaged in projects aimed at tackling societal and scientific challenges.  Of course, any attempt to do so needs to be based on historical examples of deaths caused by environmental stress. But the data on environmental conflict is rare and fragmented, making the study of conflict due to resource insecurity challenging. To fill this gap, we have launched an interactive map of such events over the last 12 years, illustrating that environmental stress is already causing chaos, globally. We define chaos as a combination of natural resource insecurity, social unrest and at least one death. We sourced the data from news items, focusing on key search words, such as “food protest” or “fuel crisis”, to match events that include at least one reported death due to underlying food, fuel or water security issues. Out of a total collective “chaos figure” of 1,625 deaths over the period studied, 20% of deaths on the chaos map are attributed to suicide. The highest death toll was 425 in Sri Lanka, for a single event in August 2006 when Tamil rebels and the Sri Lankan army fought to control an irrigation sluice near Trincomalee.  This map is a pilot project and currently holds data on events up to 2017. But it something we aim to update and maintain in order to provide consistent open access data for the research community, as well as governments and NGOs. It could underpin their understanding of the trends that drive this type of chaos. The map shows that deaths linked to natural resource insecurity are already happening. We hope that by highlighting this we will increase the pressure on governments to develop food, water and energy strategies which take into account the likelihood of chaos and therefore build more resilience into the global and local economy. The chaos events we tracked were not limited to sensational breaking news stories that make global headlines. We also covered less-publicised incidents, such as farmer suicides in Australia and the death of a woman during the Gilets Jaunes protests in France. These smaller incidents are as important to track as the major outbreaks of civil unrest as they highlight ongoing pressures in the food, fuel and water systems.  It is also likely that the data points we collected reveal an extremely conservative estimate of the reality of chaos around the world triggered by environmental insecurity. This is because a significant amount of under-reporting occurs due to delays between initial food, water or fuel access issues and eventual deaths through protest, or even censorship and a lack of media coverage (in English).  For example, while many commentators have since linked food insecurity to the early demonstrations that led to the Syria unrest, no individual news report explicitly links a particular death to those early demonstrations. Or at least no news report included both the food insecurity demonstrations and someone’s death in the same article. So there were no news reports in the database that we searched and this event is therefore not included in the map.  This highlights that episodes related to fuel or food insecurity which do not immediately involve death, can escalate, leading to other protests (potentially no longer directly linked to the underlying food or fuel insecurity). They can then cascade into much larger impacts, such as the Arab Spring or Syrian civil war, which of course led to thousands of deaths. Alongside the data we collected, we have also developed a commentary series, selecting specific chaos events and gathering further information on the immediate context, how these events unfolded and the identification of reoccurring common themes. We hope that others will build on our work, diving into the particular issues associated with each recorded event to enhance our understanding of the compounding factors which lead to chaos and identify common conditions and triggers. This is crucial work to do in the context of the current climate crisis. To demonstrate the forces at work, let’s consider two examples of the chaos points on our map. There’s the case of West Bengal, which saw food riots linked to changes in food price subsidies in 2007, and the case of Venezuela, which saw a change in fuel prices for export lead to food shortages – and then chaos. These two examples highlight how different local and international dynamics can still lead to similar chaotic situations.  During the September to October 2007 food protests in West Bengal, India, 300 people were injured and two were shot dead by police. At least three food distributors were captured and told to pay fines. Unable to raise the cash and in combination with public shaming, they killed themselves.  How did this happen? India has systems set up that are supposed to deal with resource insecurity and hold chaos at bay. For many years, the country operated a Public Distribution System (PDS) which supplies essential commodities at a subsidised price through an extensive network of fair-priced shops to both rural and urban households below the poverty level.  But a central government investigation in February 2007 found that most rural poor in northern and eastern India failed to receive regular rations of food. It was found that rural West Bengal had the highest number of households below the poverty line and faced seasonal starvation, with 28% of household livelihoods rooted in agricultural labour. Rising wheat prices also prompted households above the poverty level to demand wheat rations from the PDS. The survey further revealed that food distributors were hoarding grain and selling it for premium prices on the open market.  For example, on at least two occasions in Radhamohanpur, West Bengal, villagers caught local food dealers selling subsidised grain outside the village. They reported this to the ruling Communist Party of India Marxist (CPM). But villagers felt that the CPM was not only protecting the dealers (as no action was taken) but financially benefiting from party donations from dealers’ growing wealth. It was only a matter of time before poor villagers reached breaking point and on September 16, 2007, a perfect storm gathered. The national survey had confirmed the belief held by millions – of a corrupt system resulting in hunger and a widening gap between rich and poor. They also believed the village leader and dealer were partners in ration theft and sought to formally present the allegations to the CPM leaders and put them under pressure to force them to take some action. A rickshaw cycle, microphone and a variety of slogans were organised by the villagers, who selected the most educated among them to communicate the slogans across four neighbouring villages where food dealers lived. The rickshaw gathered a crowd of 20 to confront the dealer but the CPM was sheltering them to avoid confrontation.  Up to 12 villagers entered a convention organised by the party leaders to voice their grievances. But they were told by the party there was no time to hear from them. A district council member urged the protesting villagers to do what they could as the dealer was inside the school. The crowd began pushing and shoving. When they saw that the crowd was turning against them, party members, who were standing behind a barricade, took out firewood and waved it aggressively at the crowd. By this stage, the crowd had grown massively in size, with accounts ranging from between 1,000 and 5,000 – mainly male – villagers gathered outside the school. When the police were called in the crowd turned violent. Stones and bricks were thrown at the party convention and at police officers. The Rapid Action Force (RAF) was deployed, firing blank rounds into the protesters who quickly dissipated. The RAF was forced to stay in the village for a month to keep the peace. But two deaths of protesters occurred and spill-over violence erupted in the neighbouring villages and towns of Murshidabad, Bankura and Birbhum.  Food chaos can also stem from fuel crises. The northern region of Venezuela, particularly the state of Sucre and district capital Caracas, was gripped by violence and ten deaths in the summer of 2016, and many more deaths in subsequent years. The unrest was a result of a steep fall in Venezuelan oil prices, which led to severe shortages in food and basic necessities, as imports became unaffordable.  Since taking office in 2013, president Nicolas Maduro had continued to follow socialist economic policies. But years of mismanagement left the country more dependent on imports. As oil accounts for 95% of Venezuela’s export revenue, the country took a major blow to its income when prices declined. Following a decision to reduce imports of food and basic necessities to pay off national debts, a state of economic emergency was declared in early 2016. The resulting food shortages worsened and the ensuing anger led to unrest. The political opposition made efforts to call a referendum to oust president Maduro, but government councils stymied these efforts. The armed forces were granted power to resolve social unrest and General Vladimir Padrino Lopez was promoted to minister of defence. The military took control of all food transportation and distribution, controlling prices and simulating production, in addition to guarding the ports, running Venezuela’s largest bank and managing a television station. Unable to produce or import enough food for a population of over 30m, the looting of grocery stores and food trucks began. Hyperinflation of 200% was recorded in mid-2016 with people spending an average of 35 hours per month in food queues. Frustration at having to queue resulted in more looting. In one such incident, an 80-year-old woman was crushed to death in a stampede. Stationary queues resulted in muggings and shootings, despite the presence of armed soldiers. The collapsed healthcare system and homicide rates of 90 per 100,000 residents meant Venezuela rivalled El Salvador as the world’s deadliest place. Thousands of Venezuelans travelled to Colombia in search of basic food and medicine. Violent outbreaks and riots from mid-2015 to mid-2016 saw over 24 killed while queuing, 30 injured and over 400 arrested.

 Climate change isn’t going away any time soon. Nor are issues like fuel shortages and social deprivation. It is likely, then, that trends in food, water and energy systems – including increases in demand – will see more volatility in prices and inequality in access. This is particularly true for key regions that may potentially become unstable (such as the Middle East or North Africa).  The links across different resources (food, water and fuel systems), different levels (local and global) and different dimensions (environmental, political and social) are clear. These links provide the network that allows shocks to cascade through the global economic system. For example, a collapse in fuel output in one location can trigger sudden increases in international prices of food which in turn result in widespread impacts and, in cases where politically fragile settings exist, chaos.  Society can better prepare for a more volatile future, or even help to reduce the likely volatility, by being guided by past “chaos events” and understanding the risk of environmental conflict around the globe before it escalates. Previous examples show us that governments should better map key bottle necks in food and energy supply chains so they can prepare to respond when a future global shock causes increases in prices or a reduction in availability. Nations and states, meanwhile, need to have a water strategy that can forecast demand as well as understand likely changes in supply due to climate change or degradation (chemical pollution or salt water intrusion).  The international community needs to understand which countries are more susceptible to food and fuel price shocks so that aid can be proactively deployed to reduce this exposure. Being better prepared for such events should reduce the “chaos toll” and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of aid spending. There are ways that migration and civil disobedience can be avoided. Given the right help and support, a community may be able to diversify livelihoods and develop alternative and sustainable fuel, food and water options.  Certain themes shine through that could inform possible local interventions. For example, the West Bengal case highlights the risks involved in government corruption, poverty and subsidies. A long legacy of distrust based on land-grabbing, theft of food rations and lack of response to village concerns in reporting the dealers for selling rations, was in place. Governments need to build trust, give space for a community’s legitimate grievances to be heard, support community voices to exercise their legal right to protest, and hold anyone guilty of corruption accountable for their crimes. In the case of Venezuela, government mismanagement, military presence, inflation, reliance on imports and long queues were all factors. Seeking high-level agreements to suspend debt payments while requesting additional loans or aid from the international community and securing essential supplies would have been critical to tackle the medium-term crisis. Short-term solutions, like identifying queuing alternatives such as drop-in days by alphabet based on name, may have helped reduce chaos. An earlier intervention in this case would focus on diversification of national revenue away from oil. In addition, supporting local food and water security initiatives would build local resilience and reduce the potential exposure of communities to international prices.  The earlier effective interventions can be made, the more likely it is that the risk of chaos can be averted. Interventions generally require decentralised, democratic, participatory and representative models, that address the essential needs of those in the lowest socioeconomic groups. In tandem, adaptable plans that include energy alternatives, such as renewables, resilient and diverse food systems and integrated water management, should operate locally.  Our chaos map brings together data that can help inform thinking around the factors that lead to chaos. With better information, we can then work with people across the board – decision makers, academics, practitioners and local communities – to achieve a less chaotic system and, hopefully, reduce future death tolls.

"WASHINGTON  —   The Federal Reserve is waiting for more information about the Trump administration’s economic plans, just like everyone else. After its first policy making meeting of the year, the Fed said on Wednesday that its economic outlook remained essentially unchanged since its previous meeting in December. The nation’s    economic expansion has continued, with little sign in the latest data that it is flagging or accelerating. And as expected, the Federal Open Market Committee, which makes monetary policy, left the Fed’s benchmark interest rate unchanged. The question is what comes next. Fed officials said in the weeks before the meeting Wednesday that their uncertainty about the outlook had increased. President Trump has proposed significant shifts in economic policy  —   including changes in taxation, regulation and trade  —   that could affect growth. “The statement is written such that the F. O. M. C. will be able to adjust monetary policy as needed in response to the fiscal and trade policies of the administration,” said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. At its December meeting, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate for just the second time since the financial crisis. After the increase of a quarter point, the rate now ranges from 0. 5 percent to 0. 75 percent, still very low by historical standards. Low rates encourage borrowing and   contributing to faster economic growth. By raising rates, the Fed is gradually reducing the force of that stimulus. Fed officials predicted in December that they would raise the benchmark rate three times this year. But they have cautioned that changes in fiscal policy could alter those plans. If Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans seek to increase growth, for example by cutting taxes or spending a lot on infrastructure and the military, the Fed could raise rates more quickly. If Mr. Trump’s policies weigh on growth, the Fed could move more slowly. The only hint of those pressures in the Fed’s latest statement was a mention of increased public optimism about the outlook for the nation’s economy. “Measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late,” it said. Fed officials are watching fiscal policy makers closely because the Fed has concluded that the American economy is growing at something close to the maximum sustainable pace, meaning that, in the Fed’s view, faster growth would probably lead to higher inflation. Changes in fiscal policy are most likely to have a gradual impact, however, so the tension between the Fed and fiscal policy makers may play out mostly in coming years. “The committee is probably still in a    mode as far as fiscal policy is concerned,” said Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC. The Fed’s assessment of economic conditions remained upbeat. The latest data showed “the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace,” the statement said. “Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate stayed near its recent low. ” Fed officials spoke in similarly optimistic tones in the weeks before the meeting. “All in all, things are looking good,” Patrick T. Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in  . “We’re starting 2017 off on a good foot. ” But seven years of tepid growth have not restored the economy to full health. The unemployment rate stood at 4. 7 percent in December, a level most Fed officials regard as nearly normal. Other labor market measures, however, remain weak. Wage growth is tepid, and the employment to population ratio for people 25 to 54 was 78. 2 percent in December. The Fed’s preferred measure of price inflation, the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ index of personal consumption expenditures, rose by 1. 6 percent in 2016, the strongest performance in more than two years. But inflation remains below the Fed’s goal of a 2 percent annual pace  —   a goal the Fed has not achieved since 2011. The vote to leave rates unchanged was unanimous, the Fed said. And the tempered language of the statement led investors to mark down the modest chance of a rate increase at the Fed’s next meeting, in March, from about 20 percent before the February statement to about 18 percent afterward, CME Group said. Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Fed, will have a chance to elaborate on the central bank’s economic outlook and policy plans when she delivers a semiannual report on monetary policy to Senate and House committees on Feb. 14 and 15. In the meantime, the Fed is the rare corner of official Washington where nothing is happening. Contrasting a lively week at the White House and on Capitol Hill with the Fed’s announcement, Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, declared the Fed’s headquarters “the most boring spot in Washington. ”"

Australia’s goldfish-brained journalists and politicians act predictably and stupidly, every summer. It’s Australia: it gets hot, [there are bushfires](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/who-green-lit-australias-catastrophic-bushfires/). Every decade or so, there are mega-fires. And, every time, the memory-challenged idiots in newsrooms and electoral offices act with the same, predictable faux-horror and opportunistic “outrage”.



All sides of politics are guilty of the political necrophilia that sees them scrambling atop the bodies and the ashes to wave their little, self-righteous flags. Most odious are, naturally, the patron saints of predatory sanctimony, the Greens.



Greens MP Adam Bandt has no need to battle bushfires in his downtown Melbourne electorate, but that is not the reason he should shut up until the crisis is over. He should do so out of basic human decency […]



Among low ebbs, it is hard to recall an instance in which Australian politics has been dragged as low as Mr Bandt blaming Scott Morrison and his ministers for the tragedy engulfing NSW and Queensland and touching other states…Greens leader Richard Di Natale came a close second.



While the Greens are sickening, it’s almost as galling to have to stomach the likes of Barnaby Joyce kicking their own little can into the ashes.



Barnaby Joyce says the policies of the Greens have increased the bushfire threat, as he claims a lack of hazard reduction burning has helped fuel fires in regional NSW and Queensland […]



“We don’t have access to dams because they have been decommissioned on national parks because of green policy. We have trees that have fallen over vehicles and block roads, so people cannot either get access to fight a fire or to get away from fires. And we can’t knock over the trees because of Greens policy.”



There is at least some small measure of truth in what Joyce says, along with a heapin’ helpin’ of ignorant drivel. Nonetheless, he is still doing exactly as the Greens are: exploiting a tragedy for political gain.



Senior Coalition and Labor MPs have launched a bitter attack on the Greens for suggesting climate change policies are responsible for the catastrophic bushfire threat confronting NSW and Queensland.



[…] Federal Labor agriculture spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon, who is facing fire threats in his NSW seat of Hunter, lashed the Greens for politicising the catastrophe.



He is correct. But there is also blame-shifting and opportunism at play, too. Especially from state governments, who bear the primary responsibility for managing fuel loads in their forests.



What, exactly, contributed to these latest fires will be determined in due course by the inevitable Royal Commission. But, then, we’ve already had a Royal Commission into catastrophic bushfires.



The royal commission into Australia’s worst bushfires, on Black Saturday in Victoria in 2009, found communities and local flora and fauna were safer by reducing combustible fuel and the risks associated with fire. It also warned that vegetation along roads needed to be managed to allow egress and entry during bushfires and to maintain the roads as firebreaks.



What remains to be seen is whether those things have been adequately done. You can be sure there are a lot of local councillors, state politicians and parks and wildlife bureaucrats getting ready to cover their arses as best they can.



Meanwhile, the shrieking ninnies of the media and the swivel-eyed zealots of climate change alarmism might be served by picking up a history book.



Appalling as it is, the crisis is not unprecedented. Several of Australia’s deadliest bushfires occurred in years of below-average temperatures — in Victoria in 1926, when 60 people died, and in 1939 when 71 died and 650 homes were lost; and in Tasmania in 1967 when 62 died and almost 1300 homes were lost. The Federation drought saw a third of the continent stricken from 1891 to 1903. What is different now is that climate change is being blamed.



Was climate change responsible for the fires in 1967, 1939 and 1926? Or how about the devastating Black Thursday fires in 1851? The smoke from those fires blew across Bass Strait to Tasmania and blacked out the sun. Residents of Ulverstone on the coast thought that the end of the world had come. Flaming embers set fire to ships in Bass Strait. **Five million hectares were burned – by far the most widespread devastation in Australia’s recorded history.** Even before then, the earliest explorers continually remarked on the constant sight of fires and smoke wherever they went.



There is some evidence that indigenous land management first dried out the eastern seaboard of the continent, then maintained a regular regime of frequent, low-intensity fire. **Fire is an inescapable part of the Australian landscape.**

When a political consensus arises, it’s usually time to worry. Right now, the Conservatives and Labour have convinced most commentators that ramping up government infrastructure investment is an economic no‐​brainer.



Clear differences exist in the scale and composition of the parties’ plans. Chancellor Sajid Javid has pledged an extra £22bn per year of borrowing for new public investment in road, rail and broadband. Labour’s John McDonnell wants to more than double current investment spending, adding £55bn a year primarily for “green” and “social” transformation.



Both, ultimately, would raise public investment to levels not seen sustainably since at least the Seventies, predicated on the idea that cheap borrowing costs make today a great time to invest.



Economists have legitimised this reasoning, after strongly opposing investment cuts in the early 2010s. But there’s an essence of fighting yesterday’s war here. The economic case for infrastructure spending is very different when we’re close to full employment than in a recession rebound. No longer do we desire mythical “shovel‐​ready projects” putting unemployed construction workers back to productive activity.



With unemployment low, infrastructure spending will take resources, workers and capital out of the private sector and into politically managed enterprises. For this to be an economic boon requires such spending to be more socially productive than the private activity it replaces.



No economist would disagree that good infrastructure can enhance economic potential, in theory. A new road that cuts travel time between two cities reduces the effective cost of production, delivery and movement of workers, raising profit and encouraging entry into the local market.



Better connections allow more specialisation, improved job matching to skills and the building of more meaningful economic clusters. Where the worry creeps in is over whether the political process ensures the right investments are made, and cost effectively.



An early warning sign comes from the claim that low interest rates make today a good time to invest. Such reasoning only considers the “cost” side of a project and not the benefits. If interest rates are low because growth is weak, then user numbers for road, rail or broadband will be lower too, reducing its social returns. Borrowing costs tell us nothing about a project’s desirability alone. More instructive is the lack of private sector appetite for the projects politicians desire.



Nor does it follow that cheap government borrowing makes government infrastructure the most desirable response. Suppose some private projects generate an average 5pc return on capital and a government project only generates a 3pc social return.



At borrowing rates of 1.5pc, it might be preferable for the economy to engage in deficit‐​financed business tax cuts, such as full expensing of investment in plant, buildings and machinery within the corporation tax system, to encourage the activities with the biggest economic payoff.



Low borrowing costs are therefore a red herring. What matters is whether government investments have bigger net social benefits than if workers, machines and capital were retained privately. Claims that new government infrastructure investment will be “good for the economy” hinges on Javid and McDonnell knowing better how to generate productivity improvements than businesses and entrepreneurs, perhaps by selecting projects that alleviate genuine market failures or deliver huge bang for the buck.



Chalk me up as unconvinced. Politicians historically prefer prestige projects and unveiling plaques over maintenance or removing bottlenecks that tend to generate big returns. How else to explain that in the 2010 spending review, the Coalition government deferred and cancelled road projects with average benefit‐​cost ratios of 6.8 and 3.2, respectively, but pushed ahead with HS2, then estimated to have a benefit‐​cost ratio of just 1.2?



Bent Flyvbjerg’s magisterial work has shown that over‐​optimism plagues political megaprojects worldwide. Nine of every 10 major projects have cost overruns, commonly of 50pc or more. Rail projects, he finds, are especially characterised by over‐​optimism on user numbers. Little surprise then that huge infrastructure spending drives have ended in tears, from Spain’s empty airports to China’s ghost cities. Japan, in particular, has invested like crazy for three decades, to little avail.



Javid and McDonnell’s specific investment priorities heighten doubts about a growth dividend. Conservatives prioritise economic infrastructure, true, but their 3pc of GDP annual investment target is arbitrary. A political focus on “left behind” regions suggests the investment will work against market signals rather than with them.



The party’s obsession with broadband is based on speculative technological determinism too — a blind faith that it is a “must have” because computers are important. Given faster broadband roll out could occur privately and profitably to most areas, the Government would, in effect, be throwing billions of pounds to ensure relatively remote areas are connected, with unclear economic benefits.



The sheer scale of Labour’s spending plans make them susceptible to dodgy investments (the UK would be the highest spending advanced economy). McDonnell admits he prioritises “green” and “social” transformation, not growth. But building social housing, rather than removing barriers to a responsive private housing market, could lock people into unproductive areas.



Though climate change deserves a response, rapid decarbonisation would push the UK into expensive forms of renewable energy, without much affecting global emissions. Other social investments will try to revive flagging regions. Yet previous attempts at regeneration, not least under Gordon Brown, failed miserably.



Anyone expecting this infrastructure arms race to address Britain’s chronic productivity problem will thus be disappointed. Well‐​targeted infrastructure projects selected according to disciplined cost‐​benefit analysis could enhance growth in areas where private provision is impossible. With the outright deluge of funds proposed, mixed with politics, such requirements speak for themselves.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJournalist Jan Grossarth of flagship political daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) says it all in just the first sentences of his recent online commentary here:
Where the Pope errs
The Pope’s Encyclical is chock full of criticism and anti-liberal distortions. The good of the industrial present hardly gets mentioned.”

This is quite a comment for Germany’s leading political daily, which has been consistently green and a devoted purveyor of climate alarmism.
Grossarth is not the first to criticize the Pope’s massively one-sided, über-pessimistic position outlined in the Encyclical. Other journalists and observers have done so as well.
Increasingly it is growing clearer with each passing day that Pope Francis has made a fatal miscalculation in allowing certain alarmist, extremist scientists to dictate the Encyclical’s tone. They have rendered it a grotesquely flawed document.
The FAZ’s Grossarth cannot understand why the Pope is coming down so hard on modern society and its many virtues:
For many, and not by a long shot only those in the Northern World, capitalism is a paradise: Hunger is receding, more and more people are going to school, are getting older, and don’t have to work as long or as hard.”

In a nutshell, most things that earlier popes and Catholics requested in former times have been expediently delivered by free market systems. Much misery, squalor and suffering have been alleviated. Ehrlichian visions of doom from just 40 years ago never came to pass – due to modern industrial progress.
Grossarth thinks the Pope is overly “pessimistic” – someone who is way out of bounds in equating “capitalism to greed”. He characterizes Pope Francis as a person who has an incurable, chronic habit of presenting only the very ugly side of things. He writes:
In the Encyclical there are so many examples of one-sided negative perceptions that in summary a distorted depiction of civilization is the result.”
This should not be a surprise as the lead contributor to the Encyclical was German alarmist scientist Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber. It’s truly a pity the Pope did not have the wisdom to recognize the document for what it was: a power-grabbing instrument by extreme environmental activists masquerading as scientists. Under John Paul II or Benedict such a polarizing and distorted encyclical would have never seen the light of day.
Grossarth also makes the point that Francis is extremely adversarial to free-market systems, that he is someone who defines them as the world’s evil.
Instead, all the abstract talk is about ‘refraining’, and the ‘common good’, or of ‘irrational trust in progress’. For the Pope, man’s intervention in nature leads to a vicious circle.
Economic liberalism (symbolized by Adam Smith’ s ‘invisible hand’) is named in the same breath along with sickness, forced labor, slavery or child abuse.”
Grossarth also sharply criticizes Pope Francis for making claims “without any evidence”. He writes that the “Pope leaves the facts aside.” The FAZ journalist thinks that the Pope’s vision of an exodus back to an agrarian world of more natural, pre-industrial living is totally misguided. On the Pope’s vision, Grossarth writes:
Thus here the pre-industrial times are revered as a time when ‘man and things’ were still ‘in friendly harmony’. The return to that time is a frightening idea.”

"On the eve of our debut episode of “The Daily,” President Trump delivered a major news story. For his first Supreme Court nomination, he selected Neil M. Gorsuch, a conservative judge with a sterling résumé. I spent the night in the studio talking with some of my most insightful New York Times colleagues about what it means. Maggie Haberman, a White House reporter, explains Mr. Trump’s reverence for the Supreme Court. Carl Hulse, the dean of congressional reporters, explains what to expect during the confirmation process. And Adam Liptak, our chief legal correspondent, introduces the country’s new Supreme Court nominee. To understand more about Judge Gorsuch, I also talk to David Green, the chief executive of Hobby Lobby, a company at the center of one of Judge Gorsuch’s most important cases. He ruled that corporations with religious owners  —   like Hobby Lobby  —   cannot be required to pay for insurance coverage for contraception. “We voted for Trump, not that we agree with everything he does,” Mr. Green tells me on the show, speaking for himself and his wife. “The most important thing to us was the fact that we knew he would put someone there that ruled on the Constitution,” he said, referring to the Supreme Court. “Because if you rule on the Constitution, it would be obvious that we would not have to be forced to do something, and that we would have our religious liberties. ” Tune in, and tell us what you think.

This is a letter from John Rofe, a self-declared “Concerned Citizen” to Professor Gerrard, the NZ Prime Minister’s Science Advisor.   
  
As it is quite long we have ‘serialized’ it over a few days. 



Part one [here.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/dear-professor-gerrard/)



New Zealand’s situation is pretty much an “outlier” on the world stage, as we enjoy a benign maritime climate. So while rapid heating was obvious in the UK there was little change in NZ – certainly not for an Auckland resident. I conclude that while Grand Solar Minimums affect the entire planet, the countries of the Southern hemisphere are less affected due to the fact that the sea takes many years to adjust to climate change. The huge land masses of the Northern hemisphere heated faster and will likely cool faster, yet inevitably we will catch up. 



We are all familiar with the impacts of the GFC of 2008/9 but we are less familiar with the Arab Spring of the same era. The Arab Spring involved a shortage of various food staples and at the time, the common reaction in an attempt to achieve resolution to hunger and want was the population rising up and over-throwing tyrants. Of course, this was exacerbated in countries like Yemen, Egypt and Syria which had transitioned from being oil exporters to importers and necessarily residents’ fuel subsidies were being cut, impacting energy costs. These, like our present government’s fuel taxes affect the lower-paid productive sectors the most. 



The Chinese have long experience with food shortages arising from the effects of natural climate change too. Their history of 2,000 years plus is well chronicled and well understood by members of the present central committee of the CCP. They know that famines occurred during particularly deep solar minimums that we refer to as Grand Solar Minimums, and that every time one of these occurred (every 170-200 years in regular cycles) the ruling dynasty would collapse. They are now affected by the same poor harvests as the USA, but cold climate crop losses for them have been exacerbated in 2019 by the predations of the Army Worm and the African Swine Haemorrhagic Fever. So they are today buying what protein they can, where they can, in the realisation that severe looming food shortages on a regional, if not global scale, have for them now arrived. The Russian Government’s preparations are also well underway and quite transparent. 



I have no doubt that the Global Warming fraud will be destroyed when people realise what is really happening. The George Soros funded media and “[Extinction Rebellion](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/extinction-rebellion-its-never-been-about-the-climate/)” campaigns (ably assisted by the other globalist billionaires) that have led to our news media reporting overseas heat waves and not reporting the cold events, has led to all time record cold in Moscow being ignored at the same time that the short Paris heat wave was being trumpeted in the media some months ago as evidence of global warming. But of greater concern has been the exclusion from the mainstream news media of the facts of 100 year cold and rain records being broken for the lower 48 states of the USA over the winter of 2018-9. Because their spring came 1-2 months late in 2019 and autumn then came under the guise of winter a month earlier than normal, **the US crops have been extremely hard hit**. The demonstrably shorter growing seasons for 2019 are simply a continuation of a shortening trend which began in 2017, then 2018 (when it snowed in the Sahara and Quiet Quarter of Saudi Arabia in the winter….Yet not reported here). And like all climate-related effects, the shortened growing periods are already duplicated in other countries/regions even if their agriculture stats are harder for us to come by… given the success of the Soros media campaigns. 



If you want I can show you video footage of combine harvesters desperately working on the prairies during blizzards four weeks ago in the hope of saving a proportion of immature corn crops. In isolation, that is just anomalous weather, even if 2020’s global food security of supply was being lost in the process. But this video clip below should suffice because it shows the fact that successive winters during the unfolding Grand Solar Minimum will not likely be much better and more likely will be much worse.

When, if ever, will we see the reasonable and educated people in the warmer side of climate debate speak out against hateful garbage like this? What will it take? Why would government fund what amounts to a sanctioned hate crime disguised as “art”? This is just bizarre.

How how the ACT Government justify spending taxpayers’ money on a theatre work entitled ”Kill Climate Deniers”?

What sane Government donates to a project urging others to kill fellow citizens, even as a “joke”? Are these people mad?

from the World Wildlife Fund | World Wildlife Fund issues 10th edition of ‘The Living Planet Report,’ a science-based assessment of the planet’s health
Washington, DC – Monday, September 29: Between 1970 and 2010 populations of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish around the globe dropped 52 percent, says the 2014 Living Planet Report released today by World Wildlife Fund (WWF). This biodiversity loss occurs disproportionately in low-income countries—and correlates with the increasing resource use of high-income countries.
In addition to the precipitous decline in wildlife populations the report’s data point to other warning signs about the overall health of the planet. The amount of carbon in our atmosphere has risen to levels not seen in more than a million years, triggering climate change that is already destabilizing ecosystems. High concentrations of reactive nitrogen are degrading lands, rivers and oceans. Stress on already scarce water supplies is increasing. And more than 60 percent of the essential “services” provided by nature, from our forests to our seas, are in decline.

“We’re gradually destroying our planet’s ability to support our way of life,” said Carter Roberts, president and CEO of WWF. “But we already have the knowledge and tools to avoid the worst predictions. We all live on a finite planet and its time we started acting within those limits.”
The Living Planet Report, WWF’s biennial flagship publication, measures trends in three major areas:

populations of more than ten thousand vertebrate species;
human ecological footprint, a measure of consumption of goods, greenhouse gas emissions; and
existing biocapacity, the amount of natural resources for producing food, freshwater, and sequestering carbon.

“There is a lot of data in this report and it can seem very overwhelming and complex,” said Jon Hoekstra, chief scientist at WWF. “What’s not complicated are the clear trends we’re seeing — 39 percent of terrestrial wildlife gone, 39 percent of marine wildlife gone, 76 percent of freshwater wildlife gone – all in the past 40 years.”
The report says that the majority of high-income countries are increasingly consuming more per person than the planet can accommodate; maintaining per capita ecological footprints greater than the amount of biocapacity available per person. People in middle- and low-income countries have seen little increase in their per capita footprints over the same time period.
While high-income countries show a 10 percent increase in biodiversity, the rest of the world is seeing dramatic declines. Middle-income countries show 18 percent declines, and low-income countries show 58 percent declines. Latin America shows the biggest decline in biodiversity, with species populations falling by 83 percent.
“High-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries, but low income countries are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses,” said Keya Chatterjee, WWF’s senior director of footprint. “In effect, wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion.”
The report underscores that the declining trends are not inevitable. To achieve globally sustainable development, each country’s per capita ecological footprint must be less than the per capita biocapacity available on the planet, while maintaining a decent standard of living.
At the conclusion of the report, WWF recommends the following actions:

Accelerate shift to smarter food and energy production
Reduce ecological footprint through responsible consumption at the personal, corporate and government levels
Value natural capital as a cornerstone of policy and development decisions

Why is this a baseless claim? Read this: Where Are The Corpses?

[UPDATE by Willis Eschenbach] Reading the Living Planet Report, I came across this interesting chart …


For birds, fishes , reptiles and amphibians, and mammals, half or slightly more are increasing, a bit less than half are decreasing, and a thin sliver are unchanging.

Setting aside the obvious problems with the counting and the categorization, I fear I don’t find that result either surprising or alarming. Half increasing, half decreasing … and?

This small island, about two‐​thirds the size of Washington, D.C., with only 100,000 people, is home to one of the world’s largest financial centers.



Americans know of the state of New Jersey, but few know that it was named after the isle of Jersey, which is located in the English Channel about 14 miles off the coast of France. Back in the 1650s, when the English were engaged in a civil war, King Charles II took refuge in Jersey at the manor of George Carteret. After Charles regained his throne, he repaid the kindness by giving Carteret partial ownership of a large land tract in America, which Carteret then named New Jersey in honor of his homeland.



Jersey has been quasi‐​independent from England since 1204. It is self‐​governing but swears allegiance to the British Crown — however, not to the British government or Parliament. It is not only a home to global finance, but a tourist mecca as well, with its ancient forts, including some from Viking times, and more modern fortifications built by the Nazis during World War II. (It was occupied by the Germans for five years.) In addition to the fortifications, it has several splendid beaches, a mild climate, lovely pastures — with its own breed of cow, which is now raised around the world (the Jersey, of course).





Financial centers are places where global capital can be accumulated and then invested in their highest and best use anyplace on the planet.



Jersey has a higher per‐​capita income than America, and roughly twice the per‐​capita income of Britain and France. The globe is dotted with relatively small, prosperous places that have become rich without the benefit of natural resources. What have Jersey and the island next door, Guernsey, along with Bermuda, Cayman, Singapore, Hong Kong, and even larger places like Switzerland done right, leaving many of their larger and more richly endowed neighbors plodding along in their economic dust? In one sentence, they have kept their governments relatively small and not wasted the efforts of their citizens with counterproductive government programs and excessive regulations and high taxation.



Critics of places such as Jersey call them “tax havens,” which implies that the jurisdictions have few or no taxes. All of the so‐​called tax havens have plenty of taxes that provide for education, infrastructure and a social safety net, often greatly superior to the big‐​government, high‐​tax jurisdictions. What they do not do is penalize capital or tax labor at job‐​killing rates. Jersey and the other “offshore” financial centers have been suffering increasing attacks from many in the global left, who somehow think that if these successful small‐​government states are forced to give up their small‐​government model — that, through some miracle — the big‐​government states would become rich. This makes no economic sense, but it is satisfying to those who think envy is a virtue rather than a sin.



Critics say that the offshores depend on the big countries for their defense, a charge which is only partially true. Jersey does depend on Britain for its defense, but it also provides Britain with military bases. The only time Jersey was threatened with a military attack in the last hundred years was when the Nazis decided to occupy it in 1940, and the British response was to retreat, with the argument they could not defend Jersey and Guernsey.



In reality, Jersey helps make Britain richer, by serving as an adjunct to London’s financial center, enabling financial firms in London to offer a broader array of financial products, including those that would be tax‐​disadvantaged without the existence of Jersey. Most of the world’s financial centers (including those in the United States) are based on British common law, because it was developed through trial and error over many centuries and evolved to deal with real‐​world problems in a just and understandable way.



Financial centers are places where global capital can be accumulated and then invested in their highest and best use anyplace on the planet. Some abuse does occur, but for the most part, the services offered by offshore financial centers enhance world welfare. Many of the critics of offshore financial centers engage in overheated rhetoric, while at the same time demonstrating an ignorance of how global finance operates and how excessive taxes on capital undermine economic growth and job creation.

"The tide isn’t usually this high, Robert Hill says. “There is normally 150 metres of beach out the front here,” he says, pointing down past the flowers and the coastal scrub. “That’s all beach all the way down.” Today, the water is lapping at the base, not of Hill’s house, but of his neighbour’s. Overhead, a crane dips back and forth, lifting concrete blocks 20m up into the air, laying them gently in front of his neighbour Peter’s beachfront place – a protective wall for where the verandah has snapped and the lawn has sunk into the water. At Wamberal Beach, 90km north of Sydney on the New South Wales Central Coast, the houses are slouching into the sea. Last Friday night it stormed. The residents of Ocean View Drive woke to find the land had slid out from under them. The swell had grown and grown and, in the words of resident Margaret Brice, “it just comes up and bashes the dune and undermines it”. Standing on his deck in the sun in his old rugby jersey, Hill, 81, has spent more than 40 years watching the sea come in. The stairs to his house come up straight from the beach, subdivided in a coastal garden: saltbush, hard little coastal flowers and huge striped tongues of sansevieria. “The worst has been at the foot there,” he says. “But that was many years ago. Back in the 70s.” Resident Robert Hill sitting on his deck. Storms and erosion at Wamberal are not new. Dr Tayanah O’Donnell from the Australian National University says that for the beachfront (a “known high-risk location”) “there will come a time when people will have to accept that they can no longer live there”. Houses were destroyed in 1974 and 1978 and huge storms nearly did the same in 2016. “It has been happening since back in the 1970s and it is almost as regular as every four or five years, there is a major event,” Hill says. “What happens in a really bad storm event is the storms come from the south-east, they come around The Skillion, and they come in like a fishhook. They come in and scour the beach out.” Residents like Hill say the solution is for the council to build a permanent revetment wall – known as a seawall. He rejects the argument that the houses themselves are built too close to the sea. “I don’t think so,” he says. “Not in my view. Robert Hill walks down his stairs to the beach “The area was subdivided in the early 1900s, and there have been properties on the beachfront here for over 100 years.” It is bad luck, not risk, that has caused his neighbours’ houses to fall while his stays standing, he tells Guardian Australia. “I’ve just been lucky there is more accumulation of sand in front of me, at the moment,” he says. “On another occasion, they could be fine, and I could be scoured out.” He is pointing out at the sand. “Over the years that has accumulated and it is like money in the bank.” On Monday, the residents of the 18 worst-affected lots were evacuated. Owners along the strip are furious. Chris Rogers, whose house was directly affected, says the council has dragged its feet on the seawall, and even prevented residents from taking other protective action like sandbagging. Above: Chris Rogers stands on his lawn which is slowly eroding. Below: The staircase that led from his house to the beach “It’s because of them that we are here,” he says, as he packs up to evacuate his house. “They have stopped people trying to protect their homes, they have denied DAs.” Margaret Brice lives a few doors down, on the outer limits of what she calls the “green zone”, where it is still safe to stay. The edge of her lawn has a huge crack in it, steel bars stick up from the ground. “It is now illegal to walk on my deck,” she says. Brice says the council had promised as early as 2002 to build the seawall. “In the early 2000s, when I bought this house, it was in the coastal zone’s management plan that they would build a buried rock revetment wall … And that was why you were allowed to build on the beach.” Brice and Rogers say residents have offered to pay for the seawall. Margaret Brices surveys the storm damage from her deck “The solution is very simple,” Hill says. “Dig a hole along the front, fill it up full of rocks, and then cover it back with sand. It is not a difficult proposition.” But others, including O’Donnell, say the land should never have been built on in the first place. “[The seawall] might be an appropriate short-term solution, but it will come at great economic and environmental costs,” she says. “Revetment walls are not cheap and environmentally they disturb the natural formation of coastlines. Coastlines are meant to move. A hard structure like a revetment wall can simply make these natural movements occur further along a coastline.” Residents and councils in many other areas around Australia face similar dilemmas. At Stockton Beach, north of Newcastle, which has been repeatedly hit by coastal erosion, the council has attempted to defend the community by bringing in sand to fill voids. The latest plan involves importing 80,000 truckloads of sand at a cost of $52m. In Byron Bay, beachfront property owners have spent two decades in a marathon legal battle with the council over a seawall which the residents want repaired and have offered to pay for, but have been repeatedly knocked back. Similar arguments have been raging for decades at Sydney’s Collaroy Beach, which suffered massive erosion after a 2016 storm. A proposal there for a seawall received massive opposition from surfers and environmentalists because of the impact it would have on the rest of the beach. O’Donnell says the residents at Ocean View Drive may have to walk away at some point.  Damage at the front of Margaret Brice’s home “Climate change will continue to exacerbate weather patterns and coastal events like what we have seen will become more common place. It is a nonsense to build, or rebuild, on soft shorelines; equally it is a nonsense for land not to be utilised for its highest and best use at particular points in time.” Local resident Susie, who declined to give her surname, lives three streets back from the beachfront strip. “I’ve lived here all my life, it’s been going on for quite a few years,” she says. “Personally, in 1974, when it happened I think they should have reclaimed the land back then.” She believes the land on the beachfront should be turned into a community area, or if the seawall is built, it should not be fully-funded by the ratepayers. Cement blocks are placed at the base of a property to save it from the erosion “I think when the owners purchased their properties they would have had to have known that this is an area of erosion, they would have done their investigations,” she says. “It’s like the one in 100-year flood – you can be guaranteed that as much as you think it is not going to happen to you, Murphy’s Law, it will. There is a huge risk you take when you want this lifestyle. “I know some of the residents along here, they are great people, the loveliest people, the most genuine people you can find, and they have worked very hard to afford these beautiful properties, so I really feel for them. But in saying that again, you have got to have known, the possibility of erosion, and this happening, again, was on the cards. “I truly believe council should reclaim the land and make it more of a community area, where the community can enjoy it, everybody can enjoy it, rather than the wealthy few.” Brice and Rogers reject the idea that the wall is just for them. A collapsed veranda at Wamberal Beach “It’s not just our homes,” Rogers says. “The beach is ruined. My point is – we get another storm? That breaches? All of this is gone.” He points to the main road and the houses behind. “There’s a lot of people saying, ‘Oh yeah, you homeowners, blah blah blah.’ No one can use the beach. If you’re walking your dog, you can’t do it now. If you’re going for a surf, you can’t. If you going for a fish, you can’t. Because they have allowed the beach to be wrecked.” “We’re not silver spoon kids,” Brice says. “It’s not about throwing stones at rich people, saying ‘Too bad, haha, you lost your views.’ “This is about protecting the whole of Wamberal. There are hundreds of homes behind us, with very little foundation and much lower level than us. We are sitting on nine metres above sea level. That road is three metres, you do the math, if the dune goes. It’s really scary.” Central Coast Council did not respond to specific questions about the revetment wall, but directed Guardian Australia to information on its website about the wall. Any eventual seawall could cost between $10,000 to more than $30,000 per metre, and would have to take into account the impact on the environment and “the impact on public access and beach amenity”, the council says. “The solution is complex, requires input and agreement from a number of parties, and no funding model has previously been developed to implement the works. An agreed funding model is a central element to delivering a terminal protection seawall structure on Wamberal Beach.” A working group is currently investigating solutions, it says, and “consideration of the impacts of forecast climate change will also be required”. O’Donnell says a wall protecting public assets such as roads and infrastructure is “an appealing option”, but “in my experience and my own research, taxpayers don’t really see it that way – and there is a general community sentiment that those who don’t benefit from the wall should not be paying for it”. Back on Wamberal Beach, Rogers is packing up. He has a place to stay, with a neighbour, who has another house in Sydney. His daughters start school again soon. “I didn’t build too close to the sea,” he says. “We built, we bought and built, if you are allowed to build, you build it efficiently. What the problem is, the coast is eroding, it happens all over the world. And the way to stop that is to build a revetment wall. It’s not us.” A set of fallen stairs lead down from a Wamberal Beach property Brice says: “We’ve done what we have been allowed to do. We haven’t built illegally. We have done what we have done within Central Coast Council’s usual building plans ... under the proviso that they were going to build a wall. “We haven’t built too close to the sea, Central Coast Council has [not] prevented the sea from coming too close to us.” A few streets back, Susie is unimpressed. “I nearly purchased a property up here a while back, but it came back that it was in a one in 100 flood zone area, and you know – there are other places you can buy, in other areas, and you can have just as beautiful outlook.”"
"SAN FRANCISCO  —   From the spread of fake news to a nasty court fight in Texas, it has been a rough few months for Facebook. But company executives can take heart in two things: Despite an audience nudging toward two billion users, more and more people are still flocking to the service, and more and more advertisers are spending money on it. Facebook’s   sales, announced Wednesday, handily beat Wall Street estimates. And even a $500 million jury verdict that went against the company earlier in the day did little to diminish enthusiasm about its finances. Facebook said sales had totaled $8. 8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, up 51 percent compared with a year ago, surpassing analysts’ expectations of $8. 5 billion. Not surprisingly, user growth is at a peak. The announcement of the blockbuster quarter comes as Facebook grapples with complaints that it has not done enough to stem the rise of false news stories and misinformation across the social network. Since those complaints began to mount, Facebook has started to address the problem. “In the past we’ve taken steps to reduce spam and clickbait, and now we’re approaching misinformation and hoaxes the same way,” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said during a conference call with investors. He pointed to the company’s closer ties to publishers and   organizations and the high priority it had placed on making changes to its news feed and ad network. The controversy over fake news seemed to have little effect on users’ appetite for the website. Total profit for the quarter was $3. 6 billion, annual ad revenue was up roughly $10 billion compared with 2015, and more than half of the site’s 1. 86 billion regular visitors used it daily. Against that backdrop, a jury verdict on Wednesday in a   legal fight in federal court in Texas over virtual reality technology made by Facebook’s Oculus division did not appear to faze company executives. “The verdict is nonmaterial to our business,” Sheryl K. Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, said in an interview. “We had a really strong quarter, capping off a really great year. ” Facebook paid $2 billion to acquire Oculus, which makes a headset, the Rift, that immerses users in   games and videos. Mr. Zuckerberg has predicted that virtual reality could be the next big computing platform, like the smartphones of today or the personal computers of a decade ago. The financial damages were far lower than the up to $6 billion that the plaintiff, the games publisher ZeniMax Media, had sought, in part because the jury was unmoved by its argument that Oculus employees stole ZeniMax trade secrets. In a statement, Tera Randall, a spokeswoman for Oculus, said the company planned to appeal the verdict. “The heart of this case was about whether Oculus stole ZeniMax’s trade secrets, and the jury found decisively in our favor,” she said. “We’re obviously disappointed by a few other aspects of today’s verdict, but we are undeterred. ” The damages were nonetheless meaningful to ZeniMax, which publishes the Elder Scrolls series, the Fallout series and other   video games. The jury based the damages award on finding a series of copyright and trademark violations involving ZeniMax software by one or more of the defendants, a group that included Oculus and several of its employees. The biggest portion of the award stemmed from the finding that Palmer Luckey, an Oculus founder, had violated a confidentiality agreement he signed with ZeniMax as he was forming Oculus. ZeniMax said it was exploring options for preventing Oculus from its continued use of computer code that infringes on ZeniMax copyrights, including seeking a court order. “Technology is the foundation of our business, and we consider the theft of our intellectual property to be a serious matter,” said Robert Altman, ZeniMax’s chairman and chief executive. “We appreciate the jury’s finding against the defendants and the award of half a billion dollars in damages for those serious violations. ” That figure may decrease as litigation between the companies continues. But Facebook may not be too worried about it. As the results announced Wednesday showed, Facebook’s dominance in internet advertising is surpassed only by Google’s. And Ms. Sandberg’s latest efforts to woo small businesses are paying off: Tens of millions of businesses market their products across Facebook and Instagram, the   app it owns. Shares of Facebook rose 2. 5 percent, to $136. 69, in   trading. Wall Street is looking for Facebook to show revenue growth outside its news feed, the social network’s moneymaking ad machine. The company has cautioned analysts that it is nearing the limit of its ad load  —   the amount of ads it chooses to place between   content like news stories and status updates  —   inside the feed. That means increased pressure on properties like Instagram, which recently announced that it had more than 600 million users. Although Facebook does not disclose revenue figures for Instagram, it said on Wednesday that five million businesses were now on the app and that its latest feature  —   a messaging service similar to Snapchat  —   was already being used by a quarter of Instagram’s user base."
"**Three weeks ago, Josh Steen watched his close friend Ronnie McNutt kill himself live on Facebook.**
Now, he is fighting for answers from the firm and other social media platforms where clips of the suicide are widely available.
""For the last two and a half weeks Ronnie's image has been one of the most recognisable on the internet and yet these companies claim to have detection software to stop it, so something isn't right,"" he said.
He reported it to Facebook during the livestream, at 22:00 Mississippi time - two hours after the video had started, and half an hour before Ronnie killed himself.
He said that he didn't get a response until 23:51, when Facebook told him that the video did not violate its community guidelines.
By then, Mr McNutt was dead.
Josh Steen said the social network had an opportunity to stop the stream when Ronnie misfired his gun before 22:00 - which he says is a clear violation of the guidelines.
""If Facebook had intervened then, my friend may still have committed suicide but at least there wouldn't be this video.""
Mr McNutt was a 33-year-old army veteran who had seen active service in Iraq, and subsequently dealt with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental-health issues.
He had recently broken up with his girlfriend and had been drinking on the night of his death. He was talking about suicide and arguing with people who were trying to comfort him. At some point the police turned up outside his apartment.
More than 200 people were watching the stream when he died, including Mr Steen and several of his friends.
Clips showing his death started going viral the day after his suicide.
""The video was public and his account was public. Whoever took the first clip and uploaded it created a back story about Ronnie,"" said Mr Steen.
""None of it was true. But it helped fuel the fire to help it spread,"" he added.
On Mr McNutt's Facebook page, more and more comments were being posted. Many were unpleasant and Mr Steen reported them to the social network as harassment.
But he said Facebook told him nothing could be done because he was not the account holder.
Meanwhile, several online funding pages were set up in Ronnie's honour. But they were not authorised by the family and Mr Steen is unclear what, if anything, was being done about it.
""It got so out of hand. We watched it circle the globe. When a person in Australia says their nine-year-old child had seen this on TikTok, it's crushing.""
He is aware that many will argue Mr McNutt should never have filmed his death in this manner and that others will blame him for the psychological damage inflicted on those seeing the video.
But Mr Steen remains loyal to his friend.
""I don't think that was his intention when he started the live,"" he said.
""When you go back and follow his digital trail there is this beautiful telling of his life on various social-media platforms. He had a history of getting on a streaming service and talking.""
Regardless of the background, Mr Steen is outraged that the video is still online.
He believes bots are spreading the clips.
Facebook has previously discussed the use of automated software to share misinformation and make certain posts go viral for political ends.
""I watched it in real time. We'd report an account and then it created another account. We saw the exact same accounts post the exact same message over and over and over,"" he said
Claire Wardle, an expert on disinformation with First Draft News, suggested two possible explanations.
""Graphic content that makes people feel upset and fearful can by used by those trying to destabilise populations to unsettle people. Or it could be to test how effective the platforms are at taking this type of content down.""
That happened with the Christchurch shootings, she said, where copies of the video spread at an incredible rate.
""The idea was they did this so they would know how to attack the platform at a later date,"" she said.
Facebook declined to answer a question about the use of bots in this case.
In a statement the firm said: ""We removed the original video from Facebook last month on the day it was streamed and have used automation technology to remove copies and uploads since that time.
""We are reviewing how we could have taken down the live-stream faster. Our thoughts remain with Ronnie's family and friends during this difficult time.""
Mr Steen has learned a few other things about how the internet works in recent weeks.
""YouTube didn't have any idea that if you misspelled Ronnie's name then the algorithm wouldn't spot it. We found thousands of instances of the video where people had done this.""
He also came across:
In response, YouTube said it had clear policies that prohibit content containing or promoting self-harm. ""We quickly remove any copies of this video uploaded to YouTube,"" a spokesperson said.
""We extend our deepest sympathies to the family of Mr McNutt.""
TikTok repeated its claim that is systems ""have been automatically detecting and flagging these clips"".
Mr Steen thinks Ronnie's family deserve more and hopes there can be action before another person in distress starts a live-stream.
""I don't want this to happen to anyone else's family,"" he said.
""These are the most powerful companies on Earth. We know that they have the monetary resources and they claim to have the tech - all they don't have is the ability to care.""

"As a scientist investigating climate change, I’m embarrassed by the high carbon footprint I have when I travel to, and work in, Antarctica. Researchers based in the UK regularly take four or five flights to reach the continent and the stations we visit rely on electricity from fossil fuels. Our food is shipped in and our waste is returned by ship to South Africa, South America or New Zealand. When we venture further afield for research and set up a temporary camp, a portable generator is flown in with us, along with our snowmobiles. Antarctica is the most remote and inhospitable place on Earth, so it’s no surprise that people based there have struggled to break out of convenient habits. It’s cold. There are 24 hours of darkness in winter. Icicles build up on solar panels operating during the summer months and the concrete foundations for wind turbines won’t set in the cold. It’s expensive to ship in renewable energy components and it’s difficult to find warm and dry places to keep large batteries for storing energy. These challenges are real, and yet, I’ve seen how they can be overcome at Antarctica’s only zero-emission research base, the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica Research Station in East Antarctica. The base is staffed during the summer season from October to March, when the majority of scientists – like me – conduct their research.  Dreamt up by the Belgian explorer Alain Hubert during his transantarctic crossing of the continent by kite ski in 1998, and constructed by the International Polar Foundation and its many partners, the Princess Elisabeth station has welcomed researchers since its first 2008-2009 summer research season. The glinting silver pod looks like something from a James Bond film. It’s anchored by raised pylons, hovering above the East Antarctic Ice Sheet on a narrow granite ridge. In Antarctica these other-worldly structures are somewhat the norm. Raised, aerodynamic research stations litter the edge of the continent, where researchers from around the world gather to measure ice flows, the atmosphere and natural biomes. While these stations all have similar traits, the Princess Elisabeth stands out. I have never seen anything like it. Almost every inch is covered in solar panels – on the roof, on the walls, on the side of sleeping containers. They are even screwed to frames anchored to the ground.  Solar panels have to be mounted high above the snow-covered ground to capture the 24 hours of daylight during the austral summer. Wind turbines are drilled into the granite ridge beneath the snow and ice, removing the need for large concrete foundations. Their blades are maintained with carefully designed polar lubricants, but they can shut down production during intense storms. These renewable energy sources melt snow for water, which is filtered and reused on site to reduce waste. The whirl of nine wind turbines generates the reassuring sound of regular clean electricity on base. While other research stations have to use fossil fuels to keep station staff warm, fed and hydrated, the Princess Elisabeth station uses 100% renewable energy supplied by the sun, the wind, and plentiful frozen water.  There’s no need for conventional heating here either. Nine layers of cladding and insulation keep the biting Antarctic cold out, and the pleasant warmth of the station in. Every piece of electrical equipment runs on renewable energy. Even my hair dryer is powered by the almost constant Antarctic winds and summer daylight. In order for the base to run as sustainably as possible, there’s a strict hierarchy for energy use on the base. Safety is the priority, so electricity for the doctor’s surgery, the base commander’s office, fire alarms, smoke detectors and satellite connections that can alert the need for outside help are maintained first. Basic human needs like food and water are a close second, while working facilities, like lights, microscopes and laptops come third. Unnecessary luxuries like showering or laundry are at the bottom of the list for energy need priorities. We shower once or twice a week, using push-button showers to limit how much water we use. Everyone understands and respects these systems. We all come to Antarctica to experience one of the most enchanting natural environments on Earth, we don’t come here to pollute the environment.  When I asked Alain Hubert, the expedition leader, why he wanted to build a zero-emission base in Antarctica, he said that if we can do it here, we can show the world that it can be done anywhere. I hope life and work with no carbon emissions can become a reality for people everywhere. The Princess Elisabeth Antarctica Research Station shows us that these zero-emission lifestyles are within reach.  As the current holder of the prestigious Baillet Latour Antarctica Fellowship, I’ll be able to visit the station once more, in January 2020, to collect samples that will allow us to better understand the global carbon feedback cycle. By then, working there will become even more sustainable with new electric-powered snowmobiles. I can’t wait to try them out. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"As humans encroach ever more on the planet, nature is running out of hiding places. Species thought lost for decades are making a regular habit of returning from the dead, while science’s newfound access to nature’s nooks and crannies is fuelling a boom in the discovery of entirely new ones. Vietnam has seen far more than its fair share of resurrections and discoveries. It is a treasure trove of weird and wonderful wildlife found nowhere else on Earth. But hunting, habitat destruction and the black market are placing the future of many of these precious rare plants and animals under severe threat. The country’s densely forested hills and unique mountain refuges have for decades provided great cover for secretive species to flourish. The Annamite mountains that separate Vietnam from Laos house a particularly unique evergreen forest refuge that survived the last ice age, allowing many rare plants and animals to evolve in isolation. One of these rarities has now shown its face after being thought lost to science. The silver-backed chevrotain, a tiny deer-like species the size of a large rabbit with small fangs, a grizzled coat, ochre front quarters and a white stripe running down its underbelly, was first discovered more than 100 years ago but then escaped the attention of scientists for 80 years. In 1990, scientists obtained a dead specimen from a local hunter near the coastal city of Nha Trang. But with no validated sightings in the 28 years since, many feared that an epidemic of snare hunting in the region had pushed the species, also known as the Vietnam mouse deer, to the brink of extinction – a fate that has befallen numerous others in the country. After using local knowledge of suspected sightings to set up camera traps in three Vietnamese provinces, more than 200 independent detections reveal that this chevrotain remains in the wild, although how close to extinction the species is remains unknown. This is a common problem – three other diminutive deer species have also been discovered in Vietnam in the past 30 years alone, but sightings are so rare that very little is known about any of them. It’s not just deer that have been hiding in Vietnam’s dense landscapes. One of the most iconic recent discoveries was the rather bizarre saola, discovered in 1992. Measuring almost one metre tall, that such a large mammal apparently unfazed by humans went unnoticed to science for so long is amazing in itself. It’s the largest land-dwelling animal discovered anywhere since 1937. What makes the discovery of the saola particularly interesting is that we still do not know what it is related to. It is likely a member of the Bovidae – the family containing cloven-hoofed animals such as bison, cattle, sheep, antelopes and gazelles – but beyond that where it fits is anyone’s guess. It looks more like an African antelope than any bovine species from South-East Asia, with its two long curved horns, white face markings and multi-coloured tail. While Vietnam is renowned for its animal diversity, its plants should not be underestimated. During the period since the last sighting of the silver-backed chevrotain, an astonishing 1,136 new species of plants have been described from Vietnam, more than 20% of which are orchids. Worthy of special mention among these are the alluring and brightly coloured slipper orchids. These orchids have a petal that evolution has modified into a pouch-like slipper to aid pollination. When insects fall into the open pouch while searching for nectar, the only way out is to squeeze their way through an opening at the back of the pouch, in the process depositing pollen from elsewhere and picking up more from the plant. Unfortunately, the black market is to thank for many recent discoveries of slipper orchid species. With 99% of South-East Asian tropical slipper orchids at risk of extinction, their international trade requires a permit subject to the highest possible level of control – equivalent to the protection rhinos receive. However, highly desired by collectors, a booming illegal trade continues. Like many others, the Vietnamese slipper orchid was 
identified from plants being traded on the black market before it was ever found in the wild. By this point it was selling for more than US$5,000 a plant, with nearly $1m worth being traded illegally in the first years after its discovery. The Vietnamese slipper orchid followed the path of many orchids before it. Delenat’s slipper orchid, which also has a defining pink slipper, though less intense in colour, was itself thought extinct in the wild for 70 years after its initial discovery in 1922. The situation changed in the early 1990s when plants started turning up on the international black market in the US, Europe and Japan. In these first few years, an estimated six tonnes of the orchid were stripped from the wild – an astronomical amount considering the weight of an individual plant. This flood of black market plants led scientists to mount an expedition, which eventually led to it being rediscovered in the wild, near the silver-backed chevrotain’s home. Regrettably, these scientific identifications have had little impact on the black market trade – both in orchids and other species. In fact, all of the species discussed in this article are either “critically endangered” according to the IUCN Red List of threatened species, or there is so little data that no determination can be made. This begs the question: how many species have become extinct before they were even discovered? The clock is ticking down on Vietnam’s unique wildlife as its forests empty. Hunting and habitat destruction have decimated species across the country – in a single national reserve set aside for the saola and other rare animals, 23,000 snare traps were found in 2015 alone. Despite intensive surveys, no verifiable sighting of a saola has occurred since a photo was last taken of one in 2013. The country’s last known rhino was shot by poachers in 2010, while bears, elephants and primates are barely hanging on. That the silver-backed chevrotain has managed to dodge hunters’ snares thus far is some cause for optimism. The future of this tiny deer and other invaluable wildlife in the country hangs in the balance – and it’s up to us which way the pendulum swings.

"After an explosive fight with her boyfriend, Melissa Monserrate, 18 at the time and five months pregnant, shut herself in the bathroom and put a razor blade to her wrist. Her boyfriend found her before she could hurt herself. On that night, in December 2009, he stood guard by the door until the morning, making sure she did not leave to try to harm herself again. She had just moved out of her mother’s apartment in Ridgewood, Queens, and begun living with her boyfriend and his family. The pregnancy was unplanned and difficult for Ms. Monserrate, who said she came from an unsupportive home environment. She discovered she was pregnant the summer before her senior year of high school and kept the news from her parents until she could no longer hide it. She missed 60 days of school because of complications from the pregnancy and had to have a minor operation, but worked hard to catch up on missed class. She managed to graduate on time. Much has changed since her son, Xavier Hormaza, 6, was born. “My son is everything to me,” Ms. Monserrate said. “But at the time, I wasn’t thinking about my son. ” Ms. Monserrate, now 25, and her boyfriend are not together anymore. At his house, she recognized the same adversarial environment that she had grown up in, and she wanted to give her son a different childhood from her own. Describing her home life as “very chaotic,” she recalled arguments between her mother and stepfather that became physical. Once, when a fight escalated, a knife pierced Ms. Monserrate’s bedroom door. Ms. Monserrate covered the hole with a mirror. When fights starting breaking out between Ms. Monserrate and her boyfriend, she decided something had to change. “I didn’t even know I was leaving until I’d left,” she recalled of leaving his apartment on Halloween in 2014, adding that she had not even packed an overnight bag. “That night I thought, ‘I can’t do it anymore. ’” In an interview at the Jamaica, Queens, offices of Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow, a work force development nonprofit and partner of Community Service Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Ms. Monserrate said that after she left, she realized she could not become the mother she wanted to be without first rebuilding her own life. She left her son with her boyfriend and his family, went to stay with a friend in a   apartment in Queens, and continued working as a cashier at a CVS. At a  ’s urging, she also began therapy last June, finally confronting the troubles from her past that she had long ignored. At first, her financial situation had been secure. When she was 3 and living in an old apartment building, doctors found elevated levels of lead in her bloodstream. She was awarded $100, 000 in a lawsuit against the landlord  —   accessible as a lump sum when she turned 18. But unaccustomed to such wealth and with a newborn to care for, along with the expense of living on her own and helping family members, Ms. Monserrate had run through the funds by 2015. Struggling to get by on a cashier’s wage of $8. 25 an hour, she applied for public assistance and once received $191 in food stamps each month. But now, because she is a   student and is unable to work part time, she no longer qualifies for food stamps and her financial situation has been tenuous. “But I’m still happy I helped my family,” she said. The CVS   who encouraged her to seek therapy also urged her to go back to school and find a   job. At a Human Resources Association office in September 2015, while enrolling for workfare, a public assistance program requiring recipients to look for work, she met a representative from Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow. She enrolled in several certification and credentialing programs to bolster her résumé. She received a certification in retail customer service, learned Microsoft Windows programs and took a public speaking class. After completing her courses at the nonprofit in February 2016 and with the help of her friend at CVS, she enrolled at LaGuardia Community College, where she received financial aid to cover her tuition, and prepared to start classes the next month. But days before classes began, she learned that her textbooks would not be covered by her scholarship. If she could not purchase the books, she would not be able to start until the following semester. Community Service Society expedited a grant request and provided her with $187 in Neediest Funds to buy her college textbooks. In September she qualified for the Accelerated Study in Associate Programs, which is providing academic resources as well as covering her tuition. Now in her third semester, and on the dean’s list with a 3. 9 grade point average, Ms. Monserrate is a psychology major and hopes to become a clinical therapist. “I want to give to people what I didn’t receive for so long,” she said, adding that her time in therapy has helped her move forward from the nightmares of a decade ago. She currently shares an apartment with three roommates in Maspeth, Queens, and pays $370 monthly toward the rent. She worked briefly at her college bookstore and is now looking for a   job to help pay off nearly $650 in credit card debt. But while her finances remain shaky, she said her life was finally coming together. She is again taking an active role in raising her son, helping him with school work and playing together in the park. Her dream for her son: “I want my son to have a father figure. I don’t want him to go through life without him. I want him to grow up with two parents that love him and protect him. ”"

ISTANBUL – A couple weeks ago I visited Turkey’s largest city, cosmopolitan Istanbul. Pictures of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promoting his party’s candidate for mayor, former prime minister Binali Yildirim, dominated the cityscape and vastly outnumbered those for Ekrem Imamoglu, the opposition Republican People’s Party’s standard‐​bearer. Few observers thought the latter had much of a chance. Yet after the polls closed on Sunday, Imamoglu had narrowly triumphed.



Assuming the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) does not steal the election—it’s contesting the result and controls most levers of power—the opposition will have won mayoralties in five of the country’s six most populous cities, including the capital of Ankara. The AKP and related parties have ruled Istanbul and Ankara since 1994, making the losses doubly painful. The opposition also made significant gains at the provincial level. The AKP still picked up a plurality of votes and along with its nationalist coalition partner secured a bare national majority of 51.6 percent. However, Erdogan, seemingly on his way to being a modern sultan, no longer seems invincible.



His greatest weakness today was once his strongest advantage: the economy. Turkey has fallen into a recession; per capita GDP has dropped to the level of a dozen years ago. Unemployment has surged to the highest level in nine years. Inflation hit 20 percent, while last year the Turkish lira’s value fell 28 percent.





An authoritarian at home, duplicitous abroad, he is no friend nor ally of the U.S.



The opposition’s revival is good for the people of Turkey, who are suffering under Erdogan’s increasingly authoritarian rule, as well as for Western governments, which should no longer view Ankara as a friend and ally. In fact, the transatlantic alliance should suspend or terminate Turkey’s membership in NATO.



The Republic of Turkey grew out of World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk was an Ottoman military officer turned revolutionary leader who was instrumental in founding the new Turkish government. He created an authoritarian, secular state that allied with the West during the Cold War. Behind its democratic façade was a military‐​nationalist deep state. The armed forces occasionally ousted elected leaders, most recently in a “postmodern” coup in 1997, which forced the resignation of an Islamist prime minister.



The following year, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then mayor of Istanbul, was ousted from office and jailed for reciting an Islamist poem. In 2001, he cofounded the AKP, which won the 2002 election with support from liberals seeking to end the repressive Kemalist regime. Once in office, he adeptly forced the military out of politics.



However, within a decade, Erdogan was moving in an authoritarian and Islamist direction, targeting businessmen backing the opposition, seizing control of independent media, and punishing critics, including journalists, academics, and even schoolchildren. This gave life to the report that as mayor he had declared: “Democracy is like a streetcar. When you come to your stop, you get off.” The attempted coup in 2016 became his Reichstag fire—in fact, some suspected, without proof, that he engineered the operation. It gave him an excuse to purge anyone with the slightest (and often imagined) connection to the aged Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who he improbably blamed for the attempted putsch.



Some 80,000 people, including opposition politicians and journalists, have been jailed; the government actually paroled criminals to make room for political prisoners. Torture and other abuse continue, though Amnesty International reports that it is no longer as common as in the immediate aftermath of the coup. In excess of 160,000 Turks have been forced from their jobs, public and private.



The government removed 95 municipal, provincial, and district officials of the Kurdish People’s Democratic Party, replacing them with appointive “trustees.” Human Rights Watch notes, “Turkey remained the world leader in jailing journalists. An estimated 175 journalists and media workers are in pretrial detention or serving sentences for terrorism offenses at time of writing. Hundreds more are on trial but at liberty.”



Turkish agents kidnapped alleged enemies abroad. The regime imprisoned foreigners, such as the American pastor Andrew Brunson, who was later released under U.S. pressure, and NASA scientist Serkan Golge, on dubious evidence. Ankara shut down thousands of schools and foundations, and scores of media enterprises, publishing houses, universities, and trade unions. The regime displayed its brutal character in 2017 when during a state visit to Washington, Erdogan’s bodyguards beat up peaceful American protestors.



Erdogan has engineered a shift from a parliamentary system to a strong presidency, filled by him. Freedom House rates Turkey as “not free,” near the bottom in civil liberties. Explains FH: “The government’s authoritarian nature has been fully consolidated since a 2016 coup attempt triggered a more dramatic crackdown on perceived opponents of the leadership.” Amnesty International agrees: “Dissent was ruthlessly suppressed, with journalists, political activists and human rights defenders among those targeted.”



Most freedoms have been curtailed, many dramatically so. Observes FH: “While not every utterance that is critical of the government will be punished, the arbitrariness of prosecutions, which often result in pretrial detention and carry the risk of lengthy prisons terms, is increasingly creating an atmosphere of self‐​censorship.” Indeed, AI notes, “Thousands of criminal prosecutions were brought, including under laws prohibiting defamation and on trumped‐​up terrorism‐​related charges, based on people’s peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression.”



The fact that elections are still held does not mean that Turkey is a functioning democracy. Freedom House says that last year’s “elections were marred by a number of flaws, including misuse of state resources by the ruling party to gain an electoral advantage, as well as intimidation of and attacks on the” opposition. Similarly, reports Human Rights Watch, “The June 2018 election campaign took place under a state of emergency imposed after the July 2016 attempted military coup and in a climate of media censorship and repression of perceived government enemies and critics that persisted throughout the year, with many journalists as well as parliamentarians and the presidential candidate from the pro‐​Kurdish opposition in jail.”



Moreover, Ankara’s foreign policy has drifted away from America’s and Europe’s. Turkey initially allowed the Islamic State to operate within its borders against the Assad government and later intervened militarily in Syria to target America’s Kurdish allies. Erdogan’s son allegedly enriched himself selling ISIS‐​supplied oil.



The Erdogan government nearly broke with Moscow after shooting down a Russian aircraft in Syria, but soon reversed course to stage a dramatic rapprochement. Thereafter, Erdogan cooperated with Russia and Iran in Syria, effectively abandoning his demand for Bashar al-Assad’s ouster. Turkey also purchased a Russian S-400 missile air defense system, despite Washington’s threats to halt the continued sales of F-35 aircraft in response.



Turkey’s relations with Israel have sharply deteriorated. Ankara violated U.S. sanctions on Iran and increased commercial ties with Venezuela’s government, also under sanctions. In his latest political campaign, Erdogan used the mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, to advance his Islamist and nationalist message.



On Tuesday, a “Senior State Department Official” briefed the press and insisted that “Turkey has been and remains an important NATO ally, an important partner to the United States. Our relationship is not being defined by the single issue of the S-400.” (Is there any defense dependent on earth that is not said to be an “important partner” of America?) However, the SSDO did allow that “the S-400 is a deeply problematic issue for the United States, and we have made that clear to Turkey.” Without result so far, alas.



Increasingly, Ankara is no friend to America or the West. In fact, Turkey would not be invited to join the alliance today. Its international objectives are too divergent and its domestic institutions are too authoritarian. Complained Andrew Dawson, head of the Council of Europe election observer mission, “I am afraid we are not fully convinced that Turkey currently has the free and fair electoral environment which is necessary for genuinely democratic elections in line with European values and principles.” In 1952, when Ankara joined, it was little more democratic than today. But Turkey was committed to containing the Soviet Union, so the other members were willing to overlook its domestic failings. There is no reason to make similar allowances now.



Washington has little ability to influence politics in Turkey. However, the latest vote offers an important reminder that Erdogan will not rule forever. My Cato Institute colleague Mustafa Akyol notes that “the municipal election results in Turkey over the weekend suggest that there is still some hope for democratic change there—that despite a descent into authoritarianism, ballots still count.” The population’s deep‐​seated anti‐​Americanism will be harder to eliminate; for that, U.S. foreign policy needs to change. Moreover, any elected government is likely to pursue independent policies inconsistent with U.S. priorities. Best for Washington to loosen its ties with Turkey.



Rather than desperately attempting to hold Ankara in NATO, the allies should begin considering how to ease Turkey out. There will still be issues where we need to cooperate with Ankara. However, Washington should stop making policy based on illusions of friendship with a government seeking to revive the Ottoman Empire. Turkey today is neither friend nor ally. The U.S. should treat it accordingly.

Guest essay by Philip Dowd
Whenever the subject of renewable energy comes up, the conversation usually turns to solar. You hear statements like: “The world receives more energy from the sun in one hour than the global economy uses in one year.”[a] You then ask yourself; “Why can’t we just capture the energy from the sun and solve our energy problem that way?” Why not, indeed? 
Let’s suppose that we convert the entire American economy to “all-electric”, and we produce all of the electricity to power it from a solar facility. In other words, we stop burning carbon and capture the sun. What would this solar plant look like? How much would it cost? We can get a ballpark answer to both of these questions with a few assumptions and some simple calculations.
First we need to know how much electricity our solar power plant must generate. An analysis from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory[b] divides the US economy into four sectors – Residential, Commercial, Industrial and Transportation.

Total demand for energy from these sectors (in the box) is about 70 quadrillion BTU’s (or “quads”) per year. So, our solar power plant must reliably deliver the electric energy equivalent of 70 quads to run the US economy for one year, or 56*1012 Wh (56 Terawatt hours) of electricity per day[c].
Our solar facility would consist of a photovoltaic (PV) panel and a battery. (There are other forms of solar power, but PV is good for this purpose.) The PV panel would generate enough electricity during the day to power the economy and charge the battery, and the battery would power the economy at night. Our task is to calculate:
1. The size of the PV panel
2. The size of the battery
3. The cost of the whole thing.
The Photovoltaic Panel
Let’s assume the following:
1. The PV panel would be spread out in the Southwestern states, because that is the sunniest place in America[d].
2. We build in a 50% safety factor to handle any contingency
If we start with demand of 56 Terawatt hours of electricity per day and add a 50% safety factor, we find that we will then need a system that can produce about 83 TWh/day[e].
The easiest way to estimate the footprint of a solar facility of this size is to look at the operating experience of existing solar power plants. Here are several examples [f].
Facility Location Electricity Output/sq meter
Nellis Nevada 150 Wh/day
Beneixama Spain 160
Serpa Portugal 90
Solarpark Mühlhausen Bavaria 68
Kagoshima Nanatsujima Japan 170
The sample shows that actual output is in the 70-170 Wh/day per square meter range. If we assume 150 Wh/day-sq m for our power plant, then its foot print would be about 210,000 sq mi[g].
The Battery
For the battery we will use technology known as “Pumped Storage”[h].
This method stores energy in the form of potential energy of water, pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation reservoir. In our example, electric power from our solar facility produced during the day would be used to run the pumps and fill the upper reservoir. Then, at night, the stored water would be released through turbines to produce the electricity that would run the night time economy.

This is proven technology. “Pumped storage hydro (PSH) is the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage available. As of March 2012, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) reports that PSH accounts for more than 99% of bulk electric energy storage capacity worldwide, representing around 127,000 MW”h. There are about 50 pumped storage plants with more than 1,000 MW of capacity in operation around the world[i] .
In 2009 the United States had 21,500 MW of pumped storage generating capacity[j]. Many of these plants were built during the 1970’s and have therefore been operating for more than 30 years.
Two good examples of pumped hydro electric energy storage in the U.S. are:
1. The facility at Ludington, Michigan[k] is built on a bluff overlooking the east shore of
Lake Michigan. It was constructed in 1969-73.
2. The Bath County facility[l] is located in the northern corner of Bath County, Virginia, on the southeast side of the Eastern Continental Divide, which forms this section of the border between Virginia and West Virginia. It was constructed in 1977-85 and is currently the largest pumped storage facility in the world.
Here are the relevant specifications (from this spreadsheet[m] ):
Capacity Capital Cost Stored Energy Footprint
(MW) ($2014/W)[n] (GWh)[o] (Acres)
Ludington, MI 1,872 0.98 25.5 1,000
Bath County, VA 3,000 1.40 43.0 820
For the purposes of this anlysis, we assumed that the night time energy demand would be about half of the daily demand, or 41 TWh. If we fulfilled this requirement with pumped storage, we would need about 1,000 facilities like Bath County , VA, or about 1,640 like Ludington, MI[p] .
If we assume the average footprint of these facilities to be 1,000 acres, the total footprint would be about 2,600 sq mi[q] for the Ludington option and 1,300 sq mi[r] for the Bath County option.
Note that for the sake of simplicity this analysis does not include a factor for energy losses during the charge/discharge cycle. Overall, the pumping/generating cycle efficiency has increased pump-turbine generator efficiency by as much as 5% in the last 25 years, resulting in energy conversion or cycle efficiencies greater than 80% (MWH, 2009)[s]. Including this factor does not materially change the result.
What Would It Cost?
Assuming today’s technology and today’s costs, this power system would cost about $65 trillion to build.
The PV Panel
Utility-sector PV systems larger than 2,000 kW in size averaged $3.40/W of capacity in 2011[t]. The capacity of a solar power plant that could generate the required 83 TWh/day of electricity would be about 17 TW[u]. The installed cost of our facility would therefore be $3.40/W times 17 TW or about $60 trillion.
The Battery
If we use the actual construction costs of the two PSH projects above, the Bath County option would cost a total of about $5 trillion and the Ludington option would cost about $3.5 trillion[v].
A few comments
1) Putting the PV power facility in the Southwest makes sense from a solar energy point of view because this is the sunniest part of America. But, this strategy has two problems:
a. The Southwest, defined as southern CA + the southern tip of NV around Las Vegas + NM + the panhandles of TX and OK, constitutes about 400,000 sq mi[w]. Our facility would therefore cover about 50% of it!
b. If a major storm covered most (or worse, all) of this, electrical output would drop dramatically and the whole country would suffer.
2) Putting our PV power plant in the “Southern states”, defined as southern CA + southern tip of NV around Las Vegas + all of NM + all states east to the Atlantic Ocean, alleviates the storm risk scenario but puts much of the panel in states that are not as “sunny” as the Southwest, and so our PV power facility would have to be larger to account for that. Even without this expansion it would occupy about 22% of it[x].
3) Some people would say that much of the land in these states is “empty”; but others would say that it is wilderness or grazing land or farm land. It’s safe to say that either the Southwest or the Southern States strategy would provoke some real push-back.
4) PV Panels on houses. There are about 89 million houses in the US[y]. If the owners of every one of them installed 1,000 sq ft (e.g 20 ft by 50 ft) of PV panel on their roof, the total area would be about 3,200 sq mi., a small percentage of the needed area.
Additional Construction Costs
Building the solar power plant is not the only cost of capturing the sun.
1) Electrifying the economy. We simply assumed at the beginning that the entire economy has been “electrified”, so that all energy is now supplied in the form of electricity, but this in itself would be an enormous project. By far the largest part of this would involve the electrification of the transport sector. The chart above shows that transportation is the largest user of energy (38%) and that almost all of it comes in the form of petroleum. Electrifying this sector would mean abandoning the internal combustion engine and converting to electricity all cars, buses, trucks (especially tractor-trailers), ships, and the entire railroad network.
2) Re-building and expanding the entire national electrical grid. Today power plants are located close to the user. Major cities, e.g. Chicago, are surrounded by a network of power plants[z]. Our new solar system, however, would locate the power plants where the sun shines the most. So, in theory, much of it would be located in the Southwest, which is the sunniest part of America. This means that the solar-based grid would be much larger than present because it must transport electricity much larger distances, for example, from Arizona to New Jersey.
3) Developing a computer network to control the whole system, the so-called “smart grid”. The solar grid must be able to react to changes in the weather. Suppose we adopt the Southern States strategy. Further suppose that on Monday the Southwest is clear and the Southeast is cloudy. On that day huge amounts of electricity must move generally west to east. Then suppose that on Tuesday the Southwest is cloudy and the Southeast is clear. On that day huge amounts of the electricity must move generally east to west. This will be happening every day as weather systems move across America. The grid and control systems to handle this do not, today, exist.
Compare the “Solarization” of America With Other “Mega-Projects”
America is certainly capable of successfully sustaining large projects over long periods of time that require solutions to major engineering problems. Three examples are:
1. The Manhattan Project. The project to build the first atomic bomb spanned 1942-1946 and cost about $26 billion in 2014 dollars[aa].
2. Project Apollo. The project to put the first man on the moon spanned 1961-1972 and cost about $130 billion in 2014 dollars[bb].
3. The Interstate Highway System. This project was authorized in 1956 and was completed in 1991, 35 years later, at a cost of about $500 billion in 2014 dollars[cc].
These are three very successful projects. What were the keys to their success?[dd]
1. A perceived threat or reward that leads to public acceptance. The Manhattan project and Apollo project were both responses to perceived threats, which compelled policymaker support for these initiatives. The interstate highway system was perceived as an enormous jobs program that would also produce a big jump in economic productivity.
2. A clear goal. Each project had a clear goal – build the bomb, put a man on the moon by end of 1969, build the interstate highway system.
3. Government money that ensures success. All three projects were funded by government. For example, the Manhattan Project consumed about 1% of the federal budget during its life, and Project Apollo consumed about 2% during its life.
How does our solar project score on these three success factors?
1. Perceived threat or reward. Climate change and/or exhaustion of fossil fuels. But, does the American public buy in to this? Recent polls suggest that it does not.
2. A clear goal. Electrify the US economy and generate the electricity with a solar-based system. But, whereas the interstate highway system (for example) generated huge benefits to Americans, it is not clear if there are any near-term benefits from, for example, converting transportation from carbon to solar-produced electricity.
3. Government money to ensure success. The government’s role in all three projects was to provide the funding. But, given the public’s lack of support, the huge amounts of money required, and the fiscal shape in which governments at all levels find themselves, governments today are in no position to fund this entire project.
What To Do?
In order to adopt solar power on a large scale today we must confront four problems associated with the technology.
1. The sun is a relatively low density energy source. Even in a sunny place like Arizona, it delivers only about 200 W/sq m over an average day[ee].
2. Today’s PV panels are inefficient at converting this energy to electricity. A typical low-cost PV panel will convert only 15-20% of the sun’s energy to electricity.
3. Intermittency. The sun shines for only about half of the 24 hour day, and is often obscured by clouds.
4. Cost. The construction cost of a solar PV facility is about $3.50/W vs about $1.00/W for a gas-fired power plant[ff]. Furthermore, whereas a gas-fired plant produces electricity 24/7 rain or shine, a solar plant produces electricity only during the daylight hours.
The efficiency of PV panels continues to improve, and panels with 20% efficiency are coming onto the market[gg], but the theoretical limit of the PV technology in use today is 31%[hh], and getting there has been agonizingly slow. More research is required to improve the efficiency of PV panels and any other technology that converts the sun’s energy to electricity.
The sun’s intermittency issue requires development of grid scale electricity storage systems that are sufficient (in this example) to power the entire economy during the night. Many new technologies are currently under development. As with PV panel efficiency, more research is required to develop these new technologies for electricity storage.
The capital cost of PV power plants is falling as the cost of PV panels drops. Today, PV panels cost about $.74/W, one one-hundredth of the cost in 1977[ii]! But the PV panel is only one component of the total cost of a complete solar power plant. The so-called “non-module” costs, e.g. inverters, mounting hardware, labor, permitting and fees, overhead, taxes, installer profit, etc, now make up at least two thirds of the total installed cost[jj]. Further reductions in total cost will require significant reductions in non-module costs. The total cost of a PV power plant today is still about four times the cost of a gas-fired equivalent, and it generates electricity for only half the day.
Finally, as with any energy plan, we must continue to work on energy efficiency. The chart above shows that of the 70 quads of energy supplied to the economy, about 47%[kk] of them are “rejected”, i.e. lost. Improving energy efficiency (BTU/$ GDP) is a must, regardless of the way forward.
A Final Comment
The intent of this exercise is to arrive at a ballpark estimate of what it would take to stop burning carbon and “Capture the Sun”. There is obviously a large margin of error, plus or minus, in all of it. One thing is certain. Eventually we homo sapiens will consume all of the planet’s supply of carbon. Long before that time we must develop an alternative to burning that carbon.
It’s a good bet that solar will eventually be a major part of our energy equation. The good news about the sun is that it is:
1. For all practical purposes an inexhaustible source of energy.
2. Free.
3. Available to everyone. No country can seize control of the sun and deny it to others.
But, it is also true that solar power today supplies only about two tenths of one percent of the energy to run the U.S. economyb. It is easy to see why when we compare the economics of solar with other options. In the exercise above I estimate the cost of building a system to power today’s economy with energy from the sun at about $65 trillion. Doing the same thing with gas-fired technology would cost about $4 trillion[ll], about 6% of the cost of solar.
Remember that this whole exercise has used today’s technology and today’s costs. Both of these should improve over time, but until they do the business case for a major push into solar does not look good.

"The UK will go to the polls on December 12 for the third time in four years. Climate change didn’t make waves in previous elections, but this one may be different. Youth climate strikers have launched a petition calling on the UK’s political parties to agree to a televised “climate and nature” debate. Extinction Rebellion and campaign groups like Labour for a Green New Deal have stated their hopes for making this a climate election. But should they be careful what they wish for? The May 2019 Australian federal election was fought in part on climate policy, with the opposition Labor Party promising emissions cuts, support for electric vehicles and a national energy guarantee, which would oblige electricity retailers to sign up to gradual decarbonisation. At the same time, the party refused to rule out an enormous coal mine in Queensland. Labor found itself criticised for not being bold enough by green-minded urbanites while still being held in deep suspicion by rural voters, who believed the party to be anti-coal and anti-farming. The incumbent Liberal and National Party coalition won that election with essentially no climate policy at all. After their shock defeat, the Australian Labor Party asked two former politicians to write a post-mortem. They sidestepped the question of the Adani coalmine. As historian and commentator Frank Bongiorno notes: Like just about everyone else, [Labor] know [the Adani coal mine] is a financial and environmental mess. But in terms of electoral politics, Adani is radioactive. Labor suffered in Queensland and the Hunter Valley as a result of its ambiguity, but the authors are silent on what the party could have done differently. If it had been less ambiguous about Adani, it would have needed to take a stand. But what should that stand have been?

      Nuance and nostalgia: Labor's election review provides useful insights and inevitable harking back to Hawke


 The G20 has released a report showing Australia’s climate policy response to be among the worst in the developed world. Bushfires are raging out of control in Queensland and New South Wales, and summer hasn’t even started yet. The deputy prime minister Michael McCormack has helpfully said: We’ve had fires in Australia since time began, and what people need now is sympathy, understanding, help and shelter … They don’t need the ravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital city greenies. But before UK readers get too smug, they should remember that the independent Committee on Climate Change argued: UK action to curb greenhouse gas emissions is lagging far behind what is needed, even to meet previous, less stringent, emissions targets. Over the past year, the government has delivered just one of 25 critical policies needed to get emissions reductions back on track. The British government has suspended rather than banned fracking, discouraged onshore wind and scrapped subsidies for domestic solar panel installation. Polling suggests the British public would reward a major party promising strident measures to tackle climate change. Two-thirds of voters have said that climate change will affect how they vote while a majority support an ambitious target to decarbonise the UK economy by 2030.  To exploit the governing party’s weakness on the climate crisis, Labour should go bold and commit to the 2030 decarbonisation target agreed at its conference. Such ambition from the party leadership could help defuse issues on which ambiguity might look hypocritical. It’s possible that support among some Labour MPs for expanding Heathrow airport could become the British Adani coal mine in the December 12 election. But whether electoral politics can really offer the space for a radical discussion about climate action remains to be seen. As the American social scientist, John Dewey mournfully noted: As long as politics is the shadow cast on society by big business, the attenuation of the shadow will not change the substance. I think we need to understand that states are founded on the accumulation of wealth, and that their legitimacy currently rests on a growing economy, which so far has meant growing emissions and a growing impact on the natural world. Ultimately, social change will come from social movements that can build alliances and question the current understandings of prosperity. That is an enormous task, and one that is likely to be led from the bottom-up, and not helped by the sound-bite demands of an election campaign.

California is about to take one giant step toward following [Germany’s failed climate goals which should be a wake-up all for governments everywhere](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001z8sOhoRqwELqnjYynHSR75OMJnskFyqeBhyf6vtH1_YCtOalKk9HQ2Li-glcTfQG-dYXPYlovkkLFoVaDA56DJ097uiwYaaLm8h8NM23hRUUdwHTrrFwKvsxG-C7SzB79Rs7UapGOc9fRB4dNEM_DFnGqbK89s6vWqcOLJvayuN4iYO842hLOmr2o-ypYh8R&c=UX0gOwQPUESOmJRlTpSmZs_pfSQ9C8r7RfVaM5Eq4V6qZ8U_JikxBQ==&ch=qpPLY_ybb8ehZC4AD5ltBnt1ZVCPneJNAnkWvThqOfXERysfU2ZUbg==). Yes, you guessed it, our legislatures have authorized CalEPA in the 2019 – 2020 California State budget and Assembly Bill AB 74 to conduct studies and identify strategies to manage the decline of in-state crude oil production and decrease demand and supply of fossil fuel.



Germany tried to step up as a leader on climate change, by phasing out nuclear, and pioneered a system of subsidies for industrial wind and solar that sparked a global boom in manufacturing those technologies. **Today, Germany has the highest cost of electricity in the world.**



From Alberta to Australia, from Finland to France and beyond, infuriated voters are increasingly showing their displeasure with expensive energy policies imposed by politicians in an inane effort to fight purported human-caused climate change. Now you can add Chile to the growing list of countries whose governments are suffering a backlash as average people, tired of elites forcing costly climate policies down their throats with continuous proposals to raise public transport fares and energy bills.



Like Germany and a slew of other countries, California continues to make decisions based on their belief that intermittent electricity from renewable wind and solar will be the replacement to fossil fuels to run the 5th largest economy in the world. Like Germany, this has come at a HIGH COST to Californians.



With its green dreams of an emission free state, California has not even been able to generate enough of its own electricity in-state and imported 29% of its needs in 2018. The bad news is that imported electricity comes at higher costs and those costs are being borne by residents and businesses alike. **California households are already paying 50% more,** and industrial users are paying more than double the national average for electricity.



The future of electricity in California does not bode well as the State has chosen to not challenge the closure of the States’ last nuclear zero emission generating plant at Diablo Canyon, and 3 natural gas generating plants in Southern California.



The four upcoming losses of continuous generating electricity are:



1\. PG&E’s Nuclear 2,160 MegaWatt Generating Plant at Diablo Canyon’s to be shuttered in 2024.



2\. The 823 MW Natural Gas Power Plant at Scattergood in Playa Del Rey, to be shuttered in 2024.



3\. The 575 MW Natural Gas Power Plant at Haynes in Long Beach, to be shuttered in 2029.



4\. The 472 MW Natural Gas Power Plant at Wilmington, to be shuttered in 2029.



With NO plans for industrial wind or solar renewable intermittent electricity projects to generate “replacement” electricity in-state, especially with the huge land requirements for those renewables, there will be a need to import from other states. States with greater percentages of California’s electricity needs in the years ahead. And as you guessed it, more costs to the consumers and businesses who are already infuriated with high costs.



Could it be that our legislatures are also unaware that those unstoppable costs of more regulations, taxes and increased minimum wages targeted toward businesses are just passed through to the consumers of the services and products from those businesses? Those higher costs roll directly into housing, utilities, food, and entertainment if there’s any money left, and may be very contributory to California’s growing homelessness and poverty populations.



I know our legislatures want to sunset the oil industry, BUT imagine how life was without those fossil fuels before 1900 when we had NO militaries, NO vehicles, NO airlines that now move 4 billion people around the world, NO cruise ships that now move 25 million passengers around the world, NO merchant ships that are now moving $50 Billion dollars of products monthly through California ports, NO space program, NO medications and medical equipment, NO vaccines, NO fertilizers to help feed billions, NO tires for vehicles, and NO asphalt for roads.



Most importantly, before the 1900’s we had NONE of the 6,000 products that are manufactured from the chemicals and by-products from fossil fuels. Interestingly from each 42-gallon barrel of crude oil, half is for those thousands of products and the other half for the fuels to run commerce.



We’ve had more than 100 years to find alternative or generic methods to manufacture the thousands of products we get from those deep earth minerals, and to manufacture the fuels for commerce and the military. By nearly every quantifiable measure, we are better off than our pioneer predecessors because of fossil fuels. In more than a century we’ve only come up with electricity that can be generated intermittently from sunshine and wind.



When we look at what intermittent electricity from wind turbines or solar panels CANNOT do, we see they are blatant failures to qualify as replacements for the fossil fuels that produce those 6,000 products. Of which are the basis of our lifestyles and of our numerous infrastructures. With manufacturing more than 60 million gallons of fuels every day to meet the demands of the states’ commerce and nearly 40 million residents.



I believe it’s easy to understand that wind and solar alone are obviously incapable of supporting the military, airlines, cruise ship, and merchant ships. As a reminder just in case you’re still living in the pre-1900’s, without transportation and the leisure and entertainment industries, we have no commerce.



Imagine if politicians would tell voters that their utopian vision of a world run on solar panels and windmills is a fairy tale? But instead, they have doubled down to sunset the economy with legislature verbiage that pre-determines the outcome of the CalEPA efforts to study ways to decrease the size of the in-state oil industry that’s driving (no pun intended) the California economy.

When Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Adviser to U.S. President Barack Obama, coined the term “the Blob” a few years ago, it was to describe the hawkish Beltway elites whom he blamed for undermining Obama’s foreign policy vision. Since then, the term has taken on a life of its own, appearing in books and articles and spawning a thousand arguments on Twitter. It has become a shorthand for the D.C. foreign policy community—sometimes as a token of pride, more often as an epithet for those who occupied positions of power during some of the United States’ biggest foreign policy debacles since the end of the Cold War.



In a recent article in _Foreign Affairs_ , Hal Brands, Peter Feaver, and William Inboden set out to defend the Blob. Their argument is simple: contrary to what some critics contend, the Blob is not monolithic. Its track record over the last few decades is largely one of success. And to reject the collective wisdom of the Blob, they contend, is to reject expertise—with disastrous consequences, as U.S. President Donald Trump’s amateurish approach to foreign policy has shown. “The Blob is not the problem,” they conclude. “It is the solution.”



They are wrong. For the most part, the Blob clings to a narrow set of views about the United States’ global role and paints a far too rosy picture of the last few decades of American foreign policy. Its outlook, albeit widespread, should not be confused with expertise—but the idea of the Blob has become so slippery as to enable such conflation. For those who truly want to reshape Washington’s overweening and militarized foreign policy, the best approach is not to engage in name‐​calling but to work to replace the existing foreign policy consensus and its disciples with something better.



For those who truly want to reshape Washington’s overweening and militarized foreign policy, the best approach is not to engage in name‐​calling but to work to replace the existing foreign policy consensus and its disciples with something better. 



**A Rigged Market**



The U.S. foreign policy establishment is easy to parody as an out‐​of‐​touch cabal, mired in groupthink and determined to thwart those who question mainstream views. As Brands and his co‐​authors point out, that portrayal is not quite fair. The Blob is by no means monolithic, and even policies with broad support at the time of their inception, such as the Iraq war and NATO expansion in eastern Europe, met with some criticism from inside Washington foreign policy circles.



To argue that the United States has a thriving “marketplace of foreign policy ideas,” however, is a stretch. For many years, the expert consensus in Washington has been a brand of hawkish internationalism that holds that the United States, acting as the world’s police officer, must seek to solve every global problem and that bad outcomes are the result of insufficient U.S. involvement or “leadership.” Debate occurs, but only within certain bounds: it is perfectly acceptable to argue that NATO expansion was a mistake but anathema to suggest that NATO itself may no longer serve American interests, given that Washington bears an unequal defense burden and could be forced into conflicts on behalf of the alliance’s newer members. One can permissibly debate whether the United States should “negotiate with Iran or squeeze it,” as Brands, Feaver, and Inboden write. But you’re unlikely to receive a warm welcome if you argue that, beyond its potential to develop nuclear weapons, Iran presents no real threat to the United States. Debate raged for years over whether the Obama administration should intervene against the government of Bashar al‐​Assad in Syria, but even those opposed to direct military intervention generally supported the provision of arms to rebels or stand‐​off strikes to deter chemical weapons use. Very few advocated for simply doing nothing. Discussions over the defense budget are equally monotone: in 2016, when the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments asked several think tanks to create their ideal strategies and Pentagon budget proposals, only one suggested a budget smaller than the one the White House proposed. Supporters of the status quo often point to the importance of debate in one breath then decry counterarguments as “isolationist” in the next.



The constraints matter. They have a chilling effect on debate, in part because those who ignore them run the risk of being branded as Trump sympathizers. Who would want to suggest publicly that the United States should try to improve relations with Russia if to do so means to be associated with a racist, misogynistic administration? Dissenters face career costs, too: if debate happens only within certain bounds, young policy scholars—those most likely to embrace new ideas—can find their careers stunted if they step out of line.



 **Mistakes Were Made**



In Brands, Feaver, and Inboden’s view, critics of the Blob understate not only its internal diversity but also its achievements. To hear them tell it, Washington’s grand strategy of engagement since the end of the Cold War has produced stability, peace, and prosperity, occasionally interrupted by “misconceived and mishandled” interventions in Iraq and elsewhere. The chaos engulfing the world today, they argue, is the result of Trump’s abandoning that strategy.



But this picture is misleading at best. The bipartisan consensus on foreign policy that emerged by the end of the twentieth century was no simple continuation of the United States’ successful Cold War strategy. A strategy and force posture that were perfectly reasonable when facing a hostile superpower such as the Soviet Union was entirely out of proportion after that threat had disappeared. Yet Washington used its unchallenged power in the unipolar moment to set off on a series of crusading missions, from “dual containment” in the Middle East to humanitarian interventions in the Balkans and Central Asia, culminating with a literally global counterterrorism cam​paign​.In the process, it squandered much of its military and political primacy.



To describe the United States’ military interventions as mishandled, for example, is to criminally underplay their impact. Take the 2003 war in Iraq, which scrambled the balance of power in the Middle East for a generation and enabled the emergence of the Islamic State, or ISIS. The same goes for the 2011 “humanitarian” intervention in Libya, which led to a civil war that still rages today and unleashed a tidal wave of small arms across a volatile region. Even the 1998 NATO intervention in Kosovo, relatively uncontroversial by comparison, substantially worsened U.S.-Russian relations and almost brought troops from the two nations to blows.



Some might argue that the Blob has learned its lesson. After all, Washington decided against large‐​scale ground invasions in Crimea and Syria. But few would have seriously argued that the United States should have gone to war with Russia over Crimea to begin with, while the light‐​footprint intervention in Syria—often inaccurately described as Obama’s resisting the Blob—was similarly harmful. In one memorable case, Pentagon‐​trained and CIA‐​trained rebels ended up fighting each other.



Defenders of the status quo are right to point out that one cannot boil down all of U.S. foreign policy since the Cold War to debacles such as Iraq and Libya. But some less bellicose policies have been just as detrimental. NATO expansion comes to mind. So, too, does American support for the “color revolutions” in eastern Europe and the Caucasus, which did little to promote democracy and much to worsen U.S. relations with Russia and China. Then there are the extraterritorial sanctions that the United States has imposed on Iran, North Korea, Russia, and others and that have pushed even close allies to try to shield their companies or decouple from the dollar. Critics may argue that only Trump’s incompetence has pushed allies to this extreme, but his administration is using tools popularized and perfected during the Bush and Obama years.



The notion that American withdrawal from global leadership is the real culprit behind these failures—that the world would be a better place if the United States just leaned in more—doesn’t pass the sniff test. There are now as many as 80,000 U.S. troops in the Middle East, compared with around 20,000 in the mid‐​1990s. U.S. forces overseas still number almost 230,000, compared to 300,000 during the last year of the Cold War. American troops are engaged in combat in at least 14 countries, with regular U.S. air or drone strikes in seven others. Defense spending in 2019 was about 3.4 percent of GDP; most other advanced industrialized democracies spend less than 2.0 percent of GDP. To call this disengagement is laughable.



Ultimately, Brands and his co‐​authors conclude, thanks to liberal internationalism, the “long peace continued” and the world has remained on a “generally positive track.” They may be right that alternative strategies would have done no better; counterfactuals are impossible to falsify. But judged against its own goals—peace, a rules‐​based order, and the maintenance of American primacy—the project of liberal internationalism has in many ways failed. The United States’ globe‐​spanning forward military presence has not prevented the emergence of a peer competitor, as China’s growing power shows. The number of global conflicts is at its highest since 1975, while Freedom House’s recently released report concluded that 2019 marked “the 14th consecutive year of deterioration in political rights and civil liberties.” Meanwhile, the rules‐​based international order is proving to be paper‐​thin, not least because it was weakened by a continual stream of American violations, such as the invasion of Iraq and the use of drone strikes and extralegal targeted killings. By almost every foreign policy metric, the United States is worse off today than it was at the end of 1991.



 **A New Generation**



With a track record like that, experts are easy to blame. Yet Brands and his colleagues are entirely correct that a retreat from expertise is a bad idea. The evidence is all too visible in the Trump administration. Trump adviser Peter Navarro—a man whose books contain made‐​up quotes from his own alter ego—pushes for a trade war with China. Key negotiations are delegated to the president’s daughter, Ivanka, with predictably laughable results. And the less said about Jared Kushner’s Middle East peace plan, the better.



In his original comments, however, Rhodes wasn’t suggesting that U.S. foreign policy should be run by amateurs—rather, that the D.C. foreign policy community was rigid and unwilling to consider new ideas, such as the Obama administration’s unconventional outreach to Iran. Likewise, scholars attempting to supply a retroactive definition for the Blob have focused on its distinct ideology, not its expertise. For Patrick Porter, for example, the Blob “comprises a class of officials and commentators who worry incessantly about the ‘collapse of the American security order.’” Stephen Walt is clear to note that although the Blob is “not a uniform monolith … most of its members embraced an expansive view of U.S. interests and tended to favor the ambitious grand strategy of ‘liberal hegemony.’” 



Colloquially, however, the term has become so synonymous with the foreign policy elite that it often conflates expertise with support for hawkish or liberal internationalist U.S. policies. This usage allows defenders of the Blob‚ such as Brands and his co‐​authors, to argue that abandoning liberal internationalism is the same as abandoning expertise. But not all experts view the United States as the indispensable nation. Restraint‐​oriented experts may be less represented in the traditional D.C. foreign policy bastions on Massachusetts Avenue, but they certainly exist. One does not have to look far—to academia or more heterodox think tanks such as the Cato Institute or the newly formed Quincy Institute, for example—to find experts who disagree with the idea that Washington can or should solve nearly every problem with military force. They’re a minority, but a vocal and an active one.



Trump’s administration is not replete with incompetents because he questioned the foreign policy status quo; he has been unable to staff his administration because many capable people concluded that they could not in good conscience serve this president, while others’ willingness to criticize him barred them from service. Outside the administration, however, a rising generation of policy scholars—many under the age of 35—have witnessed firsthand the mistakes of Afghanistan and Iraq and experienced the failures of post‐​Cold War U.S. foreign policy. In line with most of their generation, they see a place for the United States in the world that is more cooperative, multifaceted, and less focused on military intervention. Some prioritize international cooperation on climate change, while others emphasize strengthening U.S.-European ties to balance a rising China; still others talk about using a smaller military footprint to ensure the nation’s security or fostering foreign aid and humanitarian cooperation.



Defending the Blob as the only game in town is convenient for those who subscribe to its consensus, but it sets up a dangerous dichotomy: to claim that expertise and hawkish liberal interventionism are one and the same leaves nothing but Trumpian incompetence as the alternative. That argument serves only the interests of a failed foreign policy and the people behind it. But in relying on a term as ill‐​defined as the Blob, even critics of the status quo have inadvertently played into this misleading narrative. For those who seek to reform U.S. foreign policy, the best path may be to send Rhodes’s neologism into retirement. Instead of criticizing the Blob, reformers should work to replace it.

"“Is this the best moment ever? Are we on the brink of extinction? Can both be true?” So begins Lily Cole in her forthcoming book Who Cares Wins, a very Upsidey piece of work which manages to champion not one “ism” but two. Cole’s central argument is that if we are going to confront the looming climate catastrophe, we will need not just a prodigious surge in environmentalism but a huge dose of optimism as well. The model, actress and activist articulates this well: optimism isn’t childish credulity or pretending things aren’t very serious. It isn’t the cynical tropes of the political classes eager to get voters to suspend their disbelief. Optimism, she says, is the belief that goodness can prevail, “that the long moral arc of the universe does bend towards justice”. Oh, and it’s much better than pessimism at actually getting things done. We felt Cole’s book was so perfectly attuned to the Upside that we optimistically invited her on to the Upside, live! to talk about hope, the environment, and all those inspiring agents of change out there.  Membership Event: The Upside: In conversation with Lily Cole  She agreed. The event takes place on Friday 31 July at 1pm BST. Tickets are inexpensive, easy to get and here, in that order. Book now, and let me know whether you think optimism is enough, and I’ll endeavour to put your point to Lily during the hour-long chat. In answer to Cole’s opening question – yes, of course both are true. It’s perfectly possible for two seemingly contradictory ideas to co-exist. Just look at this week’s Upside pieces: Promising progress on the vaccine front (but Covid still rampant) Two-minute read The ultimate compliment: it makes us both feel great Three-minute read Can a great leader ever be two people? Three-minute read The rise and rise of the bicycle (in a country where it’s a deadly form of transport) Two-minute read Get in touch with your favourite contradictory ideas that co-exist. We’ll publish some of the best in coming weeks. Next week: what you said about population. $1.15m. That’s how much Greta Thunberg won in the inaugural Gulbenkian Prize for Humanity. It’s also the amount she is giving away. That is more money than I can begin to imagine, but all the prize money will be donated, through my foundation, to different organisations and projects who are working to help people on the front line, affected by the climate crisis and ecological crisis.” In other environmental news, the likely range of global warming this century has narrowed to between 2.6C-3.9C. Apocalyptic predictions of warming of more than 5C now seem less likely. And elsewhere, it’s apparently good times for books, bad times for coal. Book sales nudged up 4% in the UK last year. Coal will soon be discontinued as a fuel source in Portugal – the third European country to turn its back on the black stuff. The Seattle Times has a series called Stepping Up, which focuses on moments of compassion and community. We particularly liked this week’s piece on an initiative to connect farming surplus to food banks in Washington state. And we enjoyed this project to display Unesco world heritage sites as they once were. Somewhere out there, buried in this the largest 3D map of the universe ever published."

An increasingly popular accusation among members of the U.S. foreign‐​policy establishment and their allies in the news media is that Donald Trump’s administration is abandoning America’s global leadership role and placing the country into an isolationist cocoon. The latest proponent of that thesis is New York Times columnist David Brooks, who asserts flatly that “America is withdrawing from the world.” He adds that the negative results of that course “are there for all to see.” Brooks cites as examples China’s increasingly aggressive treatment of Hong Kong, a variety of Russian misdeeds, and Iran’s (but notably not Saudi Arabia’s or Israel’s) disruptive behavior in the Middle East. He contends that America’s alleged abandonment of the “liberal international order” will likely lead to even more widespread unfortunate consequences.



There are several problems with the argument that Brooks and his ideological brethren are propounding. First, the concept of a liberal international order is at best aspirational and at worst fictional. The reality is that it has been little more than a convenient façade for U.S. hegemony exercised through Washington’s network of military alliances and U.S.-dominated international political and economic institutions. The United States and its allies have routinely violated the supposed norms of a rules‐​based international order whenever such action seemed convenient.



Second, the notion that Trump’s foreign policy has been a dramatic departure from those of his predecessors since World War II is a myth. That is especially true regarding security issues. Although the president’s rhetoric toward Washington’s longtime allies has sometimes been abrasive and less collegial, his actions have differed little from the post–World War II norm. There certainly is no credible evidence that he is orchestrating a withdrawal from Washington’s multitude of global security commitments and initiatives.





Despite the accusations from Trump’s critics, Washington remains as hawkish and interventionist as ever.



Indeed, allegations of a retreat into isolationism are especially bizarre as America seems poised on the brink of war with Iran. And those making the “abandonment of global leadership,” “retreat from responsibility” and “embrace of isolationism” arguments have considerable difficulty citing concrete Trump administration actions that correspond to those cliches. Where, exactly, have such examples taken place?



Despite Trump’s rhetoric in the 2016 election campaign that the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan should be terminated, he promptly reneged on that position, and Washington’s war in that country goes on with no apparent end in sight. Likewise, the United States maintains a military presence in Syria and still pursues the increasingly quixotic effort to unseat Bashar al-Assad’s government. Indeed, U.S. military action escalated, with air and missile strikes on Syrian government forces.



Nor has Trump terminated the Obama administration’s policy of making the United States an accomplice in the Saudi‐​led war in Yemen, despite the proliferation of war crimes by Washington’s allies. Indeed, overall ties with Riyadh have expanded under Trump, and the president vetoed a congressional measure terminating U.S. involvement in the coalition’s Yemen war effort. Even more worrisome, the Trump administration has ratcheted‐​up its confrontational policy toward Iran. One will look in vain for any signs of a U.S. “retreat” in the Middle East.



Furthermore, allegations of withdrawal have no greater validity regarding U.S. security behavior in East Asia. The U.S. Navy has increased its “freedom of navigation” patrols throughout the South China Sea during the Trump years, despite Beijing’s vehement complaints. Washington’s support for Taiwan has grown rather than diminished. Trump eagerly signed the new Taiwan Travel Act, which for the first time authorized meetings between high‐​level U.S. and Taiwanese officials. In May, the administration implemented that provision with a meeting between National Security Adviser John Bolton and his Taiwanese counterpart.



Trump also has gone out of his way to stress that Washington’s ties with Japan, America’s principal ally in East Asia, remain as strong as ever. And although there have been some differences with South Korea about policy toward North Korea, there are no signs that the United States is about to downgrade, much less terminate, its military alliance with Seoul. So, again, where is the substantive evidence of U.S. retreat or abandonment?



Such evidence also is lacking with respect to Washington’s relations with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries. During the 2016 campaign, Trump did call NATO “obsolete,” and he raised doubts about whether he embraced the North Atlantic Treaty’s Article 5 commitment that an attack on one member would be treated as an attack on all. But once in office, he and his associates quickly reversed course. Trump’s annoyance with the allies now is largely confined to traditional burden‐​sharing complaints.



Meanwhile, other U.S. actions indicate that Washington’s security policy in Europe is as active as ever. Contrary to the myth Trump’s domestic critics foster that he is willing to “do Putin’s bidding,” administration actions point unmistakably to the opposite conclusion.



Washington has supported expanding rather than contracting NATO, backing Montenegro and Macedonia as new members. U.S. forces have joined in an accelerating number of NATO military exercises in Eastern Europe and the Black Sea. Additionally, the Trump administration is now in negotiations to build a permanent base in Poland. Moreover, contrary to assertions that Trump seeks to appease Russia, the United States has been training Ukrainian troops and has concluded not one, but two, arms sales to Kyiv. That is curious behavior for an administration determined to conduct a policy of retreat from Europe.



The theory that Washington is relinquishing its global leadership role on non‐​military matters is not quite as absurd, but only marginally so. The Trump administration’s repudiation of the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership did herald a narrower, nationalistic orientation on trade issues. So, too, have Trump’s bilateral trade feuds with Canada, Mexico, and China. Nevertheless, there is scant evidence that U.S. officials want America to be less involved in global commerce. Instead, they seem to be angling for trade on better terms for U.S. producers. The wisdom of that strategy is certainly questionable, but the approach is still a far cry from succumbing to isolationism.



When pressed, Trump’s critics scramble to point out actions such as his decision to end U.S. adherence to the Paris climate accord—an agreement that the Obama administration never even submitted to the Senate for ratification. Such examples smack of desperation. An unwillingness to endorse a largely symbolic, unenforceable measure reflecting hysteria on climate change is hardly credible evidence of a U.S. retreat from global leadership.



It actually would be gratifying if Trump’s critics were right. Terminating crusading follies such as the interventions in Afghanistan and Syria would be a good development, not a bad one. So, too, would be a willingness to reassess NATO, an alliance created seven decades ago under vastly different global conditions to wage the Cold War against the Soviet Union. Likewise, it would be worthwhile to conduct a sober risk‐​benefit analysis regarding the U.S. defense commitments to Taiwan and South Korea, given that the risk level in both cases is rising rapidly.



Unfortunately, despite the hostile propaganda that Trump’s opponents continue to circulate, there are no signs that he is even considering, much less executing, a badly needed retrenchment in America’s global obligations.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA reaction to the Pope’s encyclical has been published at climate science critical site: Die kalte Sonne.
=================================
What does the pope know about our climate?
By Uli Weber
[Translated/edited by P Gosselin]
In his encyclical‚ Laudato si, Pope Francis worries about our “common home”, and fundamentally he is not incorrect here. Under Part I of his encyclical he addresses environmental pollution and climate change. Unfortunately the papal view on the climate question is restricted solely to the strictly alarmist position. Here we present a few excerpts:
20. … Technology, which, linked to business interests, is presented as the only way of solving these problems, in fact proves incapable of seeing the mysterious network of relations between things and so sometimes solves one problem only to create others.”
This statement not only applies to market economy technologies, but rather to a far greater extent to central planning mechanisms. The ecological efforts of using renewable energies for rescuing the climate are creating at the very moment great problems in the third world, and these are being completely ignored. On this point our ecological souls, namely rainforests, are being clear-cut to make way for bioethanol production for our “ecologically precious E10 fuel”. Here a clear position-statement from the Pope on the sale of eco-indulgences at the expense of the third world would have been most desirable. Instead such active environmental destruction is being booked under the alleged climate change, which supposedly will lead to the migration of climate refugees. Quote from the papal encyclical:
25. …this is how, for example, changes in climate, to which animals and plants cannot adapt, lead them to migrate; this in turn affects the livelihood of the poor, who are then forced to leave their homes, with great uncertainty for their future and that of their children…”

For the first time since the Middle Ages the scientific mainstream and the Catholic Church are once again unified. A quote from the encyclical:
23. …a number of scientific studies indicate that most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity. … The problem is aggravated by a model of development based on the intensive use of fossil fuels, which is at the heart of the worldwide energy system.…“,
… and both agree with the politics:
26. … Therefore it is urgently needed to develop political programs over the coming years which will serve to drastically reduce the emission of carbon dioxide and other strongly polluting gases, … There have been some investment in production methods and types of transportation that require less quantities of energy and raw materials, as well as types of construction or ways of building renovation that increase energy efficiency. However these good practices have by no means been put into practice everywhere.”
We already know the implicit demand to decarbonize the global energy supply from the G7 summit at Schloss Elmau, and from the “Contract for a Great Transformation“ by the German Advisory Council for Global Change (WBGU) of 2011. Precisely this WBGU reported on 17 June 2015 that Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, Chairman of the WBGU and Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, PIK, would introduce the encyclical “Laudato si” by the Pope together with Cardinal Turkson in Rome on June 18, 2015 . This encyclical on environment declared that man-made climate change is a scientific fact and that committed climate protection for mankind represented a religious and moral imperative. Is the Pope now announcing ‘ex cathedra’ climate science truths?
—————————-
Our reader Manfred Büchel points out another important point in the encyclical, which we find hidden at the very end of the first chapter:
61. On many concrete questions, the Church has no reason to offer a definitive opinion; she knows that honest debate must be encouraged among experts, while respecting divergent views.”

"Joe Biden’s $2tn plan to eliminate all greenhouse gas emissions from the US electricity grid within 15 years has been applauded by climate campaigners, but the enormous overhaul will have to pick its way through a minefield of community as well as lobbyist opposition.  The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has touted millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy where electric vehicles, retrofitted buildings and renewable power generation help phase out emissions from fossil fuels. A Biden presidency would aim to spur tens of thousands of new wind turbines and millions of new solar panels across the US to rapidly scale up zero-carbon energy. Should Biden defeat Donald Trump in the November’s presidential election, however, the sheer scale of the energy transformation risks a backlash from communities unhappy with the nearby placement of new solar and wind infrastructure. “We must decarbonize, but that’s not the only metric. We need to care about other environmental and social impacts too,” said David Keith, a climate and energy expert at Harvard. In 2018, Keith co-authored research that found America’s transition to solar and wind would require up to 20 times more land area than previously thought. Land development was particularly significant for wind, which has an average power density – measured in watts per meter squared – that is 10 times less than solar. “Wind turbines are wonderfully efficient and we shouldn’t abandon them, but we should take their footprint seriously,” Keith said. “You should tilt the energy system towards low land footprints, which means focusing on solar, nuclear and carbon capture and storage, with wind at the margins.” An incoming Biden administration would not only have to help navigate concerns over the placement of clean energy infrastructure, but also a massive new network of transmission lines required to bring solar and wind energy from remote areas to power homes and businesses. “If there’s a seriousness about a Green New Deal and deep cuts in emissions there will need to be federal legislation that states’ rights people won’t like where decisions are made quickly,” said Keith. “It will need leadership to admit there will be tradeoffs for a shared national goal. Biden will need to be clear there will be local decisions people won’t like. We can’t pretend this is going to be easy.” The fiercest opposition to energy construction has until now centered on pipelines for fossil fuels such as oil and gas, with the Trump administration suffering recent court setbacks to its hopes of pushing through a number of projects that climate campaigners say will help push the world closer to catastrophe through disastrous global heating. But protests have also started to flare around some clean energy projects, such as a Virginia community opposed to a huge solar farm 60 miles south of Washington DC, or demonstrations in the Hawaiian island of Oahu over new wind turbines that led to more than 100 arrests late last year. “It’s not fair that AES [the company behind the wind project] can just build these monsters in our backyards, rake in all the money from them and leave us to live with the eyesore and all the side-effects,” said Kryssa Stevenson, one of the Oahu protesters, in December. Objections to wind and solar projects range from complaints they are an eyesore and harmful to property values, to largely debunked claims they are dangerous to public health. Trump has attacked “windmills” for causing a “bird graveyard” for flying animals. There are also broader environmental concerns over the land consumed for solar arrays or wind turbines. For example, conservationists have raised objections to the development of solar energy in the Mojave desert due to the threat posed to the desert tortoise, a creature that can live up to 80 years. The US has repeatedly seen renewable energy infrastructure “sited and constructed in places that have led to a significant loss of biodiversity”, said Rebecca Hernandez, co-author of a recent University of California, Davis study that found the development of the Mojave imperils cacti and other desert plants. “We need land for energy, food and conservation – how will we make sure we allocate enough for each on an increasingly hot and full Earth? We make prudent decisions about where we put our renewable energy.” Ultimately, however, the impacts of a surge in renewable energy construction may have to be weighed against an alternative where emissions are not cut and the US is roiled by unbearable heatwaves, failed crops and increasingly powerful storms. “It’s important that the Biden plan is technology neutral, so communities can pick their path to zero emissions,” said Melissa Lott, senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “A portion of the country will oppose this but that’s the case for anything that is built. On balance, are these impacts better than a carbon-intensive grid that will cut thousands of lives short? The answer is an unequivocal yes. “Getting to zero carbon for the power sector by 2035 is ambitious, it’s difficult, but it’s achievable with policy support. Every year we wait will make it harder to do. We have a narrow window in the next nine or 10 years to get everything running, and fast.”"
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know to start your day in Europe: • President Trump nominated a conservative judge from Denver, Neil M. Gorsuch, to the U. S. Supreme Court, presaging yet another political battle in Washington. The    nominee’s legal philosophy echoes that of Justice Antonin Scalia, whose seat he will fill if confirmed. In Congress, Democrats sought to delay confirmation for Mr. Trump’s cabinet picks after he fired the acting attorney general for defying his contentious immigration order. About 1, 000 American diplomats around the world have signed a   dissent cable objecting to the order, and legal challenges are mounting. We met seven Iranians stuck in Amsterdam who are among thousands of people affected by the measure. While the immigration order has prompted protests and raised anxiety in corporate America and among U. S. allies, a broad swath of the U. S. electorate appears to welcome it. _____ • Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, called President Trump a potential threat to the European Union, saying his administration seemed to “put into question the last 70 years of American foreign policy. ” Other foreign leaders also wonder whether they can depend on the U. S. to honor defense treaties and trade pacts, given the new president’s litany of impulsive statements and false claims. And Mr. Trump’s top trade adviser waded into E. U. politics by accusing Germany of exploiting other European countries, and the U. S. by keeping the euro artificially low. _____ • The war in eastern Ukraine has intensified, with the government in Kiev and   separatists blaming each other for the surge in violence. Kiev said it was preparing the evacuation of thousands of civilians from the   city of Avdiivka after days of shelling there. _____ • Romania’s government decriminalized official misconduct in some cases, dealing a blow to a yearslong anticorruption campaign. Thousands of people took to the streets in protest, and President Klaus Iohannis, who serves in a largely ceremonial role, called it “a day of mourning for the rule of law. ” _____ • In France, François Fillon’s presidential campaign suffered another blow with new accusations that the conservative’s relatives received government funds for   jobs. The police searched offices in the lower house of Parliament as part of their investigation. And Marine Le Pen, the   presidential candidate, refused to repay 298, 000 euros that the European Parliament, of which she is a member, said she misused. _____ • Take a look at the roaring wheels of China’s   industry.

High tech is trying to help snow adventurers survive avalanches with tools to add to the basic shovel and probe. The big danger is being buried and running out of air. So there are backpacks with airbags that cause the churning snow to drive the wearer toward the surface. For someone trapped beneath the snow, a product called an AvaLung can be a lifesaver. It’s a breathing tube that snakes through a backpack, so that inhales are far from the ice block formed by the melting power of exhales. But one of the most recommended tools, the avalanche transceiver, isn’t all that new. In the 1960s, the scientist Edward LaChapelle developed an early version, which John Lawton, another researcher, later improved. That led to the Skadi, an audio transmitter inside a plastic box that was nicknamed “the hot dog” and fit inside a jacket pocket. The Times in 1969 heralded its arrival, noting that the Skadi could eventually replace a much different tool: the avalanche dog.

"A humpback whale was recently spotted in the River Thames near London. This unusual sighting sparked national media interest, similar to “Benny” the beluga who also called the river home for several weeks last year. However, while Benny eventually left the Thames and headed home to the Arctic, the humpback whale was not so lucky. Ironically, despite the human-interest factor, the whale died as a result of human impact. In doing so, it had the dubious honour of being the first humpback whale known to have died in UK waters from being hit by a vessel. Whale scientists like us call such incidents a “ship strike” or “whale strike”, and they happen in all oceans around the world, both on the high seas and near the coasts. Injuries, which are not always fatal, can be sustained from blunt trauma from the boat’s hull, or sharp propellers.  The risk is highest when lots of vessels overlap with areas where susceptible animals occur in large numbers. For example, sperm whales like to gather in the part of the Mediterranean between Corsica, southern France and the coast of northwest Italy. It’s an area with lots of commercial and merchant vessel traffic, but of course the whales don’t necessarily know that. Though the area has been turned into a large special protected area for marine mammals – Pelagos Sanctuary – research has estimated that 74 sperm whales could still be hit by ships in a single summer. In the case of the Thames humpback, it was likely in the wrong place at the wrong time. A necropsy (an autopsy for animals), carried out by scientists from the UK Cetacean Stranding Investigation Programme, discovered the whale was in poor health, which may explain its journey into the Thames in the first place. However, a wound on its head clearly showed the cause of death was a collision with a ship. Such accidents are not particularly unusual, but the fact that it happened to an animal in the public eye makes it a fairly unique case.   One of the problems with ship strikes is the lack of knowledge. Dead whales sink more often than they float, so the evidence is usually quick to disappear beneath the waves. The few cases of dead whales washing ashore with clear ship-strike injuries are just the tip of the iceberg, compared to all the collisions that likely go unnoticed. As a result, there is still a lot that we don’t know about ship strikes, including key information such as how often they happen, and to what degree they impact whale conservation.  We do know that ship strikes have led to population declines in the now critically endangered North Atlantic right whale. So named because it was considered the “right” whale to hunt due to its slow speed and tendency to float when dead, the North Atlantic right whale is a species with a particularly unfortunate history. Before a 1986 moratorium, they were decimated by commercial whaling. Since then, the species has been unable to recover as the animals’ location in busy Atlantic shipping lanes and fishing grounds puts them at risk of ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear.  The threat of ship strike is truly a global issue, also affecting seals, dolphins, sharks and turtles in coastal and offshore areas around the world. The level of risk varies from species to species. For example, some whales predominantly feed in surface waters, within the reach of commercial ships’ draughts. Almost a quarter of fin whales that have washed up on UK shores since 1990 were killed by ships, and ship strike is the leading cause of death for large whales in nearby France. Understanding the current situation is only part of the problem, however, as the oceans are changing at an unprecedented rate. Shipping grew fourfold between 1992 and 2012, making collisions with whales more likely, and increasing noise pollution which can further alter natural cycles and behaviours.  Climate change is changing the distribution of plankton, one of the preferred items on a whale’s menu. This could result in whales also moving, potentially to new areas that overlap with shipping lanes. Many whale species are only just beginning to recover from historic whaling – the worry is they will suffer the same fate as the northern right. Whales dying from ship strike is also not great for shipping companies and crews. Pulling into port with a dead whale draped across the bow is never a great look, but another worry is human health and safety. There have been cases where whale-vessel collisions have resulted in sinking vessels, human injuries, and even deaths. We still don’t know enough about whale strikes though. That is why we have teamed up with ORCA, a conservation charity, to investigate exactly how busy shipping lanes in European waters overlap with whale habitats. We want to reveal the true scale of the whale / ship strike problem, and suggest ways ships can minimise the risks.  Ultimately, we need to manage our marine spaces to minimise mortality, so that the death of the Thames humpback remains an oddity rather than the norm."

On the way to his aunt's house in one of the capital's most populated neighbourhoods, Mostafa's mother started to feel unwell. She gave the little boy money to buy her a bottle of water from a kiosk while she sat down to rest.
What happened next is based on what passers-by told Mostafa's father, Abdallah, after he came to find his wife in hospital.
Abdallah, a retired accountant, says he received a phone call telling him that his wife had lost consciousness. He rushed to the clinic, a three-hour drive away, to be with his wife and son.
His wife was there, but there was no boy. No child had been with her when she was admitted, he was told.
""This was the beginning of near eight years of suffering,"" Abdallah says.
""The people who took my wife to the hospital had found her unconscious on a chair in the street. It seems that as soon as Mostafa left to get her water, she fainted - then people gathered and moved her to the hospital without realising she had a kid with her,"" he says.
""I rushed to the local police station to file a report that my son was missing, only to be asked to file that report in my hometown. I rushed back there but they told me I had to wait 48 hours.
""I felt helpless.""
In fact, by law Abdallah should have been able to file the report on the same day and in the local police station, where his son had gone missing.
To make matters worse, as soon as Mostafa's mother left hospital and learnt that her son had gone missing she suffered a stroke and was paralysed as a result.
""She was overwhelmed with a feeling of guilt. She died a year later,"" Abdallah says.
""In that year, I was trying to save both: my son and my wife.
""I was moving from one hospital to another trying to treat her and going from one police station to another trying to find him.""
In 2011, Egypt underwent tumultuous change when mass protests forced the resignation of long-time President Hosni Mubarak. But for Abdallah, what happened in those days was a disaster.
During the demonstrations, several police stations were stormed and set on fire.
""Police reports were burnt, including my son's,"" Abdallah says.
He recalls the 2011 protests with a grudge. ""These events harmed me personally,"" he says.
In 2011 and 2012, Egypt went through a period of instability with waves of protests calling for the post-Mubarak transitional period to be accelerated.
Then in 2013 another series of demonstrations took place against the rule of late Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, leading to his ousting that July; only one year after he had assumed power. Morsi's ousting led to protests and sit-ins by his supporters that were dispersed by force in August 2013.
According to Abdallah, because of years of political upheaval, it took until 2014 for him to be able to file new police reports about Mostafa's disappearance.
As time passed, Abdallah started to lose hope of finding his son. Then something unexpected happened.
""One day, I came across a page on Facebook called Missing Children,"" he says.
""I got in touch with the administrator and sent my son's picture to post it on the page. I had very little hope but did it anyway.""
Missing Children was launched in mid-2015 to raise awareness of the issue by posting pictures of lost children and their stories.
The page's founder is 43-year-old engineer Rami el-Gebali.
""When I started it, my aim wasn't to find these children,"" he says.
The first time a child was discovered through the page, it happened by chance, but it prompted Mr Gebali to change its mission from drawing attention to actively trying to find missing children.
""A few months after we started, I was contacted about one of the pictures, which was of a missing special needs boy. The caller claimed the boy in the photo slept in front of the block where he lived,"" Mr Gebali recalls.
""I didn't believe him until he sent me a picture of the boy. I contacted the boy's mother and she confirmed it was him.""
After Mostafa's picture was posted on the page in July 2015, Abdallah says people started claiming to have seen him in different places. Every time someone mentioned seeing him somewhere, Abdallah would drive to that place and spend the whole day looking for him but in vain.
""Every time the picture was posted, new people started claiming to have seen him. But I stopped believing them,"" Abdallah says.
""Then on 26 May 2016, I received a phone call from the wife of the page's founder, telling me they found Mostafa. She was over the moon.""
An employee at a foster care institution had gotten in touch with Missing Children and asked them to send someone to see if any of the youngsters at the facility matched any of its pictures.
""We sent someone to check and when she saw Mostafa, his name and the date he was admitted to the centre rang a bell,"" Mr Gebali says.
""We tried to check as much details as possible to verify his identity before getting in touch with the dad.""
At first Abdallah was sceptical.
""Although I was assured that they had verified his identity, I still couldn't believe it,"" Abdallah says.
""I asked them to send me a picture [of the boy]. But his looks had changed.""
However, Abdallah had kept one piece of information secret to use as a conclusive evidence of his son's identity if he ever found him. Mostafa had a car accident when he was four and the operation left a mark above his left knee.
So Abdallah asked the page's administrators to send a picture of the boy's bare legs.
""When I saw the mark I couldn't believe it,"" he says.
Seven years after last seeing his son, Abdallah went to get him from the foster care centre in Giza.
""The moment I walked through the doors, it felt surreal,"" he recalls.
After being reunited with Mostafa, Abdallah started to piece together what had happened on that fateful day in 2009.
It transpired that when Mostafa had returned with the bottle of water for his mother, he could not see her anywhere.
""The boy started crying. Someone passing by found him and took him to the police station,"" says Abdallah.
""There Mostafa only said his first name. He was terrified to the extent that he couldn't talk.""
The police station is about two kilometres (1.2 miles) away from where Mostafa was separated from his mother.
He was then transferred to the foster care centre.
""I don't think I would have found him if it wasn't for the Missing Children page,"" Abdallah says.
Rami el-Gebali describes the work of Missing Children as ""a very complicated process"".
""We don't just post pictures of missing children,"" he says. ""When the page found its first missing child, his mother mentioned something intriguing: he was wearing different clothes.""
This prompted Mr Gebali to start researching how many of the children are kidnapped. He found that children get abducted for five main reasons: adoption, begging, sex trade, organ trade and ransom.
He thought that while it was difficult for ordinary people to help find children abducted for sexual exploitation, organ trade or ransom, they could actually help find those taken to join gangs of beggars or for adoption.
As a result, the page started a ""No to using children as beggars"" campaign in 2015.
""We asked people to take pictures of kids begging on the streets and send it to the page. We collected tens of thousands of pictures of beggars of all ages,"" Mr Gebali says.
A match-making process started between those missing and those begging on the street. Due to the large volume of pictures, the page started using open-source face recognition tools in late 2017.
Although the campaign led to only three children being found, thanks to it the page now has ""the biggest database of missing children with pictures in Egypt,"" according to Mr Gebali.
The page now has 13 people working on it and has over 1.7 million followers. It also has a large network of lawyers, therapists and educators to help missing individuals and families transition back to living with each other.
It also has an impressive success rate. It says that, so far, it has found more than 2,500 missing people of all ages out of more than 7,000 cases reported to it.
But as many are found, more still go missing. According to the state-owned Al-Akhbar newspaper, police received 2,264 reports about disappeared children in 2018 and 2019.
Mr Gebali expects these numbers to drop in 2020 as a consequence of the pandemic.
""During Covid-19 we noticed almost a 30% drop in cases compared to the same period last year.""
In 2018, Facebook selected the page as one of the top 115 most impactful initiatives on the platform.
Using a $50,000 (Â£38,000) grant from the social media giant, the page was able to build its own website with face recognition tools.
Capitalising on its success in Egypt, the page launched a similar one in Romania - ""very similar to us, with a large number of missing people,"" Mr Gebali says - in 2019.
""Our dream is to have one global database of missing people around the world,"" he says. ""That way we will be able to connect the dots and confront human trafficking, organ trade, etc.
""Our motto is that no family should suffer the pain of missing a living loved one. We want to spread our model across the world. We proved the concept and we know it works.""
_Mostafa's and Abdallah's real names have been changed to protect their identities._"
"**Facebook has said it could lose most of its revenue from ads on apps, because of changes to Apple's operating system.**
In the upcoming iOS 14, apps have to explicitly ask users' permission to collect and share data, meaning ads will no longer be able to just ""follow"" users to apps outside of Facebook.
Users targeted in this way are eight times more likely to buy products, according to Facebook.
But iOS 14 tests suggest ""more than a 50% drop in... publisher revenue"".
Audience Network, which Facebook describes as a ""way for advertisers to extend their campaigns beyond Facebook and into other mobile apps"", works by using an identifier code to target advertising on the basis of users' ""likes"" and preferences.
IPhone users can already opt out of this tracking.
But Apple's plan to require all users to actively opt in before they can be tracked ""may render Audience Network so ineffective on iOS 14 that it may not make sense to offer it"", Facebook said.
In a blog, Facebook warned advertisers they ""should expect their ability to effectively monetise from Audience Network to decrease"" and called for industry consultation on the changes, which it said would have ""a far-reaching impact on the developer ecosystem""."
"**â¢Farhiya was separated from her father when she was a baby**
**â¢She didn't see him for nearly 40 years**
**â¢They were reunited thanks to a stranger on social media**
""Congratulations! We found your dad!"" read an email in Farhiya's inbox.
""I couldn't believe it when I first got the news."" she says. ""It was a dream come true. But I always kept faith this moment would one day arrive.""
When she was growing up, Farhiya used to ask her mother what her dad was like.
""She would tell me to look in the mirror,"" says Farhiya. ""You talk like him, you walk like him, you even argue like him,"" her mother would reply.
But apart from a few black and white photos, that was all she had to go on.
Thirty-nine-year-old Farhiya was born in Leningrad - now St Petersburg - in 1976 to a Russian mother and a Somali father.
Siid Ahmed Sharif was one of many young Somali officers invited to study in the Soviet Union as the USSR sought to expand its influence in Africa.
He and Farhiya's mother planned to marry, but a year after Farhiya was born, Somalia went to war with its neighbour, Ethiopia - and the Kremlin sided with Ethiopia.
So very soon Somalia expelled Soviet advisers from the country and all Somali students in the USSR, including Farhiya's father, were told to go home.
""My mum and I were visiting my grandma in Western Siberia when we first heard on radio about the war,"" she says.
""I remember her telling me later that she immediately knew what this meant for our family, what this meant for my father.""
Sharif had 24 hours to pack his bags. With his loved ones away, he couldn't even say goodbye but he left a note with his parents' address in Mogadishu.
""I knew he did not walk out on us, he had not left us or abandoned us,"" says Farhiya. ""He only left us because of the circumstances.""
But those circumstances also made it impossible to stay in touch.
The family was separated for nearly four decades.
Despite this, Farhiya's childhood was a happy one.
""I was surrounded by unconditional love from my mum. Her relatives gave me so much love and care, I felt very special,"" she says.
""I was proud of my heritage, was proud of looking differentâ¦ My classmates, my teachers at school and the university always told me I was special.""
**Farhiya** spoke to World Update on the BBC World Service - listen to the interview here
Farhiya always wondered where her father was and what he was like, though.
""The desire to find my dad was always there but it was when I was about 12, I thought to myself I had to do something to find him,"" she says.
By this time the political climate had changed - Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of _glasnost_ (openness) was under way and Farhiya saw nothing to stop her writing to her father.
But when she sent letters to the address he had left they always bounced back unopened. She didn't know if they even reached Somalia.
She contacted organisations in the USSR that helped children find their African fathers and got in touch with the Red Cross, which provided a similar service. But her attempts were fruitless.
""Other Russian children were able to find their parents in other African countries because it was easier. Those countries had diplomatic relationships, embassies and people working in Russia who were going back and forth to African countries. As for Somalia, access was extremely limited,"" she says.
From time to time she stopped actively searching but she never fully let go of the idea of finding her father.
""It was like trying and failing and then giving up for few years then going back to the search once again and failing again,"" she says.
When Somalia descended into civil war in 1991, that was a huge setback.
The war continued for nearly two decades, but as it drew to an end, social networks were beginning to emerge and this gave Farhiya fresh hope.
On one Russian social media site, Vkontakte, she came across a woman helping reunite people with parents living abroad, but it turned out to be another dead end.
""I wrote to her but she said that if my father was in Somalia she would not be able to help,"" Farhiya says.
Then she started to browse pictures of Somalia on Instagram.
A lot of the photos she liked were posted by a young Somali man called Deeq who seemed well connected, so she messaged him to see if he could help.
Deeq had cultivated a range of Somali contacts during his years travelling in North America, Europe and the Horn of Africa. He also had good contacts in the Somali government from his work at the country's embassy in Dubai.
On 16 March he posted Farhiya's plea on his Facebook page.
Comments soon started flooding in, and one from Norway stood out.
""That's our sister Farhiya,"" it read.
It was written by one of Farhiya's half siblings, living in Oslo, and her father was staying with her at the time.
A few weeks later, after several Skype calls, Farhiya, her mother and Farhiya's husband travelled to Norway to meet her father.
""He was exactly like I expected him to be,"" she says. ""We walked exactly in the same manner. We talked exactly in the same voice. It was unbelievable - the two of us were together after all this time!""
She met three of her half-sisters, and a half-brother arrived from Sweden, where her father lives most of the time. A half-uncle also flew to Oslo for the family gathering.
Farhiya discovered that her father had been looking for her too.
""When we spoke on Skype for the very first time, he told me about his attempts to reach us,"" she says.
But she and her mother had moved when her mother had married, and Sharif didn't have their new address. And like his daughter, he had run up against problems caused by the breakdown in relations between their two countries.
These days Farhiya and her mother talk regularly with Sharif on Skype and another meeting is planned. Next time he may visit St Petersburg.
There are many things about her father's life Farhiya has yet to find out, and many things she and her mother want to tell him about the last four decades.
Fortunately Sharif still remembers the Russian he learned many years ago.
Farhiya is delighted to have discovered an extended family in Scandinavia and Somalia, but sometimes it's hard to take in that her search is finally over.
""It will probably still take me a long time to believe that in my phone, I now have the most important contact in my life - Dad.""

For nearly 80 years, the United States was the chief architect and foremost defender of the global rules‐​based, liberalized trading system. The twin aims of this bipartisan policy were to promote U.S. economic and strategic interests—and on both counts, the nation’s efforts have been successful. Increasing economic interdependence and globalization more broadly have fueled economic growth and innovation, raised a billion people out of poverty, and discouraged the kind of bloodshed that was all too common before the advent of the global trading system. Despite these successes, however, the system is facing its most serious and credible threat since the early 1930s, when beggar‐​thy‐​neighbor protectionism spread across the globe and fueled both the Great Depression and World War II.



Under the false promises of economic nationalism, President Donald Trump has abdicated the commercial leadership supported by his predecessors stretching all the way back to Herbert Hoover. The president has withdrawn the United States from the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP), a promising trade agreement with Pacific Rim countries; threatened to withdraw from valuable institutions like the World Trade Organization (WTO) while crippling its adjudicatory function; recklessly imposed tariffs on longstanding allies under the dubious guise of national security; and spurned those allies to wage an ad hoc and aggressive unilateral trade war against China.



These ill‐​advised policies have hurt American families and businesses, damaged U.S. competitiveness in an increasingly globalized 21st century economy, triggered predictable retaliation from trading partners, sewn uncertainty, and alienated the very allies America needs to tackle legitimate challenges facing the global economic system. By erecting new barriers to trade and investment while working outside the confines of the rules‐​based system, the United States is rapidly squandering decades of hard work and foresight at a time when much of the rest of the world—particularly the economies home to Americans’ biggest competitors—pushes forward with more liberalization.



As 2020 presidential candidates campaign across the country, we are concerned that they are failing to grasp the severity of the situation they would inherit upon entering the White House. It is imperative that the next president work diligently to re‐​establish the United States as the global leader and defender of rules‐​based trade liberalization. A candidate wishing to adopt a bold, forward‐​thinking trade policy agenda for the 21st century should promise to:



It is imperative that the next president work diligently to re‐​establish the United States as the global leader and defender of rules‐​based trade liberalization.



 **Withdraw the National Security Tariffs and Threats of National Security Tariffs**



Previous presidents, who rightly understood that false claims of national security undermine real ones, used their authority to restrict imports in the name of national security sparingly and judiciously. Today, that is not the case. After dubious Department of Commerce studies determined that imported steel and aluminum jeopardize the national security of the United States, President Trump levied steep duties on these metals in early 2018. Meanwhile, the Defense Department estimates that “U.S. military requirements for steel and aluminum each only represent about three percent of U.S production.” Now the White House is considering whether to use national security tariffs to restrict imported automobiles and automotive parts.



Imported steel, aluminum and automobiles do not jeopardize national security. Instead, President Trump is, by his own admission, using the threat of national security tariffs to extract from our trading partners more favorable treatment of American exports. This belies the intent of the statute and ignores the fact that the United States has negotiated a number of successful trade agreements without resorting to reckless, self‐​defeating national security tariffs.



The president’s national security protectionism has triggered predictable retaliation from trading partners, ensnaring unrelated industries like agriculture in the back‐​and‐​forth and raising the cost for U.S. firms reliant on imported steel and aluminum. Economists Dr. Kadee Russ and Lydia Cox recently concluded that there are “75,000 fewer jobs in manufacturing attributable to the March 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum, not counting additional losses among U.S. exporters facing tariffs other countries levied in retaliation.” Meanwhile, companies like Harley Davidson face a one‐​two punch: higher costs for inputs due to the steel tariffs and retaliatory tariffs from the European Union. This led Harley, an iconic American brand, to shift some production overseas.



At the same time, the tariffs have failed to revitalize the industries they were ostensibly designed to protect. As _The New York Times_ reported, “There are fewer aluminum production jobs in the United States than a year ago, while steel mills have added only a few thousand jobs.” According to economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, each steel job created due to the tariffs is costing consumers about $650,000. Meanwhile, steel and aluminum producers, most notably U.S. Steel, have shuttered factories in the face of high input prices and sagging demand and have seen their stock prices tank.



On top of the direct costs and failed objectives, the national security tariffs and threatened tariffs have strained commercial relations with longstanding allies. Though the president reluctantly removed the steel and aluminum tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada after it became clear they were a hurdle to ratifying his NAFTA replacement, the remaining tariffs are still in place for virtually every other trading partner, including Japan and the European Union.



To spare families and businesses from needless pain and rebuild trust among valued allies, the next president should withdraw the steel and aluminum tariffs, pledge not to impose national security tariffs on automobiles and automotive parts, and work with Congress to enact meaningful restrictions on unilateral tariff authorities.



 **Defend and Reform the World Trade Organization**



With 164 member nations covering 98 percent of global gross domestic product, the WTO provides a crucial bulwark for the rules‐​based trading system. The institution serves three basic functions: It provides baseline multilateral trade rules that ensure open, non‐​discriminatory markets; a forum to negotiate new rules; and a process for peacefully resolving disputes through consultation and, if necessary, binding litigation.



Through numerous multilateral negotiating rounds and the resolution of hundreds of disputes, the WTO and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), have been remarkably successful. When the United States and its allies began negotiating the GATT shortly after World War II, the average tariff of participating countries was 22 percent. In 2018, the world’s applied tariff was just 9 percent. Though declining slightly this year due to a number of factors, including trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, trade volumes have grown by over 4 percent annually (on average) since the WTO was first established in 1995. Likewise, the United States has effectively used the WTO’s dispute settlement system to hold countries accountable for violating their binding commitments. The president’s own Council of Economic Advisers acknowledged that the United States wins more than 85 percent of the cases it brings to the organization. This reality stands in stark contrast to the president’s misguided rhetoric about the WTO.



With populism on the rise, the WTO is facing a multi‐​front crisis. China’s unique brand of state‐​driven mercantilism poses the biggest challenge to the future of the WTO. However, the more immediate challenges are driven by the Trump administration’s own antipathy for the Geneva‐​based organization. The president has repeatedly threatened to withdraw the United States from the WTO. Though he lacks the express legal authority to do so, his threats alone undermine global trade.



A more subtle threat to the WTO is the Trump administration’s war of attrition on its Appellate Body, the highest court of international trade. Citing certain disagreements with the dispute settlement process generally, the Trump administration is currently blocking the appointment of new Appellate Body jurists. As a result, the Appellate Body now has just one member—two short of the quorum necessary to hear appeals of panel decisions—instead of the usual seven. Unless the Trump administration stops blocking new appointments, the Appellate Body cannot adjudicate new disputes. Like the threat of withdrawal, crippling the adjudicatory function of the WTO will hamstring the United States’ ability to hold foreign countries accountable for discriminatory and protectionist trade policies.



Admittedly, a major problem confronting the WTO is the inability of its 164 member countries to move forward with negotiations to update and expand the rules for global trade. Since the collapse of the Doha Development Round, multilateral talks have ground to a halt. Though there were numerous causes of the Doha Round failure, much of the blame lies with the United States—in particular, U.S. (and E.U.) unwillingness to curb agriculture subsidies and other forms of agricultural protectionism or to further discipline the use of “fair trade” mechanisms like antidumping measures. This intransigence came with a cost: While American competitiveness in services and data‐​enabled exports has deepened, common rules governing these forms of trade remain weak or entirely absent from WTO agreements.



To reaffirm the United States’ commitment to the WTO while promoting reforms that enable it to meet the challenges of the 21st century global economy, the next president should make three specific promises.



First, if the United States expects other nations to abide by their trade commitments, it must lead by example. Thus, the next president should stop blocking the appointment of new members of the WTO’s Appellate Body. Instead, he or she should engage in robust negotiations to address legitimate U.S. concerns about the dispute settlement process in Geneva.



Moreover, the next administration should work to expand the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body so that it can resolve disputes more quickly, enhancing its ability to deter unfair practices without lengthy delays. A fully functioning dispute settlement mechanism allows the United States to hold countries accountable for protectionist trade policies that burden American firms.



To accomplish this goal, the next administration must work with Congress to provide the WTO with more funding. The organization currently faces a massive resource crunch. In 2018, the United States provided the WTO with slightly more than $22 million—about 11 percent of the organization’s budget. As the world’s largest service exporter and the second largest goods exporter, the United States can and should recognize the importance of the institution and contribute more.



Second, the next president should reaffirm that the United States will attempt to resolve all disputes over WTO rules within the system rather than undermining the system by working outside its confines. The United States’ commitment to resolving disputes through the WTO was instrumental in forging a broader compromise that transformed the flawed GATT into the WTO, with its binding dispute settlement system, in the mid‐​1990s. Whoever is elected in 2020 should continue this legacy.



Likewise, given the United States’ record as a complainant, the next administration needs to bring more disputes to the WTO. At the same time, the United States should seek compliance where it has won a dispute but the offending party has not withdrawn the offending measures. In 2012, for example, the United States prevailed in a case involving China’s discriminatory payment system policies. Despite winning the case, China was slow to take adequate steps to remove the offending policies. The United States should have pursued compliance proceedings in this and other instances to ensure China responds in a manner contemplated by the decisions.



Third, with multilateral negotiations stalled since the collapse of the Doha Development Round, the next administration should actively negotiate with some, but perhaps not all, WTO members to write new disciplines that will update and expand the rules for international trade. Known as “plurilateral” negotiations, these “coalitions of the like‐​minded” offer the best option for revitalizing the WTO as an indispensable forum for liberalization. Three areas are ripe for these types of negotiations: trade in environmental goods, to mitigate the effects of climate change; digital trade, the new frontier of commerce in the 21st century; and trade in services, in which the United States has an enormous comparative advantage. Though trickier to negotiate, new rules on industrial subsidies would also be a worthwhile endeavor. The goal of these negotiations should be to write new rules that eventually apply to every WTO member.



Should momentum grow for multilateral talks, the United States should be ready to offer farm subsidy cuts and new antidumping disciplines in exchange for real commitments on industrial market access, services liberalization, subsidies, and 21st century issues. The importance of such commitments is reflected in the structure of the U.S. economy, which excels in technology‐​enabled services, high‐​value industrial products, and frontier innovation.



 **Pursue Regional Trade Liberalization**



Not only should the United States pursue new rules and broad liberalization at the WTO, it should seek partners to begin negotiating free trade agreements. Such agreements would expand market access for the benefit of both American consumers and producers, write new rules that could eventually form the basis of a new era of multilateralism, and engender goodwill among trading partners, making it easier to address collective action problems facing the world.



While the rest of the world pursues more trade liberalization—the European Union, for example, recently concluded an agreement with MERCOSUR (a South American trading bloc comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay)—the United States is standing still. After the United States withdrew from TPP, its remaining members pushed forward to implement the agreement, offering preferential access to each other’s domestic market. Meanwhile, since 2016 the U.S. has been able to make only negligible modifications to the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, a minor deal covering only a few sectors with Japan, and renegotiate NAFTA, which passed Congress in early 2020.



Returning to the TPP is the most expeditious way to ensure that U.S. exporters face a level playing field with their competitors in pivotal Asian‐​Pacific markets. Lost market access is an especially acute problem for American farmers and ranchers attempting to reach notoriously closed Asian agriculture markets. Though the U.S. recently announced a limited deal with Japan that would reduce agriculture tariffs, cut a small number of industrial tariffs, and enshrine digital trade rules, joining the TPP provides greater market access and more comprehensive commercial, labor, and environmental protections than currently on offer. 



Re‐​engaging with our Asian allies through the TPP provides an important strategic asset to the next president. Through this partnership, the United States provides countries in China’s orbit with an alternative market of similar size and a framework for dispute resolution based on rule of law rather than economic power. The U.S. will gain a vital tool of soft influence in the region that challenges Beijing and other Asia‐​Pacific countries to raise their commercial standards.The next president should quickly rejoin the TPP and encourage other regional countries like Thailand to accede to the agreement.



Europe, too, presents an opportunity for renewed trade cooperation. Between 2013 and 2016, the United States and the European Union were negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a modern, comprehensive commercial agreement. Those talks stalled after President Trump’s election and the surprising decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. Yet despite the absence of a free trade agreement, the European Union remains the United States’ largest two‐​way (exports plus imports) trading partner—total trade between these two powerful economies nearly reached $1.3 billion in 2018.



Cutting trade and investment barriers on both sides of the Atlantic could supercharge an already powerful economic arrangement. Like TPP, TTIP would enhance the United States’ geostrategic positioning by strengthening important security and diplomatic ties. After the last several years of the Trump administration questioning the value of alliances like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, undercutting the U.S/EU commercial relationship by proclaiming certain European products to be national security threats, and acting outside the confines of the WTO, a completed TTIP would reaffirm the United States’ commitment to the transatlantic relationship. Likewise, it would improve the West’s position vis‐​a‐​vis an increasingly hostile Russia and provide the United States with another trading bloc committed to high quality commercial rules that could be leveraged to help discipline China’s trade and investment transgressions.



Renewed TTIP negotiations will not be easy and the next president must be willing to make some tough concessions in order to move forward. Several high‐​profile areas of disagreement – including those involving issues of agriculture, international tax, digital trade, and data flows – await a re‐​engaged president. Tough decisions will need to be made. Nevertheless, the economic and strategic benefits are too great to ignore.



Familiar and new trade partners offer potentially valuable economic and strategic alliances. Free trade agreements with a post‐​Brexit United Kingdom and Switzerland could boost trade beyond existing relationships while providing U.S. trade negotiators additional leverage in TTIP talks. Meanwhile, opportunities for fruitful deals exist with MERCOSUR, India, and the 54 nations now part of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, the first phase of which went into effect last year. The next president can and should aggressively work to push the envelope on regional and bilateral liberalization.



 **In Concert with Allies, Effectively Confront Beijing’s Trade Practices**



The U.S.-China relationship is the most important geostrategic relationship in the 21st century—and increasingly so. As China’s wealth and influence continue to rise, frictions between Washington and Beijing are inevitable. From disputes over human rights and national security to economic cooperation and confronting climate change, how these two superpowers manage their relationship over the coming decades will largely define the prospects for global peace and prosperity. Developing a thoughtful, forward‐​looking commercial strategy is thus of paramount concern to the next president.



Despite this imperative, the current administration’s ad hoc approach to China is woefully inadequate for the long‐​term challenges ahead. The United States has legitimate complaints about Chinese trade policy practices, including intellectual property abuse, forced technology transfer, cyber intrusions into commercial networks, and theft of trade secrets, all of which were documented in the U.S. Trade Representative’s 2018 report. Relying on the report, the president has waged a haphazard trade war against China. Indeed, over the last year and a half, the world’s two largest economies have engaged in a tit‐​for‐​tat escalation of tariffs against a backdrop of increasing tensions and uncertainty.



The next president will need to confront some hard truths about the U.S.-China commercial relationship. To begin, he or she will have to acknowledge there is no silver bullet with respect to resolving the multi‐​dimensional problems that exist in our trade and investment relations with Beijing. The administration must deploy a variety of tools of economic statecraft. He or she will need a flexible and transparent strategy for managing this increasingly complex relationship.



Constant engagement will be far more effective than an outdated Cold War paradigm that erects an “economic iron curtain” between the world’s two largest economies. Such engagement must include close coordination with U.S. allies. Confrontational, erratic unilateralism may win plaudits from Beltway hawks, but it confuses and alienates our friends and marginalizes reform‐​minded voices in Beijing, making progress that much more difficult. Transforming China’s state‐​centric mercantilist economy will take time and persistence, not overheated bluster and unilateral tariffs.



To pivot away from self‐​defeating tactics toward smarter tools, the next president should remove all the recently enacted tariffs on imports from China. In the unlikely event that the recently announced “phase one” deal with Beijing comes to fruition, the average tariff on imports from China will remain above 19 percent, which is six times higher than when the trade war began. And, given the recent adversity in China due to the COVID-19 virus, achieving the (already) excessively optimistic Chinese import goals of the agreement may prove impossible. U.S. tariff removal should be paired with China’s removal of its retaliatory tariffs against American exports. The tariffs are causing an inordinate amount of pain for America and its allies. Business investment continues to fall as the trade war drags on, imperiling future productivity growth. Moreover, as time passes, it becomes increasingly clear that the Trump tariffs have failed to achieve their objective of forcing substantial changes to the Chinese economic model. The next president needs effective tools that promote Chinese compliance with global commercial norms.



As an alternative to self‐​defeating unilateral tariffs, the United States should lead a large coalition of like‐​minded allies to bring important cases against Beijing at the WTO. Despite the current administration’s claims, the United States can successfully challenge Beijing’s commercial practices at the WTO. The payment systems case notwithstanding, China has a decent record of complying with adverse decisions at the WTO. For instance, in 2010, after Beijing restricted sales of rare earth minerals used in certain technology products to Japan in a high‐​profile confrontation, the United States, the European Union, and others joined Tokyo to challenge the measures. After losing the case at the WTO in 2014, Beijing eventually withdrew the measures. This is just one example of China complying with adverse WTO decisions and provides a roadmap for future American presidents to confront Beijing in Geneva.



In addition to filing cases at the WTO, the next president should better deploy the full range of tools of economic statecraft. The United States recently enhanced its ability to monitor and restrict potentially malicious foreign investment in domestic firms through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Though CFIUS could be used as a protectionist cudgel, carefully crafted restrictions implemented in a consistent, transparent manner ensure that American trade secrets and sensitive technologies are not transmitted to the Chinese government.



Likewise, the next president should consider imposing narrow sanctions on specific actors—for example, state‐​owned enterprises controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. Likewise, adopting carefully crafted export restrictions on certain cutting‐​edge technologies with national security applications also makes sense. Though these measures should also be reviewed for their consistency with multilateral trade rules, they are subject to formal rules that make them a superior alternative to the ad hoc, opaque tariff regime now in place.



Though politically challenging, the United States and China could negotiate an actual bilateral trade agreement that addresses a number of structural concerns raised by the USTR. Before Barack Obama left office, his administration was negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with Beijing with binding and enforceable commitments. The next president should build on those negotiations to bring the Chinese back to the table.



Leveraging allies and institutions like the WTO, deploying carefully targeted tools of economic statecraft, and enhancing U.S. economic integration to raise commercial standards in the Asia‐​Pacific Region will not completely transform China’s economy, but it will provide more benefits and do less harm to the United States than sclerotic protectionism.



Yet even the most carefully deployed tools of economic statecraft are no match for out‐​competing China in the 21st century. That effort begins at home. In order to meet the challenges of the 21st century, policymakers should expand high‐​skilled immigration, eliminate tariffs on industrial inputs, expand science‐ and technology‐​based education, provide more subsidies for research and development, and responsibly address climate change and the national debt while working to reform local licensing and zoning regulations that dampen both business and labor dynamism. If China truly is an existential competitor or even a threat, it is time that U.S. policymakers started acting like it.



 **The Challenge**



Trade policy has not been a top priority for presidential candidates in the recent past. Yet, since the early 1930s, American policymakers have overcome difficult politics to pursue carefully crafted trade policies that propelled U.S. commercial leadership. Yet given the serious harm President Trump has done to our commercial relations since assuming office, the next president will not have the same luxury.



During the 2020 campaign and thereafter, trade policy will be front and center as the U.S. confronts a rapidly changing technological and geopolitical environment. To undo the damage that the current administration’s unilateral and ineffective actions have wrought, the next president must pursue policies and alliances that affirm the United States as the global leader of the rules‐​based trading system in the 21st century.

Dear Minister Shaw,



You once wrote to me to tell me that you and PM Ardern want to be **the** global leaders in climate change. You admitted you were only pursuing your fraud because the UN IPCC wanted you to. A bit like “I only drink beer because Big Terry does”. Not really a bankable excuse for perpetrating fraud when you have been told the ramifications on regular occasions, is it?



Obviously, with due respect, you and your colleagues don’t really understand what is up, do you? The game for you may already be lost because you only listen to your own PR.



Most of the new coal-fired power plants will be built by China along the “Belt and Road”. But then there is this new report today that makes you look even more out of touch with reality … because China themselves will [drown out your efforts](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Coal/China-Adds-Wave-Of-New-Coal-Fired-Power-Plants.html) to tax us into oblivion…



Your real problem is that 2020 will be the year your fraud dies. **The real global leader in CO 2 emissions is China**, aided and abetted by 150 other countries, so what crumbs does that leave for you wannabe “King Canutes”?



You see, 2019 is the year that will likely go down in history as “the year the Grand Solar Minimum made its presence felt”. I have been writing to you about this for two years and you know the basis on which my allegations of fraud against you were made to the SFO… and would likely soon hit the courts…namely…



1\. **Changes in atmospheric CO 2** can be reliably shown to have **NO influence over changes in earth’s climate.** Hmmm, I see a challenge has been thrown down today by the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition offering a prize of $10,000 for evidence that CO2 changes can affect the climate. I am certain their money is safe because I already know what my affidavits from experts will say.



2\. **CO 2 is not a pollutant** but is instead a gas essential for all life on earth. Despite your exercise of the power of persuasion over the modern version of a child army, you cannot alter chemical and physical reality.



3\. There is no chance that you can make a credible claim of reducing atmospheric CO2 by the year 2100 sufficient to make any measurable change to earth’s climate.



So you are trying the equivalent of pushing excrement uphill.



But I will only go to court against you and the PM in 2020 if the facts of a cooling climate do not destroy your narrative beforehand.



 **Because the Grand Solar Minimum has come to town in October/November 2019 in the form of enormous cold climate crop losses,** the food shortages are going to cause mayhem in 2020. I will be making sure that the public know why. Again China is in the spotlight because not only has the cold affected cropping but also because they were invaded from the South by the “Army Worm” and from the African Swine Haemorrhagic Fever. So their buyers are scooping up food in bulk wherever they can. Much of SE Asia is actually affected. Russia and China have been preparing for this Grand Solar Minimum for the last five years, so the Chinese will corner the market as a result of their wise planning – and others will …. to use an old term, “go begging”.



So in the Northern hemisphere, the agricultural production will be so low this year as to escalate food prices and for the price escalation will give us a taste us of what is to come as the Grand Solar Minimum bites between now and 2030.



The conditions experienced under the “Little Ice Age” that occurred from 1280 to 1850 should now inform the actions of any competent Minister of Climate Change. I leave you to judge which scientists got it right, the ones warning of a mini ice age in 1970-75 (after the global temperature cooled for 35 years at the same time the level of atmospheric CO2 rose) or the frauds at the UN IPCC with their repetitive alarmist attempts to extort money issuing threat after threat from 1989 to 2019? The IPCC reports are not worth the paper they were written on or the tears of the innocent children they distressed.



Shame on you Minister!



 **There is no official news of this looming global food shortage yet but the cascade of informal news from farmers and blog sites should be enough to help you realise that your coalition has no hope of re-election, if you continue to lie to the public about causes of climate change.**



Unfortunately, the Northern growing seasons began to shorten in 2017 then again in 2018 and this year disastrously so. This is not part of weather phenomenon because this is a climate shift. If you ask NASA they will explain what the effects of a Grand Solar Minimum have been and will be. NASA and NOAA know and accept that it is arriving because they monitor the space weather which drives the terrestrial climate – you yourself can go look at the data on [www.spaceweather.com](http://www.spaceweather.com/). It is public for all to see. These cyclic “Grand Solar Minimums” come every 200 years and the current one is due following on from the end of the Dalton Minimum, almost 200 years ago.



Perhaps someone will be kind enough to tell you what caused what is known as the “modern warm period”. It isn’t man. It isn’t CO2. It is the sun (as always). The eleven-year solar cycles of the 20th century include the most active cycles in over 4,000 years. That is a credible cause, not like your recreation of mankind’s “Original Sin”.



All your misinformed subjects can now watch as the new “Eddy Minimum” rolls in, over the top of your hopes and dreams. I will attach my summary of the truth above in Word documents…a one page summary of the difference between your fraud and reality, and one page of empirical satellite temperature data for just the last 40 years.



This one hour video below provides the historical context…you may after all wish to read and learn…your call.



These videos below provide a meandering trip through your worst cold climate crop loss nightmares. Soon the official data will be in and fudged in an attempt to suit the venal politicians and yet impossible to conceal. But this is enough to help you prepare your own spin for why sugar, flour, rice, barley and all other imported food staples are going to be considerably more expensive in New Zealand by this time next year…



and



and



and



and



and



and



and



Because the globalist billionaires actively supporting your fraud slant all the news reports in favour of global warming narrative we don’t get easy access to the reports about the real weather or the real cropping disasters happening each day. So while your staff may express annoyance at having to wade through the sometimes relevant and sometimes irrelevant or inaccurate data in the above links to get at the truth, I am doing so on a far larger scale and would lack a true perspective if I didn’t consider every article to be suspect. This is because I am a true sceptic, no matter what the source I am looking at is.



As a footnote, when they happen, Grand Solar Minimums are said to first become apparent in places like Iceland, Baffin Island and Greenland. I wonder if that is why I have observed a build-up of the Greenland ice sheet of about a cumulative 1.2 trillion tonnes following the end of the three melt seasons 2017, 2018 and 2019 (from…source Royal Danish Meteorological Institute).



Take a look at this all-time hot summer in Iceland…oops,



Unsurprisingly, the snow on Baffin Island in October 2019 was the heaviest ever recorded…so go figure!



The global average hasn’t yet dropped enough to convince me I won’t need to sue, but all the indicators from previous Grand Solar Minimums are stacking up.



Isn’t it time to ask some penetrating questions of your science advisers before it is too late? I won’t hold my breath so I will make a start on preparing the necessary affidavits early in 2020.



Yours sincerely

Political predictions are notoriously difficult; predicting a Biden White House’s trade policy is even more so. In general, supporters of open trade and the global trading system should prepare for an improvement in U.S. trade policy over the one advanced by President Trump since 2017, but it’s far from certain that the difference will be as big as hoped.



This tepid conclusion stems not from my own timidity or ignorance (well, not entirely at least), but instead from two key facts. First, Biden’s campaign team—much like the Democratic Party itself these days—is conflicted on trade: some senior advisers have long parroted labor union views on protectionism and industrial policy, while others preach from the Democrats’ urban, “globalist,” and increasingly suburban side of the aisle. Who will “win” this debate in a future Biden transition team is anyone’s guess.



Second, although Biden’s initial campaign proposals are heavy on economic nationalism and light on trade liberalization or agreements, “presidential campaign policies” do not necessarily become “White House policies”—a fact for most policy areas, but _especially_ for trade policy. This is because, although most Americans support open trade, they don’t know or care much about (and thus vote on) the issue, and of the few who _do_ care, the most intense and politically‐​valuable voters—say, former union members in Wisconsin—are on usually the protectionist side. Thus, campaigning politicians have long viewed protectionist promises as a way to win swing state votes with little risk of losing voters on the other side of the issue. That doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll govern that way. See, for example, President Obama’s quick dismissal of candidate Obama’s promise to renegotiate NAFTA.



At the same time, recent history does tell us that some of these protectionist promises often _do_ become White House policy and even law. While Obama sidelined his NAFTA promises, he did chart a moderately nationalist course during his first term—for example, implementing Buy American provisions in the 2009 stimulus bill; sidelining Bush‐​eras free trade agreements with Panama, Colombia, and Korea (while not pursuing any new deals either); banning Mexican trucks on U.S. roads; and imposing “special safeguard” tariffs on Chinese tires. (He also campaigned on economic nationalism in 2012.) Even stalwart free traders like George W. Bush implemented steel tariffs and a massive farm bill that aggravated U.S. trading partners and stymied multilateral trade negotiations. Thus, contrary to the popular narrative among many “new thinkers” on the right and left, most presidents have not been naïve globalists but instead governed pragmatically on trade, balancing domestic political interests with commercial, foreign policy, and macroeconomic ones.



Supporters of open trade and the global trading system should prepare for an improvement in U.S. trade policy over the one advanced by President Trump since 2017, but it’s far from certain that the difference will be as big as hoped. 



Biden’s trade policy would doubtless feature a similar balance, but its precise tilt is obscured by the aforementioned uncertainties. Nevertheless, given Biden’s own history of both supporting and opposing trade liberalization, his recent policy proposals, and the fact that the Democratic Party leadership tends to side with the “old school” unionist view of trade, we can generally assume that Biden will be less openly hostile to foreign trade as President Trump, but shouldn’t be expected to usher in a new era of pro‐​trade policies. Instead, we should expect some improvement, some stasis, and maybe even some deterioration.



 **Where Biden Will Most Likely be Better**



Joe Biden’s record, recent campaign statements, and, quite frankly, essential not‐​Trump‐​ness indicate we could see a substantial improvement in four key trade policy areas. First, a President Biden would very likely re‐​engage in negotiations at the World Trade Organization (instead of threatening to withdraw every few weeks) and remove the United States’s hold on Appellate Body appointments—a Trump administration move that has crippled the much‐​heralded (and quite successful) WTO’s dispute settlement system and annoyed most of our closest trading partners. (Without an Appellate Body, WTO members can appeal adverse panel decisions “into the void” where they’ll remain incomplete until the AB is reconstituted, thus discouraging WTO disputes, encouraging unilateral retaliation, and injecting even more uncertainty into the trading system.)



WTO negotiations have struggled in recent years (and certainly not only because of Trump), but releasing the Appellate Body block and simply changing the United States’ tone and posture should help advance U.S. trade objectives—inside and outside the organization.



Speaking of outside, it’s also quite likely that the Biden administration would dramatically improve U.S. trade relations with close allies like the EU and Canada, which have deteriorated since 2016 because of Trump’s inexplicable obsession with bilateral trade balances and irrational use of “national security” tariffs on imports from these countries. Disagreements will undoubtedly continue, but I’d expect the aforementioned tariffs (and tariff threats) to quietly disappear and the Biden administration to look to work with these countries on China and other key issues ( _e.g._ , multilateral negotiations on industrial subsidies and climate change).



I would also expect the United States to once again engage with the EU on a trade agreement of some kind, though likely more limited in scope than traditional U.S. free trade agreements in order to avoid some of the problems, such as agricultural market access, that stymied the Obama administration’s Trans‐​Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (“TTIP”). If the Biden administration decides not to re‐​enter the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (more on that below), then completing the Trump administration’s partial deal with Japan could also be in the offing.



Finally, we should expect a significant improvement in U.S. treatment of developing countries through unilateral “preference programs” like the Generalized System of Preferences, which alleviates duties on imports from poor countries and which the Trump administration has curtailed in an unsuccessful attempt to bully countries like India and Thailand into doing what we want. These programs have long enjoyed bipartisan support and benefit U.S. consumers in addition to helping developing economies.. It’s likely that they resume that position.



 **Where Biden Will Probably be the Same**



The aforementioned changes should bring about a tangible improvement in overall U.S. trade policy and international relations more broadly, and they should eliminate some of the uncertainty that has hindered the U.S. economy in recent years. That may, however, be where the improvements end. On China, for example, it seems highly unlikely that Biden will eliminate Trump’s tariffs on more than $300 billion in annual Chinese imports due to recent Chinese government transgressions, an increasingly hawkish political consensus in Washington, and Biden’s own need to avoid proving Trump and Republicans right that he is “soft” on China. (As noted above, however, he’ll wisely add multilateral pressure to the United States’ China arsenal.)



I’d also expect little to no changes to U.S. trade remedy (anti‐​dumping and countervailing duty) policies, which—despite their numerous flaws—have long enjoyed bi‐​partisan support. Indeed, Biden has even subtly endorsed continuing the Trump administration’s ill‐​advised attempt to use the U.S. countervailing duty law to target other nations’ (not just China’s) currency policies. 



Similar stasis may occur with respect to new U.S. trade agreements with developing countries, though for different reasons: Whereas Trump’s team couldn’t seal these deals due to their single minded focus on bilateral trade in goods and “unfairness” (whatever that means) more broadly, Biden’s team may find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to convince a developing country to agree to the types of onerous labor and environmental rules that his campaign has proposed (and that congressional Democrats added to the USMCA). Indeed, Biden’s team has already stated that they won’t prioritize new FTAs, even as the EU and others race ahead to give their companies that advantage in key foreign markets. 



**Where Biden Might Actually Be Worse**



In case the previous section didn’t depress you enough, let’s next examine the trade policy areas where a Biden administration might actually be worse. Most notable is Biden’s promise to impose carbon tariffs (aka a “carbon adjustment fee against countries that are failing to meet their climate and environmental obligations”)—something Elizabeth Warren’s campaign also proposed and an increasingly common feature of mainstream Democratic Party climate policy. In theory, a carbon tariff imposed in concert with a domestic carbon tax—essentially applying to imports the same tax that domestic goods face—is relatively uncontroversial (though reasonable minds can differ on the efficacy and impact of such policies). In practice, however, there is a serious risk that—given the difficulty of passing a domestic carbon tax in the United States, the relative ease of imposing tariffs without Congress (thanks, President Trump), and the long history of domestic industries turning well‐​meaning regulatory policies into straight‐​up protectionism –Biden’s climate plan becomes less about the environment and more about insulating political favorites from fair international competition. (For those who doubt this risk, I invite you to check out the EU or past attempts to add such measures to U.S. legislation.)



Another major risk lies in Biden’s plans to “revive” U.S. manufacturing through protectionist Buy American mandates and supply chain “repatriation” efforts. Though the Trump administration also supports such policies, they’ve been stymied by a lack of congressional support and thus relegated to tinkering at the margins of current law. If political trends continue, however, President Biden might not face similar obstacles and instead could see a Democratic Congress willing and eager to pass a major 2021 stimulus bill that, like the one 12 years earlier, was chock full of protectionist industrial policy.



 **What We Just Don’t Know**



Even with the aforementioned disclaimer about the uncertainty of a Biden administration’s trade plans, there are two important areas that are especially opaque. First is the question of the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership, which Trump abandoned in early 2019. The agreement has since entered into force without the United States as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Likely because of progressive opposition and pressure, Biden’s team has said he won’t prioritize re‐​entering CPTPP, but the economic and geopolitical benefits of doing so—particularly given the urgent need to counterbalance China’s influence in the AsiaPac region and the relative ease of rejoining the deal—have led many to forecast that a President Biden would experience a post‐​election conversion, “fix” CPTPP’s “problems,” and then work to re‐​join as soon as possible. Count me among those forecasters, though Biden’s about‐​face might not occur until later in 2021.



The second area of uncertainty relates to President Trump’s expansive use of unilateral trade measures—in particular Section 232 “national security” tariffs and Section 301 actions, which previous presidents avoided due to their problematic economic, legal, and geopolitical consequences but have become a favorite tool of President Trump, with little to no congressional or court pushback. Now that this genie is out of the bottle, would a President Biden, concerned with WTO and other international relations, try to stuff it back in, or would the measures’ potential (especially the lack of a congressional check on their use) just be too tempting, particularly for the aforementioned carbon tariffs? We shall see.



Despite these problems and uncertainties, it’s still relatively safe to assume that the improvements in U.S. relations with the WTO and close allies, as well as the departure of bizarre, flat‐​earther economic priorities, would ensure that the Biden administration’s trade policies constitute an improvement over President Trump’s. Given the myriad failures of “America First” trade policy, however, that’s a very low bar to hurdle—and it’s far from clear that President Biden would clear it by much.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA survey conducted by the German Emnid polling institute found that 79% of Germans reject the installation of wind turbines in forests. That’s the result of a survey commissioned by the Deutschen Wildtier Stiftung (German Wildlife Foundation). 

Not only are there plans to disfigure and destroy forest regions in Germany, it is already a sad reality in Vermont (New England). Here an aerial photo of a portion of the Lowell Mountain wind park shows how the once natural mountain was blasted with dynamite and forests cleared and industrialized. Photo: courtesy of Daniel F.
When asked if they agreed with the statement: “For the construction of more wind energy, in general no forest areas should disappear or be cut down.”, 79 percent replied with: “I agree!” Only 11% agreed with: “for additional wind parks also forest areas should be cleared away or cut down.” The Emnid Institute survey also determined that the public’s interest in the issue of wind parks in forests is very high. Only 8% said that the issue did not interest them.
For the Deutsche Wildtier Stiftung, the Emind results prove that a large majority of the German population reject wind parks in forests. “Wind power at any cost must not be the result of the Engergiewende,” emphasized Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, Chairman of the German Wildlife Foundation. “The citizens of Germany do not want forests to become the victims of a one-dimensional climate policy.“ People think it is important to keep forests and biodiversity intact. Even 65% of those responding said: “In the case of any doubt, the construction of wind turbines must yield to the protection of birds and other animals”.
The thoughtless construction of wind energy in the forest is a serious threat. “Opening up forests to allow wind parks leads to the endangerment of rare species,” Prof. Dr. Vahrenholt criticized. Every year in Germany up to 240,000 bats are killed by wind turbine rotors. Although they are able to dodge the moving rotors, the negative pressure in the rotor’s wake causes the bats’ lungs to burst. Most of the domestic bats are on the endangered species list.
Bird species like the rare lesser spotted eagle, the red kite and the black stork are especially sensitive to turbines. For example half of the breeding population of the black stork disappeared in just 6 years at the Vogelsberg site in the state of Hesse after 125 wind turbines were constructed. Many predatory birds die in collisions with rotors.
“So far only the state of Saxony Anhalt has opted not to allow wind parks in forests,” says Prof. Vahrenholt. In German states with large forest areas, such as Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, North Rhine Westphalia, Hesse and Brandenburg, there are already decrees to allow the construction of wind parks despite regional resistance to them,” said Vahrenholt.
Moreover Emnid found that among those surveyed, wind energy in forests is not a matter of personal preference, but one of a greater good – namely forest as a space for life. On the question: “Would you feel disturbed about wind turbines in the forest?”, 43% answered with “yes”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt Facebook Jean-Francois Garlépy, a Duke University researcher, expresses how he has become fed up with the inner workings of western academia and is resigning. Hat-tip: reader Magnum.
He writes:
This week, I resigned from my position at Duke University with no intent to solicit employment in state-funded academic research positions in any foreseeable future. Many reasons have motivated this choice, starting with personal ones: I will soon be a father and want to be spending time with my son at home.
Other reasons have to do with research academia itself. Throughout the years, I have been discovering more and more of the inner workings of academia and how modern scientific research is done and I have acquired a certain degree of discouragement in face of what appears to be an abandonment by my research community of the search for knowledge. I found scientists to be more preoccupied by their own survival in a very competitive research environment than by the development of a true understanding of the world.
By creating a highly-competitive environment that relies on the selection of researchers based on their “scientific productivity,” as it is referred to, we have populated the scientific community with what I like to call “chickens with no head,” that is, researchers who can produce multiple scientific articles per year, none of which with any particularly important impact on our understanding of the world. Because of this…”

He adds:
The fact that the peer-review system does not care about looking at the data is not in any way reassuring about this concern. Furthermore, a large portion of the time of a scientist is spent on frivolous endeavors such as submitting a grant request to 5-10 agencies in the hope that one of them will accept. Finally, our scientific publication system has become so corrupted that it is almost impossible to get a scientific article published in an important journal without talking one-on-one with the editor before submitting the article.”
Later on he writes:
My most important scientific articles were accepted in major journals because the editors had a favorable prejudice toward me or my co-authors, …”
Also:
The scientific publication system portrays itself as a strict system for the evaluation of the importance of individual scientific contributions to knowledge, but anyone who has participated to this system and became good at it knows that the true factors that influence the publication of a scientific work have to do with social networking and, in many cases, straight-out corruption.”

"**Did Facebook go easy on hate speech by an Indian lawmaker belonging to the governing BJP to protect its interests in its biggest market? A Wall Street Journal report, based on interviews with current and former Facebook employees, suggests so, and it prompted immediate calls for an investigation. Soutik Biswas reports on the aftermath.**
In its report, the WSJ said Facebook deleted some hateful anti-Muslim posts by T Raja Singh, a lawmaker from India's southern Telangana state only after the paper asked about them.
The paper reported that Facebook employees had decided in March that Mr Singh's post violated the company's hate speech rules and qualified as dangerous. But the firm's top public policy executive in India, Ankhi Das, opposed applying ""hate speech rules to Mr Singh and at least three other Hindu nationalist individuals and groups flagged internally for promoting or participating in the violence"".
Ms Das, the paper said, told employees that ""punishing violations by politicians from Mr Modi's party would damage the company's business prospects in the country"".
The WSJ report has sparked calls by opposition MPs for investigations into Facebook's conduct in India.
The leader of the main opposition Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, led the charge. He alleged that the BJP, and its ideological fountainhead, RSS, were ""controlling"" Facebook in India.
India's information technology minister Ravi Shankar promptly responded. He alluded to his previous remarks in 2018 about ""numerous reports"" of Congress involvement with Cambridge Analytica and asking Mr Gandhi to ""explain"" the company's role in his social media outreach. (That year India had taken down the local website of Cambridge Analytica following allegations the company used personal data of 50 million Facebook members to influence the US presidential elections.)
With more than 340 million users, India is Facebook's biggest market. In April Facebook announced it was investing $5.7bn (Â£4.6bn) in cut-price Indian mobile internet company Reliance Jio, owned by the country's richest person Mukesh Ambani. This would give Facebook a major foothold in India, where its WhatsApp chat service has 400m users and is about to launch a payments service.
I reached out to Facebook with a list of detailed questions. I asked why Facebook had not taken down Mr Singh's posts earlier, what it did with the lawmaker's account, and how many pages had been taken down and accounts suspended in India for hate speech.
""We prohibit hate speech and content that incites violence and we enforce these policies globally without regard to anyone's political position or party affiliation. While we know there is more to do, we're making progress on enforcement and conduct regular audits of our process to ensure fairness and accuracy,"" a Facebook spokesperson replied in an email response. The firm did not provide any more details.
Separately, Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesman, acknowledged to WSJ that Ankhi Das had ""raised concerns about the political fallout that would result from designating Mr Singh a dangerous individual, but said her opposition wasn't the sole factor in the company's decision to let Mr Singh on the platform"". Mr Stone told me he had nothing more to add.
The BJP lawmaker T Raja Singh said his official page on Facebook with 300,000 followers was ""hacked and deleted"" in 2018 and he had complained about it to the local cyber crime detectives. ""I don't know whether it was misused,"" he told me.
He said Facebook might have recently taken down pages floated by his followers and containing inflammatory content. He said his followers might have ""uploaded hate speech"" on these pages.
""Sometimes I go to public meetings and talk in style. My followers might have uploaded those videos"", Mr Singh, the sole BJP legislator in the 119-member elected Telangana state assembly said. Mr Stone told WSJ that Facebook is still considering whether it will ban the legislator.
When I asked him why he would post such incendiary content Mr Singh said: ""There are a lot of anti-socials in my area. I counter them in their language, sometimes it is communal"". He said his Instagram account, which was still active, was not being operated by him.
This is not the first time allegations have been raised that Facebook is favouring the governing party.
A series of articles by journalists Cyril Sam and Paranjoy Guha Thakurta in 2018, wrote about the social media platform's ""dominant position in India with more than a little help from friends of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP"", among other things. (The articles also looked at the Congress party's own ""relations with Facebook"".)
The Congress party's chief of data analytics, Praveen Chakravarty, says he met senior Facebook officials in the US and India in 2018 and ""discussed the issue of bias and partisanship of their India leadership team"" and denying to accept party advertisements relating to a controversial fighter jet deal by the government. ""I was told that it will be looked into but nothing happened,"" he says.
Last year, Derek O'Brien, a lawmaker belonging to the opposition Trinamul Congress party, raised the issue in the parliament. ""Facebook censors anti-BJP news. Its algorithm censors anti-BJP news,"" Mr O'Brien said in a short speech. When I reached out to him at the weekend, Mr O'Brien said: ""There are other important issues to raise in the parliament, but this will not go unnoticed.""
Shashi Tharoor, a prominent Congress MP who heads a parliamentary committee on information technology, says he believes the ""recent revelations raise questions that require explanation"".
""The subject is serious because of Facebook's extensive reach in India and the potential for hate speech to incite violence and other unlawful behaviour. How worrying this is to be determined after a hearing process is concluded, not on the basis of media reports,"" he told me.
Chinmayi Arun, a fellow at the Information Society Project at Yale Law School, says it is difficult to assess Facebook's record without access to the company's data in India.
""There are contexts in which they have reacted swiftly or improved their policies based on feedback. But the system for implementation is opaque and one is unlikely to hear about the sort of incident that the WSJ reported unless insiders share information only available to Facebook,"" Ms Arun told me.
In its latest biannual Community Standards Enforcement Report, Facebook said it had taken action against more than 20 million pieces of hate speech content that had violated its community standards between January and March. But in its biggest market, many say the social media behemoth needs to do more."
"**US President Donald Trump's re-election campaign is running hundreds of Facebook advertisements pushing an unfounded conspiracy theory that Joe Biden cheated during the first US presidential debate.**
The adverts show the Democratic Party challenger with an earpiece, and say that he refused to have his ears checked for devices prior to the debate.
The Biden campaign rejected the claims.
The Trump campaign adverts ask: ""Why won't Sleepy Joe commit to an ear test?"" and ""Who is in Joe's ear?""
Accusations that presidential candidates have received debate help via hidden hearing devices are familiar, albeit unproven. Such allegations have been levelled against both Republican and Democratic candidates in the past.
Prior to Tuesday's debate, the rumour about Mr Biden's supposed earpiece was circulating on several social networks, and was being promoted by the Trump campaign.
The advertising campaign was launched after the debate, and also promotes two other baseless but widely shared rumours about Mr Biden. One suggested he asked for breaks during the debate, and another accused him of refusing a ""drug test"".
The photo featured in the advert is not from Tuesday's debate. It was first shared online in September 2019.
In a number of the adverts, it has been doctored to show Mr Biden wearing wireless Apple headphones. This was not the case in the original image. Some versions circle the ear featuring the headphone.
By Wednesday evening, there were at least 15 different versions of the advert, and according to Facebook's Ad Library, they had reached at least 10 million users.
Facebook has pledged to label posts containing voting misinformation and point users towards accurate information ahead of the election. However its policy does not involve fact-checking political speech, including in advertisements.
The company declined to comment about the latest Trump ad campaign.
Hours before the debate, the claims went viral on Facebook and YouTube.
Identical memes were pushed by a number of popular Facebook pages with names such as US Conservative and Unhinged Left. They claimed ""Joe Biden should be inspected for a hidden earpiece as well as submit to a drug test before the debate"".
These memes are subject to fact-checks - and some have had warning labels applied to them on Facebook.
The claims were picked up by Fox News and other conservative news outlets.
They were further amplified by supporters of QAnon, an unfounded a conspiracy theory that claims President Trump is fighting a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles.
Those who believe in QAnon are known for promoting political disinformation on social media which targets opponents of the president. They shared close-up pictures of Mr Biden's ears, alleging a listening device was visible.
During the debate, some also shared photos of a fold in Mr Biden's shirt, claiming it was caused by a wire, and of a supposed device on his wrist, where he wears a rosary in memory of his late son Beau.
Conspiracy theories about secret listening devices have been recycled in presidential election campaigns for the past two decades.
Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton faced similar unfounded claims ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
In 2004, rumours circulated among left-wing sites and blogs that President George W Bush was being aided by a secret earpiece.
None of those allegations were found to be true.
Even if a candidate did wear an earpiece, any advantage would be questionable. As TV and radio presenters can attest, listening to someone while simultaneously talking during the back-and-forth of a live event is a difficult skill to master."

9th International Conference on Climate Change
July 7 – 9 — Las Vegas, Nevada
Includes the Findings of the New Report by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) Climate Change Reconsidered II

A message from S. Fred Singer, PhD
Chairman, Science & Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
We are excited to be once again co-sponsoring an International Conference on Climate Change ICCC-9 will be the ninth such assembly of nearly 1000 skeptics from all over the world These climate realists do not doubt the existence of climate change itself, but are skeptical of the simple-minded proposal to stop the climate from changing — or even to slow the process significantly — by replacing coal and oil to generate electric power and run cars with expensive and intermittent wind and solar energy …
Scientific data demonstrate convincingly that global temperatures have not risen for the past 15 or more years in spite of the measured ten percent rise in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Yet politicians and many scientists influenced by politics continue to ignore the overwhelming importance of natural causes of global warming and cooling; they –and not skeptical scientists — are the real deniers, The observed facts will always win out over artificial manmade theoretical models attempting to simulate the real climate on computers.
On behalf of the board of directors of SEPP, I congratulate The Heartland Institute for organizing ICCC-9 and for its many important publications about climate change – especially the series of reports “Climate Change Reconsidered” written by scientists of the Non-governmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) , available at www.NIPCCreport.org. We also thank the Chinese Academy of Sciences for translating and publishing some of these reports.

SEPP’S APRIL FOOLS AWARD
THE JACKSON
The nominations and voting has ended. The results will be announced at the conference of Doctors for Disaster Preparedness in July.
###################################################
THIS WEEK:
By Ken Haapala, Executive Vice President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
Supreme Court: On June 23, the US Supreme Court (SCOTUS) rendered its decision on the controversial lawsuit known as Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The litigation is a result of numerous groups filing litigation against the EPA for its scientifically questionable finding that human carbon dioxide emissions endanger human health and welfare (Endangerment Finding). There were three separate opinions expressed in the 9-0 Court’s decision with some justices concurring in part and opposing in other parts, chiefly because it did not go far enough in expanding EPA power; and other justices concurring in part and opposing in other parts, chiefly that the decision gave the EPA too much power. There are probably as many opinions as to the meaning of the Supreme Court’s holding and the eventual results as there we groups supporting or objecting to the EPA finding.
According to the Supreme Court Blog: “The Clean Air Act neither compels nor permits the Environmental Protection Agency to adopt an interpretation of the Clean Air Act requiring a stationary source of pollution to obtain a “Prevention of Significant Deterioration” or Title V permit on the sole basis of its potential greenhouse-gas emission. However, EPA reasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act to require sources that would need permits based on their emission of chemical pollutants to comply with “best available control technology” for greenhouse gases.”
The scope of the holding is limited. Early in the process the US Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia made it clear it would not permit questioning of the EPA science. Subsequently, during the oral arguments the Supreme Court stated that the science will not be an issue.
The Court’s decision limited the power of the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, chiefly carbon dioxide (CO2), only for those stationary sources for which it has power to regulate other emissions such as sulfur dioxide. It prevented the EPA from modifying clear regulations (tailoring) to fit the EPA purposes now or contemplated in the future. Under the prevention of significant deterioration section of the Clean Air Act, the EPA has the power regulate emissions ranging from 100 to 250 tons annually. Strict enforcement of the regulations would require the EPA to regulate millions of establishments that omit no traditional pollutants, including schools, hospitals, apartment buildings, etc. The EPA attempted to modify the regulations to avoid this strict requirement for now, but to perhaps tighten regulations in the future. The court denied this flexibility to the EPA. To summarize, the EPA has the power to regulate GHG emissions from major industries, but not from facilities that are not already regulated. Separate regulations give the EPA power to regulate emissions from motor vehicles.
No doubt, an issue that will be litigated in the future is the use of section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, which EPA is using to regulate carbon dioxide from power plants. The majority opinion specified in a footnote that the opinion does not decide whether the provision EPA has used for its new and existing power plant rules is “ill-suited to accommodating greenhouse gases.” Thus, the opinion defined the battleground for future litigation.
Given the nature of the EPA to interpret science as it sees fit, it will take an act of Congress, or a court willing to accept challenges to EPA science (unlikely), before the public is adequately protected from the regulatory zeal of the EPA.
As stated in the February 1 TWTW, in its questionable finding that carbon dioxide emissions endanger public health and welfare, the EPA claimed its findings are supported by science and cited three lines of evidence.
1.) EPA claims a distinct human fingerprint — a hot spot in the atmosphere centered over the tropics at about 10 kilometers (33,000 feet). This hot spot may not exist. Satellites and weather balloons have failed to find it.
2.) EPA claims late 20th century surface global warming was unprecedented and dangerous. It was not. A similar warming occurred in the early 20th century, which was not associated with carbon dioxide. The late 20th century surface warming stopped over 16 years ago.
3.) EPA claims climate models are reliable. Climate models failed to predict that global warming would stop and greatly exaggerate the warming over the past 30 plus years.
The EPA finding that carbon dioxide endangers human health and welfare is based on failing science and sub-prime climate models that are failing.
The EPA, and many of its supporters, claim that the Court’s decision protects the public from increased heart attacks, asthma attacks, etc. Yet, the EPA refuses to reveal the scientific basis for these claims to Congress and the public.
To further challenge the Administration’s claims, the 2010 claim by Gavin Schmidt, the new head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies [GISS], and others in that agency, that atmospheric CO2 is the principal control knob governing Earth’s temperature is failing as rapidly as EPA’s science is failing. http://www.sciencemag.org/content/330/6002/356

******************
Risky Business: Several high-profile politicians and former government officials as well as the Executive Chairman of Cargill have signed on a report by the Risky Business Project. Former Secretary of State George Shultz is a well-known Republican on the committee. The co-chairs of the group are former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Secretary of the Treasury and Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, and Democratic Party contributor Thomas Steyer, who opposes the expanded Keystone Pipeline and promised the Democratic Party $100 million for the upcoming elections.
The Title of the report: “Risky Business: The Economic Risks of Climate Change in the United Sates – A Climate Risk Assessment for the United Sates” sounds impressive. However, the quality of the research is summed up in the opening paragraph. “Our research combines peer-reviewed climate projections through the year 2100 with empirically derived estimates of the impact of projected changes in temperature, precipitation, sea levels, and storm activity on the U.S. economy.” In short, “Risky Business” is a continuation of the drum-beat of climate alarmism found in the Summary for Policymakers of Physical Science volume of UN the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR-5). The alarmism was exaggerated in the recent US National Climate Assessment (NCA), signed by President Obama’s scientist, John Holdren, calling into question the scientific rigor endorsed by this Administration.
As with the NCA, “Risky Business” assumes that the projections some 90 years hence by un-validated climate models are reliable and that the global models can be used to project regional physical climate changes 90 years hence. The approach is logically and scientifically absurd. “Risky Business” is one more demonstration that scientific ignorance is not limited by political party.
It is amusing to speculate what will happen 10 years hence, if executives of businesses make decisions, costly to the shareholders, based on speculative climate models, and the climate models turn out to be very wrong, as it appears they are by projecting temperature increases that are increasingly diverging from observations. Basing decisions on the unsubstantiated claims in “Risky Business” could turn out to be very risky. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy.
******************
BASIC Countries: The issue regarding Greenpeace India continues to fester. The country’s Intelligence bureau submitted a report all but calling Greenpeace anti-national and a threat to national energy security. Based on reports, Greenpeace India is partially financed by Western environmental interests. So are other Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) in India. The reports state that Greenpeace India opposes coal-fired power plants, nuclear power, and genetically modified (GM) crops. The international NOGs are working to prevent funding of coal-fired power plants by the World Bank.
Speaking at a UN conference on sustainable development, Forests and Climate change minister Prakash Javadekar stated: “Poverty eradication…must remain the central and overarching objective of the SDGs (sustainable development goals) and the post-2015 development agenda,” It is increasing clear that the BASIC countries are choosing eradication of poverty over the ill-defined concepts such as sustainable development pushed by the UN and Western NGOs. As such, the BASIC countries are doing as service for humanity, including those living in developed countries. The BASIC countries are Brazil, South Africa (Africa, South) India and China. See links under Energy Issues – Non-US and Environmental Industry.
******************
Measurement Issues: A quick squabble broke-out among several independent blogs on the issue on whether or not the adjustments to the historic temperatures, which show a cooling of the past, are deliberate by the agencies reporting this temperatures. The specific instance was a press release by NOAA (the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) that May 2014 was the hottest May for global temperatures since records began in 1880. The press release was quickly rebuked in the blogs (including using NOAA’s own data) but the motivation issue lingered. In Climate Etc., Judith Curry well-summarized the issue and observed about the independent blogs involved: “However, the main point is that this group is rapidly self-correcting – the self-correcting function in the skeptical technical blogosphere seems to be more effective (and certainly faster) than for establishment climate science.” [Boldface added.]
The issue is a sensitive one to this author. Having long-served in many capacities, including President, in the oldest scientific society formed in Washington, an all-volunteer group, this author recognizes the importance of tradition and assuring that historic record-keeping is accurate. Many of the early members of this scientific society were important to establishing a nation-wide weather (climate) record. It is disturbing that this record may have been altered, whether or not deliberately. Further, NOAA was not transparent in its press release, which did not explain the sparseness of the world-wide record going back to 1880. See links under Seeking a Common Ground and Measurement Issues.
******************
Irrigation: A recent paper, based on models, supposedly showed that irrigation lowers land-surface temperatures. Empirical work by others, including John Christy, et al., show that irrigating arid and semi-arid regions do change temperatures. By adding water, evaporation produces water vapor (the main greenhouse gas). The effect is a decrease in day-time highs and an increase in night-time lows by a greater amount with a net effect of an increase in average daily temperatures. Direct empirical measurements are more important in understanding climate impacts of human activities than model simulations. See links under Changing Earth.
******************
Model Issues: In a post on Climate Etc., Judith Curry asks the thought-provoking question: are the General Circulation Models the best tools for studying climate change. What is critical is separating the human and natural influences. It is becoming increasingly evident that the establishment climate science community has failed to do so.
Further, our ability to mathematically model far exceeds our ability measure. The first step would be an inventory of those things we can measure both globally or regionally, and both historically and currently. From these we can begin to identify those phenomena we need to measure and begin to distinguish between natural influences and human influences. See links under Model Issues.
******************
Number of the Week: From 36% to 25% in 10 years. According to a June, 2014 report by the Energy Information Agency (EIA) the percentage of sales of fossil fuels produced from Federal and Indian Lands (including offshore) fell from 36% of total US production in 2003 to 25% of total production in 2013. The Obama Administration is not entirely responsible for this decline. Some of the decline can be attributed to the administration’s allies who previously stopped oil drilling activities in Alaska and are preventing construction of new coal-fired power plants. Defenders of the administration claim that increases in production on state-owned and private lands distort these number. But that excuse does not explain the declines in actual production.

"**Video-sharing site TikTok is struggling to take down clips showing a man killing himself.**
The footage, which has been circulating on the platform for several days, originated on Facebook and has also been shared on Twitter and Instagram.
TikTok is hugely popular with young people - and many have reported coming across the video and being traumatised by the content.
The app said it would ban accounts repeatedly uploading clips.
""Our systems have been automatically detecting and flagging these clips for violating our policies against content that displays, praises, glorifies, or promotes suicide,"" a representative said.
""We appreciate our community members who've reported content and warned others against watching, engaging or sharing such videos on any platform, out of respect for the person and their family.""
Facebook told BBC News: ""We removed the original video from Facebook last month, on the day it was streamed, and have used automation technology to remove copies and uploads since that time.
""Our thoughts remain with Ronnie's family and friends during this difficult time.""
On Monday, Brenda's 14-year-old daughter came running down the stairs. She was covering her mouth, crying and saying she was going to be sick.
""She was in such a state, shaking like a leaf and properly sobbing,"" Brenda, who lives near Edinburgh, told the BBC.
""I have never seen her that distressed. It was horrific and took ages to get the words out of her.""
Brenda explained that her daughter had seen the suicide video after it appeared within the recommended clips of TikTok's For You section.
""She was scrolling through songs and funny videos when a bearded man in a white shirt appears behind a desk,"" the mother recalled, saying shortly after he was seen to kill himself.
""I have heard about trolling and nasty things but this tops it all. I phoned the police but they reminded me that it is not their job to police the internet.
""My daughter was in a state of shock, still is in a state of shock and this could stay with her for months.""
Since the incident, she added, her daughter had slept with the light on and kept reliving the images she had seen. She added that her daughter felt scared to leave the house and was missing a day of school as a result.
It is reported that some users are sharing the video, disguised behind images of kittens or other content. Others have put together their own videos warning about the content and urging people to delete it.
TikTok's algorithms often recommend content from people not directly followed by a user.
Several people have streamed their suicides on Facebook Live since its 2015 launch.
Facebook, which owns Instagram, has also faced criticism that the platform shares content sensationalising self-harm and suicide.
After the death of Molly Russell, in 2017, her father said Instagram had ""helped kill his daughter"".

Don’t you just love those fresh-faced baby politicians with their progressive ‘woke’ ideas? There we were, thinking that investments should be based on what makes the most money, but then they come along to educate us that profit is not as important as being seen to be setting an example to the rest of New Zealand and indeed the world.



Profit is so old school. Yes dear readers, we need to lead the way to the New [Venezuela ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/04/the-past-was-a-different-country-mostly-venezuela/)as explained by Chloe Swarbrick on behalf of the Green Party in the below Press Release.



As the largest publicly owned investor in New Zealand, the ACC board should **divest from fossil fuels** , demonstrating our leadership role on climate change, Green Party MP Chlöe Swarbrick said today.



“As the largest publicly owned investor, ACC have accepted they have huge influence in the market, including a billion dollars invested in fossil fuels.



“New Zealanders **would be shocked to learn** that a publicly owned investor is banking on the climate crisis.



“It’s entirely within the ACC Board’s mandate to decide to end such investment on ethical grounds, as they did with tobacco in 2006.



“If not, **the Government should end this investment in fossil fuels through a direction** under the Crown Entities Act.



“The Green Party is focused on ensuring New Zealand **retains its leadership role** in driving and inspiring action to reduce emissions and protect our climate for future generations.



“We’ve seen a groundswell of public support, and with our [Zero Carbon Act ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/a-national-mp-on-national-voting-for-the-zero-carbon-bill/)passing unanimously, ending what is effectively state-sponsored investments in fossil fuels should be a next step in this work.”

"Scientists have predicted for the first time when, where and how polar bears are likely to disappear, warning that if greenhouse gas emissions stay on their current trajectory all but a few polar bear populations in the Arctic will probably be gone by 2100. By as early as 2040, it is very likely that many polar bears will begin to experience reproductive failure, leading to local extinctions, according to a study published in Nature Climate Change.   The study examines how the bears will be affected under two different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The researchers found that under a business-as-usual emissions scenario, polar bears will likely probably only remain in the Queen Elizabeth Islands – the northernmost cluster in Canada’s Arctic archipelago – at the end of the century. And even if greenhouse gases are moderately mitigated, it is still likely that the majority of polar bear populations in the Arctic will experience reproductive failure by 2080. Scientists estimate that there are fewer than 26,000 polar bears left, spread out across 19 different subpopulations that range from the icescapes of Svalbard, Norway, to Hudson Bay in Canada to the Chukchi Sea between Alaska and Siberia. Polar bears are unable to find enough sustenance on land and rely on sea ice from which to hunt. They often stake out seal breathing holes in the ice, waiting hours for a blubbery meal to break the surface. But as that sea ice declines because of climate change, so, too, will the polar bears. “It’s been clear for some time that polar bears are going to suffer under climate change,” said Péter Molnár, a biologist at the University of Toronto Scarborough, and lead author of the study. “But what was not fully clear was when we would expect major declines in the survival and reproduction of polar bears that could ultimately lead to their extirpation. We didn’t know whether that would happen early or later in this century.” Polar bears draw on energy reserves built up during the winter hunting season to make it through lean summer months on land or time spent on ice in unproductive waters. Though the bears are used to fasting for months, their body condition, reproductive capacity and survival will eventually diminish if they are forced to go too long without food. In Alaska’s southern Beaufort Sea population, biologists have already seen polar bear numbers drop 25– 50% during low ice periods when the bears have been forced to fast for too long. And in western Hudson Bay, one of the southernmost polar bear habitats, the population has declined by roughly 30% since 1987. To figure out when bears might reach their critical physiological limit, Molnár and his colleagues estimated how thin and fat polar bears can be and modelled the animals’ energy use to derive the threshold number of days they can fast before cub and adult survival rates decline. Then they combined those thresholds with the projected number of future sea ice-free days to determine how populations will be affected in different parts of the Arctic. “Even if we mitigate emissions, we are still going to see some subpopulations go extinct before the end of the century,” Molnár said. This includes the polar bears in the vulnerable, southernmost ice areas of western Hudson Bay, Davis Strait, and southern Hudson Bay. “But we would have substantially more populations persisting by the end of the century, even with reduced reproduction, compared with a business-as-usual emissions scenario.” The study examined 13 of the world’s 19 polar bear subpopulations, accounting for 80% of the total population of the species. Bears inhabiting an area known as the Archipelago ecoregion in the Canadian Arctic were not included as the geography of the area – islands and narrow channels – made it too difficult to predict future ice extent. Of those studied populations, polar bears in southern Hudson Bay and Davis Strait in Canada are “very likely” to experience reproductive failure by 2040 in a scenario of unmitigated emissions. Polar bears in much of Alaska and Russia will be in serious trouble by 2080. And by 2100, it’s inevitable that these populations will experience reproductive failure, leading to extinction if countries don’t drastically reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases. “It’s important to highlight that these projections are probably on the conservative side,” said Steven Amstrup, chief scientist for Polar Bears International and a co-author of the study. The models, he explained, may assume a better-than-reality body condition of the bears at the start of fasting periods. And the team used a cautious baseline estimate for how much energy a bear uses to maintain its body condition. “The impacts we project are likely to occur more rapidly than the paper suggests.” Unlike other species threatened by hunting or deforestation, polar bears can only be saved if their habitat is protected, which requires tackling climate change at a global level. Previous research has shown that even if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions tomorrow, it will still take another 25 to 30 years for sea ice extent to stabilise because of all the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere. It’s important that the public understand the urgency of the issue, Amstrup said. But a timeline for possible extirpation was also an important tool for managers in northern communities living alongside polar bears. “It shows where we would expect to see increased human-bear conflict,” said Andrew Derocher, a biology professor at the University of Alberta who heads the Polar Bear Science Lab and is unaffiliated with the study. Not all Arctic communities have programmes in place to deal with more polar bears in their localities. And there is a moral question of whether humans should help struggling bears. “With something like polar bears, where you’re not going to get their habitat back, it’s not clear we’re going to try to hold on to these populations everywhere. If we start to see a large number of bears on land dying of starvation, what kind of interventions would we get into?” Derocher said polar bear managers needed to work out whether they would provide supplementary feed for the bears, or relocate them to regions that still had ice. “You look at the fallout from one video of a starving bear. Well, imagine going to Churchill, Manitoba – a hub of polar bear tourism – and seeing 50 bears walking around like that. The public outcry is going to be intense and managers need to be thinking about what their policies are going to be now.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"Planting trees is often suggested as at least a partial solution to the climate crisis. But campaigns to put roots down across the countryside have a long and storied past, and today’s environmentalists could learn much from the persuasive methods pioneered by a 17-century gentleman, John Evelyn (1620-1706).  Now recognised as one of the founding fathers of English environmentalism, Evelyn is best known for his 1664 work, Sylva, Or a Discourse of Forest-Trees, and the Propagation of Timber. The first book published under the auspices of the newly-formed Royal Society – now the world’s oldest national scientific institution – Sylva was expanded and reissued three times during Evelyn’s lifetime.  Its passionate advocacy of tree plantation has been credited with inspiring the 18th-century trend for landscape gardening, including the work of “England’s greatest gardener” Capability Brown. It is a powerful historic example of academic publishing with real-world consequences. Born into a landowning family with royalist sympathies, at a time of mounting tension between king and parliament, the young Evelyn spent the early 1640s travelling in France and Italy before settling in Kent, England, in 1647. His concern for environmental issues was first evident in his 1661 publication, Fumifugium, which condemned “aer and smoak” pollution from coal fires in London and argued for the mass plantation of trees, shrubs and herbs as a means of improving the city’s air quality.  Three years later he published his magnum opus, Sylva, which provided readers with an encyclopaedic study of trees and tree cultivation in Britain and Ireland. Starting with practicalities such as the choice of seed and the best conditions for successful germination, Sylva provided chapter-length studies of individual tree species from the oak and sycamore to the willow and holly. It also offered advice on such issues as tree diseases, pruning, and how to chop down trees and season the timber. Evelyn himself claimed to have written Sylva for purely practical reasons. The recent Civil War between supporters of the king and parliament had led to extensive deforestation, as trees were either felled for military purposes or sold off for ready cash, so fresh supplies of timber were urgently needed for shipbuilding. On the title page, Evelyn represented his work as responding to “Certain Queries” propounded by “The Principal Officers, and Commissioners of the Navy”.  Yet as he admitted in Sylva, many of the trees he described in such loving detail would never have been suitable as shipbuilding materials. Evelyn, it seems, genuinely loved trees and wanted to communicate his enthusiasm for tree planting to his contemporaries.  Both the wealth of knowledge evident in Sylva and the care that Evelyn devoted to revising and improving his text over four decades suggest that tree planting for its own sake, rather than the needs of the navy, was his principal motivation. Evelyn was clearly canny enough to know that simply bombarding people with information was not enough to persuade them into action. His portrayal of tree planting as an act of service to the nation was just one of several strategies for appealing to the emotions of his readers.  For instance the many quotations from classical authors – including Virgil, Horace, Cicero and Pliny – which litter the pages of Sylva, would have had powerful cultural resonance for Evelyn’s gentlemanly first readers, many of whom would have been well educated in classical literature as schoolboys. The fact that so many Latin authors had advocated the planting of trees would have carried considerable emotional weight, and would also have counteracted any snobbish assumption that it was beneath the dignity of gentlemen. Evelyn’s other persuasive methods included his attention to practical details, which must surely have done much to make tree plantation seem manageable even to novice gardeners. He also name dropped several well-respected contemporaries – including the King, a “Lady in Northamptonshire”, and his own father and brothers – as committed tree planters.  Above all, and on almost every page of Sylva, he offered himself to his readers as his own best model of a Restoration tree grower, as experienced in the day-to-day challenges of tree cultivation as he was knowledgeable about tree science, history and literature. Sylva was no mere abstract recommendation: Evelyn aimed to lead by example. Evelyn’s situation, needless to say, was very different from our own. While he only had to address a narrow elite, modern campaigners have to reach out to a much wider range of readers, and our diverse and increasingly sceptical society has no equivalent to the shared cultural and political values that a 17th-century author could rely on. But many of Evelyn’s methods still make good psychological sense, such as making tree plantation seem practical and easy, or leading by personal example, and are as likely to be effective now as then.

"The race is on to reach net-zero carbon emissions within the next few decades – and the road to a zero-carbon UK runs through its railways. Transport currently accounts for 26% of all carbon emissions in the UK, and only 1% of this comes from trains.  Trains are one of the most environmentally friendly forms of mass transport available, releasing 0.046kg of carbon dioxide (CO₂) per kilometre each passenger travels. A diesel car is more than double that at 0.117kg.  That’s probably why road transport and aviation are the most popular sources for emissions cuts. You may have heard about plans to completely phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040, for example. But the big decisions about how to power Britain’s trains are actually the most urgent.  Cars are typically only in service for 10 years or so, while trains carry on for 40 or even 50 years. Trains built today will only be in “mid-life” by 2050, when the UK’s targets demand greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced to zero. This means that zero-carbon trains need to be ordered and delivered from 2025 onwards to stay on track with this timeline of decarbonisation. Currently the only trains that could meet this criteria are electric, but only 42% of track in the UK is electrified and 29% of Britain’s current fleet is run solely on diesel fuel. These trains will need to be re-engineered or scrapped before they get to the end of their useful life to meet government targets. So what needs to be done to turn Britain’s ageing and polluting rail fleet into the zero-carbon mass transit of the future? The UK has already electrified about two-fifths of the rail network, meaning some of these trains run exclusively off electric current and release no local carbon emissions. But they are only as green as the electricity grid that powers them – and though the UK has made encouraging progress away from fossil fuels, they still account for roughly half of all energy generated. Diesel trains are more versatile as they can work on the almost 60% of lines that aren’t electrified and the portion that is. Diesel power can also transport exceptionally heavy loads and so is often used in the freight sector. But the UK has been unable to order new diesel freight locomotives since 2008, because none of the current rolling stock comply with the set emission standards. This has effectively forced the freight sector to use rather elderly locomotives – some from as early as the 1950s – that are more polluting. The rail industry will need to eliminate diesel power before 2040 as the fuel becomes increasingly expensive and unacceptable to the public, especially given stations trap train emissions, threatening the health of passengers and staff. Given how widespread electric power is on the rails, could diesel-electric hybrid engines work? These hybrid engines use electricity where electrified third rails or overhead line are available and diesel elsewhere. New hybrids have been ordered for routes in and out of Paddington, one of London’s busiest train stations. Some older passenger trains have been converted to hybrid, but with little take-up from the rail industry.  This could reduce diesel use in the short-term, but it isn’t a long-term solution for removing diesel by 2040. Using batteries as a train’s power source has been tested in Germany at low speed and with light loads, using traditional lead acid batteries. It’s a tried and tested technology, so it’s cheap and reliable, but the batteries have a limited life and are made with corrosive liquids and precious materials.   Lithium-ion batteries have been tried in the UK by providing an additional power source for the electric motor on a train. Unfortunately, these could only travel up to 50km once separated from overhead wires. Battery trains can only work on specific routes and aren’t easily replaced when they fail, causing disruption and delays. Hydrogen fuel cells can generate sustainable electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. This can power homes, offices, factories, cars and public transport – making them carbon free and independent from the main power grid. Instead of a tank of diesel and an engine, the train has a tank of hydrogen and a fuel cell that combines the hydrogen with oxygen from the air, without combustion. With the only emission being water, the fuel cells provide power and have zero emissions. Sounds good but, as a power source, hydrogen has low energy density, meaning trains would need a very large space to store the fuel. To compare, a litre of diesel contains 36 megajoules of energy but a litre of hydrogen has only 1.81 megajoules. This isn’t a problem for a nice light car, but a major issue when one massive locomotive has to pull 40 wagons – and each wagon weighs perhaps as much as 80 tonnes. It also doesn’t help that no facilities exist in the UK to make or deploy large quantities of hydrogen. Still, it’s reasonable to expect that this could be resolved over the next ten years as the government and businesses race to produce the fuels of the future. So, there are a number of options, and not one of them is a perfect solution on its own. Each can be used where they’re most appropriate, and gradually move British rail away from fossil fuels. The freight industry is unlikely to come up with viable solutions on its own, so the government should mandate businesses to transform their operations. Investment in zero emissions technology and innovation could encourage this.

      We can't expand airports after declaring a climate emergency – let's shift to low-carbon transport instead


 To get things moving, there’s much to change in how things currently work. Train operators should lose their right to use polluting diesel engines and these should be replaced in ten-year intervals. Cities could be given the right to fine train operators for polluting in a similar way to the low emission zones that exist in several cities around the world. One policy that is long overdue would be scrapping the duty-free diesel that train operators currently enjoy. Overhauling the most polluting aspects of the UK’s rail system won’t happen overnight, but to get on track for 2040 and beyond, the big decisions about Britain’s railways need to be made right now.

"While US President Donald Trump may be “the world’s most powerful climate change denier”, our latest research suggests that he took over over a thriving green economy. According to new data, by 2016 it was generating more than US$1.3 trillion in annual revenue and employed approximately 9.5m people – making it the largest green market in the world. It’s been growing rapidly too – between 2013 and 2016, both the industry’s value and employment figures grew by 20%. For some time, economic data on the green economy in many countries has been lacking. In the US, the Bureau of Labor Statistics stopped measuring jobs in the green economy in March 2013 due to budget cuts. This meant that US politicians were not able to make informed decisions about the relative merits of supporting green industry or backing fossil fuels – as Trump had pledged to do on his 2016 campaign trail. To fill this knowledge gap, we analysed massive databases to record the latest available business transactions from every country in the world. We estimated sales revenue and employment figures across 24 economic sub-sectors covering renewable energy, environmental protection, and low carbon goods and services – collectively termed the green economy. We used this same standardised method across all countries, allowing us to make meaningful comparisons between them. Our study estimates that revenue in the global green economy was $7.87 trillion in 2016. At $1.3 trillion, the US made up 16.5% of the global market – the largest in the world. Our analysis also suggests that in the US, nearly ten times more people were employed in the green economy and its supply chains (9.5m) than employed directly in the fossil fuel industry (roughly 1m) – that is, miners, electricity grid workers, infrastructure manufacturers and construction workers. This wide gap comes despite the US fossil fuel industry receiving huge subsidies, estimated at $649 billion in 2015 alone. Importantly, the green economy has been growing faster than Trump’s wildest dreams for the fossil fuel industry. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump set out his “America first” energy policy, promising to add 400,000 new jobs to the fossil fuel industry. During the campaign, he suggested that he could increase the industry’s economic output by $700bn over 30 years. Our data indicates that the green economy grew by over $60bn per year 2013 and 2016. This dwarfs Trump’s best hopes for growth in the fossil fuel industry, which equate to an annual increase in value of $23bn. Employment in the US green economy also grew by the equivalent of 1.5m full-time jobs during this time, whereas coal mining jobs declined by 37,000 over the same period. These are strong numbers. But after three years of faltering support, the US’s position as a world leader in the green economy is precarious. Up to now, Trump’s campaign rhetoric has not been backed up by major policy changes, although his rollback of a number of Obama era regulations has likely helped the fossil fuel industry in the short term. But unlike Trump, competing superpowers are strongly backing renewables. China, for example, has emerged as a global climate leader in the wake of Trump’s determination to pull out of the Paris Agreement. In 2017, it announced plans to invest USD$361 billion in clean energy by 2020 to generate 13 million jobs. This investment alone could go a long way to closing the gap between the value of the US’s green economy and that of China’s, the second largest in the world.

 The Green New Deal – popularised by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others – is an ambitious policy agenda that could reestablish the US’s commitment to the green economy. It proposes massive investment in renewable energy and an environment-friendly public works programme of gargantuan scale. Phasing out direct fossil fuel subsides could free up some of the funding required for such investment. It’s not for us to say whether the Green New Deal is right for the US. But what our data does say loud and clear is this: if you want a strong economy that supports thousands of new jobs, then supporting its green quarters is essential. And of course, it will help our imperiled living planet too. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."

Van Jones, an American political and civil rights activist and former adviser to former President Barack Obama, recently spoke at the University of Chicago. The host asked Jones about the increasing demand from students to be protected from ideas and speakers they don’t like.





Ideological safe spaces make those on the left and the right more extreme.



Van Jones’s response deserves to be quoted at length. It was a compelling argument for political and ideological diversity on college campuses and for young people’s need to be challenged in order to grow and mature as human beings and maybe at some point make a difference in society. Jones castigated ideological self‐​segregation.



“There are two ideas about safe spaces,” he explained, referring to some college students’ request for “safe spaces,” where they can get together without being exposed to ideas and speech that make them feel uncomfortable. “One is a very good idea, and one is a terrible idea.” The good idea, he said, is “being physically safe on campus, not being subjected to sexual harassment and physical abuse.”



Jones continued:



“But there is another view that is now ascendant … It’s a horrible view, which is that ‘I need to be safe ideologically, I need to be safe emotionally, I just need to feel good all the time. And if someone else says something that I don’t like, that is a problem for everyone else, including the administration.”



Jones suggested that safe spaces insulating students from certain ideas contradicts the purpose of a university:



I think that’s a terrible idea for the following reason: I don’t want you to be safe ideologically. I don’t want you to be safe emotionally. I want you to be strong. That’s different. I’m not going to pave the jungle for you. Put on some boots, and learn how to deal with adversity. I’m not going to take the weights out of the gym. That’s the whole point of the gym.



You can’t live on a campus where people say stuff that you don’t like? […] You are creating a kind if liberalism that the minute it crosses the street into the real world is not just useless but obnoxious and dangerous. I want you to be offended every single day on this campus. I want you to be deeply aggrieved and offended and upset and then to learn how to speak back.



Van Jones’s remarks were met with applause from the audience. But six professors at Wellesley College didn’t hear or didn’t heed Van Jones’s advice. In an email to the Wellesley community in the aftermath of a recent visit by leading feminist intellectual and cultural critic Laura Kipnis, they proposed setting up a censorship committee to vet speakers in order to make sure that “disempowered groups” would be protected from ideas and speech they find offensive and harmful. The professors claimed that bringing somebody like Kipnis and other “guest speakers with controversial and objectionable beliefs” to campus “impose on the liberty of students, staff and faculty at Wellesley.”



This is exactly the kind of reasoning dictatorships use to shut down unwanted speech, where censorship is justified in the name of security, public safety or social harmony. That’s top‐​down censorship. But censorship can also be exercised from the bottom up. This has been the case with students who exclude, disinvite and shut down speakers whose opinions they don’t like. It’s a big irony that the Wellesley professors’ call for censorship happened as a reaction to Kipnis’s talk at Censorship Awareness Week. And it’s baffling to see professors at an elite college being unable to distinguish between bullying the disempowered and making an argument. Alexis Zhang, a former Wellesley student, castigated the professors’ e‐​mail in an op‐​ed in the Boston Herald:



The message — shocking for any institution of learning — is that Wellesley students should not need to tax their minds and hearts rebutting arguments they find disagreeable.



As a Wellesley alumna, I find this alarming. What would a campus without disagreement look like? How can Wellesley do its job of preparing women leaders to challenge orthodoxies and make their mark on the world without unfettered commitment to freedom of expression and dialogue? As the college’s own mission statement points out: ‘There is no greater benefit to one’s intellectual and social development … than the forthright engagement with and exploration of unfamiliar viewpoints and experiences.’



In 2015, Obama gave a speech to high school students in Des Moines, Iowa, in which he talked about his own experience as a student belonging to a disempowered group and being raised by a single mother. Obama stressed the need for ideological diversity on college campuses:



Look, the purpose of college is not just, as I said before, to transmit skills. It’s also to widen your horizons; to make you a better citizen; to help you to evaluate information; to help you make your way through the world; to help you be more creative. The way to do that is to create a space where a lot of ideas are presented and collide, and people are having arguments, and people are testing each other’s theories, and over time, people learn from each other, because they’re getting out of their own narrow point of view and having a broader point of view. …



[W]hen I went to college, suddenly there were some folks who didn’t think at all like me. And if I had an opinion about something, they’d look at me and say, well, that’s stupid. And then they’d describe how they saw the world. And they might have had a different sense of politics, or they might have a different view about poverty, or they might have a different perspective on race, and sometimes their views would be infuriating to me. But it was because there was this space where you could interact with people who didn’t agree with you and had different backgrounds that I then started testing my own assumptions. And sometimes I changed my mind. Sometimes I realized, you know what, maybe I’ve been too narrow‐​minded. Maybe I didn’t take this into account. Maybe I should see this person’s perspective.



Laura Kipnis is a professor at Northwestern University, where she teaches filmmaking, and she is the author of five books on a wide range of topics. Two years ago, she became the target of a so‐​called Title IX investigation after having published an essay in Chronicle of Higher Education criticizing “sexual paranoia” on campuses. Two graduate students filed Title IX complaints arguing that the essay had a “chilling effect” on students’ ability to report sexual misconduct. After a 72‐​day investigation, Kipnis was cleared of any wrongdoing. But only after she publicly exposed her treatment in a second essay titled “My Title IX Inquisition.”



Title IX is a 1972 law intended to protect students against sexual discrimination, but its application has been expanded so the law is now being used, among other things, to police classroom content. The law has been criticized by free speech groups like the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. Kipnis was invited to Wellesley as part of Censorship Awareness Week to talk about her case and her forthcoming book _Unwanted Advances: Sexual Paranoia Comes to Campus_. (Full disclosure ― I spoke at Censorship Awareness Week the day after Kipnis.)



In her talk ― I was in the audience during her talk with my daughter ― Kipnis criticized what she sees as a deranged feminism driven by a new paternalism that is based on the notion that women need to be protected while men have to be surveilled. Kipnis said there’s no better way to subjugate women than to tell them that an assault awaits around every corner. Kipnis suggested that young women should be taught self‐​defense and learn how to turn down unwanted advances. There’s an urgent need for sexual education of young people.



Kipnis perceives that what is going on on college campuses is part of a broader cultural shift: “My generation saw sex as a source of pleasure and liberation. Today, many see it as a risk and a danger that demands more control by university administrations. It implies delegating enormous power to employers and administrations instead of being in control of our own lives. If this is called feminism, then feminism is broken.”



Kipnis’s talk was well‐​received. It was a small audience, 30 people or so, a mix of students, professors and guests with no connection to Wellesley College. Most questions were asked to clarify points with no stated disagreements. Nobody was forced to attend the speech.



Kipnis was challenged by two female students. One explained that administrative regulation and the anti‐​sexual misconduct movement has contributed to her sexual liberation. It has given her more power in sexual relations because she is aware of her rights. Another student took issue with Kipnis’s thesis about sexual paranoia on campus and a reference to statistics showing that there are fewer cases of sexual abuse. The student said that a majority of her close friends have been sexually assaulted by longtime boyfriends and not taken legal recourse even though they had been forced to have sex against their will. The disagreements were expressed forcefully, though there was no sense of hostility. It was an enlightened exchange of opinions.



Kipnis’s talk and the following back‐​and‐​forth with the audience unfolded in a spirit of mutual civility and a willingness to listen to one another. Kipnis praised the students for asking questions that revealed key dilemmas in the debate about sexual misconduct on campuses. The six Wellesley professors who accused Kipnis of “bullying the disempowered” in her lecture have no base in reality. In an interview, Kipnis called the accusation “absurd.”



“What actually happened,” she said, “was that there was a lively back‐​and‐​forth after I spoke. The students were smart and articulate, including those who disagreed with me.”



The potentially disastrous consequences of the position stated by the six Wellesley professors reach far beyond college campuses. To many Americans, the 2016 election was a wake‐​up call. Jonathan Haidt, a professor of moral psychology at New York University and a vocal supporter of political diversity on campuses, put it this way:



Americans have long known that they have racial, ethnic, class and partisan divides. But the 2016 presidential election has forced all of us to recognize that these gaps may be far larger, more numerous and more dangerous than we thought. Americans are not just failing to meet each other and know each other. Increasingly, we hate each other — particularly across the partisan divide.



In order to fight ideological self‐​segregation, some media organizations have introduced new features. The New York Times regularly references noteworthy writing from both the left and right. New apps are being developed to help users getting out of their bubbles to be exposed to points of views that they disagree with. 



Ideological and other kinds of diversity are important on college campuses and in a liberal democracy because they cultivate tolerance, which in many ways is diametrical to our instincts. We have to learn to live side by side with values, opinions and ways of life that we don’t like. It’s crucial for the concept of tolerance that we speak out against what we disagree with. But there are limits. The concept of tolerance implies that we refrain from using violence, intimidation, threats and bans to silence our opponents. This isn’t easy. It’s painful. In Europe, it took our forefathers hundreds of years to foster a climate of peaceful coexistence among communities adhering to different beliefs.



Providing room for ideological diversity also helps fight extremism and destructive polarization. Cass Sunstein, a Harvard law professor, wrote an important book called _Going to Extremes: How Like Minds Unite and Divide_. He analyzes social‐​psychological experiments dealing with group dynamics, extremism and polarization. His conclusion: When people find themselves in groups of likeminded types, they are especially likely to move to extremes. When people on the left and on the right only talk to likeminded people, their opinions tend to become more extreme. This insight is not limited to particular periods, nations and cultures. It happens in politics, families, businesses, faith‐​based communities and student organizations.



It doesn’t mean that individuals and society won’t benefit from deliberations within communities. This promotes the development of positions that would otherwise be invisible or silenced. Many social movements have been made possible through this route, including the civil rights movement and the LGBTQ rights movement. However, it is important to ensure that such enclaves are not walled off from competing views and that there is an exchange of views between members of a group and those who disagree with them.



Sunstein’s argument explains the value of bringing somebody like Laura Kipnis to Wellesley. It also explains why it is of value to invite the libertarian Charles Murray to speak at Middlebury College and engage with students who don’t like his work. The importance of listening to people with whom we disagree involves a process that is fundamental to being human beings. As the British historian Timothy Garton Ash puts it in his excellent book on free speech:



Only with freedom of expression can I understand what it is to be you. Only by articulating our differences can we clearly see what they are, and why they are what they are.



Openness about all kinds of human difference is as vital as civility. I cannot fully express myself — that is, my self — unless I identify my differences with others. We all notice differences and respond to them both consciously and unconsciously. Unless we explore these responses and feelings, we have no chance of digging down to the hidden biases of which we are not aware. If we “speak as we feel/​not what we ought to say,” as Shakespeare puts it at the end of King Lear, we can learn from experience what is hurtful to others and hence discover for ourselves what it takes to live together as neighbors.

"After a traumatic breakup, Julia Scinto, a fashion designer in Manhattan, found herself searching online sites far and wide, looking for any available resource to help her feel better. “I even considered hypnosis,” said Ms. Scinto, who designs women’s wear for Macy’s private label. Instead, she discovered Mend, an app and online community that serves as part personal trainer, part online refuge for the brokenhearted. On the Mend app, users are introduced to an animated avatar of the Mend founder, Ellen Huerta, and her reassuring voice offers guidance on how to move forward, with topics like “detoxing” from your ex redefining your sense of self  —   even how to get a better night’s sleep. “It’s this charming and endearing voice of a friend,” Ms. Scinto said. “And there’s a line, ‘We never get tired of hearing about your breakup,’ and those words are like an oasis in the desert. ” Geri Dugan, who works as a psychiatric nurse practitioner in Chicago, knows all too well the mixed emotions that come after a love affair ends. After being stunned by a relationship that didn’t work out, she said, she felt like an “emotional basket case. ” Ms. Dugan found Mend through Ms. Huerta’s podcast “Love Is Like a Plant. ” Now, for more than eight months, she has been applying Mend’s daily regime, which includes monitoring one’s   journaling exercises, a Spotify playlist and a book club on Good Reads. She has also navigated through difficult days with support from Mend’s Facebook group. It “really helped normalize the experience,” Ms. Dugan said, adding, “I’m even recommending it to some of my patients going through things like divorce. ” In her Santa Monica, Calif. office, just blocks from the Pacific, Ms. Huerta, 30, with a tumble of dark hair and giant blue eyes, admitted that she had always been drawn to matters of the heart. “Mend started very organically after I went through a breakup,” she said between sips of her   rooibos tea. “I had a lot of resources at my disposal  —   I had supportive friends and access to therapy  —   but I still was having such a hard time moving forward. ” Ms. Huerta, identified by the name Elle on Mend, found online sites that offer breakup advice to be disappointing, with generic insights like “It just takes time” or wearisome directives like “Post a photo on social media of yourself with someone new. ” She said she set out to build a better digital experience for the newly solo, where users could shake their feeling of helplessness and take action. As a former Google employee, she was familiar with the tech field and took her cues from fitness and   apps. “We are taking those parts of our lives very seriously,” she said. “Yet we weren’t doing that with our love lives, which is at the core of who we are. ” Mend started as a newsletter focused on recovering from heartbreak. Now the company is working with Silicon Beach’s highly selective business accelerator MuckerLab (whose portfolio includes tech companies like TaskRabbit and the Black Tux). MuckerLab invested seed money in Mend and assists Ms. Huerta with business development, including product design and marketing. Still less than a year old, the app has been downloaded in more than 100 countries, and many Mend users return for the supportive community, which spills over with tales of solidarity. “One of my personal missions is to erase the shame and taboo of heartbreak as something to just get over,” Ms. Huerta said. One way she addresses that is by drawing on her background in science. (She has a degree in geosciences from Wellesley, and her father is a geophysicist.) She counsels the Mend community that it’s not just emotion that causes a wave of intense feelings, it’s also biology. “It’s different for everyone,” Ms. Huerta said, “but when you go through a separation with someone who you have been intimate with, your body can tell that there’s been a separation. You’re giving off hormones, and they are giving off hormones, over time you become addicted to that source of   hormones. ” She pointed to a 2016 study published in the Frontiers in Psychology journal, in which researchers found that romantic love stimulates the same area of the brain as addiction does, with symptoms like euphoria, craving and emotional and physical dependence. Love’s addictionlike qualities, the study states, have developed in humans to encourage procreation and, thus, our very existence. Although much of Ms. Huerta’s advice for Mend users is grounded either in science or in her own romantic mistrials, and she encourages a range of options, like meditation and   teas, she firmly believes in the magic and mystery of love, which no data, chart or study can pinpoint. It is that belief that will inform a Mend app update scheduled to roll out in the spring. One sentiment remains: “It’s true what they say,” Ms. Huerta said. “Love really is the drug. ”"
"WASHINGTON  —   Just five days after taking office, over dinner with his newly installed secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, President Trump was presented with the first of what will be many    decisions: whether to approve a commando raid that risked the lives of American Special Operations forces and foreign civilians alike. President Barack Obama’s national security aides had reviewed the plans for a risky attack on a small, heavily guarded brick home of a senior Qaeda collaborator in a mountainous village in a remote part of central Yemen. But Mr. Obama did not act because the Pentagon wanted to launch the attack on a moonless night and the next one would come after his term had ended. With two of his closest advisers, Jared Kushner and Stephen K. Bannon, joining the dinner at the White House along with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. Mr. Trump approved sending in the Navy’s SEAL Team 6, hoping the raid early last Sunday would scoop up cellphones and laptop computers that could yield valuable clues about one of the world’s most dangerous terrorist groups. Vice President Mike Pence and Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, also attended the dinner. As it turned out, almost everything that could go wrong did. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be present as the body of the American commando killed in the raid was returned home, the first military death on the new commander in chief’s watch. The death of Chief Petty Officer William Owens came after a chain of mishaps and misjudgments that plunged the elite commandos into a ferocious   firefight that also left three others wounded and a $75 million aircraft deliberately destroyed. There are allegations  —   which the Pentagon acknowledged on Wednesday night are most likely correct  —   that the mission also killed several civilians, including some children. The dead include, by the account of Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen, the    daughter of Anwar   the   Qaeda leader who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011. Mr. Trump on Sunday hailed his first counterterrorism operation as a success, claiming the commandos captured “important intelligence that will assist the U. S. in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world. ” A statement by the military’s Central Command on Wednesday night that acknowledged the likelihood of civilian casualties also said that the recovered materials had provided some initial information helpful to counterterrorism analysts. The statement did not provide details. But the mission’s casualties raise doubts about the months of detailed planning that went into the operation during the Obama administration and whether the right questions were raised before its approval. Typically, the president’s advisers lay out the risks, but Pentagon officials declined to characterize any discussions with Mr. Trump. A senior administration official said on Wednesday night that the Defense Department had conducted a legal review of the operation that Mr. Trump approved and that a Pentagon lawyer had signed off on it. Mr. Trump’s new national security team, led by Mr. Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a retired general with experience in counterterrorism raids, has said that it wants to speed the   when it comes to such strikes, delegating more power to   officials so that the military may respond more quickly. Indeed, the Pentagon is drafting such plans to accelerate activities against the Qaeda branch in Yemen. But doing that also raises the possibility of error. “You can mitigate risk in missions like this, but you can’t mitigate risk down to zero,” said William Wechsler, a former top counterterrorism official at the Pentagon. In this case, the assault force of several dozen commandos, which also included elite soldiers from the United Arab Emirates, was jinxed from the start. Qaeda fighters were somehow tipped off to the stealthy advance toward the village  —   perhaps by the whine of American drones that local tribal leaders said were flying lower and louder than usual. Through a communications intercept, the commandos knew that the mission had been somehow compromised, but pressed on toward their target roughly five miles from where they had been flown into the area. “They kind of knew they were screwed from the beginning,” one former SEAL Team 6 official said. With the crucial element of surprise lost, the Americans and Emiratis found themselves in a gun battle with Qaeda fighters who took up positions in other houses, a clinic, a school and a mosque, often using women and children as cover, American military officials said in interviews this week. The commandos were taken aback when some of the women grabbed weapons and started firing, multiplying the militant firepower beyond what they had expected. The Americans called in airstrikes from helicopter gunships and fighter aircraft that helped kill some 14 Qaeda fighters, but not before an   Osprey aircraft involved in the operation experienced a “hard landing,” injuring three more American personnel on board. The Osprey, which the Marine Corps said cost $75 million, was badly damaged and had to be destroyed by an airstrike. The raid, some details of which were first reported by The Washington Post, also destroyed much of the village of Yakla, and left senior Yemeni government officials seething. Yemen’s foreign minister, Abdul Malik Al Mekhlafi, condemned the raid on Monday in a post on his official Twitter account as “extrajudicial killings. ” Baraa Shiban, a Yemeni fellow for Reprieve, a   human rights group, said he spoke by phone to a tribal sheikh in the village, Jabbr Abu Soraima, who told him: “People were afraid to leave their houses because the sound of choppers and drones were all over the sky. Everyone feared of being hit by the drones or shot by the soldiers on the ground. ” After initially denying there were any civilian casualties, Pentagon officials backtracked somewhat on Sunday after reports from the Yemeni authorities begin trickling in and grisly photographs of bloody children purportedly killed in the attack appeared on social media sites affiliated with Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen. Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said on Monday that some of the women were combatants. The operation was the first known   ground mission in Yemen since December 2014, when members of SEAL Team 6 stormed a village in southern Yemen in an effort to free an American photojournalist held hostage by Al Qaeda. But the raid ended with the kidnappers killing the journalist and a South African held with him. That mission and the raid over the weekend revealed the shortcomings of secretive military operations in Yemen. The United States was forced to withdraw the last 125 Special Operations advisers from the country in March 2015 after Houthi rebels ousted the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the Americans’ main counterterrorism partner. The loss of Yemen as a base for American counterterrorism training, advising and   was a significant blow to blunting the advance of Al Qaeda’s branch in the country and keeping tabs on their plots. The Pentagon has tried to start rebuilding its counterterrorism operations in Yemen, however last year, American Special Operations forces helped Emirati troops evict Qaeda fighters from the port city of Mukalla."

I bring you wonderful news from the cold and windy but still-beating heart of the nation; the luvvies are upset, they’re positively spitting wild. Sometimes it’s great to be alive.



The gentleman sending the climaterrati into an apoplectic tail-spin is Sean Rush, newly elected councillor for the Wellington’s eastern suburbs, who had the audacity to make a submission to the Zero Carbon Bill select committee arguing that the bill was all a bit too much hot air and piffle, and not enough common sense.



 _Stuff_ , with their one-seeing eye, have decided Rush is a public enemy and have produced a little flurry of articles since his election repeating all the usual prattle-cries of the left intended to besmirch the bloke – denier, oil-industry insider, anti-science, blah, blah, blah…the trouble for them is that Sean does know what he’s talking about, he’s currently completing a ‘Master’s in Climate Change Science and Policy’ at Victoria University’s School of Geography, Environment and Earth Sciences.



Doing what the petulant kids do when some independent thinker has the temerity to disagree with them _Stuff_ ran to teacher and told on the recalcitrant, urging teacher to scold the boy, and midday yesterday the retort went up: **“Climate scientist rubbishes his student – Wellington councillor Sean Rush.”**



Doomer James Renwick, fresh from a Sunday conference advocating for a soviet solution to solve the climate-imagincy, penned the ‘rebuttal’ to the heretic and I recommend you look at [the article](https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/117135629/wellington-councillor-argued-global-warming-was-driven-by-natural-forces) including Rush’s full submission to parliament which upon reading will render you a nice warm glow alike a little kerosene heater inside a cold hut.



“It is therefore important that New Zealand politicians do not impose hardship by policy that is in excess to that which the climate might impose.”



Perfectly stated; Mr Rush, a phrase which should have been boldly shouted from rooftops throughout the land by the National Party, instead they hid under their safety blankets and whimpered like puppies fearing chastisement.



Sean Rush for Prime Minister, just as soon as possible please.

"**Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has seen his personal wealth rise to $100bn (Â£76bn) after the launch of a new short-form video feature.**
On Wednesday, Facebook announced the US rollout of Instagram Reels, its rival to controversial Chinese app TikTok.
Facebook shares rose by more than 6% on Thursday. Mr Zuckerberg holds a 13% stake in the company.
He joins Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Microsoftâs Bill Gates in the exclusive so-called 'Centibillionaire Club'.
Technology bosses have been in the spotlight recently as the size and power of their companies and their personal fortunes continue to grow.
Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google have been among the biggest benefactors of coronavirus lockdowns and restrictions as more people shop, watch entertainment and socialise online.
Mr Zuckerbergâs personal wealth has gained about $22bn this year, while Mr Bezos's has grown by more than $75bn, according to Bloomberg.
The short-form video feature Reels, which is seen as a rival to the controversial Chinese-owned TikTok platform, works within the Facebook-owned Instagram photo-sharing app.
The launch couldnât have come at a better time for Mr Zuckerberg as late on Thursday Donald Trump issued an executive order to deal with what the US president called the ""threat"" of TikTok in the US.
So-called tech titans, including Mr Zuckerberg, have come under increased scrutiny from US and European lawmakers over allegations that their power and influence are out of control.
The five largest US tech companies, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft, currently have market valuations equivalent to about 30% of US gross domestic product (GDP).
**Wealth tax**
US senator and former presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders this week unveiled a plan to tax what he called âobscene wealth gainsâ made by billionaires during the coronavirus pandemic.
The âMake Billionaires Pay Actâ would tax 60% of the increase in a billionaire's net worth from from the start of the pandemic through to the end of the year.
Mr Sanders proposes that the tax revenue earned would go towards out-of-pocket health-care expenses for Americans.
Mr Zuckerberg has previously said he plans to give away 99% of his Facebook shares over his lifetime through the charitable foundation he set up with his wife Priscilla Chan."

Scientists largely removed from the consideration of science
Story submitted by Tom Barr
The U.K.’s Energy and Climate Change Committee [yesterday] endorsed the IPCC’s 2014 opinion that humans are the dominant cause of global warming.
In a 9 to 2 vote in a parallel universe the “Science was Settled”, yet again. But not by scientists, of course. Let’s look at the MPs who voted: Of the 9 in favour at least one had fiddled his expenses, just six held degrees and only one of them in what could be considered a scientific field, Human Biology. 
More here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-28531091 .
The two MPs that voted against held scientific degrees in, respectively, Chemistry and Natural Sciences.
Rigorously applying the proven “97% consensus” methodology, that implies 66% of scientifically qualified MPs tasked with considering the IPCC report don’t believe that global warming is predominantly caused by man.

 _On the 14th of November, a group of New Zealand Farmers protested in Wellington. A copy of the speech notes of[Andrew Hollis](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/someone-stepped-out-of-line-oh-dear/), a new Tauranga council member who spoke at the Rally has been provided to The BFD._



Who am I… I’m a geologist (now city Councillor). I have been studying the Earth and its systems for years. For me the spectre of human-caused climate change reared it’s head in 1990. Since then I have been called a “denier”. I call those in charge of this scam “deceivers”. NZ has been heading down a pathway with closed eyes and closed minds with regards to the climate. The latest is the Paris Accords where we will apparently beggar ourselves to kowtow to the UN.



It also seems that farmers will bear the brunt of changes to tax rules to try and pay for our commitments. However, it appears that farmers far from being responsible for emitting CO2, may well be New Zealand’s best absorbers. The accounting our government uses for CO2 emissions does not include grassland or fruit trees and vines. It turns out that untilled grassland absorbs nearly as much as pine plantations per hectare. AND it can keep doing it beyond the life of a pine tree.  




Grassland binds soil together whereas soil is literally destroyed by pine plantations. No allowance is made for native plantings which are often the makeup of riparian planting. **It’s almost as if there is an agenda at play here.**  




All of this and it also looks as though CO2 is not the villain it has been made out to be by the Deceivers. Not one climate model based on the thermostat model of CO2 concentration works within cooee of reality. Climate models use a thing called parameterization for all the hard to measure pieces of the puzzle… water vapour being one, you know… clouds. Many other authors call this fudging. The process brings the model up to date historically and then fails to match reality going forward in much the same way that financial models can tell us after a stock market crash what went wrong but have never accurately predicted any future movements.  




By the way, methane consumed by livestock is 6% of the carbon consumed by the animal. The remainder is returned to the earth in the form of urine, manure, milk, wool, steak or any number of other products but **not methane.** In horticulture, how much CO2 does it take to make an olive, avocado, kiwifruit or grape? All carbon trapped and not released by the orchardist and yet no accounting made for it. Why not? Could it be that no tax is available that way?  




Here is the fun bit…. the methane emitted is from sugars made by grass which took CO2 from the atmosphere. No new carbon added… none. And 94% of the total is removed from the atmosphere. It is possible to show that farming and horticulture in New Zealand is not only carbon neutral but is likely to be a carbon credit.



The only time a farm releases carbon is upon tilling the soil. You know… to plant soy for biofuels as an example.  




Importantly, if CO2 is doing little or nothing to warm our planet then how on earth is this anything to do with farmers? At the moment 87% of NZ is living in cities all using cars, buses and SUVs to get around and yet are baying for farmers to clean the planet? Because farmers are seen as “The Rich Bastards”.  




In short, there seems to be a push to make farming so expensive that land will be freed up to have pine plantations planted on arable land. This will ruin the soil structure, allow massive amounts of NZ soil to run off and release mega tonnes of carbon in the coming decades at the cost of NZers.  




Please push back with the information that farms collect as much carbon as pine plantations. Let’s get the carbon accounting accurate and honest and don’t pay anything for climate mitigation.  




Carbon is the elixir of life – don’t let the Deceivers fool you, or anyone else.  
Time to end the guilt tactics.  
Time to stop blaming farmers.  
Time to remind townies where pollution actually comes from.  
Time to stop overseas investors ruining food growing farmlands at our expense.  
Time to realise you can’t eat trees.  
Just do the maths right and stop the attack on farmers. “

As part of the 35th Vienna Motor Symposium, German online financial daily Handelsblatt here has an interview with leading automotive engine design expert Prof. Fritz Indra, who says that much of the talk about electric vehicles is “hype” and calls the Tesla “a failure”.
Indra, 75, is now retired after a long career in developing engines for BMW Alpina, Audi and General Motors. He now acts as a consultant.
Demand for electric cars reach “absolute low point”
The Handelsblatt writes that internal combustion engines have made huge technological leaps in progress when it comes to efficiency and cleanliness. And when asked about the most recent trend for electric vehicles, Indra tells the Düsseldorf-based financial daily that this year there was not even a single presentation on electric vehicles, and that the demand “has reached an absolute low point.”
Skewed statistics and “environmental fraud”
Indra tells the Handelsblatt that countries like Norway and USA have stopped or plan to curb their generous subsidies for electric cars. He says Germany’s target of putting 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2020 is wildly exaggerated. “In reality it won’t even be 100,000 vehicles.” He then tells the Handelsblatt that they may get the figure to look respectable by skewing the statistics by including hybrid cars and electric bikes in the count.

Indra also calls both plug-in-hybrids and electric cars “an environmental fraud“, adding that the subsidies for electric cars are very expensive and points out that Norway is stopping some of the subsidies and that the USA curbed them after 60,000 vehicles. These are two rich countries!
Moreover he says China ought to impose an “electric car driving ban” as a first step to help clean up its air pollution.
Tesla “a failure”
Indra also believes that the Tesla will be a failure “because every year the company makes huge losses and the market is not big enough.” Moreover he describes how its batteries are technically inadequate, and that Tesla owners face huge replacement costs later on: “The customers are going to wonder.” He calls Elon Musk “probably the best PR man in the world“.
He also believes the electric car market is “almost saturated”.
Indra feels that the future remains in combustion engines due to their tremendous technological progress with regards to fuel efficiency, cleanliness and practicality.
Finally, WUWT reports on how Teslas really get recharged.

"That collective shriek of joy you’re hearing from the BeyHive? Beyoncé and Jay Z are expecting twins. Beyoncé, the cultural and music powerhouse, dropped the news in an Instagram post on Wednesday afternoon with a picture showing her cradling a baby bump: The announcement was yet another example of the Beyoncé’s penchant for tightly controlling her own narrative. She revealed she was pregnant in 2011 with a knowing belly rub at the MTV Video Music Awards, after a spirited performance of “Love on Top”  —   and a microphone drop. (A quick camera cut to Jay Z, born Shawn Carter, smiling    as Kanye West shook his rapper friend by the shoulders confirmed the message.) Their daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, was born on Jan. 7, 2012. While Beyoncé is famously averse to interviews and rarely discusses her personal life without setting the terms, she put the spotlight on her marriage with the release last year of the album and HBO film “Lemonade. ” It told the story of a struggling relationship, including explicit infidelity and, eventually, reconciliation. Many assumed the songs’ lyrics  —   which ranged from heartbroken to defiant to forgiving  —   were autobiographical, though the couple never revealed how much of the story was based in reality. (In her 2013 documentary, “Life Is But a Dream,” Beyoncé discussed having an earlier miscarriage. “About two years ago, I was pregnant for the first time,” she said. “I flew back to New York to get my checkup  —   and no heartbeat. ” Jay Z alluded to the experience in his song “Glory. ”) “Lemonade” is nominated for a leading nine Grammy Awards at the ceremony to be held on Feb. 12. Beyoncé is also scheduled to headline the second night of the Coachella festival in the California desert on April 15 and April 22. Things seem to be going well for the couple now  —   Beyoncé’s Instagram post was signed, “The Carters. ” The pair’s fervent and loyal fans responded with typical enthusiasm to the announcement: Twitter said more than half a million tweets were sent about the pregnancy within 45 minutes. Some Coachella ticket holders wondered about the status of Beyoncé’s scheduled performance. A representative for the singer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jay Z and Beyoncé are not the only musical duo with baby news. Pharrell Williams and his wife, Helen Lasichanh, recently welcomed triplets, according to reports."

Guest essay by Paul Homewood
WUWT carried the story yesterday of the paper by Kodra & Ganguly, forecasting a wider range of temperature extremes in the future.
According to the Northeastern University press release, using climate models and reanalysis datasets, the authors found that

While global tem­per­a­ture is indeed increasing, so too is the vari­ability in tem­per­a­ture extremes. For instance, while each year’s average hottest and coldest tem­per­a­tures will likely rise, those aver­ages will also tend to fall within a wider range of poten­tial high and low tem­perate extremes than are cur­rently being observed.

But is there any evidence that this has been happening? We can check what’s been happening in the US, by using the US Climate Extremes Index, produced by NOAA.

Of course, the US only accounts for 2% of the Earth’s surface, (except when there is a polar vortex, a mild winter or a drought in California), but it seems a sensible place to start. We also know that climate models often bear very little resemblance to reality!
Just to recap, the US Climate Extremes Index, or CEI, is based on an aggregate set of conventional climate extreme indicators which, at the present time, include the following types of data:

monthly maximum and minimum temperature 
daily precipitation 
monthly Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) 
landfalling tropical storm and hurricane wind velocity.

In terms of temperature, the CEI is

The sum of (a) percentage of the United States with maximum temperatures much below normal and (b) percentage of the United States with maximum temperatures much above normal. 
The sum of (a) percentage of the United States with minimum temperatures much below normal and (b) percentage of the United States with minimum temperatures much above normal.

So, for instance, we can plot maximum temperatures during summer months:
 

http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/cei/graph/1/06-08
 
And, minimum temperatures in winter:
 

http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/cei/graph/2/12-02
 
The reds indicate the percentage of the US, which were “much above normal”, and the blues “much below normal”. The CEI also lists the actual percentages, so we can plot the “much aboves” in summer, and the “much belows” in winter, thus:
 


 
The trend is to an increasing percentage with above average summer temperatures, although recent years seem to be at similar levels to the 1930’s. (The CEI is based upon adjusted temperatures, before anyone asks).
In winter, though, the trend is decreasing.
We can now combine the summer and winter sets together.
[I have simply added together the percentages, although of course some areas could have experienced both hot and cold – think of it as an index].

Clearly, the overall trend is to extreme temperatures reducing. In other words, the area of the US experiencing unusually high or low temperatures is tending to grow smaller. (Although it is interesting to note the relative absence of such extremes in the years around 1970).
Of course, although this analysis tells us about the area of the country affected, it does not say anything about how extreme the temperatures are. But we can check this very simply, using the NCDC Climate At A Glance datasets.
The graph below shows the difference each year between winter and summer temperatures, for the country as a whole, along with a 10-Year average. As can be seen, the variation from winter to summer has been getting smaller in recent years.
The most extreme year was 1936, when the hottest summer on record (even after adjustments) followed the second coldest winter. I wonder how their models account for that?

FOOTNOTE
 
NOAA offer this definition of how they calculate their index:
 
 
The U.S. CEI is based on an aggregate set of conventional climate extreme indicators which, at the present time, include the following types of data:

monthly maximum and minimum temperature
daily precipitation
monthly Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)
landfalling tropical storm and hurricane wind velocity

* experimental (not used with the Regional CEI)
Each indicator has been selected based on its reliability, length of record, availability, and its relevance to changes in climate extremes.
Mean maximum and minimum temperature stations were selected from the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) (Karl et al. 1990). Stations chosen for use in the CEI must have a low percentage of missing data within each year as well as for the entire period of record. Data used were adjusted for inhomogeneities: a priori adjustments included observing time biases (Karl et al. 1986), urban heat island effects (Karl et al. 1988), and the bias introduced by the introduction of the maximum-minimum thermistor and its instrument shelter (Quayle et al. 1991); a posteriori adjustments included station and instrumentation changes (Karl and Williams 1987). In April 2008, maximum and minimum temperature data from the USHCN were replaced by the revised USHCN version 2 dataset. In October 2012, a refined USHCN v
ersion 2.5 was released and replaced version 2 data for maximum and minimum temperature indicators.
 
 
The U.S. CEI is the arithmetic average of the following five or six# indicators of the percentage of the conterminous U.S. area:
 

The sum of (a) percentage of the United States with maximum temperatures much below normal and (b) percentage of the United States with maximum temperatures much above normal.
The sum of (a) percentage of the United States with minimum temperatures much below normal and (b) percentage of the United States with minimum temperatures much above normal.

 
 
In each case, we define much above (below) normal or extreme conditions as those falling in the upper (lower) tenth percentile of the local, period of record. In any given year, each of the five indicators has an expected value of 20%, in that 10% of all observed values should fall, in the long-term average, in each tenth percentile, and there are two such sets in each indicator.
A value of 0% for the CEI, the lower limit, indicates that no portion of the period of record was subject to any of the extremes of temperature or precipitation considered in the index. In contrast, a value of 100% would mean that the entire country had extreme conditions throughout the year for each of the five/six indicators, a virtually impossible scenario. The long-term variation or change of this index represents the tendency for extremes of climate to either decrease, increase, or remain the same.
 
The index is built up from the Climate Divisional Database, and therefore reflects the area of the US, rather than a simple percentage of stations.

David Rose’s piece in the Mail on Sunday has already been picked by WUWT and Bishop Hill, amongst others. But I want to concentrate on one aspect, that of cycles.
The Mail report:
However, Dr Hawkins added that the decline seen in recent years was not caused only by global warming. It was, he said, intensified by ‘natural variability’ – shifts in factors such as the temperature of the oceans. This, he said, has happened before, such as in the 1920s and 1930s, when ‘there was likely some sea ice retreat’.
Dr Hawkins said: ‘There is undoubtedly some natural variability on top of the long-term downwards trend caused by the overall warming. This variability has probably contributed somewhat to the post-2000 steep declining trend, although the human-caused component still dominates.’
Like many scientists, Dr Hawkins said these natural processes may be cyclical. If and when they go into reverse, they will cool, not warm, the Arctic, in which case, he said, ‘a decade with no declining trend’ in ice cover would be ‘entirely plausible’. 
Peer-reviewed research suggests that at least until 2005, natural variability was responsible for half the ice decline. But exactly how big its influence is remains an open question – and as both Dr Hawkins and Prof Curry agreed, establishing this is critical to making predictions about the Arctic’s future.
Prof Curry said: ‘I suspect that the portion of the decline in the sea ice attributable to natural variability could be even larger than half.
‘I think the natural variability component of Arctic sea ice extent is in the process of bottoming out, with a reversal to start within the next decade. And when it does, the reversal period could last for several decades.’
This led her to believe that the IPCC forecast, like Al Gore’s, was too pessimistic.
‘Ice-free in 2050 is a possible scenario, but I don’t think it is a likely scenario,’ she concluded.
The cycle they refer to is the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, AMO. Below is the detrended AMO, and you can see it runs on about a 60-year cycle. It is currently around or just below its peak, having risen strongly since the mid 1970’s.
It may remain at the current level for a few more years yet, but it will then fall away for the next 30 years, just as it did from the 1940’s to the 1970’s.
 

http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/cgi-bin/gcos_wgsp/tsanalysis.pl?tstype1=91&tstype2=0&year1=1895&year2=&itypea=0&axistype=0&anom=0&plotstyle=0&climo1=&climo2=&y1=&y2=&y21=&y22=&length=&lag=&iall=0&iseas=1&mon1=0&mon2=11&Submit=Calculate+Results
 
 
So, what effect will this have on Arctic ice? We can glean much from examining temperature trends around the part of the Arctic affected by the AMO.
 
First, Iceland. Below is a report from the Icelandic Met Office in 2008, “Past temperature conditions in Iceland from 1798 to 2007”, which uses the long running, high quality site of Stykkisholmur.
 
Temperature in Stykkishólmur (Western Iceland)
The temperature (figure 1) has in the long run been increasing during the last 200 years at the rate of +0.7°C per century. This is similar to the general temperature increase in the whole Northern hemisphere during the same period. The warming has been very uneven, dominated by three cold periods and two warm ones.
 
Annual temperature in Stykkishólmur 1798 to 2007

Figure 1. Annual temperature in Stykkishólmur 1798 to 2007. Note that the values prior to 1845 are interpolated from observations at other stations. The confidence is very low for the years before 1830 and the values are preliminary and should not be referenced. Work on quality improvement is ongoing. A few warm and cold years are highlighted.   
 
The time from 1925 onwards is dominated by a very large cycle that does not show an overall significant warming, although the temperature rise of the last 20 years is considerable.
There is also a large decedal variability before 1925. The year 1892 marked the end of a period dominated by a very large year-to-year variability and the end of a long run of very cold years. There was a relatively warm period during 1837 to 1858, and by overlooking the very cold year of 1835 and a few isolated cold months one can identify the interval 1813 to 1858 as a generally warm one.
The years 1807 to 1812 were very cold. Although the following warm period was considerably colder than the corresponding 20th century warm period it was noted as a generally favourable time for agriculture and the population of the country increased markedly. 
The 20th century warm period that started in the 1920s ended very abruptly in 1965. It can be divided into three sub-periods, a very warm one to 1942, a colder interval during 1943 to 1952, but it was decisively warm during 1953 to 1964.
The cold period 1965 to 1995 also included a few sub-periods. The so called “sea ice years” 1965 to 1971, a slighly warmer period 1972 til 1978, a very cold interval during 1979 to 1986, but therafter it became gradually warmer, the last cold year in the sequence being 1995. Since then it has been warm, the warmth culminating in 2002 to 2003. Generally the decription above refers to the whole country, but there are slightly diverging details, depending on the source of the cold air.
 
Note:
1) The reference to a long term temperature increase since 1798.
2) No significant warming since 1925.
3) Reference to cold and warm periods. The most recent ones being the cold period from 1965 to 1986, followed by the recent warming. Note how these, and the warm period culminating in the 1940’s, correspond with the rise and fall of the AMO.
If we look further afield, we find patterns in Greenland (Godthab and Angmassalik), Norway (Vardo) and Russia (Murmansk and Salehard). The following graphs are from GISS, and use unadjusted data.
 

 http://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/show_station.cgi?id=431042500000&dt=1&ds=1

 http://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/show_station.cgi?id=431043600000&dt=1&ds=1
 
http://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/show_station.cgi?id=634010980003&dt=1&ds=1

http://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/show_station.cgi?id=638221130005&dt=1&ds=1

http://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/show_station.cgi?id=222233300002&dt=1&ds=1
All these stations, ranging from western Greenland to Siberia, show essentially the same pattern, a warm period around 1940, comparable to now, and a much colder interlude in the  1960’s and 70’s. And, of course, these all closely follow the ups and downs of the AMO.
There seems little doubt that the Arctic will be in for another cold period during the next 30 years or so, and that, as Judith Curry indicates, we will see a long term recovery of Arctic ice extent.
We fail to learn the lessons of history at our peril!

 **Eve McCallum**



 _On the 14th of November, a group of New Zealand Farmers protested in Wellington. This copy of the speech notes of Eve McCallum was taken from the 50 Shades of Green Facebook page._



We are real people, we are families, and we are intergenerational custodians of our land.



This is not just about us; it is about our children, and their children



We matter and **we are not being listened to**.



I am lucky enough to be the 5th generation of my family to grow up and work on a farm. My family has farmed in Otago, Hawkes Bay, the King Country and Northland. My Great Grandfather Lewis White was killed in a farming accident when he was felling trees to clear the land for grass to be planted.



Being a country kid has given me so many experiences and life skills that you simply do not get in the city. 



**Independence** – from the age of 7 I had my first pony, I would go out riding around the farm by myself. 



**Responsibility** – by the age of 14 I had 4 ponies, they were my responsibility (not mum and dads) to exercise, feed, water and everything else, but I loved every minute of it. 



**Resilience** – the ponies had to be looked after rain hail or shine, sick or not sick. A broken femur from a riding accident at 13 taught me how to get back on the horse, literally, and keep going, even when things were hard.



Calf day is a great example of when the farming community would come together. As young kids we would all spend weeks teaching our pet calves to lead, brushing them and feeding them. 



**Responsibility**. We also spent a fair amount of time chasing after the calves when one got away in a very large paddock during leading practice. We all then gathered at the local primary school with our calves to show off all the hard work we had put in. Sometimes I think the parents were more disappointed than the kids when the purple champion ribbon wasn’t tied around their calves’ neck.



Signs such as “more cows = more milk = more climate change” hit directly at farmers. They show one side of the argument. **They lack any actual understanding of what farming is about.** It is more than just a job. It is about family. It is about community. It is about people. Real people. I credit most of who I am to my childhood, my childhood was not stolen. My childhood is the reason I am the person you see here today.



I challenge my generation to go and investigate, to find more stories of farming life like the ones I have told you. To learn that farmers are not monsters. To not be ignorant as to what is a huge part of New Zealand Society. To give us a chance.

"**The developers of Among Us say they're cancelling plans for a sequel so they can focus on improving the original.**
The murder-mystery game (set in space, obviously) involves ten players trying to find out who among them is an imposter.
In August, it was announced a second instalment was on the way.
But Innersloth now say they've been so overwhelmed by a spike in popularity for the original, they're going to focus on reworking that instead.
The original game was released back in 2018, but it's only just found a fanbase - thanks, largely, to pick-up from streamers on Twitch and YouTube.
Data from the website Steam shows it went from having an average of 4.5 PC users logged on in January 2019, to 107,000 over the past month.
""The main reason we are shooting for a sequel is because the codebase of Among Us 1 is so outdated and not built to support adding so much new content,"" the developers wrote on their website.
""However, seeing how many people are enjoying Among Us 1 really makes us want to be able to support the game and take it to the next level.
""We have decided to cancel Among Us 2 and instead put all our focus into improving Among Us 1.
""All of the content we had planned for Among Us 2 will instead go into Among Us 1.""
It's not just through Twitch and YouTube that Among Us has been finding new fans.
The format of trying to identify the traitor amongst your friends has made it an absolute gift for meme creators.
""We have been working hard to get the servers adjusted to deal with the huge influx of players,"" the statement continues.
""Thank you so much for bearing with us through these growing pains.""
Other than server improvements, Innersloth is also promising to add a new level and a more sophisticated friends and account system.
But it says progress is likely to be slow because it's having to prioritise what it thinks it can achieve.
Among Us can be played cross-platform on PC, iOS and Android.

As President Trump delivered a weekend salvo in the ongoing shutdown battle, White House aides reminded reporters that the president remains convinced of his “legal authority to declare a national emergency at the border, which could allow him to redirect Pentagon funding to a build a border wall.” The flacks’ messaging was clear: If congressional Democrats turn a deaf ear to Trump’s latest proposal, then the president retains recourse to his emergency powers.   
  
  
In a thoughtful post earlier this month, my colleague Gene Healy explained that Trump’s threats are far from idle, and that the Congress bears much of the blame for this bizarre scenario whereby the president can win domestic policy priorities by declaring an _ad hoc_ emergency. Gene pointed to “at least two provisions of the U.S. Code passed during the 1980s, 33 USC § 2293  and 10 USC § 2808,” that plausibly empower Trump to fund a border wall if he declares a national emergency.   
  
  
Disconcertingly, these were only two out of more than a hundred delegations of emergency powers to the president! Returning to Gene’s post:   




[T]he U.S. Code today [is] honeycombed with overbroad delegations of emergency power to the executive branch. A Brennan Center report released last month identifies 136 statutory powers the president can invoke in a declared national emergency. Few of these provisions require anything more than the president’s signature on the emergency declaration to trigger his new powers—“stroke of the pen, law of the land—kinda cool,” in the Clinton‐​era phrase. 



Worse yet, the president’s statutory powers aren’t limited to putative national emergencies; instead, there are many and diverse congressional delegations of law‐​making power directly to the president. For example, through the Antiquities Act, the president can regulate millions of acres of public lands with a brief proclamation. Under trade statutes, the president can impose tariffs backed by little more reasoning than his signature. Prof. Kevin Stack provides other examples in this excellent article.   
  
  
Gene’s post spotlighted Congress’s complicity to the dangerous accumulation of direct statutory authority in the president’s hands. But Congress isn’t the only branch of government to blame; the judiciary is a co‐​enabler of executive excess.   
  
  
Out of undue solicitude for the office of the presidency, the Supreme Court has abandoned substantive review of presidential decision‐​making pursuant to overbroad delegations of congressional authority. The upshot is that courts won’t scrutinize the president’s decision that a “national emergency” exists. Nor will courts perform a meaningful inquiry of the relationship between the putative national emergency and the border wall. That is, they won’t question if the wall is a reasonable policy to mitigate the supposed national emergency.   
  
  
Instead, courts would perform a superficial “facial” review of the president’s declaration pursuant to Congress’s broad delegation of “emergency” powers, bending over backwards to accommodate the executive. It’s deference squared.   
  
  
This ultra‐​permissive judicial review stands in stark contrast to how Article III courts review exercises of congressional delegations by all other actors in the Executive Branch. Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) 5 U.S.C. § 706, all “agency action” is subject to judicial review to ensure that the agency’s lawmaking is not “arbitrary or capricious.” As interpreted by the Supreme Court, this provision requires courts to take a “hard look” at the reasonableness of an agency’s reasoning and decision‐​making.   
  
  
In a seminal 1992 case, _Franklin v. Massachusetts_ , the Supreme Court held that the president is not an “agency” under the APA. Unfortunately, the _Franklin_ Court did not explain its reasoning, other than citing “respect for the separation of powers and the unique constitutional position of the President.” As observed by Prof. Kathryn Kovacs, this crucial question was neither briefed nor broached during oral argument.   
  
  
This absence of consideration is reflected by the weakness of _Franklin_ ’s legal reasoning.   
  
  
Looking to the text of the APA, there seems to be ample evidence that the statute contemplates searching review of the president’s statutory powers. As I noted above, all “agency action” is subject to a “hard look” under the APA. In 5 U.S.C. § 701(b)(1), the APA defines “agency” as “each authority of the Government of the United States,” but it expressly does not include “the Congress” or “the courts of the United States.” It wouldn’t make sense for the Congress to explicitly exclude two of the three branches of government from judicial review under the APA, but, at the same time, to implicitly exclude the third branch of government.   
  
  
There’s another textual clue that a president’s statutory powers should be subject to judicial review under the APA. In 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2), the APA precludes from hard look review “agency action [that] is committed to agency discretion by law.” In this context, “law” refers to “the common law’ of judicial review of agency action,” and included in this body of jurisprudence are such non‐​justiciability principles as the “political questions” doctrine. In turn, the political question doctrine allows courts to decline to take on controversies whose solution is better left to the political branches. Simply put, there’s no reason for the APA to account for the political question doctrine if presidents are not considered “agencies” whose actions are subject to “hard look” review under the APA.   
  
  
There are also policy reasons why the president should be considered an “agency.” In many instances, the president’s statutory powers mirror policymaking authority possessed by administrative agencies. Consider, for example, the Antiquities Act, which authorizes the president to regulate public land to the same ends as can be achieved by the Interior Department pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The difference is that the Interior Department must submit to procedural safeguards and meaningful judicial review before it can regulate millions of acres of public land, while the president can achieve the same results with a stroke of the pen and meaningless judicial oversight.   
  
  
Regardless whether the Court thought through what it was doing, the _Franklin_ decision added a perverse complement to a president’s statutory powers. On the one hand, the president enjoys vague and therefore sweeping delegations of statutory authority. On the other, he escapes meaningful judicial review when exercising these overbroad delegations. It’s a toxic mix that permits the president to gin up bogus emergencies to achieve major domestic policy priorities. (Imagine President Elizabeth Warren’s Green New Deal in response to a climate‐​change “emergency.”)   
  
  
In sum, Gene is absolutely right to endorse calls on Congress to “shore up the guardrails of liberal democracy” with comprehensive reform of the president’s statutory powers. To the same end, it’s also well past time for the Supreme Court to revisit _Franklin v. Massachusetts_.

Service is good and should be encouraged. Few Americans would disagree. Indeed, service has been in Americans’ DNA from the beginning of their nation. In his classic _Democracy in America,_ the visiting Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville commented on the proclivity of the new country’s citizens to organize. The resulting vibrant civil society was very different from the enervating monarchies and aristocracies that still dominated Europe.



This service was voluntary and decentralized. It was not organized or directed, and certainly not mandated, by government. Many communities had loose requirements for militia duty, and a national military draft was imposed on and vigorously resisted by many in both North and South during the Civil War. However, compelling people to help one another would have been alien to the philosophy underlying America’s creation. Again, de Tocqueville: in America citizens’ “chief business … is to remain their own masters.” Requiring a man to help protect the nation was the essence of citizenship. Making men and women “do good” to those around them was very different. A moral positive and perhaps even a duty, it nevertheless was not something appropriately enforced by government.



Americans’ enthusiasm for service has not waned. But support for compulsion has increased. That matches the growing role of government over the last century and more. Hence support for making service, however defined, mandatory for American young people. However, mandatory universal national service fails essential philosophical and practical tests.



National service has long been a favorite utopian scheme. The concept of “service” is difficult to fault, but most advocates imagine service to be of the form and provided in the manner that they prefer. The fount of modern national service thought dates back more than a century, ironically to a time very different from our own, when many people viewed militarism and imperialism as positive goods. President Teddy Roosevelt epitomized this age. Still venerated today by many, he was an unabashed imperialist and persistent advocate of taking America into war in Asia, Europe, and Latin America.



The first celebrated proposal for a form of “national service” occurred in 1888 with the publication of lawyer and journalist Edward Bellamy’s _Looking Backward,_ which envisioned compulsory service for men and women between the ages of 21 and 45. In its time the book was outsold only by _Uncle Tom’s Cabin_ and _Ben‐​Hur: A Tale of the Christ_ and was translated into 20 languages. Some 165 Bellamy clubs were started to push the author’s egalitarian utopia.



Two decades later, philosopher William James wrote of the need for a “moral equivalent of war,” in which all young men would be required to work for the country. He argued that “the martial virtues, although originally gained by the race through war, are absolute and permanent human goods,” and that national service provided a method for instilling those same values in peacetime. “Our gilded youths would be drafted off,” he wrote, “to get the childishness knocked out of them, and to come back into society with healthier sympathies and soberer ideas.”



Anachronistic though James’s specific vision may be today, his rhetoric became the touchstone for national service advocates. In succeeding decades a host of philosophers, policy analysts, and politicians proffered their own proposals for the “moral equivalent of war.” The so‐​called preparedness movement pressed for mandatory military training and service before the onset of World War I, during which the military draft was instituted. Radical Randolph Bourne urged forcing young men and women to provide two years of service before the age of 20. Universal military training received wide endorsement after World War II, and Congress reimposed military conscription after only a one‐​year peacetime interregnum. Defense secretary Robert McNamara advocated tying civilian service to the draft in the early 1960s. Anthropologist Margaret Mead advocated a universal program that “would replace for girls, even more than for boys, marriage as the route away from the parental home.”



Proposals continued fast and furious. Don Eberly of the National Service Secretariat spent years pressing for a service program, while publicly sidestepping the question of whether it should be mandatory. Charles Moskos of Northwestern University pushed a civilian adjunct to the draft before the creation of the All‐​Volunteer Force in 1973 and thereafter retained a preference for civilian conscription, admitting that “if I could have a magic wand I would be for a compulsory system.” In later years tennis great Arthur Ashe and former colonel and later _Newsweek_ columnist David Hackworth advocated national service. Senators as diverse as Ted Kennedy, Sam Nunn, Claiborne Pell, and John McCain favored compulsion.



Former senator Harris Wofford, who later served as CEO of the Corporation for National and Community Service, was a fan of national service proposals of most any sort. His heart appeared to lie with mandatory universal national service. He served as cochairman of the Committee for the Study of National Service, a project of the Potomac Institute. Declared the Committee report in 1979:



International comparisons also fire some American imaginations. Millions of young people serve social needs in China as a routine part of growing up, many [are] commanded to leave the crowded cities and to assist in the countryside. Castro fought illiteracy and mosquitoes in Cuba with units of youth. Interesting combinations of education, work, and service to society are a part of the experience of youth in Israel, Jamaica, Nigeria, Tanzania, and other nations. The civic spirit being imbued in youth elsewhere in the world leaves some Americans wondering and worrying about Saturday‐​night‐​fever, unemployment, the new narcissism, and other afflictions of American youth.



Although seeing Mao’s Red Guards as a model for America appears dated at best, later advocates retained the broader vision. They envisioned national service as a means to provide job training and jobs, encourage social equality, promote tolerance and civic‐​mindedness, expand access to college, encourage patriotism, and address ubiquitous “unmet social needs.”



The practical outcome of all these efforts was government‐​supported service that was neither national nor mandatory — and sometimes not clearly “service.” The New Deal and Great Society yielded the Civilian Conservation Corps, Peace Corps, and ACTION. The former was a job of last resort for many unemployed, the second often yielded a pleasant and interesting experience without undue sacrifice, and the third turned into a form of political activism for many. More recently came the push from the Democratic Leadership Council, to which Arkansas governor Bill Clinton belonged, for a Citizens Corps of 800,000 or more people for civilian service; the ensuing Clinton administration successfully pushed into existence more limited initiatives: the Corporation for National and Community Service and AmeriCorps.



Yet the president sold his proposal as much on the basis of pragmatism as idealism, as federal support for a collection of useful government and private work:



We’ll ask you to help our police forces across the nation, training members for a new police corps, that will walk beats and work with neighborhoods and build the kind of community ties that will prevent crime from happening the first place; we’ll ask young people to work to help control pollution and recycle waste, to paint darkened buildings and clean up neighborhoods, to work with senior citizens and combat homelessness and help children in trouble.



All of these tasks sounded useful, but all of them, other than, perhaps, painting darkened buildings, already were being performed by someone somewhere.



Unsurprisingly, these initiatives failed to satisfy activists who continued to press for a universal mandatory program.



Many claims are advanced on behalf of a compulsory national program. None are persuasive. The philosophical claims tend toward the collectivist, conflicting with principles underlying American history going back to the Revolution. The practical assumptions run against the experience of large government programs irrespective of their idealized objectives.



 **Today’s problems are unique requiring a unique remedy**. Advocates of MUNS typically view selfishness as ascendant and public spiritedness in retreat. In particular, America’s young people are said to have lost their sense of civic‐​mindedness. Indeed, contended the Democratic Leadership Council three decades ago, we live in a “prevailing climate of moral indolence,” where “such venerable civic virtues as duty and self‐​sacrifice and compassion toward one’s less fortunate neighbors are seldom invoked.” The Potomac Institute even pointed to the disco era, symbolized by the movie _Saturday Night Fever_.



Much can and has been written about the state of American values today. But are we really worse off than during the Gilded Age or the Roaring 20s? What of the tumultuous 1960s, filled with an unpopular war, violent protest, and racial strife? Throughout American history, it seems, youthful radicals in their maturity decried the views and behaviors of the rising generation of youthful radicals. However, such sentiments offer dubious justification for dramatic and draconian policies, so at variance with the founding ethos to which generations of Americans have felt bound. Just as one should not exaggerate America’s virtues, one also should be careful not to demonize those who are now entering adulthood and facing the many challenges which inevitably result.



 **Government‐​mandated service is an effective tool for soul‐​molding, to turn out virtuous citizens and create a moral society.** Much is expected of national service, which long ago became a universal panacea for some, seen as capable of solving a range of society’s ills. Most important is the belief that such a program would magically transform selfishness into selflessness. For instance, former general Stanley McChrystal cited the martial virtues, as James put it, in advancing a large‐​scale though not mandatory universal program:



At this scale of one full quarter of an age cohort, serving together to solve public problems will build attachment to community and country, understanding among people who might otherwise be skeptical of one another and a new generation of leaders who can get things done. I saw these effects for 34 years in the U.S. Army. We need them in civilian life.



McChrystal’s time in the military came after abolition of the draft, when men and women joined voluntarily, a process of self‐​selection unlike what is envisioned under MUNS. The volunteer military’s numbers pale in comparison to what a mandatory universal program would entail: last year the armed services inducted 171,000 new recruits. In contrast, MUNS would incorporate the roughly four million young people who turn 18 every year, a 23‐​fold difference. Contrast America’s mass conscript army during World War II. It brought diverse people into contact with one another, but its impact varied greatly on the individuals it affected. Moreover, nothing in the civilian world replicates the crucible of war.



Mass civilian conscription — a program likely to look to those compelled to serve more political, less essential, and more hypocritical than wartime military service — would be even less likely to generate the positive values desired. The spectacle of the comfortable and privileged old preaching sacrifice to the unsettled and skeptical young probably would generate far more cynicism than idealism. The long‐​term breakdown in family and community has made it more difficult to inculcate and incubate important moral and social values. However, there is little reason to believe that government, especially through a compulsory mass “service” program, is capable of doing better, especially if many young “servers” found themselves filling roles mundane at best and painful at worst. Despite the exalted rhetoric that characterizes MUNS literature, much of the work involved in any such program likely would be akin to shelving books in a library and handling paperwork for a social service agency; performing such tasks under threat of fine or prison should not be expected to transform lives for the good.



 **National Service would address “unmet social needs.”** Mandatory universal national service often is sold as a twofer: making people better and providing essential services. The literature on national service is voluminous, with advocates routinely calculating exact numbers of tasks to be done. For instance, past proponents of national service tossed around figures ranging up to 5.3 million as to the number of jobs that “needed to be done.” According to one study, for instance, libraries across America required 200,000 people; education needed six times as many.



But such numbers are meaningless. As long as human wants are unlimited and cost is no object, the number of unfilled “needs,” social or otherwise, is infinite. Labor, however, is not a free resource. Thus, it simply isn’t worthwhile for society to satisfy all “unmet” needs. One benefit of the market process is balancing benefits and costs, thereby enabling people to make tradeoffs. Wages help people assess which activities warrant being undertaken. National service would make such tradeoffs political, treating some jobs as sacrosanct, while most others not.



Indeed, at the risk of sounding too much like a professional economist, which I am not, the crux of this issue is opportunity costs. Requiring young people to “paint darkened buildings,” as suggested by President Bill Clinton, or perform other proposed “services” requires forgoing whatever else could be done with people’s time and taxpayers’ money. McChrystal said he wanted to



unleash the energy of our young people to tutor and mentor students in low‐​performing schools; support the elderly so they age with dignity; help communities respond to disasters; assist veterans reintegrating into their hometowns; and perform a thousand different tasks of value to our country.



But who decides, and by what standard measures, “tasks of value to our country”? No one with even a passing familiarity with Washington should imagine that the labor of four million young people — or, if service was two years, eight million at any one time — would be distributed objectively and dispassionately with regard to the economic and social, as opposed to the political, benefits to be achieved.



 **Government service is inherently better than private service**. “Public service” has a nice ring to it, but service comes in many forms. Being paid by the government to shelve books in a library, whether as a normal employee or as an AmeriCorps member, is no more laudable or valuable than being paid to stock shelves in a private bookstore. A host of private‐​sector jobs provide enormous public benefits — consider healthcare professionals, medical and scientific researchers, business entrepreneurs and inventors, and artists. Many of these people work much harder and earn much less than they could in alternative work; they have chosen to “serve” in their own way. Yet MUNS would effectively denigrate service through private employment.



Nor is there any reason to believe, a priori, that a dollar going to MUNS would yield more benefits than an additional dollar spent on medical research, technological innovation, or any number of other private and public purposes. Being a civilian “service” conscript would not necessarily generate more social benefits than working for a private charity or hospital. Indeed, a mandatory universal program would delay the entry of millions of people into the workforce every year, losing the benefit of their labor for the rest of us. Thus, the opportunity cost of diverting young people into extraneous educational pursuits and dubious social projects would be high.



What of essential needs which only government can address? MUNS would be like using a blunderbuss to hit a fly. Narrowly targeted responses to particularly important human needs would remain the most effective answer. That is, it would be better to find a way to attract several hundred or thousand people to, say, help care for the terminally ill, whether through public or private agencies, than to lump that task with teaching, painting buildings, cleaning bedpans, clearing undergrowth, and a plethora of other jobs performed by a cast of untrained millions.



Nor are local organizations likely to efficiently use a massive influx of “free” labor from the federal government. Many tasks not performed today are not viewed as worth the cost. If the price of labor falls to zero that will change. A similar problem is evident in federal grant programs that allow states to use national money for local projects. Observed David Luberoff of Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government: “One of the lessons of the interstate project is that in general … if you don’t require that states put up a reasonable amount of the cost, you run the risk of building stuff that is probably not that cost‐​effective.”



 **Mandatory universal national service would supplement existing private efforts.** Americans have worked in their communities since the nation’s founding, and opportunities for similar kinds of service today abound. Businesses, churches, and schools all actively help organize service by staff, members, and students. A number of years ago _Newsweek_ reported that “many of the old stereotypes are gone. Forget the garden club: today working women are more likely than housewives to give time to good works, and many organizations are creating night and weekend programs for the busy schedules of dual‐​paycheck couples. Men, too, are volunteering almost as often as women.”



Much more could be done, of course. But what makes service in America so vital is that it is decentralized, privately organized, centered around perceived needs, and an outgrowth of people’s sense of duty and compassion. Perhaps the best standard by which to judge any federal service program is whether it is consistent with this vision of volunteer service.



Proposals for MUNS, and certainly anything à la Bellamy and James, obviously are not. In fact, the explicit goal of advocates of mandatory programs was (and remains) to create a duty to the state rather than the direct beneficiaries of service. Moreover, service is to fit into a larger social plan implemented and enforced by government.



More limited initiatives have exhibited the problem. Today’s programs have essentially turned service into a government job. Undoubtedly, most volunteers believe in what they are doing. But other than the surrounding rhetoric, this work does not differ markedly from being hired by another government agency to do the same tasks. Some participants have privately admitted that they see national service as a good job option, not a unique opportunity to help the community. Indeed, President Clinton’s campaign pitch for his proposal appealed to self‐​interest, most notably the opportunity to earn money toward college tuition. There was nothing wrong with joining for the money, but the result was rather less noble than had been presented.



Moreover, AmeriCorps demonstrated its public‐​sector bias when 2,800 of the first 20,000 AmeriCorps participants were assigned to federal agencies. For instance, the Department of the Interior used AmeriCorps workers to “update geological and hydrological information for the U.S. Geological Survey” and restore wetlands and wildlife habitat. This was perfectly respectable work but more resembled traditional government employment than “service.” Such activities seemed unlikely to turn people into selfless patriots or transform those around them.



One also wonders how MUNS would affect the independent sector. Either government would have to establish massive new agencies to employ millions of servers, create a new class of government contractors, further bloating Washington’s Beltway Bandit population, or effectively take over and expand existing NGOs, turning them into de facto government contractors. In fact, today some aid groups get the bulk of their money and food from the federal government, in practice making them something different than their designation as non‐​governmental organizations. This could not help but transform volunteer organizations.



Even if the Corporation eschewed the natural temptation to meddle with NGOs, recipient behavior likely would change. If bypassed, private social service agencies would be eclipsed by new government behemoths. However, a program offering such groups the free services of millions of young people would create a massive honey pot, attracting the profit‐​minded and encouraging the worst sort of political infighting. Moreover, local and state officials would demand that “their” groups receive a “fair” share of the benefits. Members of Congress would press to enrich their districts, interest groups would lobby to twist MUNS programs to their own benefit, and labor unions would mobilize to protect their members from competition. Organizations formally dedicated to helping others would become lobbyists for creating a new class of indentured servants: in Germany private social service organizations, which benefited from providing “alternative” service to those opting out of the military, argued against proposals to end military conscription.



As the campaign for national service gained momentum during the Clinton years, David King of the Ohio‐​West Virginia YMCA warned:



The national service movement and the National Corporation are not about encouraging volunteering or community service. The national service movement is about institutionalizing federal funding for national and community service. It is about changing the language and understanding of service to eliminate the words “volunteer” and “community service” and in their place implant the idea that service is something paid for by the government.



There is much in American history to give credence to such fears. The history of the welfare state is the history of public enterprise pushing out private organization. The impact was largely unintentional, but natural — indeed, inevitable. Increased taxes left individuals with less money to give; government’s assumption of responsibility for providing services reduced individuals’ perceived obligation to help their neighbors; and the availability of public programs gave recipients an alternative to private assistance, one which set fewer and less intrusive conditions. MUNS likely would further teach that the duty of giving, the job of organizing giving (deciding who is worthy to receive government grants and, indirectly, private groups’ services), and the obligation to fund giving, belongs to government.



What would service mean under such circumstances? Compassion once meant to “suffer with.” Over time it came to mean writing a check. Now it seems to be equated, at least in Washington, with making someone else write a check. MUNS would turn it into making someone else “serve.” ****



 **Mandatory universal national service would complement military recruitment.** The U.S. Army has been having difficulty meeting its recruiting targets. Interest in serving has waned: some 40 percent of young people admit they don’t consider the military as an option. Moreover, many young people amassed poor scholastic records, consumed drugs, are out of shape, have criminal records, or are otherwise ineligible to join; the Pentagon figures fewer than a third of 17‐​to‐​24‐​year‐​olds, the prime recruiting pool, are eligible to join. Now, at least, the Pentagon has a unique claim to the service of America’s young. It can concentrate its resources on attracting the necessary new recruits — by adding recruiters, increasing compensation, revamping its message, or some other means.



Creating a mandatory civilian alternative would generate massive competing demand for young people, likely diverting high‐​quality recruits away from the armed forces. Establishing a vast civilian program would eliminate the military’s unique role in providing a service opportunity to the patriotic young. Indeed, Washington would effectively be treating civilian and military service as equivalent, even though, say, cleaning up parks can never compare with battling insurgents in Iraq.



Moreover, those primarily attracted to the military to raise money for college would gain a less challenging alternative. Around the time of AmeriCorps’ creation a majority of potential military recruits said they would consider civilian service rather than the armed forces as a means to gain educational assistance. Thomas Byrne of the Association of the U.S. Army declared: “We don’t want high‐​caliber people who might otherwise join the army off planting trees instead.” Unfortunately, conflating military and civilian service would make the military’s job much more difficult.



Some foreign governments that mix military and civilian service sought to increase the relative attractiveness of the armed services by offering shorter military terms. A number of national service proposals in America would do the same. However, this practice runs against military effectiveness, increasing turnover. Three decades ago the Pentagon’s personnel chief Grant Green warned that even more limited national service legislation could “reduce recruit quality, increase training costs and adversely affect the productivity of military personnel.”



Similarly, the Pentagon officially responded to one national service bill:



Because of the large influx of 2‐​year enlistments, the training base (and associated costs) would have to expand markedly. In addition, unit training workloads, personnel turbulence, and attrition experienced in active and Reserve operational units would all increase. Minimum overseas tour lengths would need to be cut, sharply increasing permanent change of station costs. The combined effect of these factors would drive sharp accession and end strength increases, disrupt unit cohesion, weaken esprit and morale, reduce individual proficiency and compromise unit readiness.



Indeed, America’s volunteer military is much better motivated than its conscript predecessor because all those serving want to be there. Having a force dedicated to staying in rather than getting out affects individual motivation, unit cohesion, education and training, reenlistment rates, NCO numbers, and much more. Career officers almost uniformly prefer to lead a military of volunteers than of conscripts for this reason. All told, MUNS likely would result in a less effective military.



 **National service can be fairly and efficiently enforced.** A program with four or eight million people, spending billions of dollars, working with scores or hundreds of agencies, NGOs, local and state governments, and more, and possessing a highly political agenda is unlikely to be nimble, efficient, streamlined, and flexible. Federal employment practices and program administration for existing social service agencies generally receive poor reviews. There is no reason to assume that a new universal national program, which would have to decide what jobs with whom counted as “service,” match millions of participants with openings, evaluate the performance of servers, and manage the inevitable conflicts and problems, as well as force angry, recalcitrant youth to participate, would be any better. In fact, far worse seems much more likely.



Just as military conscription has been presented as a mechanism to lower defense costs, some advocates of civilian programs contend that compulsory service would save money by lowering salaries for those performing essential services. However, conscription for any purpose shifts rather than reduces expenses. The military draft always operated as an arbitrary tax, abrogating free choice and cutting compensation that recruits otherwise would demand. A mandatory civilian program would do the same. One could save similar amounts by lowering salaries of postal employees, conscripting janitors for federal agencies, or instructing automakers to equip the government’s transportation fleet at cut‐​rate prices.



Moreover, MUNS would generate evasion efforts similar to those under military conscription. Government officials presented the military draft as a matter of national security, even survival, but many young men were not convinced that they were morally obligated to fight and possibly die in Vietnam. An entire industry arose dedicated to enabling young men to escape their legal duty. Some faked injuries, others found jobs that exempted them from the draft. A number went underground or fled. Would‐​be recruits were aided by sympathetic outsiders, such as doctors who certified nonexistent debilitating injuries.



Many men who reported for duty nevertheless resisted while “serving” — doing little work, ignoring or resisting orders, refusing educational and training opportunities, and showing disdain for their supervisors, service, and even country. The military could not discharge malcontents, since that would act as a reward; rather, the armed services were forced to accommodate the discontented to their detriment. Advocates of mandatory universal national service might dress their program in glowing rhetoric and imagine civilian conscripts sharing their enthusiasm for doing good, but a substantial number of the four million men and women turning 18 every year likely would think otherwise.



And then, what to do when “servers” refuse to report for duty? How to deal with chronic malingerers, who call in sick, show up late, and more? What if participants consciously, even ostentatiously, do their job badly? To ignore such conduct, relying only on pride and shame for enforcement, would simultaneously undermine the value of service and weaken the legal requirement. But is jail appropriate for someone who would prefer not to spend a year or two cleaning bedpans or managing parkland? Government could rely on financial incentives — say, denying college support or other government benefits for those who don’t serve — but that would be effectively reviving the Civil War practice of allowing conscripts to buy their way out of their legal duty. Those of means would effectively be exempt from service requirements, while those of limited means would feel pressure to conform.



To the extent that compulsory universal service succeeded, it almost inevitably would duplicate some jobs already performed in the private and public sectors, and likely at lower cost, assuming compensation for “volunteers” was lower than for “employees.” This prospect led the Clinton administration to promise no job displacement from its volunteer program. However, this is almost impossible in practice. A school district receiving a “free” contingent of teachers and teachers’ aides likely would reduce its independent hiring, no matter what it claimed to Washington. To prevent this from happening the government would have to treat as off‐​limits for millions of MUNS participants the most worthwhile tasks, those which the public or private sectors already are providing or supporting.



 **Compulsory national service is fair, legal, constitutional, and achievable.** However the program might be sold, in practice it would raise a host of fundamental, even debilitating practical and legal issues. How to treat religious work, for instance? Faith‐​based charities pervade the independent sector. Would they be barred from participating? What of political, social, and sexual lobbies? Say Planned Parenthood? The latter, as well as the activist Gray Panthers and controversial left‐​wing lobby ACORN, were early beneficiaries of AmeriCorps projects. In many cases educational or medical aid would be overshadowed by political activism.



The Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, or CETA, by which the national government funded local jobs, gained a notorious reputation as political pork for members of Congress and local officials alike. For instance, in Chicago the long‐​ruling Daley political machine required CETA applicants to get referrals from ward committeemen. In Washington, D.C., almost half of city council staffers ended up on CETA rolls. The program’s failings were such that it became one of the few programs ever terminated by Congress.



An even more important question is the constitutionality of a mandatory universal program. The Thirteenth Amendment was passed to eliminate slavery, but its reach is broader: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” Mandatory universal national service, at least if legally required and backed by civil or criminal penalties, would fit the definition of involuntary servitude.



In 1918, the Supreme Court upheld military conscription from a challenge under the Thirteenth Amendment, but that decision was almost preordained: it took place during a war in which U.S. draftees were then in combat, in a period when protection of civil liberties was at a historical low and exaltation of the executive was at a disturbing high, and when the Supreme Court took an essentially servile attitude toward the other branches of government. Moreover, in the _Selective Draft Law Cases_ the justices declared that “the highest duty of the citizen is to bear arms at the call of the nation” and that obligation “reflects the custom of nations.” The Court unsurprising ruled that the authority to raise armies and exercise other war powers “includes the power to compel military service.”



None of these arguments apply to civilian service. First, there is no related, explicit constitutional authority. Second, by the Court’s own ruling any civilian citizenship obligations trail military duties. Third, mass civilian “service” would not be performed for “the nation,” but rather for people and institutions at the behest of the national government. The difference is subtle but critical. Military service is directed and managed by the state for the benefit of the state. Similar is mandatory jury service, another practice that goes to the essence of state sovereignty. Requiring someone to engage in any number of civilian tasks to benefit others, however worthwhile, is very different. It is difficult to imagine such a program surviving judicial scrutiny, else the Thirteenth Amendment would be a dead letter.



 **Mandatory universal national service would eliminate young people’s sense of entitlement.** Why should middle‐​class young people expect taxpayer aid to attend university, it has been asked? To eliminate this “entitlement mentality,” some MUNS advocates would tie school aid to service (and make loss of such assistance the principal consequence of refusing to join). Yet a compulsory government program of this sort would reinforce the idea that students have a right to a taxpayer‐​paid education.



This would merely move the entitlement one step back. Students seeking college aid would be entitled to a not‐​too‐​challenging public “service” job with a salary and educational grant. For instance, among the tasks funded by the Corporation for National and Community Service: informing people about the availability of FEMA Service Centers, maintaining vehicles, surveying residents about recreational interests, cutting vegetation, and changing light bulbs in dilapidated schools. In contrast, consider the sort of tasks envisioned by William James: young laborers would be sent off “to coal and iron mines, to freight trains, to fishing fleets in December,” and much more.



The real solution to the entitlement mentality is to rethink who deserves an educational subsidy and how it should be provided. Indeed, abundant federal educational assistance, especially loans, has made it harder for students to afford college by fueling tuition hikes. The schools know they can raise their prices because students can afford to pay more, and thus are the ultimate beneficiaries of most “student” aid. Of course, America should address the entitlement mentality of those well out of university as well, who have come to expect their own “entitlements,” which presently are driving federal expenditures rapidly upward.



 **Genuine “service” can be compulsory and national.** Service is good. But what is service? It usually is thought to involve some measure of self‐​sacrifice for the benefit of others. To whom is service owed and provided? Government programs ultimately assume that citizens are responsible not to each other, but to the state. MUNS proposals suggest that as a price for being born in the United States one “owes” a year or two of one’s life to Washington. Irrespective of the rhetoric surrounding mandatory universal national service, this approach puts private lives at the disposal of government. However, while Washington can mandate that young people fill particular positions, it cannot force them to compassionately serve.



What America desperately needs is a renewed commitment to individual service. People, in community with one another, should help meet the many needs of those around them. They should be encouraged to do so — by a renewed service ethos, not a new compulsory system.



Leaders throughout society, ranging from lawmakers to clerics to philanthropists to corporate executives, should emphasize that the initial and principal responsibility to help those in need lies with individuals, families, and communities, not government. These leaders should highlight the great needs around us and promote a more traditional sense of compassion, one that emphasizes personal commitment — volunteering both money and time as well as exercising careful stewardship of resources when doing so. Compassion should be understood to reflect an act of community, not discharge of a legal duty, choosing to know, understand, and suffer with those in need.



Moreover, advocates of service should lead by example and encourage an upsurge in participation from the grassroots. People of all ages, not just the young, should be challenged and encouraged, not threatened and penalized. Increased voluntarism should be part time and full time; it should take place within families, churches, and civic and community groups. Service should occur through charitable institutions and profit‐​making ventures. There should be no predetermined definition of service, pattern of appropriate involvement, assumed set of “needs” to be met or tasks to be fulfilled, and certainly no de facto monopoly for Washington. America’s strength is its combination of humanitarian impulses, private associations, and dramatic diversity. Americans need service, not national service, and certainly not mandatory universal national service.



The most obvious role for government: officials should commit themselves to a strategy of “first, do no harm.” Policymakers should confront public programs that discourage personal independence and responsibility, disrupt families and communities, inhibit employment and education, and hinder opportunities for and efforts by people and groups to respond to problems around them. When government acts, it should train personnel to meet the most serious challenges, rather than submerge such tasks in an omnibus program dragooning millions of untrained youth to paint darkened buildings, plant young trees, or do whatever else strikes an influential politician’s fancy. 



Mandatory universal national service is a solution in search of a problem. People serving people benefits everyone. Aiding others ennobles the giver and enriches the recipient. However, the essential core of service is voluntariness, the fact that it is an outgrowth of human compassion, not legal compulsion. Mandatory universal national service would conflict with deeply held American values, violate the Constitution, create an administrative nightmare, and undermine its own objective of creating a more caring America. Such an approach is a bad idea whose time has not come.

"Parenthood is a demanding time for many creatures, and all species that take care of their young are highly motivated to ensure their offspring get the best start to life. Infancy is a crucial time for growth and there is enormous pressure on parents to get newborns gaining weight as quickly as possible to ensure healthy development. Looking after infants so they can thrive in early life without exhausting a parent’s own resources is a difficult balancing act, and we have been studying how mothers and offspring are physiologically linked so that both parties can get the most out of this important time. Best known as the “love” or “cuddle” hormone, oxytocin also influences many other behaviours and biological processes in the body. It is essential for forming bonds with others and behaving socially towards them, and this is true for parents and infants, friends or romantic partners and even pets and their owners. But oxytocin also affects processes related to energy balance in the body, including appetite regulation and weight changes. If these two areas of the hormone’s functionality are linked, then oxytocin release from bonding and interacting could also be affecting weight changes. We have been studying wild grey seals in Scotland to help us understand how the oxytocin release, behaviour and energy balance of mothers and infants are connected. Grey seals come on land to breed once a year and stay in a colony while they rear their pups. They are a great species to study mother-infant dynamics because mothers don’t feed during this time, making it much easier to investigate how they use their energy. The same mothers can also be identified year after year and can be observed over the entire period mothers and pups are together (only 18 days in this species).  The first thing we found was that the levels of oxytocin in mothers and pups are linked, with high-oxytocin mothers producing high-oxytocin pups. This happens because oxytocin acts in a positive feedback loop and can stimulate its own release. Individuals that share a bond are motivated to be together, and the sight, sound and touch of a bonded partner can cause oxytocin release, which in turn leads to more social behaviour between the pair and even more oxytocin release. This can lead to bonded individuals having higher levels of oxytocin in circulation when they are together, which we can use to identify bonded pairs. Having detected oxytocin levels in seal mothers and pups, we could then establish if there was any relationship to weight changes in the pairs. We found the higher the oxytocin levels in pups, the quicker they put on weight. This could have happened if these pups simply drank more milk while they were with their mothers. However, the behavioural data showed that across the range of oxytocin values in the pups there was no difference in the total time spent feeding or how often they fed. We also showed there was no increased weight loss for the high oxytocin mothers who were producing the pups with higher weight gain rates. Remarkably, these pups were gaining more weight per day without any additional energetic input from their mothers. At present, we don’t know why this is happening, but there are a few possible explanations. There may be behavioural reasons, with oxytocin release reducing behaviours that result in unnecessary energy expenditure. Oxytocin encourages individuals to stay close to each other, even in young seals, and by keeping close to their mothers, high oxytocin pups may spend less energy travelling around the breeding colony, getting into trouble with other seals. Pups could also be sheltered from the cold Scottish climate while snuggled up to their mothers, reducing the energy needed to keep warm. However, there are also studies showing that manipulating oxytocin levels can cause changes to fat, bone and muscle development, so it is possible that high oxytocin levels in these pups is directly affecting tissue growth. Understanding the factors affecting infant growth during early life is vital. As oxytocin is found in all mammal species, defining its role linking functional social bonds and optimal weight gain in infants could help us develop interventions for animal husbandry or medical care. In humans, problems with infant nutrition and development are estimated to cause 45% of deaths in children under five globally. By uncovering the physiology underlying interactions between care-givers and infants, we can better understand connections between positive relationships and health, and ultimately help those that are struggling to thrive during this crucial time."

America is the most powerful nation on earth. It possesses the strongest military, largest economy, and dominant culture. Nevertheless, such factors do not necessarily translate into either international respect or popularity.



Indeed, the willingness of other nations to trust the U.S. with its extraordinary power is on the wane. That, in turn undermines American influence. The better this nation’s image, the more foreign governments are likely to cooperate with Washington in advancing shared goals



Of 17 nations for which Pew Research Center has numbers for both 2016 and 2017, only three—Greece, Hungary, and Nigeria—saw a popular uptick for America. All the others were down, some dramatically: Australia (60 to 48), Canada (65 to 43), France (63 to 46), Germany (57 to 35), India (56 to 49), Italy (72 to 61), Japan (72 to 57), Kenya (63 to 54), Netherlands (65 to 37), Poland (74 to 73), South Africa (60 to 53), Spain (59 to 31), Sweden (69 to 45), and United Kingdom (61 to 50).





Support and respect by foreign populations enhances Washington’s influence and encourages foreign governments to cooperate with the U.S. On these measures, at least, the Trump administration is moving America backwards, with no end in sight.



Could this have been due to anything other than the Trump presidency? A Pew Research Center study from last June found the answer to be no. The researchers explained: “Although he has only been in office a few months, Donald Trump’s presidency has had a major impact on how the world sees the United States. Trump and many of his key policies are broadly unpopular around the globe, and ratings for the U.S. have declined steeply in many nations.”



And things are getting worse. A January Gallup poll taken between March and November of 2017 found that foreign approval for U.S. leadership was just 30 percent, down from 48 percent in 2016 (disapproval rose from 28 to 43 percent). That rating is below that for the Bush administration. In contrast, foreign views of Chinese, German, and Russian leadership remained generally positive and unchanged.



Overall, according to Gallup: “The weakened image of the U.S. in 2017 reflects large and widespread losses in approval and relatively few gains. Out of 134 countries, U.S. leadership approval ratings declined substantially—by 10 percentage points or more—in 65 countries that include many longtime U.S. allies and partners—and aspiring U.S. partners.”



The percentage point drop in the Americas and Europe was particularly dramatic (the biggest in the world was Portugal at 51 points; Belgium followed at 44 points.) With only small overstatement, one article on the survey was entitled “Trump’s First Year: Everyone Hates Us Now.”



Americans are aware that the nation’s image waxes and wanes. Ironically, their opinion of how others view the country has remained relatively constant over time. The partisan differences, however, were dramatic. In one poll, eight of ten Republicans said the country was less respected under Obama.



Almost nine of ten Democrats believe the same for Trump. Seven of ten argue that it is a serious problem (the respective GOP numbers were 42 and 28 percent.) In this case, at least, the Democrats are closer to the truth.



While foreigners don’t like “America,” by which many think of Washington, most people overseas like Americans, as in those who live in the U.S. Pew found that from 2013 to 2017 the favorability rating of Americans rose in 11 nations, stayed the same in one, and fell in 16. The numbers remained robust in most countries ‚typically in the 60s through 80s.



There is broad support for U.S. culture and liberties. The global median level of support for the two were 65 percent and 54 percent, respectively. Only in Islamic states and India, which is in the midst of a Hindu nationalist revival, does support drop below a majority. Still, a plurality dislikes U.S. ideas about democracy. That skepticism may reflect the role of U.S. government policy, since Washington often purports to spread “democracy” abroad.



Very different were confidence levels in American presidents. George W. Bush had abysmal ratings when he left office, as low as two percent—two percent!—in Turkey. Barack Obama’s lowest rating was 14 in Jordan. But he enjoyed two in the 90s and seven in the 80s.



The best that can be said for President Trump is that he has nowhere to go but up. In broad sweep, a majority of foreigners see Trump as a strong leader, but even more believe him to be arrogant, dangerous, and intolerant. Seven countries, most notably India and Israel, gave him majority approval last year. He is in single digits in three (lowest is five in Mexico). In another 23 countries his approval is in the teens through the 20s.



Moreover, the vast majority of people abroad oppose signature Trump policies: withdrawing from the Paris climate change convention, building the border wall with Mexico, killing the Iranian nuclear deal, dropping free trade agreements, and banning entry from some Muslim nations.



Residents of 37 nations were asked their opinion; On only one issue did opposition average below 62 percent. His approach received significant support in only four countries. In 16 nations majorities opposed all five policies.



Of course, sometimes the right action might be unpopular. So Washington officials should not pursue popularity to the exclusion of other objectives. However, support and respect by foreign populations enhances Washington’s influence and encourages foreign governments to cooperate with the U.S. On these measures, at least, the Trump administration is moving America backwards, with no end in sight. To the extent that Washington is looking for foreign support, it could be another three or seven years before America’s reputation recovers.
"
"Of course, reality intruded. Fabulousness is no barricade against politics. Reacting to President Trump’s executive order banning the entry of citizens from seven   nations and refugees from any country, designers who are showing their work during the four days of men’s fashion in New York expressed dissent in gestures that, while mainly small and symbolic, added gravitas to the usual   antics and overall frivolity.   models in Robert James’s show at the New York Men’s Day event on Monday carried placards   with pointed messages: “Made in a Sanctuary City” and “Bridges Not Walls. ” At a Private Policy presentation that afternoon, members of a multiracial cast clad in quilted bomber jackets and hot pants had words like “terrorist” stenciled on foreheads or cheeks. Taking a bow at the end of a show on Tuesday, in which models’ faces were obscured behind neoprene ski masks, the   designer Robert Geller wore a sweatshirt that read: “Immigrant. ” And in a spirited introduction to Nick Graham’s   collection on Tuesday, presented against a giant projection of Earth seen from space, Bill Nye  —   the “Science Guy”  —   addressed   deniers with a paean to our fragile atmosphere. You only have to go backstage to see models from nearly every point on the globe  —   India, Mongolia, China and Sudan were just some of the countries that have been represented here this week  —   and to understand that fashion is a plurality undertaking. Sure, the panoply of multiethnic faces is a relatively new addition to a business not always known for welcoming diversity. Yet behind the scenes, fashion has always been global, as Fern Mallis, the former executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, said Tuesday afternoon. “You have no idea how many visa forms I filled out in my career,” Ms. Mallis said, referring to her work on behalf of the craftspeople from distant countries whose skills were essential if American designers’ visions were to be realized. The garment industry itself was built by immigrants, Ms. Mallis noted of a business that continues to be one of the city’s top economic drivers.   societal anxieties seemed to inject themselves into the proceedings in other ways. Take a Krammer  Stoudt presentation frankly inspired by     transients, one in which the baggy layers often worn by “crustys,” or gutter punks, were used as a form of armoring. Or look at the N. Hoolywood show inspired by the designer Daisuke Obana’s and the stylist Tsuyoshi Nimora’s observations of homeless people on a recent   trip. Wearing dazed expressions that made some look as though they had forgotten to take their meds, an array of   models paraded around a Chelsea showroom. The coats they wore were adapted from utility blankets slung over multiple layers. One model wore a denim jacket pulled over a woolen coat squeezed atop a nubby Aran Island fisherman’s sweater that was tucked into a pair of the baggy pants that have been all the rage in Tokyo for a while now and that are slowly making inroads in the West. Still another jacket was knotted at the neck like a scarf. Streets and rail yards are familiar territory in fashion. Few can forget John Galliano’s “homeless chic” 2000 show for Dior, in which purposely raggedy models strutted onto the runway swathed in “newspapers,” clothes with torn linings or   labels, frayed tulle glad rags, belts slung with little green empties of JB whiskey. Editorial writers, homeless advocates and moralists in general seized on that show as proof that fashion and its narcissistic practitioners are hopelessly disconnected from the real world. Yet what those who are quick to deride it often forget is that the glass of fashion is mostly a reflective device. Sure, Mr. Galliano may have misjudged his moment, given that the 2000 Dior collection coincided with a series of raids on shelters and arrests of the homeless directed by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the mayor of New York at the time. The N. Hoolywood collection could also be judged insensitive. Yet it served as a reminder of an often invisible population  —   one that, in light of recent studies showing that in almost no place in the United States can a person working a   week at minimum wage afford a   apartment at fair market rent, seems destined to increase. Home and homecoming were a theme at Billy Reid’s show Monday evening, held in the Cellar of the Beekman hotel, a chic   nestled in the financial district, whose tall structures and windy streets on a cold winter night evoked the “cathedral of Januaries” Frank O’Hara wrote about in “Avenue A. ” The moody, elliptical O’Hara poem was recited at the show by the Tony   actor Alex Sharp to a room full of guests eager to welcome Mr. Reid on his return to the New York fashion fold. “It’s good to be here,” the designer said to the crowd, referring to a period when he sat out the show cycle. And if it is good, indeed, to have the genial Southerner around again, that has less to do with the largely generic designs he presented in a collection inspired, he said, by the Beats (though some elements were more reminiscent of the stuff he used to design for the golfer Greg Norman) than because of his steady and grounding presence in a sometimes shaky industry. Also, he gives a good party. For the last eight summers, Mr. Reid has staged a festival of music, food, drinks and fashion in Florence, Ala. and on Monday, he gathered around him friends from many realms, including the musicians Winston Marshall and the Watson Twins. “Conceptually, it’s about people sharing their talents and inspiring each other,” Mr. Reid said. He also brought in the blues musician Cedric Burnside to offer his rendition of “Love Her ’Til I Die,” along with Karen Elson, the luminous British model turned Nashville singer, who took to a microphone with a tune from her new album, “Double Roses,” as models of both sexes ambled through the crowd. Even without the abundant bourbon, Mr. Reid’s show would surely have had the loose, homey quality of a party you hope will keep going. In this case it did. When it ended, the subterranean space at the Beekman became the “Speakeasy,” and those who didn’t have an early call the next morning stayed on, dancing to the music of a jazz band, Billy and the Rock Bottoms, and a D. J. set by Mr. Marshall. It can almost be predicted that unpredictable pairings will pop up during men’s week, which comes to a close Thursday night, and this one was no exception. Mr. Reid was inspired by the Beats, and so, too, somehow, was Steve Aoki, a star D. J. whose Dim Mak line of   clothes, new to New York, has in only four seasons become a hit in Japan. “I wanted to embody the roots of what all that came from,” Mr. Aoki said in an interview Monday morning at the Roxy Hotel, referring to the punk music he listened to during his college days at the University of California, Santa Barbara. By Mr. Aoki’s reckoning, the lineage of the punk musicians he worshiped (“I almost fell to my knees when I met Jello Biafra,” he said of the Dead Kennedys singer) began with an “upstart hippie movement” that had its counterculture origins in the Beats. “Music is my breadwinner, but fashion is my creative outlet,” said Mr. Aoki, who, in an attempt to be disruptive (though “not obvious”) used quotes from and images of William S. Burroughs throughout his collection. Happily, Mr. Aoki’s music career is thriving since his debut outing at New York Fashion Week: Men’s was paid for from his own pocket. “It’s terrifying to me to show this to critics,” Mr. Aoki said, “but I accept that there are people that won’t accept me. ” His response to that hurdle, he said, is “to just go for it. ” He needn’t have worried. Not only was the Dim Mak collection of   pink hoodies, oversize coats and khakis, and jackets printed with details from paintings by Mr. Aoki’s good friend, the artist (and early Facebook shareholder) David Choe, creditable on a design level, but the presentation itself made for one of the better shows in recent recollection. Having constructed two halfpipes in a large studio at Skylight Clarkson North in Lower Manhattan, the event space for most of the New York Fashion Week: Men’s shows, Mr. Aoki cast 20 local skateboarders to model the collection as they dropped in and did tricks at breakneck speed. With shirttails or coattails flying, skaters like Jazz Leeb, Caleb Yuan, Shane Medanich and Manu Kondo (the sole woman) barreled and spun and rotated across the ramps with, in the background, Mr. Choe and his   band, Mangchi, blaring away at   volume. Backstage after his turn on the ramp, the skateboarder Jordan Zoscak hooted and   Dean Mendez, another athlete. “We nailed it!” Mr. Zoscak said. And it’s true. They did."

From Princeton University
With climate change, heat more than natural disasters will drive people away
Although scenes of people fleeing from dramatic displays of Mother Nature’s power dominate the news, gradual increases in an area’s overall temperature — and to a lesser extent precipitation — actually lead more often to permanent population shifts, according to Princeton University research. 
The researchers examined 15 years of migration data for more than 7,000 families in Indonesia and found that increases in temperature and, to a lesser extent, rainfall influenced a family’s decision to permanently migrate to another of the country’s provinces. They report in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that increases in average yearly temperature took a detrimental toll on people’s economic wellbeing. On the other hand, natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes had a much smaller to non-existent impact on permanent moves, suggesting that during natural disasters relocation was most often temporary as people sought refuge in other areas of the country before returning home to rebuild their lives.
The results suggest that the consequences of climate change will likely be more subtle and permanent than is popularly believed, explained first author Pratikshya Bohra-Mishra, a postdoctoral research associate in the Program in Science, Technology and Environmental Policy (STEP) in Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. The effects likely won’t be limited to low-lying areas or developing countries that are unprepared for an uptick in hurricanes, floods and other natural disasters, she said.
“We do not think of ‘environmental migrants’ in a broader sense; images of refugees from natural disasters often dominate the overall picture,” Bohra-Mishra said. “It is important to understand the often less conspicuous and gradual effect of climate change on migration. Our study suggests that in areas that are already hot, a further increase in temperature will increase the likelihood that more people will move out.”
Indonesia’s tropical climate and dependence on agriculture may amplify the role of temperature as a migration factor, Bohra-Mishra said. However, existing research shows that climate-driven changes in crop yields can effect Mexican migration to the United States, and that extreme temperature had a role in the long-term migration of males in rural Pakistan.
“Based on these emerging findings, it is likely that the societal reach of climate change could be much broader to include warm regions that are now relatively safe from natural disasters,” Bohra-Mishra said.
Indonesia became the case study because the multi-island tropical nation is vulnerable to climate change and events such as earthquakes and landslides. In addition, the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) conducted by the RAND Corporation from 1993 to 2007 provided thorough information about the movements of 7,185 families from 13 of the nation’s 27 provinces in 1993. The Princeton researchers matched province-to-province movement of households over 15 years to data on temperature, precipitation and natural disasters from those same years. Bohra-Mishra worked with co-authors Michael Oppenheimer, the Albert G. Millbank Professor of Geosciences and International Affairs and director of STEP, and Solomon Hsiang, a past Princeton postdoctoral researcher now an assistant professor of public policy at the University of California-Berkeley.
People start to rethink their location with each degree that the average annual temperature rises above 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit), the researchers found. The chances that a family will leave an area for good in a given year rise with each degree. With a change from 26 to 27 degrees Celsius (78.8 to 80.6 Fahrenheit), the probability of a family emigrating that year increased by 0.8 percent when other factors for migration were controlled for. From 27 to 28 degrees Celsius (80.6 to 82.4 Fahrenheit), those chances jumped to 1.4 percent.
When it comes to annual rainfall, families seem to tolerate and prefer an average of 2.2 meters (7.2 feet). The chances of outmigration increased with each additional meter of average annual precipitation, as well as with further declines in rainfall.
Landslides were the only natural disaster with a consistent positive influence on permanent migration. With every 1 percent increase in the number of deaths or destroyed houses in a family’s home province, the likelihood of permanent migration went up by only 0.0006 and 0.0004 percent, respectively.
The much higher influence of heat on permanent migration can be pinned on its effect on local economies and social structures, the researchers write. Previous research has shown that a one-degree change in the average growing-season temperature can reduce yields of certain crops by as much as 17 percent. At the same time, research conducted by Hsiang while at Princeton and published in 2013 showed a correlation between higher temperatures and social conflict such as civil wars, ethnic conflict and street crime.
In the current study, the researchers found that in Indonesia, a shift from 25 to 26 degrees Celsius resulted in a significant 14 to 15 percent decline in the value of household assets, for example. Precipitation did not have a notable affect on household worth, nor did natural disasters except landslides, which lowered assets by 5 percent for each 1 percent increase in the number of people who died.

The article, Nonlinear permanent migration response to climatic variations but minimal response to disasters, by Pratikshya Bohra-Mishra, Michael Oppenheimer and Solomon Hsiang, was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences online on June 23, 2014.

"In September 2019, people from all walks of life stood together, waving banners and leading chants, to demand action on climate change. Across Australia, 300,000 people gathered outside parliaments, in parks and on the streets for the climate strike, creating the largest climate protest in our nation’s history. We envisioned a different future. A future with no new coal, oil or gas projects, 100% renewable energy generation and exports, and a just transition where workers and marginalised communities are supported. Without these changes, we feared a future of melting ice caps, bleached coral, eroding beaches, dangerous heat waves and perpetual bushfires.  We didn’t expect the future that we’re in now. Young people in Australia have lost the freedom that we once took for granted. While in lockdown, we’ve been living, working, studying and socialising within the same four walls, usually while staring at the same little box you’re looking at now. Even for those of us who have come out of lockdown, our world and the possibilities within it have shrunk. Our fears about the effects of climate change now sit alongside the fear of becoming sick from Covid-19, passing it on to our families, the possibility of our marks being affected by studying at home, the likelihood that there won’t be any jobs for us and the debt our generation will be left with once this is all over. We’ve seen government and businesses respond to Covid-19 in a way that we haven’t seen them respond to climate change. Our systems for living, eating, working and healthcare changed radically in a matter of weeks. The increase to jobseeker and the introduction of the jobkeeper payment has supported millions across the country. Covid-19 revealed that the government has the capacity and capability to respond to and prevent crises with the urgency, and at the scale, required. Just as the Covid-19 figures around the country were starting to look up, we’ve seen an outbreak in Victoria which has forced many of us back into lockdown. It’s been a stark reminder that we cannot return to the normality that we knew. The solutions of yesterday – such as coal and gas – are not the solutions that we need to prevent further risks to our future. To return to these profit-driven solutions is to reinforce the systems and institutions which led us here – systems that allow the rich to prosper at the expense of the poor, where profit and short-term economic gains are valued over the social and environmental wellbeing of current and future generations. We can’t simply return to business as usual. The pandemic has presented us with an opportunity to pave a new way forward. To reflect and rebuild towards a society that can adequately mitigate and adapt to the threats that confront humanity now, and into the future. The Commission for the Human Future, in their report Surviving and Thriving in the 21st Century, have identified 10 catastrophic threats which we must address if we are to secure our collective future. These threats include not only pandemics and climate change, but nuclear weapons, scarcity of natural resources, collapse of life-supporting ecosystems, human population growth, pollution, food insecurity, and emerging technologies. By acknowledging the interconnected nature of many of these threats, the commission recognises that they often come from common causes and have common solutions. For example, stopping deforestation would also reduce the likelihood of novel diseases, protect ecosystems which support animal life, increase food security and mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration. Furthermore, improving international cooperation could alleviate risks from catastrophic climate change, nuclear war, pandemics and pollution. As we recover from Covid-19, young people are demanding we take this opportunity to implement systematic changes. Our future hangs in the balance. We must ensure that the decisions made today address these interconnected threats identified by the commission, and lay the foundations for a cleaner, fairer, more secure tomorrow that doesn’t retreat to business-as-usual. • Rachel Hay is a climate activist and arts/law student from southern Tasmania • Hannah Ford is a climate activist and development studies graduate from Canberra"

There’s one economic bogeyman everyone across the political spectrum seemingly loves to hate: big business.



A 2014 ComRes poll reported net trust in “big business” at minus 48pc. In today’s political environment that figure would surely be much worse.



For Corbynite socialists, large corporations personify capitalist inequality and injustice. They deliver extortionate chief executive remuneration and pay workers “poverty wages”, and women less than men. Major companies are said to under invest in staff and dine out off government education and tax credit spending, all the while avoiding their “fair share” in taxes. Others hover, vulture‐​like, to “profiteer” off the NHS and other public services.



Hostilities extend beyond the hard Left. The bank bailouts undermined faith in “big finance”. But discontent now runs wider. Conservatives blame major tech firms for everything from terrorism to child suicide. Brexiteers attack major businesses for seemingly opposing democratic decisions. Government policies, such as gender pay gap reporting, energy price caps and nanny state regulations, further entrench the view that, absent intervention, businesses would rip off workers and customers, ruin our health and impede “social justice.”





Views of big business are extraordinarily harsh. We forget their positive social role at our peril.



Are we all getting a bit carried away here? In his new book, Big Business: A Love Letter to An American Anti‐​Hero, the American economist Tyler Cowen defends large corporations, arguing critics have lost a reasonable sense of perspective. His thought‐​provoking corrective doesn’t argue big business is perfect, but underrated. He is right.



We take the “two straightforward and essential virtues” of business for granted, says Cowen. Companies produce stuff we enjoy and consume, and give vast numbers of us jobs. That saying this sounds so alien shows how far the anti‐​business zeitgeist, pushed through news and culture, permeates our psyche. Most of people’s declared protestations against major companies though are on issues not unique to them or where they are clearly not “worst offenders”.



For a start, large companies pay significantly higher wages than small ones. Office for National Statistics data for 2017 show median full‐​time earnings for businesses with more than 250 employees were 15pc higher than those with 10–49 employees.



The reason is simple: big businesses are generally more productive. They deliver goods or services demanded by others. Huge firms, such as Amazon, Google and the major supermarkets, innovate to provide us new and varied products at affordable prices. The poor benefit most from this.



Jobs provided by major businesses give our lives meaning too. Though we talk of “going to work” disparagingly, productive jobs improve life satisfaction. Evidence presented by Cowen even suggests that, for poorer people, work is a relative safe‐​haven from stress. This is not surprising given the challenges at home for those living in relative poverty. Far from opposing social progress too, large corporations are often the most responsive institutions to evolving norms, sometimes to the annoyance of conservatives. Consider the swift removal of the “racist” chocolate ducklings by Waitrose, social networks controversially banning “hate speech” and the Gillette TV advert denouncing “toxic masculinity”. Firms respond to cultural sensitivities because profits usually require inclusivity and not offending potential customers.



Examples can and will be found of harassment, discrimination and immoral behaviour within large businesses. Enron’s accounting chicanery, Goldman Sachs’s manipulation of derivative markets, and VW’s cheating on emissions spring to mind. But bad conduct is largely a reflection of human frailties, not inherent to big business.



There’s little evidence that big businesses behave worse as a cohort than non‐​profit institutions or governments. Repairmen, door‐​to‐​door salesmen or distant relatives are as likely to rip you off as any large business. HMRC says small businesses as a group are responsible for the largest proportion of unpaid tax.



Yes, some large businesses are too close to politicians and benefit from unjust favours, tax breaks or privileges. But overt cronyism is a smaller problem than imagined. Corporations spend small amounts on lobbying relative to, say, advertising.



Finally, businesses’ role in determining electoral outcomes is also overplayed. No Fortune 100 chief executive donated to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The business community here overwhelmingly opposed Brexit too, although the CBI has lobbied hard for a form of customs union within Theresa May’s proposed Withdrawal Agreement, contributing to today’s current political turmoil.



Yet if big businesses aren’t ripping off workers and customers, resisting social change, engaging in corruption and tax evasion and determining political outcomes relative to other economic groups, then why are they so resented?



Cowen argues that we tend to process thoughts about big businesses as if they are people. That means we often feel disappointed by them when they fail us or aren’t as responsive to our demands as other groups.



While this may be structurally true, it doesn’t satisfactorily explain big businesses’ decline in status in recent decades. Better theories to fit that timeline in the UK would incorporate the financial crisis, government spending restraint alongside corporate tax rate cuts, and the business community largely vacating the pitch in arguing for free enterprise.



More uncomfortable explanations would acknowledge too that globalisation creates big businesses less obviously “British” or “American”, playing into voters’ long‐​noted economic scepticism of all things foreign. Greater demands on business from government to fulfil social policy (on pay, climate change, money laundering and much else) likewise creates more issues for business to “fail” in the public consciousness.



Whatever the reason, Cowen’s central point is undoubtedly correct: views of big business are extraordinarily harsh. We forget their positive social role at our peril.

The German media have been buzzing some with the recent NASA publication warning of rising sea levels for the future, and that we need to be very worried.
Maybe I’m reading more into the lines than I should, but I get the feeling that the increasingly dubious NASA climate science organization is no longer being taken 100% seriously by some major German outlets, who have started to label NASA scenarios and projections as “prophecies”.
For example Germany’s normally politically correct, devout green NTV here has the article bearing the title: “NASA prophesizes gigantic floods“.
Prophecies are more the sort of things one typically expects to hear from prophets. The trouble today is that anyone who claims to be a prophet or to possess prophet-like powers almost always gets equated to being a kook, quack, or charlatan. Moreover being labeled a prophet doesn’t get you much respect either. So you have to wonder about the NTV’s choice of words for the title of its story.
Could NTV journalists really be so dim and naïve as to actually believe in climate prophets?
NTV writes of an organization that seems to fancy itself as having visionary power to see the end of the world. NTV tells us:
An unavoidable sea level rise of at least one meter in the coming 100 to 200 years is the result of the latest research data.”
The NTV report then cites NASA prophet Tom Wagner:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




NASA scientist Tom Wagner says that when the ice sheets break down on each other, even the risk of a sea level rise of three meters over the coming 100 to 200 years is thinkable.”
Okay, these visions may be still a bit fuzzy, but the NASA scientists prophets know almost for sure they are out there. And again the prophecy of doom gets repeated at the end of the article by prophet Steve Nerem:
‘Things will probably get worse in the future,’ prophesizes Nerem as a result of global warming.”
Again this is the NTV using the word “prophesizes”.
Of course there are only a few teensy-weensy problems with NASA’s prophecies of doom. 1) The hundreds of coastal tide gauges show no acceleration in sea level rise and they show a rise that is much less than what has been measured by the seemingly poorly calibrated satellites, 2) polar sea ice has recovered over the past years, 3) polar temperatures have flattened, or are even declining, 4) global temperatures have flattened, and 5) there’s a growing number of scientists who are now telling us that we should be expecting global cooling over the coming decades.
Moreover, new Greenland data show growing ice (more on this tomorrow).
I’ll let the readers judge for themselves on whether NASA scientists are true prophets, or if they are behaving more like snake oil peddling charlatans.
Myself I’ve lost all respect for the space organization. It’s become a grossly distorted caricature of what scientific research is about.
200 years in the future… yeah, right!

"As a climate scientist of more than 25 years, I’m proud of the work my profession has done in recent decades to alert humanity to the unfolding climate crisis. But as the emergency becomes ever more acute, we scientists need to alter the way we approach it – or face being part of the problem. Climate science has in large part been a remarkable success story. Swedish physicist Svante Arrhenius accurately calculated how much a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would warm the planet as early as 1896. The 1979 Charney report raised concerns about an impending climate crisis long before we could directly evidence it. In response, the scientific community stepped up its research efforts, and has been conducting regular scientific assessments to build a consensus view, and send a strong message to policy makers to spur them into action. The problem is that 40 years of these efforts, however well-intentioned, have not had any impact on the carbon course of humanity. Since the middle of the 19th century, CO₂ emissions from human activities have been growing exponentially, on average by 1.65% per year since 1850. There were times when economic hardships temporarily stalled emissions, such as the oil price shocks of the early 1980s, the collapse of the Soviet block, and the 2008 financial crisis. But these had nothing to do with climate policy. If we continue this exponential rise for just five more years, we will have already exhausted the carbon allowance that gives us a two-thirds chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C. That’s according to the IPCC, the UN body responsible for communicating the science of climate breakdown. Other scientists estimate that we have already missed the boat. Our painful sluggishness to act is not the fault of scientists. But the crisis is now more urgent than ever, and our current approach to it is starting to make us part of the problem. Scientists are by nature conservative. This tendency is intimately linked to the way science operates: before a new theory is accepted it needs to be repeatedly scrutinised to make sure we are absolutely sure it holds up. Usually, this is good practice. But it has caused climate scientists to consistently underestimate both the speed at which the climate is destabilising, and the severity of the threat it poses. 


      Read more:
      Climate scientists may not be the best communicators of climate threats


 The IPCC is a chief culprit for this. It has the added difficulty of having to seek ratification from the world’s governments for its summary reports, and has been consistently singled out for underselling the impending crisis. The scientists across the world that contribute to the body’s reports must heed its track record of mistaken conservatism, and adjust their approach going forward. Uncertainties are of course inherent in modelling how and when the climate will destabilise, but when the stakes are as high as they are, we must operate on the precautionary principle – the normal burden of proof on scientists should be reversed. At the current level of 1.1℃ of global heating, climate change and ecological breakdown are already displacing and killing hundreds of thousands of humans, and sending other species towards extinction. Above 1.5℃ though, risks to humanity and ecosystems amplify greatly. 


      Read more:
      Climate change will displace millions in coming decades. Nations should prepare now to help them


 Yet the UN’s target for global carbon emissions to reach net zero by 2050 only gives us about a one-in-two chance of limiting global heating to below this level. This target is based on one of multiple potential pathways laid out by IPCC scientists in a special report in 2018. Professions such as doctors wouldn’t take such a punt on preserving life if better odds were available. Why is the same not true of climate scientists? We need to shift both our own and society’s ideas about what is an acceptable level of risk to offer government leaders, and therefore the living planet’s inhabitants. Even the above pathways to a half-chance of limiting heating to 1.5℃ rely on unproven technologies to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere in the second half of the century. They also fail to take into account the political landscape in which these models are being applied. Leaders are well aware that the three to four degrees warming we’re headed for may be beyond civilisation’s ability to adapt, and yet are still to make any serious headway in phasing out global fossil fuel subsidies that total at least USD$100 billion a year.

      Not convinced on the need for urgent climate action? Here's what happens to our planet between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming


 In the face of a genuine existential threat to our civilisation, we scientists need to shift our focus from long-term models that give a false sense of control over the climate crisis and paint drastic emissions cuts as easily achievable. Instead, we should focus on vulnerability in the here and now. For example, our global food system is already vulnerable to extreme weather events. If drought strikes in several countries at the same time, there are no guarantees that our food supply chains – in which deliveries arrive “just-in-time” to minimise costs – will not experience collapses in the next decade or two. Yet compared to the vast amount of research focused on the uncertain impacts of global heating on humanity by 2050 and 2100, we know worryingly little about just how fragile our supply chains – or other parts of our highly efficient clockwork global economy – are in the near-term. Refocusing resources on such dramatically under-researched short-term vulnerabilities is vital, not least because it will make the climate and ecological crisis feel more close to home than abstract carbon budgets and temperature rises. Ultimately, the way the world responds to the impending crisis depends on the extent to which its citizens and leaders feel radical action is necessary. By reframing our research and changing accepted levels of risk and uncertainty, perhaps climate scientists can finally help humanity change its carbon course.

We have written previously on _[The BFD](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/massey-university-bury-free-speech-in-paperwork/)_ about Massey University’s recently announced [free speech](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/massey-university-bury-free-speech-in-paperwork/) (snort!) policy and [rules](https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/fms/PolicyGuide/Documents/e/external-speaker-code-of-practice.pdf). Sadly, just like George Orwell’s [Ministry of Truth](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/andrew-littles-ministry-of-truth/) which was actually the Ministry of Propaganda, their free speech is anything but free.



[Stephen Franks](http://www.stephenfranks.co.nz/continuing-devaluation-of-massey-on-your-cv/) writes that _“Massey Council has doubled down on its mission to function as a college of woke theology.”_



The chilling thing is that the Massey Council feel confident of getting away with it. In a healthy academic culture, staff and students would not allow themselves, and the future value of the qualifications and experience on their CVs, to be governed by such feeble pap. They should be ensuring the rapid removal of bosses unfit for academic discourse. The claim to gagging powers is so poorly disguised.



[…] Following is a version of what has become the leading form of re-commitment to free speech by US academic institutions. It is promoted by an influential body (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) usually called [FIRE. ](https://www.thefire.org/about-us/mission/) Chicago University made a statement notable for its unapologetic defense of freedom of thought and speech. The following draft customizes that version for New Zealand



 _Because [INSTITUTION] is committed to free and open inquiry in all matters, it **guarantees** all members of the [INSTITUTION] community **the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn.** Except insofar as limitations on that freedom are necessary to the functioning of [INSTITUTION], [INSTITUTION] fully respects and supports the freedom of all members of the [INSTITUTION] community “to discuss any problem that presents itself.”_



 _Of course, the ideas of different members of the [INSTITUTION] community will often and quite naturally conflict. But **it is not the proper role of** [INSTITUTION] **to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply offensive.** Although [INSTITUTION] greatly values civility, and although all members of the [INSTITUTION] community share in the responsibility for maintaining a climate of mutual respect, **concerns about civility and mutual respect can never be used as a justification for closing off discussion of ideas,** however offensive or disagreeable those ideas may be to some members of our community._



 _The freedom to debate and discuss the merits of competing ideas does not, of course, mean that individuals may say whatever they wish, wherever they wish. [INSTITUTION] may **restrict expression that violates the law,** that falsely defames a specific individual, that constitutes a genuine threat or harassment, that unjustifiably invades substantial privacy or confidentiality interests, or that is otherwise directly incompatible with the functioning of [INSTITUTION]. In addition, [INSTITUTION] may reasonably regulate the time, place, and manner of expression to ensure that it does not disrupt the ordinary activities of [INSTITUTION]. But these are **narrow exceptions** to the general principle of freedom of expression, and it is vitally important that these exceptions never be used in a manner that is inconsistent with [INSTITUTION]’s commitment to a completely free and open discussion of ideas._



 _In summary, [INSTITUTION]’s fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the [INSTITUTION] community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong-headed. It is for the individual members of the [INSTITUTION] community, not for [INSTITUTION] as an institution, to make those judgments for themselves, and to act on those judgments **not by seeking to suppress speech, but by openly and vigorously contesting the ideas that they oppose.** Indeed, fostering the ability of members of the [INSTITUTION] community to engage in such debate and deliberation in an effective and responsible manner is an essential part of [INSTITUTION]’s educational mission._



 _As a corollary to [INSTITUTION]’s commitment to protect and promote free expression, members of the [INSTITUTION] community must also act in conformity with the principle of free expression. Although members of the [INSTITUTION] community are free to criticize and contest the views expressed on campus, and to criticize and contest speakers who are invited to express their views on campus, **they may not obstruct or otherwise interfere with the freedom of others to express views** they reject or even loathe. To this end, [INSTITUTION] has a solemn responsibility not only to promote a lively and fearless freedom of debate and deliberation, but also to protect that freedom when others attempt to restrict it._

UPDATE: Latest GFDL model output suggests Bastardi could be right, see below.
UPDATE2: New information from Bastardi here shows 4th of July nightmare is shaping up to be true.
The Case for Rapid Development Feedback of a Potential Tropical Storm: Arthur.
NASA Satellite image of the disturbance off the east coast of Florida at 8:40am.
Guest essay by Joe Bastardi, WeatherBell Analytics.
In the old days, one never had to worry about anything but hitting the forecast.  But times have changed. With an agenda out there to take any weather event that attracts attention and turn into into a reason that an AGW driven atmospheric apocalypse is upon us, one has to make sure the physical grounds are stated before hand for why the event can occur.
We are faced with a potential nightmare.. a tropical cyclone coming at the outer banks on the July 4 weekend. I already have this as an 80 knot storm by July 4th, right on top of the North Carolina coast. That represents the mid ground of a fear this can be stronger. The post Sunday on Weatherbell.com on this outlined why.  To refresh your memory, a look at the ECMWF 200 mb pattern Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, indicates why this can deepen so much, and as a matter of fact is in a prime area to do so.

The Wed AM outflow channel is developing to the northwest,  with  north winds on the east side. The storm position is marked by the X on the map below:

Thursday morning:

Finally,  Friday morning…Even here it is still in the “upward motion” quadrant of the jet to the north (right  front entrance) though by this time the best conditions start to fade. But by this time the center has battered the outer banks.

The seawater, like the end game of the last AMO in the 1950s, is very warm along the east coast.

from: http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/anomaly/anomwnc.gif
Again this warm seawater is a product of the natural cyclical function of the AMO in its mature stage.
You can read about that here: http://patriotpost.us/opinion/26136
As I posted on it, and the Weatherbell.com preseason forecast outlined our great concern about in close development/intensification this season, a product of the overall climatic pattern we are in (again similar to the 1950s).
Storms coming to the coast in their intensification stage will often use frictional effects to feedback and intensify. A large powerful , mature hurricane in the same position might weaken, its expanse  and interaction with the trough  causing an extensive area of rain cooled air to be pulled in to the storm. But a smaller storm may actually intensify, since it is not yet large enough to pull in the rain cooled air and the frictional affects, may tighten the bands up.  The large scale pattern that may weaken a major storm, may be conducive to deepening a smaller one.
Look at it this way.  If you have 2 people, one used to 3000 calories a day, one used to 1000 calories and they sit down to a  2000 calorie meal every day for a week, the larger person would lose weight, the lighter gain weight.  The common thread of this is rarely recognized in storms.  But the smaller the storm, the better the chance it can deepen. Think of Katrina approaching Florida as a small storm with ideal conditions for development.
She deepened right to the coast. But when she got very large, a cat 5, in the same place the much smaller Camille in 1969 was a cat 5, she started to weaken, while Camille maintained the core winds right to the coast.  My point here being that what is good for the goose is not always good for the gander, and this storm has alot going for it.
Lets take a similar example:  Hurricane Alex in 2004 which battered the outer banks and was worse than the forecast from official sources had,  with wind gusts over 115 mph reported.
The track of Alex in 2004:

Alex exploded in 42 hours from a  35 kt minimal TS  to  85 kt storm. Notice the similar 200 mb pattern:
00z  Aug 2  2004

00a Aug  3 2004

00z  Aug  4,2004

By the way, a storm in the article above, Gerda in 1969, also “exploded” up the east coast in spite of interaction with an approaching trough. A first, with smaller storms, these troughs help ventilate the storms in the northwest quad. The smaller the storm, the tougher the forecast situation.
In addition, El Niño seasons are known for in-close deepeners. The strongest May storm on record in 1951 was Able, in a warm ENSO.  Audrey was  the strongest storm on record in June, 1957. Interestingly enough, in El Niño seasons, many of the first storms are strong ( more examples Betsy, 1965,  Alicia 1983,  Andrew was coming off the 91-92 El Niño and 2004 was an El Niño season, the year of the aforementioned Alex!
But if this does explode (again we have been on top of this…) the first alert for the HURRICANE  threat on the outer banks to clients, then public followers, was Saturday), it has nothing to do with .04% of the atmosphere. It has  everything to do with the physical reality of the pattern,  which we have seen before. Since we see a similar set up, we have to be on guard against a similar event.
There is nothing mystical or magical about it. That it would grab headlines of a major resort area on arguably the biggest summer holiday of the season, means the threat  of spinning it  for an agenda is there. I cherish the day when  the only kind of spinning we have to deal with is what the atmosphere  does, not what people using the atmosphere for their agenda spin it for.
There is a why before the what in a case like this if it does deepen, and it has nothing to do with global warming/climate change/AGW.
UPDATE: Latest GFDL model shows the speed, position, and central pressure forecasts for Friday, July 4th.

Press Release: **New Conservative**



The Labour led coalition government is continuing to create homelessness. The impact of immigration, [failure of Kiwibuild,](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/kiwibuild-lets-not-do-this/) and [attacks on the rental market](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/government-responsible-for-rising-rents/), have resulted in the opposite outcomes that New Zealanders were promised.



With 56,000 new immigrants last year, less than 300 houses built by Kiwibuild, and decreasing rental property availability due to [government policy and regulations ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/why-would-anyone-want-to-be-a-landlord/)that have made it unattractive to own rental property, New Zealand is now effectively **importing homelessness.**



“This government is failing its citizens, and the immigrants they are allowing into the country, when they cannot deliver necessities such as a place to live,” says Leighton Baker, New Conservative leader.



“For the past two years New Conservative has been calling for a period of net zero immigration so that we are able to rectify the shortfalls that already exist.



“Our immigration system is overloaded, with sources telling us that applications submitted in April are only just being processed now. The harm and false hope that is being created while good people are being held in limbo by a system that cannot cope is unacceptable,” observes Mr Baker.



Advocating for immigration must be based on reality, not ideology. New Conservative is committed to developing immigration policy that attracts the right people in a manageable process.



“We must cater for our existing population first and then be forward thinking with our immigration policies,” continues Mr Baker.



For immigration to be effective it is essential that serious consideration be given to how many people Immigration New Zealand can comfortably process each year, the number of houses available, and what jobs will be available in the long term.



“If we do not pause to ensure we are making considered decisions now, New Zealand is at risk of importing future beneficiaries,” adds Mr Baker.



New Zealand is suffering from the quick-fix solution of imported capability, rather than investing in the long term benefits of effective trade training and skills development .



“Rather than investing in New Zealand to strengthen and support its citizens, this Government has squandered enormous tax payer dollars on such things as [firearms confiscation,](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/stuart-nashs-buggers-muddle-gun-law-changes/) first year tertiary free, endless consultation groups, Kiwibuild failures, and more recently the destructive policy of the Climate Change Response [(Zero Carbon)](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/new-conservative-says-no-to-zero-carbon-tax/) Amendment Act 2019,” says Mr Baker.



New Zealanders have their livelihood placed at risk through unplanned, poorly managed immigration, with housing and infrastructure failing to keep step.



“New Conservative is deeply concerned that our own citizens are suffering as a result of a reliance on immigration as the cure-all of our problems,” concludes Mr Baker.

Guest opinion: Dr. Tim Ball | When Did It Occur?
Lack of information is a major problem in reconstructing and understanding climate and climate mechanisms. H.H.Lamb gave it as his reason for creating the Climatic Research Unit (CRU).
“…it was clear that the first and greatest need was to establish the facts of the past record of the natural climate in times before any side effects of human activities could well be important.”
Notice he is talking about “the facts”, which includes data and other measures. Chief among the other measures are accurate chronologies, which is why he discusses dates and dating methods at some length in Volume 2 of his Climate, Present, Past and Future.
Lamb also divided climate studies into three major areas based on time and method. The secular or instrumental period covers at most 100 years. Few stations are longer and almost all are in Western Europe or eastern North America. The historical period includes the recorded works of humans and covers at most 3000 years. The biologic/geologic record covers the remainder of time. The degree of accuracy diminishes both in measures, such as temperature and precision of dates, as you go back in time. One tragedy of the “hockey stick” rarely discussed was that it misused and demeaned the value of one of the few measures that transcends two or three of these divisions.
Climate is the study of change over time, or average conditions in a region. It is almost impossible to study climate change without accurate dates. For example, a major debate in climatology is the extent to which climate is cyclical. If the dates of events are inaccurate, it is not possible to determine the length of cycles and how they interact. You can, and likely will, draw completely wrong conclusions.
For example, I participated in a fur trade history conference when a paper by an historian claimed ice conditions on Lake Michigan occurred at very different dates than today and were proof of climate change. His source was a fur trader’s journal. Questioning revealed he was unaware that the fur trader used a Julian Calendar and the British government changed to the Gregorian Calendar in 1752, adding eleven days. (Figure 1)

Figure 1
Calendar changes are just one example of disconnects, between our thinking, understanding, teachings, and reality. Calendars are essentially fixed, human constructs, while nature is constantly changing. The Egyptians, among others, struggled with this problem. Their calendar had 12 months of 30 days, which was so out of phase with reality after 400 years they simply declared a holiday for the missing five days. Later, they decided that flooding of the Nile, critical to their food production, was the beginning and end of their year. They tied it to a physical event, namely the rising of the Dog Star, Sirius.
The Egyptian change was triggered by the growing discrepancy with natural events. The change from Julian to Gregorian was mostly pushed by the gap between the agricultural seasons and natural events. Annual climate change is problematic, but it becomes even more complex when dealing with segments of the year, such as seasons. Most significant dates in the human calendar are related to the interaction between climate, nature and food supply. The Farmers Almanac and much folklore is accumulated empirical information about agriculture, the weather and climate. The problem is so much of it is related to a specific region. For example, English proverbs say, “If the leaves do not fall before St Martin’s (November 11), expect a cold winter.” Or, A green Christmas, a fat churchyard.” It is apparent these are related to the pattern of the Circumpolar Vortex, but the impact depends on the latitude and the longer climate pattern of the time. Conditions were quite different between the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). The problem is exacerbated when the proverb was created in Europe and was then transposed to another part of the world.
Another problem for calendars, and dating in general, is establishing a datum. The millennium change to the 21st century triggered much discussion about eliminating AD and BC. Radiocarbon dating, discussed later, established January 1st 1950 AD as the base year and called it 1950 BP for Before Present. The switch to the new millennium was interesting because it ushered in the era of exploitation of extreme alarmism. Known as Y2K, many claimed computers would fail because of the inability to switch to the new date sequence. They scared people so much that everyone celebrated in the wrong year. Technically, the new millennium begins in 2001, but the celebration occurred in 2000. Maybe we should have a calendar that begins with the Big Bang, but then, what would the error range be?
Robert Claiborne wrote a book (1978) titled Climate, Man and History. It received little academic attention because Claiborne was, to say the least, a man of eclectic interests. He was too diversified for the increasingly narrow, specialized, academic world. The book intrigued me because it addressed an issue that troubled me, namely that I was getting different dates and sequences of events in different university courses. Claiborne noted that anthropologists were on a different time-scale than glaciologists and climatologists. As I recall, he wanted to do a doctoral thesis on the subject, but it was rejected, so he wrote the book instead.
Two Dating Categories in Climate
Lamb identified Absolute and Relative as the two major divisions of dating in climate studies. They are the same divisions anthropologists use as they try to create an accurate chronology for pre-history. It is mandatory for understanding cause and effect.
Relative Dating is the simplest because it relates events to a fixed or known date. For example, in parts of North America archeologists, a branch of physical anthropology, determine if an event is pre- or post Mazama. This is reference to a layer of volcanic ash laid down across the continent by eruption of Mt Mazama, now marked by the enormous caldera filled by Crater Lake.
Relative Dating is dependent on Absolute Dating. Technically, all you can say accurately is that an event occurred before or after the Absolute Dating event. Of course, this assumes Absolute Dating has an absolute precision, but that is not the case.
Problems occur because of the early assumption that certain natural events occur with an absolute precision. This created many problems and caused many changes in understanding sequences of events. Two examples will illustrate them as they relate to climate.
Radiocarbon dating was developed from concepts proposed by Willard Libby in 1933, however, they only became established after WW II. It was quickly adopted by archaeology and gradually intruded into other disciplines, where sequence and timing of events was critical.
Milankovitch created a cycle of climate conditions that indicated a glaciation sequence in Alaska. Radiocarbon dating of trees for a region conflicted with his chronology. Since radiocarbon was ‘new’ and ‘more scientific’ it over rode Milankovitch. Prior to 1950, his theory was generally accepted, but after that it was rejected. I recall conferences in the 1960s and 70s at which any reference of a cyclical trend to Milankovitch was automatically rejected. His son, in a poignant article about his father’s lifework, claimed he died of a broken heart. It was not until the late 1980s that I heard a paper referencing Milankovitch, with no challenge.
Figure 2
Part of the reason for the change was that an error in assumption about radiocarbon dating was discovered. As one article explains,
Every scientific method has its limitations. This is because the fundamental assumptions or axioms, on which a method like carbon dating is based, are only approximately true or accurate. All the physical laws we know have limits of validity. The fact that scientific methods like these, fail beyond a certain domain of approximation, doesn’t make them redundant. It only means that these need to be used with caution and with a knowledge of the limits of their accuracy.
Most forms of absolute dating involve supposedly precise measurable rates of a natural process, like the rate of decay of carbon 14. It sounds precise, but all measures are presented with a range, which increases as you extend back, to the maximum range of the technique, 60,000 years. A classic example is the radiocarbon dates for the Shroud of Turin, which are given as 1260-1390 AD with a 95 percent confidence; the range of 130 years covers most of the modern instrumental record. It is a good example because the fervent and political interest means the problems and limitations of the method are discussed to an extreme level. A computer search for absolute dating methods returns many sources from a creationist perspective. Ironically, this vulnerability illustrates the problems with scientific dating techniques.
Another form of radioactive decay and the one most widely used, is Potassium/Argon (K-Ar) dating. This measures the measures the decay of Potassium- 40 to Argon-40. A list of the assumptions required for reasonable results was set out by McDougall and Harrison (1999), and puts severe limitations on the viability of the results. A general claim is an accuracy of one percent, which sounds good. However, one percent of one million years is 10,000 years and in climate that effectively covers the Holocene. In reality, none of these so-called precise methods, even radiocarbon dating, are accurate enough for climate studies.
The Holocene is an example of another problem related to dating and climate. When did it begin? Who decided what temperature threshold was met and when? Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) advocates exploit this problem of dating when it suits them. For example, they claim the Medieval Warm Period or the Little Ice Age did not occur because evidence shows they were not uniformly global. Climate studies try to deal with this by the procedure of relative homogeneity. In my study of climate at Churchill, Manitoba I also examined the climate at York Factory, 220 km apart, to determine and separate regional from local change.
This article cannot cover all the forms and methods of establishing absolute or relative dating. Its goal is to raise the issue of the limits of the methods and subsequent accuracy. Both are essential to understanding climate and especially climate change. However, a brief list of those that have influenced climate change studies includes: Rhythmites, such as sediment layers, tree rings, and ice layers; Lichenometry, is based on the rate of growth of lichens, which is assumed to be slow and constant; and Palynology that counts the number of pollen types in a core to provide a relative sequence of changing vegetation. Notice the dangers of autocorrelation because all of these are caused by climate change.
The right century may be enough accuracy for a shroud, but is inadequate for a climate study. Accurate dating is essential for establishing the relationship between events. The specific periodicities are crucial in achieving accurate prediction and establishing correct relationships of cause and effect. Lamb’s concerns are just as valid today as when he expressed them. If anything, they are a bigger problem because people use them without understanding the limitations. As the earlier quote said,
The fact that scientific methods like these, fail beyond a certain domain of approximation, doesn’t make them redundant. It only means that these need to be used with caution and with a knowledge of the limits of their accuracy.

"**A Facebook engineer has quit the firm, saying they**""can no longer stomach"" **being part of an organisation ""profiting off hate"".**
Ashok Chandwaney is the latest employee to go public with concerns about how the company deals with hate speech.
The engineer added it was ""choosing to be on the wrong side of history"".
Facebook responded by saying it had removed millions of hate-related posts. Another of its ex-engineers has also come to its defence.
The thrust of the post by Ashok Chandwaney - who uses ""they"" and ""them"" as personal pronouns - is that Facebook moves quickly to solve certain problems, but when it comes to dealing with hate speech, it is more interested in PR than implementing real change.
Their five and a half years tenure at the firm meant ""learning about a bug in a meeting, and fixing it before the meeting is over"", they write.
""The contrast between that and our approach to hate on the platform is astonishing.
""To me being bold means seeing something that's hard to do but, knowing it's the right thing to do, rolling up my sleeves and diving in.""
White nationalism and the use of the platform by far-right militias were among the things they felt Facebook needed to do more on, as well as regulating other political content.
""Every day 'the looting starts, the shooting starts' stays up is a day that we choose to minimise regulatory risk at the expense of the safety of black, indigenous and people of colour.""
Facebook's refusal to remove that comment, posted by President Trump during the Black Lives Matter protests, was in contrast to Twitter, which labelled it as glorifying violence.
The stance led several employees to leave, with others staging walk-outs. And advertisers boycotted the platform for the month of July, over its attitude to hate speech.
Facebook responded to the engineer's post, saying: ""We don't profit from hate. We invest billions of dollars each year to keep our community safe and are in deep partnership with outside experts to review and update our policies.
""This summer we launched an industry-leading policy to go after QAnon, grew our fact-checking program, and removed millions of posts tied to hate organisations, over 96% of which we found before anyone reported them to us.""
QAnon is a conspiracy theory that believes US President Trump is waging a secret war against a ""deep state"" network of paedophiles, some of whom are powerful government, business and media figures.
Some employees were willing to defend the social network.
Stepan Parunashvili - who worked as a software engineer at Facebook for four years up to 2019 but has since co-founded his own business - told the BBC that the social network needed time to think through the issues involved.
""Changing the definition of 'hate', even with very good intentions, is dangerous and riddled with tail risks,"" he explained,
""In my opinion Facebook is aware of that, and is treating this very seriously.
""They are not 'moving fast' on changing the definition of free speech, and that is a great thing.""
Facebook employs thousands of engineers, and they are among the most highly-paid employees at the tech firm.
Regulators and policy-makers around the world are concerned about the growth of hate speech, not just on Facebook but on all social media platforms, with many countries launching enquiries into how the tech firms are dealing with the issue."

Meet Marcail Parkinson, today’s crybaby of the week and a normal teen, especially when it comes to wailing on about plastic.



Walking down a supermarket aisle lined with plastic wrappers is enough to set off “ **massive anxiety”** for Marcail Parkinson.



The 17-year-old Auckland high school student feels dread, and shopping trips can become “quite **overwhelming”**.



Before the plastic bag ban, if Parkinson forgot to take reusable bags to the supermarket she would walk out “ **feeling really, really bad** about what (I had) just done”. 



A plastic-wrapped purchase lead (sic)to an “overwhelming sense of **guilt”.**



Oh really? An overwhelming sense of guilt you say?



What about guilt for wearing a **disposable** (the worst kind of plastic) plastic raincoat?



What about guilt for surrounding yourself in a reusable thick plastic raincoat?



What about guilt for using a spray can with its ozone depleting propellant, a plastic safety vest and synthetic soled shoes? Any sense of guilt there?



Loving the leather couch. I wonder if she is aware that leather comes from [evil farting cows?](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/jacinda-funds-satellite-to-track-cow-farts/)



Then there is the plastic neckwear at some conference. She doesn’t look as if she is feeling guilty or anxious there.



Of course we have seen this teenager before. She is the sweetheart who reads books upside down.



Here’s a handy hint for climate warriors and normal teenagers in particular. It is a good idea to get your life and social media in order before you run off to the media with your crybaby stories of woe. The media don’t care if you end up exposed for being a normal plastic using person after they enable your claims for clicks.



If you are going to make yourself out to be a climate warrior then you need to make sure that there is no plastic obvious in your social media such as your glasses, your clothes, your phone and everything else you likely touch. The same goes for wearing metals like gold around your neck since extractive mining causes environmental damage. 



Or alternatively shun the limelight, forget about trying to be a Kiwi Greta Thunberg and just enjoy your teenage years.

"We’re about 600 to 3, 000 feet below the ocean’s surface. It’s cold, it’s dark and it’s slow down here. If you’re lucky, it’s blue in the daytime and black at night. And the deeper we go, the darker it gets. Welcome to the twilight zone, fishies. There’s not much to eat and no green plants growing either. Here, you eat what you can get, and find a way to eat it, or you starve. It’s weird down here, in the mesopelagic zone of the deep sea. Creatures can be sluggish, but they are well adapted. Some use big eyes to find prey. Others make their own flashlights. Big mouths help predators eat big prey. That may be why barbeled dragonfishes have special head joints that allow them to open up their mouths 120 degrees and swallow big prey whole. This flexible head joint, described for the first time in a study published on Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, is unlike any other known to science. Nalani Schnell, a zoologist at the French National Museum of Natural History, had already discovered that different groups of barbeled dragonfishes had an unusual gap between their heads and necks that other fishes don’t have. Some gaps were the result of a missing first vertebrae. Others resulted from the absence of a spine, filled in instead with an elongated notochord, a flexible rod made up of something similar to cartilage. To find out the function of these gaps, Dr. Schnell teamed up with Dave Johnson, a zoologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Together, they obtained five divergent groups of the species from museum collections, macerated the flesh from their bodies and stained the bones different colors. This allowed them to actually move the bones around, which led to the discovery that the gap was a functional joint that allows the fish’s head to move up and out. “In most other fishes, the head has a strong connection to the rest of the body, without much flexibility,” Dr. Schnell wrote in an email, which is a stabilizing force during swimming. But “the barbeled dragonfishes are    (ambush) predators, and prey items are scarce in the  . ” As the species diverged into different groups, the flexible gaps in the more primitive fish developed into “an actual folding apparatus that makes this a true joint,” Dr. Johnson said. “There are no other fishes that have that sort of a directional, complex articulation. ” A joint that allows them to open their mouths wide is advantageous because they can engulf large prey that can sustain them for long periods of no food. Like the moray eel, barbeled dragonfishes use a second set of teeth to pull the large prey into their bodies to digest it. “Imagine yourself out in the middle of the ocean, and you’re trying to make a living. You’re going to eat anything you can, if you think it isn’t going to kill you,” Dr. Johnson said. “You don’t bypass this thing because it’s too big to eat, because you don’t know when you’re going to see another meal. ”"
"**Facebook has apologised after it placed adverts on a publicly funded TV network's website without permission.**
People who visited the website of Danish broadcaster DR via the Facebook iOS app were served with unauthorised third-party advertisements.
A spokesman for the broadcaster said it had still not been made aware of how many users had been affected.
Facebook said the incident was caused by a coding error that had since been resolved.
News site Digiday reported that the issue first came to light last week, when a user complained about being targeted with adverts while visiting DR's website.
DR is publicly funded via a licence fee and does not allow ads on any of its platforms.
A spokesman for Facebook said a coding error ""caused some people to see interstitial ads within news content in the Facebook app"".
âWe apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused,"" he added.
**'Very unhappy'**
The broadcaster said it was deeply concerned by the error.
âWe are happy to see Facebook recognise the mistake and are happy that the issue has been fixed,â said DR's distribution editor Christian Loiborg.
âWe are still very unhappy with the fact that users may have been served ads alongside any visits to dr.dk and have stressed the seriousness of this to Facebook,"" he added.
Last month, Facebook said that new changes to Apple's operating system could see it lose out on most of the revenue it currently receives from ads on apps.
In the forthcoming iOS 14, apps have to explicitly ask users' permission to collect and share data, meaning ads will no longer be able to just ""follow"" users to apps outside of Facebook."
"**Thailand is prosecuting Facebook, Google, and Twitter over a failure to remove what it says are illegal posts.**
Officials did not say exactly what they contained but also announced they would take action against individual users for insulting the monarchy.
Under Thailand's strict ""lese-majeste"" laws, doing so can result in a prison sentence.
This is the first time that computer-crime laws have been used to target the platforms themselves.
The announcement follows mass protests in the country demanding political reform.
""We've notified the companies and sent them warnings twice, but they haven't complied with all the requests,"" digital minister Puttipong Punnakanta told Reuters news agency.
He said the matter had now been referred to cyber-crime police for prosecution.
At issue were 661 Facebook posts, of which the company removed 225; 69 on Twitter, of which five were removed, and 289 YouTube links, which were removed on Wednesday after the deadline, according to the Bangkok Post.
Under the computer-crimes law, the social-media companies can be fined 200,000 baht (Â£4,970) for ignoring a court order to take down posts - and an extra 5,000 baht every day until it is removed.
In August, Facebook blocked access to a one million-strong Facebook group in Thailand that discussed the monarchy, after a threat of legal action from the Thai government.
At the time, Facebook told the BBC it was preparing its own legal action in response to pressure from authorities there.
The accompanying announcement about action against individual users follows an anti-government protest last week.
Only a handful of prominent accounts are believed to be involved in that.
The protest in Bangkok involved thousands of people calling for reform of the country's political system - including the role the monarchy plays.
Police estimated about 15,000 people took part; organisers claimed 50,000 did so.
The calls for reform of the monarchy are highly sensitive. Thailand's criminal code allows for prosecution for criticism of the royal family - often in secret trials, resulting in long prison sentences.
Human rights groups allege that the law has been used as a way of limiting free speech and calls for reform.
Facebook and Twitter declined to comment on the case, and Google has yet to respond."
"QUEBEC  —   From the outside, the Islamic Cultural Center’s building in the Ste.  neighborhood of Quebec City looks more like a medical center than a place of worship. But it is very much the heart of the city’s Muslim community and, now, a site of tragedy. Several of the six people killed by a gunman at the mosque during Sunday night prayers lived in the surrounding neighborhood, which is dominated by postwar brick houses and   apartments. Others had initially come to the area to study or teach at Laval University in Ste. . They came from Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Guinea, but they were connected by community and faith. Khaled Belkacemi, 60. A professor of soil and   engineering at Laval University, Mr. Belkacemi arrived in Canada with his wife, Safia Hamoudi, to escape turmoil in his native Algeria, said   Dufour, the university’s dean of agriculture and food science. Professor Dufour said that Ms. Hamoudi, who is also a faculty member at Laval, told him after the attack, “We came to Quebec and Canada because we didn’t want to stay in an environment where we have to fight or there is too much danger. ” She added, “We never thought it would happen in Quebec,” the professor said. Professor Belkacemi, who held Ph. D. s from a university in Algeria and the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec, was an authority on the effects of freezing on foods. In addition to teaching and research, Professor Belkacemi consulted on the design of food processing equipment and factories. On Facebook, Professor Belkacemi’s son, Amir, recalled his father’s decision to seek out a better life for his family in Canada. He described his father as “a good man, an example of resilience, a man loved by all, a professor and researcher emeritus, a fighter, a man who left his country to give his family a chance to live far away from horror. ” Abdelkrim Hassane, 41. An immigrant from Algeria, Mr. Hassane was a programming analyst for the Quebec provincial government. He and his wife, Louiza Mohamed Said, had three children ranging in age from 15 months to 10 years. “How will I tell my kids?” Ms. Said said in an interview with   the French service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, adding of the man charged with the killings: “I don’t care about that person. It’s too late. It’s my husband I care about. ” Aboubaker Thabti, 44. Mr. Thabti worked in a poultry processing plant just outside Quebec City, and his wife operated a day care center. Several news reports indicated that Mr. Thabti immigrated from Tunisia about five years ago and that he was the father of two young children. “Know that this man was seen by his colleagues and manager as a courteous man, a hard worker who was smiling and discreet,” said Stéphanie Paquet, a spokeswoman for his employer, Exceldor. “Mr. Thabti was very much appreciated by all around him. ” Azzeddine Soufiane, 57. Among the first victims to be identified without official confirmation, Mr. Soufiane was a butcher who owned a small halal grocery store, Boucherie Assalam, about two minutes’ drive from the mosque. The Globe and Mail, a Toronto newspaper, reported that Mr. Soufiane came from Morocco during the 1980s to study geology at Laval University. Several members of the mosque said that Mr. Soufiane’s connection to Muslims through his store had made him an unofficial leader of the city’s Muslim community. Mamadou Tanou Barry, 42. Mr. Barry worked as a computer technician at a cosmetics company. A native of Guinea, Mr. Barry had two young children. Ibrahima Barry, 39. Another native of Guinea, Mr. Barry was a close friend of Mamadou Tanou Barry, although they were not related. Their families lived in the same apartment building in Ste. . Mr. Barry was a provincial public servant and the father of four children."

From the University of New Hampshire  and the department of “CO2 controls everything with a single big red knob” (as stated in the article) comes this modeling inanity. Never mind that after the continental breakup the continent of Antarctica is now on the bottom of the world and gets dark for months and super cold, nooooo, it’s CO2 wot dun it. Climate models can’t even get the present right,  so I have serious doubts they’ll get 34 million years ago, where we have far less data, right either.
Antarctic ice sheet is result of CO2 decrease, not continental breakup
DURHAM, N.H. – Climate modelers from the University of New Hampshire have shown that the most likely explanation for the initiation of Antarctic glaciation during a major climate shift 34 million years ago was decreased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. The finding counters a 40-year-old theory suggesting massive rearrangements of Earth’s continents caused global cooling and the abrupt formation of the Antarctic ice sheet. It will provide scientists insight into the climate change implications of current rising global CO2 levels.

In a paper published today in Nature, Matthew Huber of the UNH Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space and department of Earth sciences provides evidence that the long-held, prevailing theory known as “Southern Ocean gateway opening” is not the best explanation for the climate shift that occurred during the Eocene-Oligocene transition when Earth’s polar regions were ice-free.
“The Eocene-Oligocene transition was a major event in the history of the planet and our results really flip the whole story on its head,” says Huber. “The textbook version has been that gateway opening, in which Australia pulled away from Antarctica, isolated the polar continent from warm tropical currents, and changed temperature gradients and circulation patterns in the ocean around Antarctica, which in turn began to generate the ice sheet. We’ve shown that, instead, CO2-driven cooling initiated the ice sheet and that this altered ocean circulation.”
Huber adds that the gateway theory has been supported by a specific, unique piece of evidence—a “fingerprint” gleaned from oxygen isotope records derived from deep-sea sediments. These sedimentary records have been used to map out gradient changes associated with ocean circulation shifts that were thought to bear the imprint of changes in ocean gateways.
Although declining atmospheric levels of CO2 has been the other main hypothesis used to explain the Eocene-Oligocene transition, previous modeling efforts were unsuccessful at bearing this out because the CO2 drawdown does not by itself match the isotopic fingerprint. It occurred to Huber’s team that the fingerprint might not be so unique and that it might also have been caused indirectly from CO2 drawdown through feedbacks between the growing Antarctic ice sheet and the ocean.
Says Huber, “One of the things we were always missing with our CO2 studies, and it had been missing in everybody’s work, is if conditions are such to make an ice sheet form, perhaps the ice sheet itself is affecting ocean currents and the climate system—that once you start getting an ice sheet to form, maybe it becomes a really active part of the climate system and not just a passive player.”
For their study, Huber and colleagues used brute force to generate results: they simply modeled the Eocene-Oligocene world as if it contained an Antarctic ice sheet of near-modern size and shape and explored the results within the same kind of coupled ocean-atmosphere model used to project future climate change and across a range of CO2 values that are likely to occur in the next 100 years (560 to 1200 parts per million).
“It should be clear that resolving these two very different conceptual models for what caused this huge transformation of the Earth’s surface is really important because today as a global society we are, as I refer to it, dialing up the big red knob of carbon dioxide but we’re not moving continents around.”
Just what caused the sharp drawdown of CO2 is unknown, but Huber points out that having now resolved whether gateway opening or CO2 decline initiated glaciation, more pointed scientific inquiry can be focused on answering that question.
Huber notes that despite his team’s finding, the gateway opening theory won’t now be shelved, for that massive continental reorganization may have contributed to the CO2 drawdown by changing ocean circulation patterns that created huge upwellings of nutrient-rich waters containing plankton that, upon dying and sinking, took vast loads of carbon with them to the bottom of the sea.

The headline is a quote by Dr. Judith Curry from a David Rose article in the Sunday Mail: Stunning satellite images show summer ice cap is thicker and covers 1.7million square kilometres MORE than 2 years ago…despite Al Gore’s prediction it would be ICE-FREE by now.


The speech by former US Vice-President Al Gore was apocalyptic. ‘The North Polar ice cap is falling off a cliff,’ he said. ‘It could be completely gone in summer in as little as seven years. Seven years from now.’
Those comments came in 2007 as Mr Gore accepted the Nobel Peace Prize for his campaigning on climate change.
But seven years after his warning, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that, far from vanishing, the Arctic ice cap has expanded for the second year in succession – with a surge, depending on how you measure it, of between 43 and 63 per cent since 2012.
To put it another way, an area the size of Alaska, America’s biggest state, was open water two years ago, but is again now covered by ice.
The most widely used measurements of Arctic ice extent are the daily satellite readings issued by the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, which is co-funded by Nasa. These reveal that – while the long-term trend still shows a decline – last Monday, August 25, the area of the Arctic Ocean with at least 15 per cent ice cover was 5.62 million square kilometres.
This was the highest level recorded on that date since 2006 (see graph, right), and represents an increase of 1.71 million square kilometres over the past two years – an impressive 43 per cent.
Other figures from the Danish Meteorological Institute suggest that the growth has been even more dramatic. Using a different measure, the area with at least 30 per cent ice cover, these reveal a 63 per cent rise – from 2.7 million to 4.4 million square kilometres.
The satellite images published here are taken from a further authoritative source, the University of Illinois’s Cryosphere project.
They show that as well as becoming more extensive, the ice has grown more concentrated, with the purple areas – denoting regions where the ice pack is most dense – increasing markedly.
Crucially, the ice is also thicker, and therefore more resilient to future melting. Professor Andrew Shepherd, of Leeds University, an expert in climate satellite monitoring, said yesterday: ‘It is clear from the measurements we have collected that the Arctic sea ice has experienced a significant recovery in thickness over the past year.

Indeed, and the way things are going, it looks like WUWT (and Wang) will be closer to the final September Average for Sea Ice than any of the other forecast players in the ARCUS Sea Ice prediction Network:

"**Facebook has agreed to pay the French government â¬106m (Â£95.7m) in back taxes to settle a dispute over revenues earned in the country.**
The payment covers the last decade of its French operations from 2009.
The social networking giant has also agreed to pay â¬8.46m in taxes on revenues in France for 2020 - 50% more than in 2019.
""We pay the taxes we owe in every market we operate,"" said a Facebook spokeswoman.
""We take our tax obligations seriously and work closely with tax authorities around the world to ensure compliance with all applicable tax laws and to resolve any disputes, as we have done with the French tax authorities.""
The social networking giant did not share details of the tax dispute, but France has been pushing tech companies to pay more tax inside the country where it is generated.
Other tech giants like Google, Apple and Amazon have reached similar agreements with the French tax authorities.
Facebook said that since 2018, it had changed its sales structure so that ""income from advertisers supported by our teams in France is registered in this country"".
The BBC understands that Facebook paid a tax rate in France of 38% in 2019, which is above the statutory income tax rate of 33.3%.
In February, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said he recognised the public's frustration over the amount of tax paid by tech giants.
He added that Facebook accepted the fact it might have to pay more tax in Europe ""in different places under a new framework"" going forward, and backed plans by think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to find a global solution to how to tax tech companies.
Facebook has been accused of not paying its fair share of tax in the countries where it operates.
Last year, France announced a new digital services tax on multinational technology firms, but in January, the country said it would delay the tax until the end of 2020.
The new tax would have required global tech giants to make tax payments equivalent to 3% of their French revenues twice a year in April and in November.
In response to France delaying the new tax, the US said it would not impose retaliatory tariffs on $2.4bn (Â£1.8bn) of French goods, including champagne and cheese.
The OECD is working on a multilateral agreement on how tech giants should be taxed by governments.
In the UK, Facebook paid just Â£28.5m in corporation tax in 2018, despite generating a record Â£1.65bn in British sales.
The UK government implemented its own tax on technology firms in April. The Digital Services Tax (DST) requires digital services operating in the UK to pay a 2% tax in connection to social media services, internet search engines and online marketplaces.
HM Treasury has stressed that the tax will remain in place until a global solution to taxing tech giants is agreed.
In June, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and finance ministers in France, Italy and Spain signed a letter saying that tech giants, like Google, Amazon and Facebook, need ""to pay their fair share of tax"".
In the letter, obtained by the BBC, the four finance ministers told the US Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, that the pandemic had increased the need for such levies.
""The current Covid-19 crisis has confirmed the need to deliver a fair and consistent allocation of profit made by multinationals operating without - or with little - physical taxable presence,"" the letter said.
""The pandemic has accelerated a fundamental transformation in consumption habits and increased the use of digital services, consequently reinforcing digital business models' dominant position and increasing their revenue at the expense of more traditional businesses."""

Martin Feldstein has a new short paper out with some thoughts on a relatively under-researched subject: Why is Growth Better in the United States than in other Industrial Countries?   
  
He begins:   




In 2015, real GDP per capita was $56,000 in the United States. On a purchasing power basis, the real GDP per capita in the same year was only $47,000 in Germany, $41,000 in France and the United Kingdom, and just $36,000 in Italy. So the official measures of real GDP clearly point to the cumulative result of higher sustained real growth rates in the United States than in the major industrial countries of Europe and Asia.



Over the very long term, this is a truism. In order for the U.S. to be that much richer, it must have experienced faster real GDP per capita growth than comparator countries. We know from figures collated by the Maddison Project that the U.S. had around half the level of GDP per capita of the UK in the early 18th century, but by 1900 it was overtaking the UK as the richest country by income per head, and has remained in that leading position for almost all the period since.   
  
But showing higher _levels_ of income does not necessarily mean that the U.S. _growth_ of GDP per capita was higher than other countries over more recent periods.



Figure 1 outlines the growth performance of G7 countries since 1970. As can be seen, U.S. average annual real GDP growth has indeed been higher than the rest, but average annual real GDP _per capita_ growth was actually stronger in Japan, the UK and Germany over that period. In other words, the U.S. relative real GDP growth strength over that period is primarily about demographics.   
  
**Figure 1: Average annual real GDP and real GDP per capita growth, 1970-2015.**

The U.S. is still richer than the other countries, of course. That is, the level of real GDP per capita is still higher, but that gap already existed in 1970. Some other countries have grown more quickly since then from a lower base. In 1970, Japan’s real GDP per capita was 79 percent of the U.S., whereas in 2015 it was 91 percent. For the UK, the figure has increased from 77 percent to 80 percent. But no country appears to be fully converging.   
  
The real question then appears to be this: though individual countries have converged somewhat towards the U.S. during periods since 1945, why does there seem to be a _permanent gap_ in the l _evel_ of GDP between the U.S. and other major economies?   
  
In other words, what structural features in the U.S. help to make it permanently richer than other major economies?   
  
Feldstein posits 10 possible explanations:   






Whole theses could be written about each. But I’ll limit myself to seven quick comments here:

"**Facebook has threatened to stop users from sharing news content in Australia as it prepares for a new law forcing it to pay publishers for their articles.**
Regulators want tech giants like Facebook and Google to pay for the content reposted from news outlets.
Last month Google warned its users that its search services could be ""dramatically worse"" as a result.
Facebook's latest move to block news sharing has escalated tensions between tech firms and regulators.
The social media network said that if the proposed legislation becomes law it will stop Australians from sharing news on Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has drawn up the rules to ""level the playing field"" between the tech giants and publishers that it says are struggling due to lost advertising revenue.
The ACCC responded to Facebook's threat to block news content saying it was ""ill-timed and misconceived"".
""The code simply aims to bring fairness and transparency to Facebook and Google's relationships with Australian news media businesses,"" ACCC chairman Rod Sims said.
But in a blog post, Facebook's managing director for Australia and New Zealand Will Easton, said the draft law ""misunderstands the dynamics of the internet and will do damage to the very news organisations the government is trying to protect"".
He argued it would force Facebook to pay for content that publishers voluntarily place on its platform to generate traffic back to their news sites.
Mr Easton claimed Facebook sent 2.3bn clicks from Facebook's newsfeed back to Australian news websites, worth around A$200m ($148m; Â£110m) during the first five months of the year.
The blocking of news ""is not our first choice - it is our last,"" he said, adding that Facebook's other services that allow family and friends to connect will not be affected.
A Facebook spokesman told the BBC that it will ""provide specific details soon"" on how it will enforce the ban.
Some business experts argue that tech firms should pay publishers for the quality news content that they repost.
""Google, Facebook and others have been getting away with giving it away for free for too long,"" Michael Wade, a professor at the IMD Business School in Switzerland and Singapore, told the BBC last month.
Google and Facebook do pay for some news content in specific markets, and said they plan to roll these initiatives out to more countries."
"**Fake accounts have been undermining elections around the world, an ex-Facebook employee has claimed.**
In a 6,600-word internal memo to fellow workers, data scientist Sophie Zhang said she made decisions ""that affected national presidents"" without oversight.
""I have blood on my hands,"" she wrote in the memo, parts of which were published by Buzzfeed.
In response, Facebook said it was working hard to stop bad actors and inauthentic behaviour.
In her memo, parts of which were published by Buzzfeed without her permission, Ms Zhang said: ""In the three years I've spent at Facebook, I've found multiple blatant attempts by foreign national governments to abuse our platform on vast scales to mislead their own citizenry, and caused international news on multiple occasions.
""I have personally made decisions that affected national presidents without oversight, and taken action to enforce against so many prominent politicians globally that I've lost count,"" she added.
It is reported by Buzzfeed, which said it had shared only those parts of her memo that were in the public interest, that Ms Zhang turned down a $64,000 (Â£49,000) severance package which she was offered on condition that she did not share her memo internally.
In response, Facebook said: ""We've built specialised teams, working with leading experts, to stop bad actors from abusing our systems, resulting in the removal of more than 100 networks for co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour.
""It's highly involved work that these teams do as their full-time remit. Working against co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour is our priority, but we're also addressing the problems of spam and fake engagement.
""We investigate each issue carefully, including those that Ms Zhang raises, before we take action or go out and make claims publicly as a company.""
Examples of work she refers to in her memo include:
""Facebook projects an image of strength and competence to the outside world... but the reality is that many of our actions are slapdash and haphazard accidents.""
She said the fact she had to make countless decisions about many different countries took a toll on her health and left her feeling responsible when civil unrest took place in locations that she had not prioritised for action.
Her revelations come just a week after ex-Facebook engineer Ashok Chandwaney accused the firm of profiting from hate.
Carole Cadwalladr, a UK journalist who exposed the Cambridge Analytica scandal, tweeted: ""The speed and scale of the damage Facebook is doing to democracies around the world is truly terrifying.""
**Analysis**
**By Marianna Spring, Specialist disinformation reporter**
This explosive memo confirms concerns that have long been raised about Facebook's ability to tackle foreign interference and disinformation campaigns.
But while most eyes have been on Russian interference in US politics after the 2016 election, this former employee's testimony turns attention to democratic events beyond the West.
Facebook's failure to tackle disinformation in other languages has come under scrutiny during the pandemic - and this new information alleges it has struggled to tackle interference campaigns in non-English speaking nations before.
The memo also raises big concerns about the huge responsibility bestowed on junior Facebook moderators - whose decisions could affect democratic events, political outcomes and people's lives globally.
This will no doubt increase concerns about Facebook's work to tackle interference and disinformation campaigns as the next US election approaches. But it should remind us that Facebook plays a role in democratic events outside the US."
"**A phone that was fished out of the sea has been reunited with its owner after its rescuer posted pictures she found in it on social media.**
Emma Gilman found the device floating in its protective case while paddling at Bacton in Norfolk.
The phone was locked but she found photos on the memory card and put some on Facebook to try to trace the owner.
She said she was ""ecstatic"" when Matty Bray came forward 20 minutes later to claim the phone he had lost in July.
Mr Bray, 39, said Mrs Gilman was ""an absolute legend"".
He had been paddleboarding near Bacton on 18 July, when he lost the phone.
Mrs Gilman was at the beach on 31 July when she spotted the Samsung Galaxy.
""I was expecting someone to come running over to claim it, but no-one did so I took it out of the case, and although there was some grit and sand inside, it came on - and then went off again,"" she said.
O2 suggested she take it to one of their shops as it had been reported as missing.
""We'd been pretty strict during lockdown and I wasn't keen to go into shops, so I put it in a drawer and didn't think about it until this weekend,"" Mrs Gilman said.
""I put the memory card in my phone and there were loads of pictures but nothing really gave me any clues, so I put a few on Facebook and asked people to share.
""Hundreds did, and within 20 minutes Matty had messaged to say it was his.""
She said she could ""hardly believe"" they both lived within a couple of miles of each other in Norwich, so she took the phone to him.
""Of course it would have been exciting to think the phone had travelled for miles from a famous person's yacht - or even as far as Grimsby would have been good - but we were both ecstatic and it was great to return it.""
Mr Bray, an NHS blood service worker, said: ""I never thought I'd see it again. Then I saw a lot of missed calls from quite a lot of friends in the paddleboarding group - it's a brilliant community,"" he said.
""I don't think I'll be taking the phone with me next time I go paddleboarding.""

Inequality was a big topic in last week’s Democratic debate. Of course, it was no surprise that self‐​described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders decried the “casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little.” But he was matched by Hillary Clinton, who promised to heal the divides that exist “because there’s too much inequality.” And Martin O’Malley worried, “Our middle class is shrinking … the poor are getting poorer.” Even Lincoln Chafee“want[s] to address income inequality.”



The class warfare was greeted rapturously by the partisans in the audience. Unfortunately for the candidates, though, the latest research suggests that they have once again gotten it all wrong.



For example, it is an article of faith on the Left that inequality exists because the rich fail to pay their fair share of taxes and our social‐​welfare programs are too stingy. Of course, this ignores the facts that (a) the rich, who earn around 19 percent of U.S. income, pay more than 42 percent of federal income taxes, and (b) federal and state governments spend nearly $1 trillion on welfare and anti‐​poverty programs. But why let a few facts get in the way of a good narrative?



And now we have a new study from the Brookings Institution. Yes, the liberal Brookings Institution. Authored by former Obama economic adviser Peter Orszag and others, the study concludes that even raising the top individual‐​income‐​tax rate to 50 percent from its current 39.6 percent and redistributing all the new revenue to those with incomes in the lowest 20 percent would do surprisingly little to reduce inequality. Hillary, Bernie, et al. could tax the rich as much as they want and pour the money into welfare programs, but that still wouldn’t do more than dent inequality.





They get it all wrong on the causes and effects of income inequality.



The Left also believes that most rich people don’t earn their wealth, they inherit it, resulting in a new aristocracy. That was the central thesis of Thomas Piketty’s oft‐​cited book, _Capital in the Twenty‐​First Century_. In reality, however, roughly 80 percent of American millionaires are the first generation of their families to have that much money. Most of the rich are entrepreneurs who earned their wealth through hard work.



The last nails should have been put in the coffin of Piketty’s theory of dynastic wealth by a new study for the Cato Institute by Robert Arnott, William Bernstein, and Lillian Wu, which shows that “each generation spawns its own entrepreneurs, who create vast pools of entirely new wealth,” while the wealth accumulated by previous generations is dissipated. As the authors show, the massive fortunes of the 19th century have been almost entirely depleted, and even the fortunes generated just a half‐​century ago are diminished, replaced by a new set of fortunes, which will someday be lost in turn. Capitalism, as Joseph Schumpeter noted, is a process of creative destruction.



Indeed, as Harvard’s Philippe Aghion and others showed in a new National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, roughly 17 percent of the total increase in the share of income going to the top 1 percent from 1975 to 2010 resulted just from innovation — new ideas and new products that benefited all of us. The authors conclude that this “vindicates the Schumpeterian view whereby the rise in top income shares is partly related to innovation‐​led growth, where innovation itself fosters social mobility at the top through creative destruction.”



In a similar vein, researchers led by Jae Song of the Social Security Administration found little evidence that inequality is caused by a growing wage gap between corporate executives and other workers. Instead, nearly all the growth in inequality from 1978 to 2012 resulted from disparities in wages between companies. Similar jobs at different companies pay different wages. Duh! And workers sometimes choose other compensation or benefits or conveniences instead of higher wages. Therefore, traditional liberal proposals such as capping CEO pay would have little impact on inequality.



And if that’s not enough to spoil the inequality story, there is also a new report on poverty from the World Bank. Critics of inequality would have us believe that rising inequality is responsible for poverty. But at a time of increasing inequality, world poverty has never been lower. The researchers project that fewer than 10 percent of the world’s population will live in extreme poverty this year.



I suppose those concerned about inequality can take some comfort from a new study by Sutirtha Bagchi of the University of Michigan and Jan Svejnar of Columbia University, which concludes that inequality can slow economic growth if the inequality results from government favors and other vestiges of crony capitalism. But even this study points out that inequality can be good for growth when it is the result of free markets. So, as everyone who isn’t backing green‐​energy subsidies and the Export‐​Import Bank understands, capitalism works, but crony capitalism doesn’t. Now which side of that divide do Hillary and Bernie fall on?



The evidence just keeps rolling in, day after day, study after study. Unlike the Left’s constantly repeated claims about climate change, in this case the science really is clear.



Whoever wins the Democratic nomination next year, it is a safe bet that he or she will campaign against inequality and in favor of increased redistribution. After all, what was the Democratic debate if not an endless list of freebies to be paid for by punitive taxes on the rich?



If the Republicans, in contrast, ignore strident populism and choose a proponent of economic growth, that will set up one of the most important philosophical and economic debates of any recent presidential election. If that happens, the evidence piles up that they will have the better of the argument.

Leighton Smith has listened to New Zealanders, or more precisely National party supporters, and they are **angry!**



 **“National blew it”**. My sentiments, but not my words. It was one pithy sentence in a strongly worded email from a listener to my podcast regarding National endorsing the Government’s Zero Carbon Bill. And the author delivered plenty more venom.



I don’t have intimate insight into every National supporter’s reaction to this “betrayal” but the mood I am witnessing suggests **it’s a good time for a couple of minor parties to be active.**



Yes, while National has [kicked their rural supporter base in the slats](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/nz-opposition-should-be-called-out-over-zero-carbon-bill/) there is now space for ACT and New Conservatives to step up as their champions.



National had the perfect opportunity to paint themselves as a strong opposition quite distinct from Labour by opposing the Zero Carbon Bill. Instead, they simply confirmed what many have been starting to fear for a while now that they are actually “Labour-lite” and a “rudderless ship”.



Leighton had an e-mail from an ex-National MP who said: **“this window-dressing, virtue signalling bill is indicative of their lack of political spine and being blinded to the views of what used to be their core constituency”.** He also intimated that National were cowards and voted for it because they were [scared of being called climate deniers.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/a-national-mp-on-national-voting-for-the-zero-carbon-bill/)



I was asked by a woman on the political fringe, “what is National’s core, what do they stand for? What is their purpose?” Without waiting for a reply she answered her own question. “Basically it’s to keep the other lot out”.



[…] Right now I could see NZ First disappear and Labour and the Greens married and in bed together after the ballots are counted. Equally, rumours of a rural group winning a handful of seats, if they got their act together, could hold the balance of power. Act or the New Conservatives could be in the same position. Then maybe, just maybe, National could throw up a new leader and duplicate what Jacinda Ardern achieved in 2017.

"Inmates were holding two people hostage at a Delaware prison on Wednesday night in a standoff that began in the morning and left at least one prison employee injured, officials said. The hostages were taken at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, near the town of Smyrna, between Wilmington and Dover. It is the state’s largest prison, with 2, 500 inmates in     and   units. At a news conference on Wednesday night, officials revealed that a total of 27 inmates had been released by the   but it was unclear whether they had been held against their will and how many inmates remained. Officials said four staff members had initially been taken hostage. Early accounts put that number at five, though officials said one person had not been accounted for at first but was later found to be safe. Robert Coupe, the secretary of the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security, said at the news conference at about 8:15 p. m. that the authorities were communicating with the inmates via a   radio belonging to a correctional officer. Inmates also have access to television and may have been watching a live broadcast of the news conference, he added. At 10:32 a. m. “a correctional officer made a radio call for immediate assistance from within C Building, which houses over 100 inmates,” Sgt. Richard Bratz of the Delaware State Police said at a news conference earlier on Wednesday. The building houses   inmates who are making the transition to medium security. Other correction officers responded to the distress call, and the prison was placed on lockdown, but inmates took four employees hostage. At about 2:40 p. m. one hostage was set free and taken by ambulance to a hospital, Sergeant Bratz said, “with   injuries. ” Eight inmates were released at 5:20 p. m. Shortly before 8 p. m. another staff member and 19 inmates were released. Their conditions were not immediately known. The News Journal newspaper reported that a woman had called its newsroom, stated that she was a hostage and haltingly read a statement that she said had been given to her by the inmates, complaining of mistreatment. She said the prisoners had forbidden her to give her name, and when asked how many inmates were holding her, she said she did not know because “they’ve got my face covered. ” Officials declined to discuss specifics of the inmates’ demands. Mr. Coupe said that once the takeover was resolved peacefully, “a dialogue can start then. ” Scores of law enforcement officers in riot gear, with armored vehicles, gathered around the prison’s buildings. Sergeant Bratz said officials were in contact with the   but he gave no details about their demands or the progress of negotiations. “We are doing everything we can to ensure the safety of everyone involved,” he said. As a precaution, the Department of Correction placed all of the state’s prisons on lockdown. On a rural road along the prison perimeter, Carla Vereen was waiting in her car for news of her husband, who has worked in the prison as a corrections officer for 16 years. Ms. Vereen said she had not heard directly from her husband or from the prison authorities since the hostage crisis began. Also waiting was a former inmate, Rollin Lee Laub, who said he was not surprised to hear the reports that some inmates had taken hostages. “They took everything from these guys so they had nothing but idle time, which is the devil’s workshop,” said Mr. Laub, who was released from the prison in 2014 after serving almost 40 years."

It appears the NOAA also agrees that sea level rise is not happening any where near as fast as many among us would like to think it is. At its site here, it writes the following n(my emphasis):
The graphs compare the 95% confidence intervals of relative mean sea level trends for CO-OPS and global stations. Trends with the narrowest confidence intervals are based on the longest data sets. Trends with the widest confidence intervals are based on only 30-40 years of data. The graphs can provide an overarching indication of the differing rates of regional vertical land motion, given that the absolute global sea level rise is believed to be 1.7-1.8 millimeters/year. Note that they are relative sea level trends, and are not corrected for local land movement. The calculated trends for all CO-OPS stations are available as a table in millimeters/year and in feet/century. A complete table of non-CO-OPS station trends are available as a table in millimeters/year and in feet/century.”

A narrative of popular discontent against open trade has taken hold, and politicians on both the left and the right have reacted by taking aim at trade agreements and proclaiming their support for economic nationalism. This is both bad policy and a misreading of the views of most Americans. Democrats should not fall into the trap of trying to compete with Donald Trump in skepticism about trade. Instead, Democrats should set out the positive case for trade liberalization and the rule of law in international trade.



To do so, they should look to the Constitution and reclaim the greater responsibility over trade for Congress envisioned there. Executive branch protectionism championed by President Trump has harmed the U.S. economy and worsened relationships with our allies. Congress needs to institute checks to make sure this does not happen again in the future. Democrats should also reengage in a constructive manner with U.S. trading partners in multilateral, bilateral, and regional settings. Working with allies, instead of against them, has its own rewards, and can also be used as a basis for addressing the challenge of China’s integration into the trading system. In this way, Democrats can develop a pro‐​trade policy that creates jobs and prosperity for Americans, and that also restores American leadership of the global economy.



Democrats hope to elect a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress in November. If they succeed, they will become responsible for, among much else, setting a new trade policy for the country, which has been in retreat from trade liberalization and from international trade cooperation under President Trump. Democrats have ample reasons to be pro‐​trade. Yet, at times, Democratic officeholders and candidates have seemed to echo Trump’s espousal of trade protectionism. Even when Democrats have supported trade, they have sometimes seemed to apologize for it. They have not portrayed support for trade as the affirmative and progressive policy that it is.



If Democrats control the White House and Congress in 2021, they must return to their long and historic tradition of supporting trade, and articulate why they support it instead of just saying that they oppose Trump’s protectionist policies. They must do what virtually no one in national politics in either party has tried to do lately: they must remind all the American people why being for trade is in their best interest and why being against trade is not. Support for trade must be an essential part of any overall Democratic economic policy that aspires to restore and revitalize American prosperity.



But what should a pro‐​trade policy for Democrats in 2021 include? Being pro‐​trade is not as simple as saying “tariffs should be set at zero.” There are complex constitutional, international relations, and governance questions to answer. As I set out below, the key elements of a Democratic trade policy should include the following: reclaim Congress’s constitutional authority over trade policy; repeal Trump’s unilateral tariffs; recommit to multilateralism; recommit to the rule of law in trade; support the modernization of the World Trade Organization (WTO); find a coherent approach to dealing with China; support bilateral and regional trade liberalizing efforts; and promote domestic actions that improve American competitiveness. Through implementation of these specific items, Democrats can rehabilitate U.S. trade policy, and, in doing so, they can reclaim U.S. leadership in the international trading system.



In the United States, authority over trade is established in the Constitution, and Congress must reclaim that authority. Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution provides: “The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect … Duties” and to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.” Thus, it is Congress that has been entrusted with primary responsibility for international trade. Yet, for nearly a century now, the legislative branch has been slowly ceding its constitutional authority over trade to the executive branch, with the president and specific executive agencies being granted ever‐​increasing powers.



Some of this delegation has been for the good. Congress has neither the time nor the need to vote on approving every single tariff reduction on every product that may be negotiated as part of a trade agreement. For this reason, Congress has long since given presidents the power to negotiate trade agreements, along with congressional guidelines for negotiating them. This negotiating approach has helped the United States create a multilateral trading system based on trade liberalization and the rule of law. Under this negotiating approach, according to a study by the Bertelsmann Foundation, membership in this global system has boosted annual GDP by $87 billion in the 25 years since the establishment of the WTO— _more_ _than any other country_.1



There has also, however, been congressional delegation that has given presidents the power to impose tariffs unilaterally. Although some of this delegation has made sense in principle, in practice it has given rise to abuse, especially during the Trump administration. Most notably, the legislation ceding congressional trade authority includes Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which grants the president authority to restrict trade for national security reasons. It also includes Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which gives the president authority to impose trade sanctions against what the executive branch deems to be unfair trade practices. These statutes are left over from the Cold War era and served a purpose when they were originally enacted, but they are now outdated and need to be rethought. They give the president sweeping powers to impose a whole range of restrictions on trade unilaterally, without consulting Congress and without requiring a congressional vote.



When presidents apply their discretion under these statutes reasonably and responsibly, that can be of value. But as with many other issues where he has pushed the outer limits of his legislated and constitutional powers, Trump has abused this delegated power over trade. He has seized on the broad discretion accorded to him as president under these long‐​ignored statutes to apply tariffs unilaterally—and often for dubious reasons—on imports from many of our leading trading partners without first seeking the consent of Congress. Actions taken under Section 301 have ostensibly been in response to assertions of unfair trade practices by the targeted countries. Actions taken under Section 232 have been justified on specious claims of national security. Most of these unilateral trade actions taken by the Trump administration are illegal under international trade law.



Reform is likewise needed to the process by which Congress delegates to a president the authority to negotiate trade agreements—the so‐​called “trade promotion authority.” As a practical matter, some delegation is necessary to negotiate and conclude international trade agreements. If our negotiators had to go to Congress for approval before agreeing to cut every fraction of every tariff, no other country would ever agree to a trade deal with the United States.



Furthermore, as a practical matter in the modern world, there must be a congressional delegation of at least some unilateral trade authority in case of national emergency. At the same time, a president should not be given a blank check to pursue unilateral or other trade actions. Appropriately, in constructing trade promotion authority, Congress has sought to constrain trade negotiations by the executive branch. In 2021 and beyond, even more attention must be paid by Congress to striking the right balance by imposing negotiating constraints, irrespective of which party happens to hold the presidency.



A pro‐​trade policy should start by reclaiming Congress’s largely abandoned constitutional authority over foreign commerce. Congressional Democrats should rein in legislatively what a president is allowed to do unilaterally to restrict trade. And this should not be a Democratic initiative alone. As many Republicans as possible should be recruited to join in achieving this restorative end through bipartisan legislative action. They, too, have sworn to uphold the Constitution.



Worthy of consideration is a bill introduced by Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) that would subject all trade actions by the executive branch to congressional approval.2 Also deserving of consideration are a bipartisan bill introduced by Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH)3 that would give the Department of Defense a more prominent role in assessing any potential national security threats posed by traded products, and a bipartisan bill introduced by Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI)4 that would allow Congress to review and approve any executive branch action based on an alleged national security threat posed by a traded product before tariffs are implemented.5 These additional legislative constraints would prevent presidents from continuing to use “national security” as an excuse to justify an array of trade restrictions that have little or nothing to do with protecting national security.



Two additional proposed bills to amend Section 232 were introduced in July 2019 by Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-SC) and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). The Cunningham bill would give the Department of Defense a larger role in assessing national security threats and enable Congress to review and approve such actions.6 Senator Whitehouse’s bill would create a process by which U.S. businesses may request to be excluded from Section 232 import duties.7



With regard to delegations on trade liberalization, presidents must have the authority to negotiate trade agreements. Democrats should always support trade promotion authority—no matter who happens to be president. Any negotiating authority delegated to presidents must be accompanied by clear and specific instructions from Congress, and that authority must be limited to specific aims spelled out by Congress. Presidents must not be permitted by Congress to do whatever they wish on tariffs. By ending the open‐​endedness of statutes such as Section 301 and Section 232, and by modernizing trade promotion authority, Congress can go a long way toward reclaiming its constitutional authority over foreign commerce.



The president has claimed repeatedly that his unilateral tariffs under Section 301 are paid by the Chinese.8 They are not. They are paid directly by importers and indirectly by Americans in the form of higher prices for much that they buy and make. An economic study published by the nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) concluded that there has been a “complete pass‐​through of U.S. tariffs to import prices.”9 (Interestingly, according to their research, workers in heavily Republican counties have been the most negatively affected.)10 The Trump tariffs on imported products have hurt American consumers by increasing the prices of retail goods and have harmed American manufacturers by increasing the prices of the inputs that go into making their final products. Another economic study published by NBER concluded that the Trump tariffs have “reduced real incomes (of Americans) by about $1.4 billion per month.”11 What is more, “Due to reduced foreign competition, domestic producer prices also increased.”12



These tariffs under Sections 301 and 232 are hidden taxes. Because they are applied by the same percentage on products no matter who buys them, they are, like sales taxes, regressive taxes that fall most heavily on the middle class and on the poorest people. This is all the more reason why Democrats, who take pride in being champions of the poor, the workers, and the middle class, should oppose these tariffs and vote for their immediate repeal.



In addition, these taxes on imported products have prompted our trading partners to retaliate by imposing tariffs of their own on their imports of many U.S. products. This retaliation has hurt U.S. farmers, manufacturers, and other exporters, while adding even more to the costs that Americans are already paying because of protectionism. American taxpayers are, for example, paying billions of dollars in relief to farmers hurt by tariffs imposed on U.S. agricultural exports in retaliation against the Trump tariffs—farmers who would much rather sell their goods than be bailed out by taxpayers.13



A pro‐​trade policy must also support trade actions that are consistent with America’s international treaty obligations and that do not circumvent or undermine them. It may be tempting to keep the Trump tariffs and try to use them as leverage to secure concessions from our trading partners in future trade deals—just as Trump has tried to do, largely unsuccessfully. But that would perpetuate the domestic economic damage caused by these tariffs while running counter to existing international treaty commitments in trade. Trump’s tariffs are not only undermining the American economy, they are also undermining the American commitment to the rule of law in world trade, which is essential to continued and increased American prosperity.



The president’s decision to use tariffs as leverage in seeking trade concessions from other countries is twice a mistake. First, the unilateral application by the United States of tariffs that are higher than those we have promised to levy in international trade agreements is illegal under international law and could lead to lawfully imposed economic sanctions by other countries on U.S. exports that could total billions of dollars in annual lost trade. Second, the assumption that the United States continues to have the economic leverage to bully other countries into submission on trade is founded on a world that no longer exists. The United States accounted for about half of the world’s GDP in the halcyon days just after World War II, when the rest of the developed world was still devastated by the war and when what are now developing countries were not yet developing. Today, the United States accounts for a little less than one‐​fourth of the world’s GDP.14 A trade policy predicated on pushing other countries around is wrong. It also is inconsistent with what Americans are supposed to stand for. Further, it will not work. Eventually, other countries will push back and the American people will suffer the economic consequences.



When the United States approved the implementing legislation for the Uruguay Round trade agreements in 1994 and became a founding member of the WTO, it agreed to take all its trade disputes with other WTO members that fall within the scope of the treaty to the WTO for dispute settlement before taking any retaliatory trade action.15 In many of the trade actions he has taken, Trump has ignored these treaty obligations.



One example stands out in the eyes of other WTO members: when enacting the implementing legislation for the Uruguay Round trade agreements in 1994, the United States stated its intention to refrain from using Section 301 unilaterally. For more than two decades, up until 2017, the United States remained true to this stated intent. No unilateral retaliatory actions were taken under Section 301. But without first going to the WTO, Trump cited Section 301 as the statutory authority for imposing tariffs on products imported from China. As the Chinese have alleged in a pending WTO dispute, these tariffs are in clear violation of U.S. obligations under the WTO treaty. (The retaliatory tariffs imposed by the Chinese on many U.S. exports to China may likewise be illegal.)



In addition, Trump has employed Section 232 as the statutory vehicle to justify the steel and aluminum tariffs applied to imports from many U.S. trading partners. The professed excuse for these metal tariffs is national security. Yet, what Trump poses as national security concerns are merely pretexts for protectionism.16 It is doubtful that any trade‐​savvy American thinks that importing steel from our Canadian, Mexican, European, Japanese, and other friends and allies poses a threat to America’s national security. The threat to our national security would be if we did _not_ trade with our friends and allies.



This bogus national‐​security defense has put WTO jurists in a lose–lose position: either rule in favor of the United States and risk opening up a Pandora’s Box of “anything goes” in the WTO when claiming a national security defense, or rule against the United States and risk that Trump will withdraw the United States from membership in the organization. The multilateral trading system thrived for more than 70 years without having to define what the national security defense means. Now, it is being compelled to answer a legal question that no one really wants answered.17



Trump and his trade negotiators have sometimes visibly and vocally—and sometimes surreptitiously—wielded the metals tariffs as cudgels in continuing trade negotiations. The president says, “I am a tariff man,” and on numerous occasions has threatened to levy higher tariffs while attempting to bully other countries into bending to his will on other matters in trade negotiations.18 To the extent that any such tariffs would exceed the bound rates pledged by the United States in the WTO, they would be illegal under the WTO treaty. Also, there is the question of whether bullying America’s longtime allies and other trading partners by threatening illegal trade restrictions is in the long‐​term national interest of the United States.



The Trump administration has also, behind closed doors, intimidated a number of other countries into “voluntarily” accepting quotas on their exports of metals to the United States in exchange for being excused from the illegal U.S. tariffs. These export quotas are simply outlawed “voluntary export restraints” by another name. One of the aims of the Uruguay Round trade negotiations that led to the WTO treaty and to the establishment of the WTO was the abolition of the involuntary “voluntary export restraints” that were forced on small countries by the United States and other large countries in the 1970s and 1980s as a convenient device for protectionism. Voluntary export restraints are the trade form of a protection racket. They are rightly illegal under the WTO treaty, and the United States is acting inconsistently with its WTO obligations by insisting on them.19



What is more, these are all violations of international law and are subject to economic sanctions authorized by the WTO. The United States stands to lose an increasing number of pending WTO cases challenging these illegal trade actions and, unless they are thwarted by further manipulations by the United States of the dispute settlement process, are likely to reach judgment starting in 2021. Why should we care? In the aftermath of these legal losses, if these adverse rulings are adopted in dispute settlement, the complaining countries will be authorized by the WTO to impose lawful economic sanctions against the United States. These sanctions will consist of the withdrawal of previously granted trade concessions to the United States in what could add up to hundreds of billions of dollars in trade _annually_. These future trade losses would amount to far more than any conceivable gains the Trump administration may claim could result from its continued actions of circumventing and undermining the international treaty obligations that are upheld through the agreed legal framework of the WTO.



As part of a pro‐​trade policy for 2021, Democrats should disavow unilateral trade restrictions as illegal under international law where trade disputes fall within the scope of the WTO treaty. Democrats must work with willing Republicans to refrain from testing the outer limits of international obligations and return to a policy of restraint in international trade law and in international trade institutions.



Democrats must return to multilateralism in trade. They should reaffirm the longstanding bipartisan commitment of the United States to multilateral trade solutions and to the centrality of the multilateral WTO‐​based world trading system. Democrats should also recommit the United States to keeping all of its multilateral trade obligations while cooperating constructively with other WTO members to continue to strengthen the global trading system and free more trade worldwide.



Democrats are often supporters of multilateral solutions through international cooperation everywhere _except_ in international trade. On climate change, on ocean preservation, on biodiversity, on hunger, on global health, on war and peace—on virtually every concern that transcends national borders, Democrats favor multilateral solutions. Now they must offer their support for multilateral cooperation toward solutions in trade as well.



Why cooperate? Because almost all of the commercial and other economic issues that America faces flow across the artificial bounds of national borders. With each passing day, there are fewer public concerns that are not international in at least some respect. International cooperation is increasingly the only way to address these concerns effectively. Active engagement by the United States in international cooperation and its willing compliance with mutually agreed and mutually binding international rules are not obeisant sacrifices of our national sovereignty on the altar of some forbidding foreign suzerain. They are often the only ways in which we can make effective use of our national sovereignty.20 In today’s ever more globalized world, if we do not have ambitious, continuous, and effective international cooperation, then American national sovereignty will eventually become worthless because we will not be able to meet many of the challenges that will face us.



Why multilateralism? In trade, multilateralism is by far the best approach because it maximizes the mutual gains that can be derived from trade. At the core of the WTO‐​based world trading system is the international legal principle of “most‐​favored‐​nation” (MFN) treatment: a basic rule of nondiscrimination that requires that any trade advantage granted by any one WTO member to any other WTO member must also be granted immediately and unconditionally to all other WTO members. The application of the MFN treatment obligation in multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the WTO multiplies the opportunities for mutual trade concessions that provide mutual trade benefits, and it maximizes the economic gains from trade agreements for all the countries that belong to the WTO.



However, the WTO treaty does not require that the further liberalization of trade occur only multilaterally. It offers additional practical means of moving forward on new trade issues as they arise through trade agreements that begin with adherence by some, but not all, WTO members and that can evolve to become fully multilateral agreements that include all WTO members. The use of this negotiating approach in the 1970s and 1980s led to the establishment of the WTO. It can be used now to overcome the long stalemate over many pressing and seemingly intractable trade issues that have long stymied global trade negotiators and that have caused the United States and other WTO members to look outside the legal framework of the WTO for trade solutions.



Why adhere to the MFN principle? Why not engage in trade discrimination by managing trade? The ever‐​present political temptation is for government to intercede in the market to manage trade. The temptation is to have the government dictate market outcomes—to substitute political judgment for the judgment of the marketplace. This is true in China. This is true in Europe and Japan, in India and Brazil. This is equally true in the United States, where Trump has demonstrated his abiding belief in managed trade. Lining up thousands of U.S. companies to beg government bureaucrats for exemptions from needless steel tariffs is statist (and some would say socialistic) managed trade.



Managed trade is contrary to the fundamentals of a free and open society. It violates the rights of those engaged in the free private enterprise that is the source of so much of American prosperity and that is indispensable to sustaining and enhancing American prosperity. Moreover, managed trade does not work. It distorts market decisions and, in so doing, it undermines the market innovations that are indispensable to attaining more prosperity, much less sharing in it. In contrast, free trade liberates the market by spreading innovations and by stimulating the domestic and foreign competition that inspires more innovations. Free trade makes possible more choices for individuals to decide for themselves how they will use their human freedoms in a free and open society.21



Managed trade encourages a transactional view of trade. But this type of approach does not create more trade. It mainly manipulates existing trade, moving it from place to place in contravention of the more productive efficiencies that would result from market‐​driven outcomes. A transactional approach also results in more trade discrimination. If, for example, China buys more soybeans from the United States while not increasing overall Chinese soybean consumption, then China will also be buying fewer soybeans from the European Union, Brazil, and its other trading partners—in violation of the core WTO most‐​favored‐​nation treatment obligation. American producers can equally be the victims of such illegal discrimination.



It is freer trade that creates more trade. By lowering barriers to trade everywhere, multilateral liberalization of trade boosts the volume of trade everywhere. Thus, the gains from trade are increased everywhere. Once trade barriers are lowered, each country can decide how best to distribute and make the most of its gains from trade domestically. In the United States, it is not in supporting free trade that we have erred; rather, it is in the failure to do all we should be doing to help more Americans share in the gains from trade. Instead of supporting managed trade, Democrats must support freer trade. Increasing and maximizing the gains from trade of the United States is essential to making it possible for all Americans to share in a more bountiful national prosperity.



In contrast to the current trade policies, the emphasis should not be on individual trade transactions; it should be on enhancing the prosperity of the American people by ensuring the survival and success of the WTO and other WTO‐​consistent bilateral and regional trading systems. For it is from such a systemic focus that the numbers and amounts of individual trade transactions can best be maximized. Above all else, what is needed in international trade is a mutually agreed and mutually upheld rule‐​based system that enables the freer flow of trade worldwide. As the core of a pro‐​trade policy, Democrats must support, strengthen, and ensure the continued global success of the WTO.



Democrats should work with other WTO members to find a multilateral solution to save the WTO’s independent and impartial system for judging appeals in international trade disputes. By spreading misinformation and false accusations, stonewalling appointments to fill vacancies, and making draconian budget cuts, the Trump administration has eroded the credibility and possibly the existence of the WTO Appellate Body, which is the tribunal of final appeal in world trade. Because the Trump administration has refused to join in the required consensus of all WTO members to appoint new judges, the Appellate Body has been reduced to one judge; without the minimum of three required by the WTO treaty, the tribunal cannot accept any new appeals.



In its brief history of less than a quarter century, the WTO Appellate Body has become arguably the most significant and successful international legal tribunal in the history of the world. WTO rules have practical meaning only if they are upheld in ways that provide necessary security and predictability to the multilateral trading system.22 Without the legal check of the Appellate Body, the risk of inconsistency in applying WTO rules rises. So, too, does the likelihood that countries that lose cases before WTO panels will appeal those rulings “into the void,” to an Appellate Body that is no longer there, which in effect blocks enforcement of the rulings against them. The absence of an appellate process puts the fundamental integrity of WTO dispute settlement at risk and thus the continued flow of international trade that is channeled by the fair and effective functioning of the WTO‐​based trading system.



The framework of international rules that enable the freer flow of trade in the world will work only if the rules are followed and upheld through the international rule of law. As Americans were taught by Alexander Hamilton in the _Federalist_ _Papers_ , and as we have preached for decades to other countries throughout the world, the rule of law requires judges to be independent and impartial.23 For this reason, WTO rules require both independence and impartiality from WTO judges. In rendering their decisions, these judges must not be influenced by any conflicting interests, including those of the 164 members that appointed them to serve the entire trading system.



No one would claim that WTO judges have ruled perfectly, just as no one would claim that about any other tribunal in the world. The act of exercising human judgment is, by its very nature, an act that falls short of perfection simply because it is a human act. Yet any errors the Appellate Body has made while judging hundreds of appeals do not support the unfounded U.S. charge of routine “overreaching” by the WTO appellate judges. The view, in the words of Trump’s trade ambassador, Robert Lighthizer, and now widely accepted within the Washington Beltway, that members of the Appellate Body have a history of creating “new obligations out of whole cloth” has no basis in fact.24



Part of this fiction is comprised of “alternative facts” about the outcome of appeals in WTO trade disputes involving the United States. Trump has told the American people that the United States has lost “almost all the lawsuits” it has taken to the WTO.25 According to one count, however, the United States has _won_ 85.4 percent of the cases it has taken to the WTO, slightly more than the average for all WTO members.26 On the other hand, the United States has lost 83.5 percent of the cases that have been brought against it in the WTO, slightly less than all other WTO members.27



Why these widely divergent percentages? One reason is that the United States and other WTO members do not take the geopolitical, commercial, and legal risk of bringing a WTO case unless they are highly confident that they have a winning case. Another reason is that the United States has lost a long string of frequently related WTO cases involving trade remedies because the United States has failed repeatedly to apply its antidumping, anti‐​subsidy, and other trade remedies consistently with WTO rules.



Trump and his trade advisers have condemned the Appellate Body but have been mute in explaining what they would prefer instead. Their silence on an explanation shows that what they really want is for WTO jurists always to rule as the United States wishes. They seek the rule of power and not the rule of law in the WTO.28 Democrats must oppose Trump and his administration with respect to the WTO. They must see the facts as they truly are and commit to working with other members of the WTO in order to restore the full functioning of the WTO Appellate Body.29



Unquestionably, there is much in the WTO dispute settlement system that can be improved, but the improvements that are needed are largely not the changes sought by the Trump administration. Instead of perpetuating a trade policy that undermines the fairness and efficiency of the WTO dispute settlement system by crippling the Appellate Body, the rule of law in world trade should be reinforced by restoring the Appellate Body and strengthening it against future political assault.



In addition to restoring the Appellate Body, Democrats should draw on the extensive experience of 25 years of working with the WTO and its dispute settlement process to update and improve the organization. Without question, the WTO dispute settlement system has been the most successful system ever devised for resolving international trade disputes, although it can certainly be improved in numerous respects. Moreover, improvements in dispute settlement must be only one item on an overall agenda for WTO reform that will help bring the WTO fully into the 21st century. In recommitting the United States to the centrality of the WTO in world trade, Democrats also must commit to more cooperation with other countries in updating the current multilateral trade rules and extending the existing multilateral trade framework. Instead of abandoning the WTO, which has taken more than 70 years to build, the United States must work with other countries to improve it in response to ever‐​new and ever‐​changing global trade realities.



Built up through round after round of global trade negotiations over the course of more than seven decades, the current scope of the WTO treaty is extensive and includes thousands of pages of rules and rulings that were agreed on and adopted by 164 members. The WTO rules apply to about 98 percent of all world commerce. There is, however, still need for negotiation and agreement on many longstanding issues of international trade. Trade‐​distorting agricultural subsidies that deny producers the benefits of their comparative advantages should be abolished. The remaining tariff obstacles to trade in manufactured goods should be eliminated. These and other important issues remain outstanding after the 15 years of multilateral trade negotiations in the Doha Development Round.



Since the conclusion of the WTO treaty, much has happened to transform world trade and the world economy. Although the WTO rules were written in the 20th century, most are still fit for the 21st century. But no small number of trade rules need updating and, in many aspects of contemporary commerce, new rules are very much needed. Democrats should support the negotiation of new and better WTO rules on digital trade, services trade, and intellectual property, all of which are areas of vast importance to American workers and businesses. New rules are needed to facilitate investment and to ensure free and fair competition. Better disciplines are required for trade‐​distorting subsidies, including new rules forbidding the favoring by WTO members of their state‐​owned enterprises. New rules also are needed to provide protections against forced transfers of technology, while encouraging the lawful spread to poorer developing countries of the new technologies they urgently need to confront environmental, health, and other global challenges. Rules are also needed to address product standards, technical regulations, and the proliferation of other non‐​tariff barriers that are increasingly substituted for tariffs and that pose protectionist obstacles to trade.



Ideally, these new and improved rules should be multilateral, applying to all WTO members from the beginning. Practically, though, it will doubtless be necessary to negotiate and agree on many of these needed updates through approaches within the WTO that include, at the outset, some but not all WTO members. This has often happened in the world trading system, and Democrats should lead in making it happen again. As was done in transforming the 1948–1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade into the WTO, the better rules that result from these plurilateral negotiations can then be entered into force for member nations that have initially agreed to them and can afterwards be extended to eventually cover all WTO members once the worth of the new rules is demonstrated in the practice of the world marketplace.



As Cordell Hull, a long‐​serving Democratic Congressman and Secretary of State in the Franklin Roosevelt administration, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in creating the United Nations, wrote in his memoirs, “To be sure, no piece of social machinery, however well‐​constructed, can be effective unless there is back of it a will and a determination to make it work.”30 Missing in Trump’s administration is the will and the determination to make the world trading system entrusted to the WTO _work_. The president and his trade team seem indifferent to whether the WTO‐​based trading system, in which Americans have invested more than seven decades of energy, ingenuity, and hope for a better and a more prosperous world, even survives. In the spirit of Hull, Democrats must make the multilateral trading system work by cooperating with our trading partners to modernize the WTO.



Crucial to maintaining and modernizing the multilateral trading system will be establishing and sustaining a mutually beneficial working and trading relationship between the United States and China. Achieving this goal is in the mutual interest of the United States, China, and the 162 other members of the WTO. For all his preoccupation with China, Trump has so far failed to achieve this goal and does not have a comprehensive strategy for achieving it. His “trade war” with China, comprised of mostly unilateral and illegal trade restrictions on imported goods from China, is a series of impulsive and improvisational salvos; it is not the implementation of a carefully considered overall strategy. The bilateral commercial conflict between the two major trading partners has harmed the economies of both while accomplishing almost nothing toward addressing the structural hurdles in China that frustrate its full compliance with its WTO obligations.



Democrats must have a strategy for China that encompasses all aspects of the complex American relationship with China. This includes American differences with China on human rights, global health, national security, and more. Yet, this strategy must proceed from an understanding that we live in a globalized world where both the United States and China can prosper the most only if the two countries find some way, despite their differences, of prospering together. We live, too, in a threatened world where such worldwide challenges as confronting pandemics, terrorism, cybersecurity, and climate change can be met only if the United States and China work together. In this world, part of the Democratic strategy for China must address American trade with China.



Unquestionably, there are genuine concerns about Chinese protectionist trade practices. However, Trump’s approach of using unilateral and illegal tariffs to intimidate China into changing its behavior has not worked. Democrats should abandon this approach and take a cooperative, constructive, and lawful approach to resolving legitimate concerns about Chinese trade practices.



Democrats should repeal the unilateral tariffs Trump has imposed on Chinese imports and refrain from imposing more. And, in concert with many other countries that have similar concerns about Chinese trade practices, they should refocus U.S. actions on using the legal remedies that are available in WTO dispute settlement and on negotiating more effective legal remedies where they do not yet exist. Only where a WTO remedy has been sought, and where China has chosen not to comply with a WTO ruling against it, should the United States impose economic sanctions on Chinese trade. And only where WTO rules do not exist—such as on many aspects of foreign direct investment—and where there are no bilateral or other treaty obligations, should the United States act unilaterally to counter discriminatory Chinese commercial practices.



As it now stands in the U.S.-China trade war, the tariffs imposed on more than $350 billion worth of Chinese goods imported into the United States are burdening the economies of both countries.31 Caught in the vice of a no‐​win choice between fueling continued growth by priming the pump or, instead, tackling an ever‐​rising mountain of debt by limiting credit, the Chinese have already found that Trump’s tariffs constrain their growth and complicate their economic decisionmaking. Now, with the additional and manifold economic and social pressures inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic, these constraints are even more confining. Meanwhile, in the United States, in 2018 American companies and consumers faced almost $69 billion in higher tariff costs.32 Every month, these tariffs cost Americans an additional $3 billion in extra taxes and $1.4 billion in lost economic growth—revenues and growth that are sorely needed in the midst of the costly effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.33



The tangible result of all these tariffs has been an anomalous “managed trade” agreement between the United States and China, the so‐​called “phase one” deal that, amid the pandemic, seems less like a deal and more like wishful thinking. In contrast to the negotiating philosophy of both Republicans and Democrats in the past, the phase‐​one deal centers on achieving supposed guarantees of _individual_ international trade transactions and not on altering the underlying trade arrangements that impede, and thus minimize, the flow of _all_ international trade transactions. The Chinese commitments to make specific purchases of American agricultural and manufactured goods seemed unrealistic and unreachable even before the arrival of the pandemic. Now those commitments seem the stuff of fantasy.



Even if the Chinese commitments in the phase‐​one deal were realistic when they were made, and even if China had every intention of keeping those commitments, in the current circumstances China is probably incapable of keeping them. The deal contains a unilateral enforcement mechanism, but this mechanism seems better suited for closing markets than for opening them. Likely, the use of this mechanism would serve mainly as an excuse for ending the truce in the trade war and starting another round of tariffs and countertariffs between the two countries, thus adding more economic harm to both in addition to the extensive economic damage wreaked by the pandemic.



Contrary to the narrative offered by Trump and his trade negotiators, some WTO legal remedies for discriminatory Chinese trade actions do exist and are effective.34 The Trump administration has simply chosen to ignore most of them and instead has tried to intimidate the Chinese with tariffs. These existing WTO legal remedies should be used by the United States. And, where WTO remedies do not yet exist, the United States should negotiate and agree on new remedies with other WTO members, including China. At the same time, Democrats should join with Republicans in applying a heightened scrutiny to Chinese investments in the United States and finding solutions to the very real threats of Chinese computer hacking, cyber theft, and commercial espionage that may fall outside the scope of the WTO treaty. These piratical practices, too, must be subjected to the international rule of law.



Further integrating China into the global trading system through full compliance with WTO rules is imperative. Since entering the WTO in 2001, the Chinese have made great progress in bringing their economy into compliance with most WTO rules. They have also, for the most part, complied with the WTO rulings rendered against them when they have lost cases in WTO dispute settlement. (In some respects, the Chinese have a better record of complying with adverse WTO rulings than the United States.) Overall, though, China continues to fall short of where it should be in fulfilling its trade obligations to the United States and other WTO members under the WTO treaty. China has benefited enormously from membership in the WTO, and it must do more to be fully deserving of that membership.



Full compliance by China with its WTO obligations will benefit the Chinese people more than anyone else. China should not be “contained.” Like any other country, it has every right to rise economically, to climb the ladder of comparative advantage and develop a more innovative, value‐​added economy driven by high‐​tech manufacturing. WTO rules do not prevent the economic rise of China, and Americans should welcome that. To be sure, America must do more domestically and internationally to compete with China economically, but it is neither right nor in America’s interest to try to contain China economically. Through increased trade, investment, and other added economic ties between the two countries, increased Chinese prosperity can continue to help lift American prosperity, and vice versa. By far the greater concern for the United States should not be what will happen if China continues to rise economically; it should be what will happen if China does _not_ rise.



The assault by the coronavirus has reminded us that it is imperative to maintain adequate local inventories of essential goods and materials, not least medical equipment and pharmaceuticals. Global supply chains come with productive efficiencies that can make needed goods more available and more affordable for everyone. Global supply chains also come with risks. Equally, the absence of diverse supply chains can pose risks. The solution is to minimize risks of all kinds. It is not to _eliminate_ supply chains. In particular, a decoupling of the closely linked U.S. and Chinese economies, in part through a dismantling of the current supply chains that connect them, would deny to Americans and Chinese alike the continued and considerable gains in prosperity that will result from a substantial and mutually beneficial bilateral trade relationship.



For China, these gains would be enhanced through additional opening up and reform of the Chinese economy to make it more market oriented. Small and medium private enterprises “create 90 percent of the new jobs in China.”35 Private enterprise can be the source of sustained growth and offer a bright economic future for China. But the recent direction of Chinese economic policy has been toward consolidating more of the Chinese economy under ever tighter centralized state control, a trend heightened in China by the coronavirus pandemic. China can continue to rise only by continuing to open up its economy to the innovative productivity of a free market within an enabling framework of rules upheld by the rule of law.



Clearly, in its size and structure, China presents some unique challenges to the WTO‐​based trading system. But the challenges it presents are not altogether unique for the WTO. Nor are they entirely unanticipated under WTO rules.36 To be sure, more and better rules must be negotiated to make certain that China participates fully and fairly in international trade. Yet WTO rules already exist that have not yet been used—and are waiting to be used—to discipline Chinese trade practices within the current WTO legal framework. For all its circumventions of WTO rules and criticisms of the organization, the Trump administration has not altogether ignored the remedy of WTO dispute settlement. It is, however, puzzling why more WTO cases have not been brought by the United States against China since its accession to the WTO in 2001, where legal remedies are already available.



A variety of discriminations in China’s internationally controversial “Made in China 2025” program can be challenged successfully in the WTO under current rules. A case against the flagrant failures throughout China in the enforcement of intellectual property rights can be brought under existing WTO rules on intellectual property rights. China’s failure to ensure the protection of the trade secrets of foreign companies can be the basis of a WTO complaint under an existing WTO intellectual property rule. Transfers of technology forced on foreigners by the Chinese government are inconsistent with an obligation in China’s membership agreement in the WTO. Chinese requirements of domestic content in locally produced products are in violation of long‐​existing WTO rules. Likewise, many of the manufacturing and agricultural subsidies provided by the Chinese government to state‐​owned enterprises and other Chinese firms and entities are inconsistent with WTO current subsidies rules.37 Conceivably, too, a systemic case could be brought against China on the basis that it has impeded the objectives of the WTO treaty and has nullified or impaired the benefits that other WTO members ought to be receiving under the treaty.38



Instead of taking illegal unilateral actions, Democrats must use these existing avenues in the WTO treaty for confronting many of the unfair Chinese trade practices. Currently, the administration contends that there is no legal recourse for the United States against China in the WTO, and it is using that fabricated excuse as justification for acting illegally outside the WTO. The United States must not go it alone in conducting trade relations with China. The European Union, Japan, Canada, and other WTO members share many of the same concerns as the United States about Chinese trade and would likely be willing allies in WTO negotiations and litigation. The United States should work closely with its allies and other trading partners instead of bullying them and insulting them. Multilateral actions are the best way to discipline unfair Chinese trade practices, ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of our own goods and services, help provide more and better jobs for the American people, and help the Chinese people move more quickly toward creating the broader market economy that will bring them greater prosperity.



A Democratic policy that affirms the centrality of the WTO in expanding trade need not be a policy that relies on the WTO _exclusively_ in expanding trade and the oppor­tunities that can be derived from trade. Democrats should also support trade agreements with other countries whenever such agreements add to the volume of trade and to the commercial domain covered by the rules for trade. A free trade area between countries that belong to the WTO is permitted under WTO rules as an exception to the most‐​favored‐​nation treatment obligation that prohibits trade discrimination when it covers substantially all the trade between the area’s members.39 If poorly constructed, such agreements can impede or divert trade, but if they are well constructed they can be proving grounds for new approaches to trade that can be tried first bilaterally or regionally and then, once proven, be implemented globally.



Throughout the past quarter of a century, foremost among the free trade agreements of the United States has been the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with our closest neighbors and major trading partners, Mexico and Canada. NAFTA created the world’s largest free trade area, linking 470 million consumers in a $19 trillion market. Trade among the three countries has quadrupled under this treaty. Investment has multiplied fivefold. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that six million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Mexico and eight million jobs depend on trade with Canada. A narrow focus on bilateral trade deficits among the three countries can be misleading. For example, 40 percent of every dollar of the value of every good exported from Mexico to the United States is—in reality—the re‐​export back to the United States of something made in America by U.S. workers. For U.S. trade with Canada, the comparable figure is 25 percent. Workers and businesses in each of the three NAFTA countries are made more competitive worldwide through the integration of regional supply chains that create and sustain jobs throughout North America.40



After long assailing NAFTA, Trump has renegotiated it and rechristened it the United States‐​Mexico‐​Canada Agreement (USMCA). This new NAFTA is in many respects identical to the old one. In digital trade and a few other sectors, the new agreement incorporates long‐​needed improvements developed in the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP)—the regional trade agreement that Trump rejected in one of his first acts as president. Otherwise, however, the new provisions in the revised agreement fully justify the glaring omission of the words “free trade” in its new name. The new treaty is less of a free trade agreement and more of a managed trade agreement. All in all, the revised regional agreement could be called “NAFTA minus.”



In particular, the new and esoteric rules of origin that impose stricter requirements of more domestic content in automobile production are classic examples of managed trade. These rules of origin replace market‐​based outcomes with the arbitrary dictates of politicians and bureaucrats. For U.S. consumers, the result will be fewer choices and higher‐​priced autos. For U.S. businesses, the result will be less global competitiveness. For U.S. workers, the result will be the short‐​term protection of some jobs in the U.S. auto industry at the expense of the long‐​term preservation and the innovative creation of many more jobs throughout the economy. These are always the costs of protectionism. This said, “NAFTA minus” is better than no NAFTA at all. And Democrats should, over time, endeavor to transform “NAFTA minus” into “NAFTA plus” by engaging in more negotiations with our friends and closest neighbors to the north and the south.



Democrats in Congress should take another look, too, at the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership, which was rejected by President Trump on his first day in office. With the United States on the sidelines, 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim have gone ahead to form the TPP without America, renaming it the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This partnership includes almost all the mutual trade commitments in the TPP agreement that was negotiated by Obama. A return by the United States to the treaty could be conditioned on agreement by the 11 other countries to implement about 20 provisions that were put on hold when Trump withdrew the United States, including intellectual property protections, safeguards against the illegal taking and trade of wildlife, and more.41



In the aftermath of rejecting the TPP, Trump has been trying to negotiate bilaterally many of the trade concessions that would have been secured in the TPP. Meanwhile, America’s trading partners along the Pacific Rim, and especially those in Southeast Asia, are left to doubt our commercial and national commitment to the Pacific region as it becomes an ever‐​increasing part of the global economy and an ever more important factor in geopolitics. By becoming a part of the CPTPP, the United States can secure many trade benefits while also reassuring trans‐​Pacific allies and other trading partners that America has not retreated from that crucial crossroads of the world.



Democratic trade policy should also include support for other current and proposed trade arrangements, such as seeking broader trade liberalization with Japan. The Trump administration has signed a partial deal with Japan, but much work remains to be done. Democrats should move ahead with negotiations on a trade deal to eliminate the remaining tariff and non‐​tariff barriers to trade with the European Union, including on both agricultural and manufactured goods, and they should proceed with free trade negotiations with Brazil and Kenya, and perhaps with other Latin American and African countries. And Democrats should most certainly enhance America’s commercial relations with the United Kingdom by early conclusion of a U.S.-UK free trade agreement. In all these endeavors, Democrats must insist on negotiating tactics that are firmly in support of U.S. trade interests but that do not descend into unseemly threats and bullying.



Moving forward, more attention will need to be given when negotiating and renegotiating all international trade agreements to a number of the so‐​called “trade and” issues that have met with mixed success in recent decades: “trade and labor,” “trade and the environment,” “trade and human rights,” and more. Criticisms of WTO and other international trade rules and rulings on these “trade and” issues have often been incorrect or exaggerated, yet these are entirely legitimate concerns in 21st‐​century world commerce.



The kinds of provisions to seek in trade agreements that would address these concerns could include those intended to improve working conditions and enhance environmental protections when making and trading goods. For instance, current trade agreements do not even mention climate change. Democrats could insist that current trade agreements and any new ones acknowledge the common global interest in pursuing trade in ways that are consistent with compliance with the Paris climate agreement and with accomplishment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. As policy, such positions could help weave together U.S. actions on several vital policy fronts into a consistent approach that could work affirmatively on all fronts. As a political tactic, such actions would also make it likely that more congressional Democrats would be willing to vote for trade agreements. The challenge, as always, would be in drawing the right lines that would promote trade while also taking seriously these other equally legitimate concerns.



An increase in trade will produce the most prosperity for Americans—and for lower‐​income Americans even more than for those with the highest incomes—if it is accompanied by the many domestic initiatives that are needed to create more competitiveness. This approach alone will ensure that all Americans are empowered to compete in the new global economy. Only if Americans have the skills, the tools, and the enabling frameworks they need to compete will increased trade lead to a much broader sharing of the gains from trade and thus to a more widely shared prosperity. For this reason, a pro‐​trade policy must not be limited solely to trade policy. A commitment to achieving more openness in international trade must be one part of an overall strategy for legislation and governance that supports and secures the best from liberal, market‐​based capitalism while enabling the full flourishing of all Americans.



Openness is a prerequisite to competitiveness, but it does not guarantee it. Thus, in addition to openness, this comprehensive strategy must provide all Americans with an equal opportunity to achieve a personal competitiveness that can be maximized only if there is openness, because “[o]penness alone does not lead to success. The competitiveness of economies in an integrated world [is determined by] how well they convert the potential created by access to global markets into opportunities for their … people.”42 The opportunities offered by more trade will result in more freedom for all of us only if trade is accompanied by domestic actions that better enable all of us to make the most of more trade. An increased openness to more and freer trade internationally must be matched domestically by actions that open the way for more people everywhere to share in the gains from trade. Without such domestic actions, the gains derived from more and freer trade will be fewer, and those gains will be enjoyed by fewer people. All too often, in America and elsewhere, this is precisely what has happened so far in this century.43



During the past several decades, an increasing number of Democratic activists and members of the House and Senate have turned away from trade because they have mistakenly seen it as a cause of U.S. economic stagnation and anxiety. But domestic policy, not international trade policy, is largely to blame. Democrats should refrain from reflexively opposing trade and trade agreements. Instead, they should work to improve existing agreements and negotiate new ones in ways that address 21st‐​century needs without descending into the false promise of protectionism. Simultaneously, they should focus on finding ways to reeducate, retrain, reemploy, and generally reengage American workers and communities that have been caught short by the relentless and disruptive march of technology and globalization. Democrats should do much more to help prepare the American people to compete in an increasingly integrated and technologically advanced global economy.



What are the needed domestic actions that would enhance American competitiveness in the trading world? The list is long. The alienation of Americans who feel abandoned by their representatives has fueled the populist reaction against trade and globalization. The widespread failure of leadership—from both Democrats and Republicans—has contributed significantly to a misplaced opposition to free trade. But stopping trade will not restart job creation. Freeing trade will.44



Open economies are engines of growth, while closed economies decline and die. Competitiveness can only be maximized if there is openness.45 The best path to competitiveness will vary from country to country, yet the basic ingredients of competitiveness are everywhere much the same. These ingredients include open trade and investment, supportive laws and institutions that enable open markets, and—to glue it all together—the rule of law. Equally essential are financial stability and fiscal solvency. What is more, the basic ingredients of competitiveness include maximizing the potential gains from trade and other economic endeavors—and thus the potential for the enjoyment of individual human freedom—by finding and combining the right mix of market and government actions.



The right line must be drawn everywhere between private and public, between markets and governments, between the necessity to preserve personal liberty and the necessity to empower it. In striving always to find this right line, we must provide: accessible lifelong education for both work and citizenship, beginning with essential and cost‐​saving investments in early childhood development; practical, skills‐​based training and other forms of transitional assistance, such as refundable tax credits for workers; modern and environmentally friendly roads, transit systems, water systems, bridges, seaports, airports, spaceports, communications, power grids, and all other kinds of infrastructure; a fair, limited, and broadly shared tax base; and strong protections for civil rights and worker rights. We must also do more to improve labor mobility; make health care more accessible and affordable; encourage basic scientific research and development; enable an economic atmosphere that supports individual and cooperative initiative, incentive, and enterprise; enforce antitrust laws that ensure ample market competition; and pursue other initiatives that help motivate new economic opportunities through an open economy in an open society.



We Americans cannot maximize our share of the future if we cling stubbornly to a past that no longer exists. One essential ingredient of sustaining and strengthening competitiveness is an openness to change. The embrace of freedom demands a willingness to undergo “the ordeal of change” for the sake of a better future.46 For any individual, any enterprise, or any country to be competitive in shaping such a future, there must be a firm and unwavering understanding that, as Nobel Prize–winning economist Michael Spence put it, “Sustained growth and structural change go hand in hand.”47 To be successful in generating economic growth, free markets must be free, if need be, to reinvent the old and create the new.



The older sectors of our economy resist the creative destruction of capitalism.48 They resist the idea of comparative advantage—the economic concept that we prosper most when we specialize in producing things that we produce relatively better than others. (Note the word “relatively” here, the oft‐​omitted core of this enduring concept.) As we have witnessed time and again, in trade policy and otherwise, those who derive power and profit from the status quo will seek to forestall change, even change for the better. The less‐​competitive parts of the economy will resist yielding to the arrival of the new, and will often seek to survive by securing the subsidizing support and other favoritism of government through crony capitalism.



As Franklin Roosevelt said in 1932, “The same man who tells us that he does not want to see the government interfere with business … is the first to go to the White House and ask the government for a prohibitive tariff on his product.”49 Entrenched economic interests that are no longer internationally competitive will do all they can to preserve their entrenchment while denying to themselves the incentivizing benefits of international competition and denying to others new opportunities resulting from new ideas, goods, and services that derive from increased trade and investment. All those engaged in the broader economy will pay the opportunity costs of this protectionism through higher costs, higher taxes, lost innovation, and lost job opportunities.



Whether or not Democrats win the presidency and control of the Congress in 2021, they should adopt a pro‐​trade agenda that centers on renewing support for trade as a policy that can benefit all Americans. They should restore the constitutional authority of Congress over international trade, and, at the same time, ensure the authority of the president to negotiate new trade agreements in accordance with the expressed will of Congress. To reset our currently fraught trading relationships, Democrats should immediately repeal all unilateral tariffs imposed on imports by the Trump administration under Sections 232 and 301. There must also be a new approach to trade with China, one that makes better use of existing rules and works with America’s allies to develop new rules.



Democrats should also renew the United States’ commitment to the rule of law in trade, including exclusive reliance on the WTO dispute settlement mechanism for resolving all trade disputes with other WTO members that fall within the scope of the WTO treaty, as well as support for the WTO’s multilateral trading system. Democrats should disavow managed trade, support the basic WTO rules forbidding trade discrimination, and work with U.S. trading partners to restore the WTO Appellate Body as an independent and impartial tribunal for final appeals in WTO dispute settlement.



They should also work to reform the WTO by modernizing it as a fully 21st‐​century international trade institution. This should be done, in part, by negotiating new and better WTO rules on digital trade, services trade, intellectual property protections, investment, competition, product standards and regulations, and more. Moreover, in addition to strengthening multilateral rules, Democrats should also negotiate new bilateral and regional trade agreements wherever needed to reduce trade barriers and serve as proving grounds for potentially new and improved global trade rules.



Lastly, to increase and distribute more widely the benefits of trade, Democrats must also undertake reform at home. Effective domestic actions to help all Americans make the most of the gains from trade by enhancing American competitiveness in the United States and in global markets are essential. Making it easier for Americans to innovate and compete at home and abroad is a crucial element to a continued and broadened American prosperity.

"This September, the Guardian is teaming up with Covering Climate Now and some of the world’s leading news organizations to highlight the issue of climate change in the 2020 elections with a first-time voter takeover. The aim is to amplify the voices of a generation of Americans whose lives will be profoundly shaped by the climate crisis – and highlight what’s at stake in the election for young voters. If you’re between 18 and 22, and are voting in the US presidential elections for the first time in November, we want to hear from you. We are inviting first-time voters to apply to be guest editors of Guardian US for a day – and help oversee a special digital issue on the climate crisis. We will choose between six and 10 young voters to edit the Guardian US’s climate coverage on 21 September, the day that kicks off this year’s climate week. Guest editors will work closely with Guardian journalists in advance of the day to choose and assign stories for the site, including news and feature pieces, photography, video projects, high-profile interviews and social media content. You don’t need any special journalism expertise to apply, just lots of creative ideas and an interest in telling stories about the climate crisis. The time commitment will likely involve two or three digital planning meetings with Guardian journalists in late August and September, and some independent work in between sessions. If you have any questions, please email Noa Yachot, membership editor for the Guardian US, at noa.yachot@guardian.co.uk. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSweden residents can’t remember seeing so much snow in August since the 1960s. Villagers can’t remember there’s ever been so much snow left at this time. “It should have been gone by now but it’s not.” “More snow than bare ground.”
Without end the public have been hearing about the above normal temperatures in Europe this summer. But all this talk has been misleading. When someone drives your face down only millimeters away from a gravel surface, then unsurprisingly the whole world starts looking like gravel. This is the tactic used by the media lately.
It turns out of course that the warm European summer has been limited more to central and southeastern Europe. The media refuses to talk about what has been going on over a vast North Atlantic region spanning from Greenland to Great Briatain, and across Scandinavia.
Luckily German website wobleibtdieerderwaermung (wherestheglobalwarming) give us the rest of the picture.
It turns out northern Europe has been downright frigid this summer, and the future looks pretty bleak.
The German site writes:
The cold summer that has gripped foremost northern and western Europe in 2015 has resulted in record snow heights on the mountains surrounding the Swedish winter sports resort “Klimpfjäll” in the southernmost part of the Lappland province, as WeatherAction News Blog reports.”

Record snow in August 2015 on the mountains “Klimpfjäll” in Sweden. Image source: www.klimpfjalladventure.com/.
The older residents in the mountain region can’t remember seeing so much snow in August since the 1960s. The mountains have an elevation of 1400 to 1600 meters, i.e. similar to Denver.
WeatherAction News Blog reports on Sweden this summer:
A very unique situation, say the residents in the area.
The approaching autumn, and still do not have the snow melting away on the mountains. Villagers in Klimpfjäll cannot remember there ever been so much snow left at this time.
‘I’ve plowed this since the 60s and this much snow has never been there. It should have been gone by now but it’s not,’ says Agne Eliasson in Klimpfjäll.”
Swedish Västerbotten site here reports:
Snow drifts in the low mountain should normally be gone now. Go towards the Norwegian border to the west at 1100 meters altitude, then there is more snow than bare ground.”

Of course the icy August cold is not limited to Scandinavia.
Iceland sees coldest summer in 20 years
Earlier NTZ reported here that Iceland had been experiencing one of its coldest summers in 20 years.
Met Office meteorologist Páll Bergþórsson suspected already in April 2015 that the cold was not an isolated event, but the start of a significant cold period.
If this holds, expect this to have major implications on Arctic sea ice in the years ahead.
Record cold in Great Britain
Also Paul Homewood reported at his site that Ireland and Great Britain are experiencing a cool summer of 2015. wobleibtdieerderwaerming writes that Great Britain saw some of its coldest July nights in many years. Southern England saw an overnight low of only 1°C, which was the coldest measured temperature ever observed on the first of August.
Scotland sees “hats, scarves and gloves” – in July!
The Scotsman here reports of “hats, scarves and gloves in July in one of the most dismal summers in living memory. It adds: “It’s the second time this month snow has been forecast.” Remember, it’s the peak of summer!
The Mail here writes that in the Scottish Highlands there are more remaining snow patches than have been seen for 20 years.
Approaching the North Atlantic Ice Age
Unfortunately the data do not support the notion that these are mere temporary weather developments. Rather experts are warning that it may be the start of an unpleasant cold pattern with serious consequences for Europe – a continent that has (foolishly?) rushed into preparations for warmer long-term temperatures. For years a number of meteorologists and climate experts have been warning that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) was beginning its cooling phase and that this would usher cooler temperatures.
North Atlantic sea surface temperature data have been worrisome. They show that June and July of 2015 have seen the lowest temperature in 14 years:
 
North Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies using the WMO 1981-2010 climate mean. Source: www.climate4you.com/. 
The next few years will tell us whether or not that trend will continue, or be reversed. Experts are less than optimistic.

Twenty years after the introduction of the euro, the European Monetary Union (EMU) is at its crossroads. Following the outbreak of the European financial and debt crisis in 2008, the European Central Bank (ECB) took comprehensive measures to stabilize the common currency. Interest rates were cut to and below zero and several asset purchase programs have inflated the ECB balance sheet (Riet 2018). Within the European System of Central Banks, large imbalances have emerged via the TARGET2 payments system, which can be seen as quasi‐​unconditional credit in favor of the southern euro area countries (Sinn 2018).



While the ECB terminated its asset purchase program at the end of 2018 and is expected to increase interest rates in late 2019, financial instability is reemerging. Growing uncertainty about the fiscal discipline of the Italian government has triggered a significant increase in risk premiums on Italian government bonds. In particular, in Italy and Greece, but also in Germany, bad loans and assets remain stuck in the banking systems. In the face of the upcoming downswing, European banks do not seem ready for new financial turmoil.



In this fragile environment, the future path of the EMU is uncertain. To enhance the stability of the EMU, a group of German and French economists has called for a common euro area budget, for a strengthening of the European Stability Mechanism as lender of last resort for euro area countries and banks, as well as for a common European deposit insurance scheme (Bénassy‐​Quéré et al. 2018). In response, 154 German economists have warned against transforming the EMU into what they call a “liablity union,” which systematically undermines market principles and wealth (Mayer et al. 2018).



In 2018, a French‐​German initative to introduce a common euro area budget faced strong opposition from a group of northern European countries as well as from Italy, symbolizing the political deadlock concerning reforms of the EMU. This article explains the different views on the institutional setting of monetary policymaking in Europe from a historical perspective. It begins with a description of the economic and monetary order in postwar Germany. It then discusses the positive implications for the European integration process and the economic consequences of the transformation of postwar German monetary order. The final section offers some economic policy recommendations.



The currency reform in the three western occupation zones of Germany on June 20, 1948, formed the basis for West Germany’s impressive postwar recovery (Buchheim 1998). Until then, monopolization, central planning, price controls, and the state‐​led allocation of goods had determined the living conditions of Germans. The turnaround came due to the fortunate coincidence of three factors: (1) the U.S. occupying forces under General Lucius Clay believed in market principles and pushed toward the resolution of cartels (Ritschl 2016); (2) Walter Eucken (1952) and Franz Böhm (1950) had developed the academic foundations for a liberal economic and legal system; and (3) in 1947, Ludwig Erhard, an advocate of a liberal economic order, took over the leadership of the Special Office for Money and Credit ( _Sonderstelle Geld und Kredit_ ), which was preparing the currency reform.



The reform was initated by the U.S. Congress, which aimed to reduce the economic burden on the starving German population. The first step was to eliminate the overhang of money that had been created by financing the war by printing fiat money. As money was in excessive supply, it disturbed the efficient use of resources. Most goods were rationed and only available on a certificate of entitlement that limited production. The overhang of money undermined the acceptance of the Reichsmark as a means of payment and store of value. A rapid economic recovery was to be expected, as the industrial plants had survived the war largely without serious damage (Ritschl 2005).



The Bank Deutscher Länder was founded in March 1948 as the predecessor of Deutsche Bundesbank (Buchheim 1998). The new Deutsche Mark (DM) banknotes were printed in the United States. On June 20, 1948, the population received 40 DM per capita. Companies and tradesmen received 60 DM per employee. Cash and bank deposits were exchanged at a ratio of 100 Reichsmark to 6.5 DM; debt at a ratio of 100:10; and wages, prices, and rents at a ratio of 1:1. Thus, the owners of physical assets such as goods, companies, and real estate gained while savers lost. A recompensation scheme (Lastenausgleich) provided only partial compensation (see Hughes 1999).



After drastic hardships of the prewar, war, and postwar periods, the currency reform became one of the “most striking positive collective experiences of the Germans.“1 While on June 19, 1948, many shops were still closed — allegedly due to being sold out or due to illness — from June 20 the shelves suddenly filled. The high demand quickly caused production to rise to prewar levels (Erhard 1958: 13–15).2 On the basis of the “Law Governing the Principles of Planning and Price Policy after the Currency Reform” of June 24, 1948, price controls were successively relaxed and wage freezes were lifted.



The large enterprises pushed for price controls and restrictions to market access. Erhard (1958: 101) vehemently opposed them: “Any fragmentation of the national economy into vested interests cannot therefore be allowed.” Erhard (1958: 136) regarded it as risky if entrepreneurs moved from personal responsibility to the socialization of risks. He saw cartels as detrimental for small and medium enterprises, which were not able to build cartels (Erhard 1958: 137–38). In his view, cartels would ultimately have to be paid by people with a lower standard of living. In 1958, the “Law against Restraints on Competition” came into force, which prohibited cartels and subjected mergers to the approval of the cartel office.3



Eucken (1952), one of the most prominent representatives of German ordoliberalism,4 formulated eight constitutive principles of a market economy, which were implemented in large parts of the economy:5



1\. The primacy of monetary policy was applied: “All efforts to make a competitive order a reality are pointless unless a certain level of monetary stability can be ensured. Monetary policy thus has primacy for the competitive order.” (Eucken 1952: 256). The DM issued by the independent Deutsche Bundesbank formed a stable backbone for the economy.



2\. The stable currency in combination with free prices ensured that prices provided reliable information about the scarcity of goods and consumer preferences.6 Therefore, the production structure was able to adapt to demand. Erhard (1958: 28) placed the consumer at the center of his economic policy: “The customer became king again; a buyers’ market began!“7



3\. The markets were open. New companies could enter at any time, unprofitable companies had to leave the market. Monopoly supervision prevented excessive market power. Consumers benefitted from competition in the form of lower prices and thereby higher real wages.



4\. In contrast to Soviet‐​occupied East Germany, private ownership of means of production was predominant, which was seen as an important prerequisite for an efficient allocation of resources. Only those who can privatize the profits will strive for the greatest possible efficiency.



5\. Due to freedom of contract, excluding contracts that would build monopolistic power, everyone was free to organize his economic activities according to his strengths.



6\. The liability principle guaranteed that profits could be retained, but also that losses had to be borne by the individual. Only if people can be made liable for their actions (it was assumed) will they act economically responsibly.



7\. According to Eucken, economic policy should be constant and forward‐​looking. He was very cautious in using state interventions and defended market principles against interest groups.



8\. Thus, as demanded by Eucken (1952) in his eighth principle, all seven principles were to be jointly fulfilled in broad areas of the West German economy.



Even though sectors such as banking, insurance, transport, and many public monopolies remained excluded from free competition (Rhonheimer 2017), the free market economy could unfold its potential in an impressive way.8Figure 1 shows the real growth rates of the Federal Republic of Germany since 1950, which between 1950 and 1990 refer to West Germany and since 1991 to unified Germany. While the economy was still idle in 1948, growth accelerated rapidly. Machinery ran smoothly, wages rose faster than prices, and unemployment fell steadily. While 1.3 million unemployed were registered in 1949 (Erhard 1958: 90), full employment was reached in 1962 with 0.7 percent unemployment (Figure 2).







Germany was surprised by an economic miracle that stood in fundamental contrast to the economically and politically fragile interwar period. The notion of “ _Wirtschaftswunder_ ” emerged. Erhard, who was minister of economic affairs from 1949 to 1963 and chancellor from 1963 to 1966, embodied the new prosperity with his thick cigars. Erhard’s (1958) book _Prosperity through Competition_ makes one aware that the market economy was anything but a self‐​runner and had to be constantly defended: “The danger of limitation of competition threatens constantly from many sides. One of the most important tasks … is, therefore, to secure free competition” (Erhard 1958: 2).



The programs of the political parties only slowly adapted to the evident economic success of the currency and economic reform. The Ahlen program of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of 1947, which aimed at overcoming capitalism and socialism, still had many elements also found in the East German socialist planning economy. Only in 1949 did the CDU turn to the market economy in the “Düsseldorf Guidelines,” which were written under the strong influence of Ludwig Erhard. The CDU combined the principles of ordoliberalism with the Christian social doctrine, which places normative values above the self‐​interest of individuals and social groups (Blank 1967).



The Social Democratic Party (SPD) initially opposed the reforms. “It is wrong to throw the sick man into cold water and expect him to swim,” raved SPD politician Kreyßig.9 In 1950, his party unsuccessfully filed a motion to remove Erhard from his office. Erhard (1958: 2) had countered that “prosperity for all” and “prosperity through competition” belonged inseparably together. The first postulate marked the goal; the second, the path leading to the goal. It was not until 1959 that the SPD admitted its support for the social market economy in the “Godesberg Programme” under the slogan “competition as far as possible, planning as much as necessary.” The German people followed Erhard and helped the CDU to an absolute majority in the 1957 election.



The fathers of the market economy must have realized that a pure market economy would have been politically difficult to defend without promising social balance. Both the CDU and the SPD had added to the market economy the attribute “social” to make it politically digestible. Eucken (1952) had formulated four regulative principles in addition to the eight constitutive principles: (1) monopoly control, (2) the control of excesses on the labor market (such as wages below the subsistence minimum), (3) the internalization of negative external effects (such as environmental pollution), and (4) redistribution in favor of very low‐​income groups through a progressive tax system.



Alfred Müller‐​Armack (1947) had proposed combining the principle of freedom on the market with that of social balance under the term “social market economy” (see also Müller‐​Armack 1956: 390). He saw three levels of sociality:



1\. The social consequences of the market, which teaches people to be reliable and aligns production with the preferences of consumers.



2\. The regulatory policy, which prevents monopolies and secures monetary stability.10



3\. The redistributive policy, which should ensure the acceptance of the new order. Social equality was enshrined in the “Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany of 1949.” Article 20, paragraph 1 states: “The Federal Republic of Germany is a democratic and social federal state.”



The great success of the reforms — real growth in Germany in the 1950s averaged 8 percent per year — spread throughout Europe. France, through the European Coal and Steel Community (1951), aimed to control the reviving West German economy by a “High Authority.” In the negotiations of the European Economic Community (from 1958), France could achieve common European institutions (institutional integration), which paved the way to a formal framework for redistribution from the north to the south. For its part, Germany, in the spirit of ordoliberalism, promoted the freedom for the flows of goods, services, labor, and capital in the common market (functional integration):11



The integration of Europe is more necessary than ever, it has become almost overdue. But the best kind of integration which I can imagine does not depend on the establishment of new offices and administrative procedures or a growing bureaucracy; it depends in the first instance on the reconstruction of a free international order, as best and most completely expressed in a free convertibility of the currency. Convertibility of the currency, of course, includes complete freedom of movement of goods, services and capital [Erhard 1958: 211].



While the common institutions formed the political basis for supranational decisionmaking in Europe, Germany’s liberal order became the economic basis for the European integration process, which was in the mutual interest of all Europeans (Müller and Schnabl 2018). The opening of European markets enabled Germany’s industry to benefit from economies of scale in industrial production. Additional productivity gains boosted wages and therefore the tax revenues of the German government. The southern and western European partner countries, whose growth models were based on central bank–financed government spending (De Grauwe 2012: 151), and thus exhibited less robust growth dynamics, benefitted from growing import demand from Germany.



As the monetary policies of the southern and western European countries were expansionary in comparison to Germany, they could import parts of the German growth via the devaluation of their currencies (beggar‐​thy‐​neighbor). This was possible because the Deutsche Bundesbank, which was geared to the primacy of monetary stability, did not devalue the German mark in response to the devaluations of the other European currencies. The credible committment of the Deutsche Bundesbank to the stable currency thus prevented the destructive devaluation race that had occured in the 1930s after the successive dissolution of the gold parities.12



Figure 3 illustrates the significant devaluations of the French franc, Italian lira, Spanish peseta, and British pound against the DM up to the euro qualification process in the 1990s. The currencies of countries that became economically strongly intertwined with Germany, such as the Netherlands, remained tightly pegged to the German mark. The gradual depreciations of the southern and western European currencies constituted a persistent competitive disadvantage for the northern European export industries, which created a persistent pressure to innovate and increase efficiency. The resulting productivity gains formed the backbone for the large prosperity gains in postwar Europe. As a result, GDP per capita grew all over Europe, widely independent from the monetary regime, as shown in Figure 4 for Germany and France.







In Germany, the high productivity gains went hand in hand with a rapidly rising real wage level and a generous expansion of the social security system. High tax revenues enabled growing financial contributions to the European Community. The common agricultural policy and European regional policy created institutional platforms for redistribution of wealth from north to south. The size of these funds grew with the accession of more southern European states such as Greece, Spain, and Portugal. The net transfers of wealth from north to south created a positive climate for removing barriers to trade, services, capital, and labor movements, which boosted economies of scale in Germany and all of Europe. Germany’s net payments to the European institutions in 2017 amounted to around 14 billion euros, a volume similar to that of the domestic German regional equalization system (14.8 billion euros in 2017).



For a long time, the stability orientation of the Deutsche Bundesbank set limits to both the German welfare state and redistribution to other European countries. If tax revenues and the scope for borrowing were no longer sufficient to meet expenditure commitments, reforms were necessary as financing via the printing press was excluded. With the generous German welfare system and the high wage level being transferred to East Germany in the course of the German unification, the German welfare state reached its limits during the 1990s.



By 1994, national debt had grown close to the Maastricht threshold of 60 percent of GDP; unemployment had risen to a record 13 percent. To ensure the commitment to low debt as enshrined in the Maastricht treaty, extensive reforms were implemented under the slogan “Hartz IV” including tightened government spending (Burda and Seele 2016). The liberalization of the labor market led to wage restraints in the private sector, which went along with wage austerity in the private sector. The flexibilization of the labor market and the restructuring of the social security systems created the potential for new prosperity gains as represented by the subsequent persistent decline of unemployment.



At this time, however, a fundamental turnaround for the German monetary and economic order was already on the horizon, triggered by the reorientation of European monetary policy. The ECB had been created after the blueprint of Deutsche Bundesbank as independent (Article 130 TFEU) and being primarily committed to price stability (Article 127 TFEU). Yet, following the bursting of the dotcom bubble (2000), the ECB stabilized the European economy — in particular low‐​growth Germany, France, and Italy — with sharp interest rate cuts (Figure 5). Large parts of the created liquidity went to the south of the euro area, where the capital inflows financed, from 2003 onward, increasingly excessive credit growth leading to real estate and stock market bubbles (Schnabl 2018). Real wages increased beyond productivity increases, and government expenditure increased fast on the back of (temporarily) inflated tax revenues.13





In 2007, capital inflows to the southern and western euro area countries dried out, triggering the European financial and debt crisis, which forced the ECB into an even more expansive monetary policy to stabilize the southern euro area crisis countries. The ECB lowered the main refinancing rate to zero. In response to the rising risk premia on southern euro area government bonds, ECB President Mario Draghi (2012) announced in July 2012 that he would do “whatever it takes” to prevent the euro area from breaking up. Thus, he gave an implicit guarantee declaration for all highly indebted euro states. This put into question the no bailout clause (Article 125 TFEU), which was intended to exclude the liability of the European Union (EU) and other member states for the debt of individual member states.



From March 2015 to December 2018, outright asset purchases equivalent to 2,600 billion euros inflated the ECB balance sheet (Figure 5). The purchases of government bonds by the ECB amounting to 2,000 billion euros can be seen to be in contradiction to the ban on the financing of government expenditure by the central bank (Article 123 TFEU).14 The ECB’s easy money eliminated rapidly rising risk premiums on the debt of the southern euro states.15



The fundamental change in the monetary policy stance of the ECB is equivalent to a change in the German monetary and economic order. Whereas in 1948 the removal of the monetary overhang and the introduction of stable money had formed the backbone of the German economic miracle, the expansion of the monetary base far beyond the expansion of output eroded Eucken’s (1952) constitutive principles (Freytag and Schnabl 2017).



The negative impact of persistently low short‐​term (via conventional monetary policy) and long‐​term (via unconventional monetary policy) interest rates on German growth dynamics can be derived based on the overinvestment theory of Mises (1912) and Hayek (1931): An overinvestment boom is triggered by a fall of the interest rate set by the central bank below the natural interest rate, which constitutes a long‐​term equilibrium between savings and investment.16 The too‐​low central bank interest rate triggers an unsustainable credit‐​financed investment and speculation boom (Schnabl 2018).



First, investment projects with high return are financed. As the boom goes on, low‐​return investments are put on track. The average marginal efficiency of investment declines. As profits of banks and enterprises increase, stock prices and wages rise. With low interest rates, deposits are converted to stocks. As incomes grow and people feel richer, demand for real estate increases. Fast rising stock and real estate prices may attract speculators, making the rise in asset prices self‐​fulling, becoming disconnected from fundamentals.17



In the overinvestment theory of Mises (1912) and Hayek (1931), when all idle production factors are employed, wages and prices rise, tempting the central bank to finally increase the key interest rate again (as the ECB did from 2005 onward). The benchmark for the profitability of all past and future investment projects is lifted and low‐​return investment projects have to be dismantled.18 With the central bank keeping the interest rate high, a downswing occurs (as in the southern euro area since 2007) during which prices and wages fall. With low‐​yield investment projects being dismantled, production factors can be shifted to investment projects with higher returns during the following economic recovery.



Following this pattern, between 2003 and 2007 the credit‐​financed booms in the southern euro area countries went along with stock and real estate bubbles (Schnabl 2018). Since 2008, the speculation boom has shifted to Germany. Figure 6 shows the sharp increase of real estate prices in Spain between 2003 and 2007, and in Germany since 2008. Yet, in contrast to the overinvestment theory, the ECB stabilized the southern euro area countries by sharply cutting interest rates and moving towards unconventional monetary policy measures. This prevented the cleasing effect and is keeping incentives, competition, and growth distorted.19





For German enterprises, the common European monetary policy represented a fundamental change in the business environment. Since 1948 the German mark had been a hard currency, being under persistent appreciation pressure, in particular since the breakdown of the Bretton‐​Woods System in the early 1970s.20 As central bank– financed growth impulses could not be expected, German enterprises had to continuously increase efficiency and innovate to stay competitive within Europe and world markets. The euro introduction and the ECB’s monetary policy eased this constraint for four reasons.



First, the introduction of the euro removed the appreciation pressure for exports to member states of the EMU, as intra‐​EMU exchange rates became irrevocably fixed. As in 1999, 44 percent of German exports went to the countries participating in the EMU. German enterprises had a significant relief from pressure originating in the depreciations of the other European currencies. After the outbreak of the European financial and debt crisis, ultra‐​low interest rates, along with the ECB’s large‐​scale asset purchases, substantially depreciated the euro and further boosted German exports.



Second, after the turn of the millennium, German attempts to comply with the Maastricht criteria triggered extensive labor market reforms and public wage austerity. The decline of the German wage level relative to other euro and noneuro countries increased German exports.



Third, Germany’s trading partners financed relative high wages and purchases of German goods via credit from Germany. Following the ECB’s interest rate cuts from 2001, German net capital exports, mainly to southern Europe, strongly increased (Figure 7). Since the outbreak of the European financial and debt crisis, private credit flows to southern Europe have dried up. Yet the sharply declining short‐​term and long‐​term interest rates, as well as the absorption of large parts of newly issued government bonds by the ECB, boosted capital outflows and depressed capital inflows. The resulting increase in German net capital outflows financed purchases of German goods mostly from outside the euro area (in particular, the United States), bringing the current account surpluses to new historical highs.





Fourth, the gradual interest rate cuts of the ECB reduced the financing costs for German enterprises. The average interest rate on credit to German enterprises declined from 5.8 percent in 1999 to 1.4 percent by 2018. The interest rate level fundamentally declined both for bank credit (to mostly small and medium enterprises) and financing on capital markets (of mostly large enterprises) (Figure 8). Between 2001 and 2005, and even more since the outbreak of the European financial and debt crisis in 2008, the financing conditions of German enterprises were strongly eased.





Therefore, from the point of view of Hayek’s (1968) “Competition as a Discovery Procedure,” the pressure on German and other northern European enterprises to increase efficiency and to innovate can be assumed to have become substantially reduced. Instead of generating profits via efficiency gains and innovation, German enterprises could realize windfall profits from reduced appreciation pressure, exchange rate depreciation, wage austerity, and steadily declining financing costs. As a result, the productivity gains of the German economy substantially declined, converging towards zero (Figure 9).





Both the exchange rate and interest rate effects of the euro and European monetary policy had concentration effects on the German enterprise sector, thereby restricting competition. Because large and large medium enterprises (hidden champions) are more export‐​oriented than medium and small enterprises, large enterprises have profited more from the increasing degree of exchange rate stability and, since 2008, from the strong euro depreciation. The sharp increase of net capital outflows since the turn of the millennium is equivalent to a relative shift from domestic to foreign demand, which boosted profits of export‐​oriented large enterprises relative to small and medium enterprises, which tend to be focused on the domestic market. The respective gain for large export‐​oriented enterprises is reflected in the substantial boost of stock prices since the start of the euro qualification period in 1996,21 and, in particular, since the advent of unconventional monetary policy measures in 2009. The German DAX, which is dominated by large, export‐​oriented industrial enterprises, has increased considerably (Figure 10).





Furthermore, since 2008 the persistent low‐​interest rate and unconventional monetary policy of the ECB have depressed the interest margins of the traditional banking business (Borio et al. 2017).22 Tightened regulation and capital requirements, in response to the global financial crisis, increased the costs of banks dealing with macroprudential measures. Both factors have constrained, in particular, small and medium banks, which traditionally provide credit to small and medium enterprises. Bank credit to corporations has hardly increased in Germany since 2008 despite further declining interest rates and robust growth (Figure 11).





In contrast, large enterprises could finance themselves directly on capital markets, where interest rates were depressed by both conventional and unconventional monetary policy measures. Large enterprises with own banks, such as Volkswagen, can refinance themselves directly at zero interest rates at the ECB. In addition, from June 2016, in the course of the Corporate Sector Purchase Programme, the ECB bought corporate bonds with investment grade equivalent to 180 billion euros.23 With less regulation being made with respect to corporate bond markets, the large enterprises overproportionally profited from the postcrisis loose monetary conditions. As shown in Figure 11, the volume of outstanding corporate bonds increased substantially, approaching the volume of outstanding bank credit to corporations.



The large additional liquidity provisions for large enterprises provided an incentive for speculation rather than for investing in efficiency and innovation. For investment in efficiency gains and innovation, Eucken’s (1952) liability principle holds: while profits can be privatized, losses have to be born by the enterprises. In the case of speculation in financial markets during the upswing, profits can be privatized. During the financial crisis, there was a high probability that the ECB would contain losses by further monetary expansion.



Stock repurchases became attractive because they increase the value of the enterprise without increasing profit expectations. Leveraged buyouts of large enterprises, likewise, enhance a firm’s global market power (e.g., in the case of the takeover of Monsanto by Bayer). Increasing market power makes it easier to either increase prices or reduce wages, given the enhanced negotiating power of the larger enterprise versus customers and trade unions. Also, as the firm’s negotiating power versus small and medium subcontractors increases, subcontractors are pressured to cut prices and depress wages.



As large corporations are indirectly subsidized, Erhard’s conviction that economic policymakers should not promote specific economic interests seems to be neglected. The special interests in favor of greater concentration in the German economy, which are often welcomed by politicians,24 are in contrast to the perception of Erhard who had warned that cartels were no way of overcoming crises, because they would prevent the organic resolution of the crisis and thus aggravate the crisis.25 Meanwhile, to resist the high degree of price pressure in the global markets, small and medium enterprises are building strategic alliances that further undermine competition.



The decline of productivity gains in Germany has been accompanied by declining productivity gains in the southern euro area crisis countries. Since the turn of the millennium up to the year 2007, the credit inflows from Germany and other northern European banks have allowed for the buildup of low‐​return investment projects (see Gopinath et al. 2017). While private credit provision to the southern euro area has collapsed since the outbreak of the crisis, the quasi‐​credit provision via the TARGET2 payments system of the European System of Central Banks, combined with the ECB’s extensive government bond purchases and other rescue facilities, keeps undercapitalized banks and enterprises with low productivity alive.



Since 2010, Deutsche Bundesbank has accumulated assets within the Eurosystem’s TARGET2 payments system amounting to almost 1,000 billion euros. The claims of Deutsche Bundesbank and some other northern European countries are matched by growing liabilities of southern euro countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal, and France (Figure 12). Since TARGET2 loans are nonrefundable and non‐​interest‐​bearing, they can be regarded as transfers in favor of other euro countries (Sinn 2018). This allows enterprise restructuring to be postponed and contributes to low or negative productivity gains.26





From the point of view of Mises (1912) and Hayek (1931), the ample provision of low‐​cost liquidity for banks and (indirectly) to companies creates negative incentives, which are reminiscent of the soft budget constraints of the Central and Eastern European planned economies before 1990 (Kornai 1986). At that time, inefficient enterprises were granted unconditional loans by the state‐​controlled banking sector to prevent unemployment. The state banks’ losses were covered by the money printing press. Inflation was suppressed by price controls. The result was a lack of efficiency gains and innovation, shortages in the supply of goods and services, and growing dissatisfaction among the population.



Acharya et al. (2016) find that in southern Europe undercapitalized banks extend loans to enterprises with low returns below interest rates charged on enterprises with high returns. So‐​called zombie lending, which became possible thanks to credit provision by the ECB at eased collateral requirements, allows southern European enterprises with low efficiency to keep alive. Storz et al. (2017) show that between 2010 and 2014 weak banks allowed zombie firms to survive and further increase debt, whereas healthy firms reduced their credit exposure.



Thus, the precrisis private‐​sector and postcrisis public‐​sector credit provision of northern European countries to southern Europe can be regarded as a substutitute for the transfers of wealth being engineered by the depreciations of the southern European currencies prior to the (qualification period for the) euro. From the perspective of German export enterprises, the credit provision has prevented a collapse of demand for German products from the southern euro area countries. The access of northern European enterprises to southern European markets is maintained, with the four freedoms of the EU remaining unchallenged.



However, the “transfer‐​based” new equilibrium in the EMU is less stable than the pre‐​euro “depreciation‐​based” equilibrium, because the change in the monetary order in Germany has undermined productivity gains. Pre‐​euro, the productivity gains in Germany and northern Europe were large enough to increase real wages in northern Europe and to provide reasonable amounts of direct and indirect transfers to other member states of the EU. As GDP per capita in all parts of Europe increased, the European political system was stable, also allowing the EU to finance and expand common European institutions.



Postcrisis, with productivity gains in Germany and some smaller neighboring countries converging toward zero, redistribution has become a zero‐​sum game. What is to be transferred from northern to southern Europe has to be taken away from the northern European populations in the form of real wage austerity, public expenditure cuts, growing tax burdens, or declining quality of public goods.27 Erhard’s maxim that one can only distribute a national product that has been produced beforehand seems to be forgotten.



Erhard’s insight that a market economy generates a fair real wage,28 seems to have become increasingly overruled in both parts of the EMU. Growing inequality promotes a lingering dissatisfaction among the populations in both northern and southern Europe.29 Erhard (1958: 216) had remarked: “A bureaucratically manipulated Europe, breeding reciprocal mistrust rather than a sense of community, apparently materialistic in its whole attitude, will bring in its train more dangers than benefits for Europe.” In both southern and northern Europe, the support for the traditional political parties is fading (Müller and Schnabl 2018).



That is why the return to the values promoted by Eucken (1952) and Erhard (1958) is recommended. Just as the stable German mark was the backbone of the German economic miracle, a stability‐​oriented European monetary policy is today the prerequisite for economic and political stability in Europe. Only if the ultra‐​loose monetary policy is reversed, and thereby the breeding ground of new financial crises is contained, can growth and real wages be stabilized and further negative distribution effects avoided. This reversal would safeguard the valuable achievements of the 1948 German currency and economic reform and the European integration process.

1 The quote is attributed to Ludwig Erhard. Ritschl (2005) argues that the transformation of the economic order was less pronounced than suggested by Erhard (1958). Important characteristics of the prewar and war economic system prevailed.



2 Erhard (1958: 13) cites Jacques Rueff and André Piettre as follows: “The black market suddenly disappeared. Shop windows were full of goods; factory chimneys were smoking; and the streets swarmed with lorries. Everywhere the noise of the new buildings going up replaced the deathly silence of the ruins. If the state of recovery was a surprise, its swiftness was even more so. In all sectors of economic life it began as the clocks struck on the day of currency reform.”



3 The law against restraints on competition did not correspond to the pure form of full competition, because it allowed for “rationalization cartels” (Rhonheimer 2017: 96–97).



4 Ordoliberalism is a German concept for a market economy. The state creates a regulatory framework for free economic action. The resulting competition generates prosperity. Undesirable developments such as high inequality and environmental pollution are corrected by the state. See also the constitutive and regulative principles of Eucken (1952). Other important representatives are Franz Böhm and Leonard Miksch.



5 Rhonheimer (2017: 89–94) points out that the concept of competition of Eucken (1952) and Erhard (1958) was different. Eucken (1952) and Böhm (1950) saw the ideal in many small companies with equal starting positions, and with entrepreneurs running their own companies. Erhard, on the other hand, as a practitioner, realized that this theoretical concept was unrealistic and inefficient. He regarded the coexistence of large, medium‐​sized, and small companies as ideal.



6 “With the currency reform, the veil which had made all calculation impossible had been torn off the economy; behind lay pseudo‐​employment” (Erhard 1958: 88).



7 “The yardstick and criterion of what is good or bad in economic policy are not dogmas or the points of view of pressure groups, but exclusively the human being, the consumer, the people. Economic policy can only be regarded as good if and as long as it is regarded simply as useful and welcomed by the individual” (Erhard 1958: 100–1).



8 Abelshauser (1975) contradicts the notion that postwar high growth was created by the new economic framework, but rather attributes the high growth to the postwar reconstruction. This is in contradiction to the fact that economic conditions in East Germany evolved fundamentally different.



9 Paraphrased by Erhard (1958: 85).



10 The German hyperinflation of the 1920s had highlighted the unfair distributional effects of inflation. It eroded the middle class, which led to increasing political instability.



11 The distinction between functional and institutional integration dates back to Balassa (1961). The distinguishing feature is the different degree of willingness to renounce economic sovereignty. Both areas of integration are interconnected because the integration of markets necessitates the establishment of institutions that regulate the process of integration.



12 On the competitive depreciations of the 1930s, see Kindleberger (1973).



13 As a result, the productivity gains generated by the Hartz IV reforms in Germany were consumed abroad.



14 The counter position is that the bond purchases of the ECB are not equivalent to government financing as long as the bonds are bought from secondary markets and not directly from governments.



15 The ECB buys the bonds of all euro countries except Greece according to the capital key, with the shares of the national central banks in the ECB’s capital being weighted according to the share of the respective member states in the total population and gross domestic product of the European Union.



16 The concept of the natural interest rate by Hayek (1931) is different from the natural interest rate by Woodford (2003), where the natural interest rate is the inflation‐​neutral interest rate, which has gradually declined since the 1990s (see Laubach and Williams 2015). For details see Schnabl (2018).



17 Since the mid‐​1980s, monetary expansions have increasingly been reflected in financial rather than goods markets (Hoffmann and Schnabl 2016). Gertler and Hofmann (2016) show that the relationship between the money supply (monetary base) and consumer price inflation became increasingly difficult to trace. Whereas central banks gradually cut interest rates toward zero and gradually expanded their balance sheets far beyond real GDP growth, inflation rates fell to historically low levels.



18 Schumpeter (1911) calls this a cleansing effect. On the role of the interest rate for reallocation of resources during a recession see also Borio et al. (2016).



19 Also, Erhard (1958: 91–92) had doubted that a central bank–financed credit expansion could generate growth and prosperity.



20 Under the Bretton‐​Woods‐​System, the German mark tended to be under appreciation pressure due to current account surpluses. In 1969 the mark was revalued by 9 percent against the dollar.



21 One qualification criterion for the euro was to keep the exchange rate within the band of the European Monetary System for at least two years without major tensions and without depreciating the central parity.



22 See Gerstenberger and Schnabl (2017) concerning the implications for the Japanese banking sector.

24 The German minister of finance Scholz advocated a merger between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank to create a very large German bank (Kayser 2018). Previously, the by then–minister of economic affairs Zypries had cheered the takeover of Air Berlin by Lufthansa to crown a national airline champion. Leading politicians such as Annegret Kramp‐​Karrenbauer and Peter Altmaier praise a new industrial policy to protect and promote German corporations.



25 “The calculation never works out — but the crisis deepens” (Erhard 1958: 135). “What can be protected and secured artifically by cartels are, at best, unproductive jobs, with the resulting danger that the whole national economy will cease to progress” (Erhard 1958: 136).



26 Cardarelli and Lusinyan (2015) show a similar development for the United States.



27 Meanwhile, there are daily press reports in Germany about a declining quality of public goods, for instance, streets, highways, railway transport, defense, child care, health care, schooling, and data transfer networks.



28 “This increase in economic efficiency is by no means an end in itself. The facts of the case of the social market economy can only be regarded as completely fulfilled when, in keeping with growing productivity, prices are lowered, thus making increases in real wages possible.” (Erhard 1958: 158).



29 Albeit, in the public perception real wage pressure and growing inequality are attributed to globalization (Golder 2016), both factors can be attributed to monetary policy (see Duarte 2018).

After years of Wall Street–friendly Democrats and Republicans with crossover appeal, of Chuck Schumers and Michael Bloombergs and Hillary Clintons and George Patakis, New Yorkers were finally ready for a candidate from the authentic Left. The election victor, who’d worked closely with the Working Families Party and financed his run with nearly $1 million from unions, was a true movement progressive, at home in the sorts of gatherings where “Joe Hill” might be sung and people know who Emma Goldman was. Writing in—where else?— _The Nation_ , the victor had earlier called for a resurgent Left to get beyond a mere “checklist” politics of demands and issues to a more “transformational” sort of politics, which, while promising to “make our lives better,” would also require that we “root out the assumptions about politics or economics or human nature that prevent us” from doing that. Of finding common ground and reaching across aisles, enough had been heard already: the real challenge was to “slow down the bone‐​crushing machinery of the contemporary conservative movement.”



These might sound like pages from the 2013 ascension of leftist New York City mayor Bill de Blasio. But, in fact, the script played out three years earlier, when New York’s progressives scored a breakthrough by electing as the state’s attorney general Eric Schneiderman, who had no prosecutorial experience but, as Ben Smith noted in a Politico profile the next year, had “spent his career building an ideological infrastructure for the left.” After edging out Nassau district attorney Kathleen Rice by 34 to 32 percent in a five‐​candidate primary, the Upper West Side state senator went on to win by 11 points in November against Republican candidate Dan Donovan. Last year, he won reelection against GOP challenger John Cahill, this time by a 13‐​point margin.





New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman has zealously used his office to pursue cases favored by left‐​wing activists.



Unlike his predecessors Eliot Spitzer and Andrew Cuomo, Schneiderman is not likely to found a cult of personality or publicly burn with an ambition for higher office. What he does make a show of doing is to remember the people who put him in office—labor advocates, community activists, and the sorts of Upper West Siders for whom progressive ideology is not just an Election Day predilection but a way of life—and help them get what they want. And while Schneiderman has clashed repeatedly with other prominent Democrats, it is a tribute to his staying power that both President Barack Obama and now Governor Andrew Cuomo saw fit to lure him into the tent with concessions and recognition rather than leave him to snipe outside.



Beyond the confines of Washington, D.C., the attorney general of the State of New York is, in some ways, the public official most feared by America’s business community, and for reasons that go beyond the famous tenure of hyperactive AG Eliot Spitzer. (See “Enforcer‐​in‐​Chief.”) While New York may now be only the fourth‐​largest state by population, it remains the nation’s center of finance and marketing. What’s more, unlike any other state’s attorney general, New York’s AG can draw on the uniquely prosecutor‐​empowering Martin Act of 1921, aimed primarily at financial fraud, the scope of which Nicholas Thompson, now of _The New Yorker_ , summarized in _Legal Affairs_ 11 years ago:



It empowers him to subpoena any document he wants from anyone doing business in the state; to keep an investigation totally secret or to make it totally public; and to choose between filing civil or criminal charges whenever he wants. People called in for questioning during Martin Act investigations do not have a right to counsel or a right against self‐​incrimination. Combined, the act’s powers exceed those given any regulator in any other state. Now for the scary part: To win a case, the attorney general doesn’t have to prove that the defendant intended to defraud anyone, that a transaction took place, or that anyone actually was defrauded. Plus, when the prosecution is over, trial lawyers can gain access to the hoards of documents that the case has churned up and use them as the basis for civil suits.



After wielding such extraordinary compulsory process, New York’s AG can then, entirely at his discretion, keep the resulting testimony and documents private or release them in full or in snippets, affording him a ready means of trying cases in the press or assisting private groups that may be fighting against the businesses. As Thompson relates, New York lawmakers armed the office with such extraordinary powers on the understanding that they would be used to keep out fly‐​by‐​night operators. That was until Spitzer went back on the unspoken deal and turned the act against established businesses, quickly bringing Merrill Lynch and other leading names of American finance to their knees. His successors have never looked back.



Personnel, as they say, is policy: for his chief of staff, the newly sworn‐​in attorney general Schneiderman chose not some career legal type but the up‐​and‐​coming political director of Unite Here, the hotel union. (His director of advocacy, like his top campaign advisor, had previously worked for the politically formidable Service Employees International Union, or SEIU.) And it doesn’t take long browsing Schneiderman’s official AG website—with its separate divisions for “social justice” and “economic justice”—to know that this is not the attorney general of Tennessee or Idaho. True, some of Schneiderman’s projects—a revamp of charities law, closer monitoring of prescription‐​drug writing, measures against cell‐​phone theft—might also interest a more conservative attorney general. Equally prominent, however, have been Schneiderman’s legal efforts directed at the so‐​called gun‐​show loophole or his threats of fraud actions against energy firms for allegedly overoptimistic projections of the benefits of upstate gas fracking—though, in that case, Schneiderman was just borrowing a page from his predecessor, Cuomo, who had browbeaten utilities into issuing more climate‐​change warnings—again, ostensibly, as a matter of investor protection.



For the labor movement, no issue has been dearer in recent years than the cause of low‐​wage work, the aim being both legislated wage mandates and the organizing of low‐​paid service workers into unions. Schneiderman has been in the fight all along, pushing hard on “wage theft”—a term that represents a continuum of practices, ranging from bald larceny by dishonest casual‐​labor jobbers to, say, not paying employees overtime if they once sent a work‐​related e‐​mail from their cell phone after office hours. He has taken a particular interest in harrying fast‐​food operators, the unions’ biggest and most elusive quarry. Schneiderman is so close with the unions that, when he sought $2 million in extra pay for deliverers from a Papa John’s franchisee, an official with the SEIU’s Fast Food Forward coalition learned about the suit—and wrote up a blurb in praise of it—before the pizza operator had gotten word.



In both New Jersey and New York, so‐​called price‐​gouging statutes—disliked by many economists but popular with voters—make it a punishable offense to charge high prices for scarce supplies like fuel or generators during an emergency. In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, as the _Wall Street Journal_ noted, New Jersey’s attorney general—who usually keeps a low profile, as he is not elected but appointed by that state’s governor—decided to go after several retail stores that he felt had committed well‐​defined infractions of the law. Schneiderman, by contrast—and stirring much more press notice—chose to file subpoenas aimed at exposing the identity of nameless middlemen (businesses or individual persons—it wasn’t clear) who had advertised gasoline at high prices on Craigslist, citing a vague legal provision against the charging of “unconscionably excessive” prices. Going after anonymous Craigslist vendors represents a more intrusive kind of enforcement, one that blurs the lines between public and private, between regulated businesses and what might turn out to be homeowners with an extra stock of gasoline in their garage. Schneiderman’s action left a much wider swath of private actors feeling as if they were being watched.



In the ongoing battles over the new “sharing economy” institutions of Uber, Lyft, and AirBnB, the views of many progressives coincide neatly with the interests of well‐​organized players in the New York economy. Though these services are enormously popular with young and urban consumers, they are anathema to the serious Left (Salon: “Why Uber Must Be Stopped”) while imperiling the interests of taxi‐​medallion owners, hotel operators (and their unions), and, in some cases, city bus drivers. (While millions of Americans bridle at the notion of government telling them what they can do with their homes or cars, New Yorkers—between rent regulation and alternate‐​side‐​of‐​the‐​street parking—are used to it.)



Matthew Feeney of Cato, a specialist in sharing‐​economy issues, notes that urban policymakers face a choice when these services arrive in their cities: they can insist that they conform to every existing regulation that governs their competitors, from inspections to commercial licenses; or they can devise new regulations (or reform old ones) so as to bring the services largely aboveground, with greater likelihood of imposing on them taxes, supervision, and methods of consumer recourse. Schneiderman, he says, “is quite safely in the camp” of the regulatory hawks. In one celebrated episode, he subpoenaed the private identity and personal information of tens of thousands of New Yorkers who had put their units on AirBnB, though the ensuing furor over privacy led to a “clarification” that the attorney general’s goal—for the moment, at least—was only to root out renters of multiple units and those who had gone into renting units as an occupation.



 **“Arbitrary and Capricious”**



When New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman filed charges of unlawful redlining against two banks in the Rochester and Buffalo areas—they had concentrated their lending in the suburbs—he drew an unusual rebuke from Frank H. Hamlin III, CEO of another small upstate bank, Canandaigua National Bank and Trust, which had not been charged. In a letter to shareholders, Hamlin reassured them that his own bank’s relations with its regulators “are healthy. I am, however, extremely suspicious of the arbitrary and capricious manner in which various agencies (prosecutors) are abusing the legal system in order to further their own political and economic interests.” And he noted a foundational problem: “The regulations are vague in explaining what conduct is actually prohibited.” That gives enforcers plenty of discretion as to when to file complaints and against whom.



Hamlin went on to explain that one of the two banks that Schneiderman targeted “has chosen to merely fold while the other has chosen to fight. I can understand the decision to fold. The potential sanctions are severe on both corporate and personal fronts. One must decide whether to put the livelihood of their employees and potentially their own personal liberty on the line or merely cry ‘uncle’ and give the ‘people’ its pound of flesh and go on with life.



“Those who choose to fight are forced to depend upon a legal system that has mutated its focus from time‐​honored legal principle and justice to efficiency and political expediency,” he wrote. “I can assure you, there is no such thing as ‘efficient justice.’ ”



Finally, Hamlin warned against assuming that any decision to fold was an indicator of ultimate guilt. “The reason that 98 percent of prosecutions are settled instead of taken to trial is not the result of defendants saying, ‘Aw shucks, you caught me.’ It has to do with a fundamental and reasonable lack of faith that our legal system is working properly.”



When the letter began to attract press notice, the bank declined further comment, saying that the letter spoke for itself. Speaking out is all well and good, but in New York, it’s important not to rile up the authorities by doing so too loudly.



The hard‐​charging attorney general has sometimes had to back off when his overzealousness runs into inconvenient facts. “Herbal Supplements Filled with Fake Ingredients, Investigators Find,” shrieked a CBS headline this past February, heralding what was supposed to be one of Schneiderman’s biggest enforcement actions—but soon turned into one of his most embarrassing.



The initial news coverage was breathless. “Many pills and capsules sold as herbal ‘supplements’ contain little more than powdered rice and house plants, according to a report released Monday by the office of New York state attorney general Eric Schneiderman,” ran _The Atlantic_ ’s report. “An investigation found that nearly four of five herbal supplements do not contain the ingredients listed on labels, and many supplements—tested from among leading store‐​brand products sold at GNC, Target, Walmart, and Walgreens—contain no plant substance of any kind at all.”



The dietary‐​supplements business has historically benefited from a congressionally prescribed regime of light federal regulation, and it had already come under suspicion. Extracts of such plants as Saint-John’s-wort, ginseng, and echinacea were often marketed with doubtful and unproved health claims that minimized the risks of overdose and side effects. Reports had also come in about sloppy manufacturing and mislabeling: a study last year of supplements sold as ginkgo biloba, for example, found that a disturbingly high 16 percent did not appear to contain any of the advertised plant.



But Schneiderman’s February announcement appeared to prove that the problems were worse than anyone had dreamed. His office had commissioned its own private tests of popular supplements from some of the nation’s biggest retailers, and the results were startling: 79 percent had no trace of DNA from the labeled plants. There seemed no other explanation but that the business was dominated by outright fraud. The AG backed up his charges by sending cease‐​and‐​desist letters to retailers, and private class‐​action suits followed within days.



But the fraud turned out to be of a rather different sort. Almost at once, experts in relevant biochemical fields—including some longtime vocal critics of the herbal‐​supplement industry—began to speak out: Schneiderman’s office had gotten nonsensical results by using an inappropriate test, one that neither the industry nor its regulators use to assay final purity. DNA barcode testing, which searches for a particular snippet of DNA distinctive to a plant, may be fine when checking the authenticity of a sample of unprocessed raw plant material. But dietary supplements are made by extracting the so‐​called active ingredient, which often means prolonged heating, use of solvents, and filtering that removes or breaks down the DNA. The better the purification methods used to isolate the active ingredient, in fact, the likelier that the original plant’s identifiable DNA will be lost. Harvard Medical School’s Pieter Cohen, a leading critic of supplement marketing, told _Forbes_ that it was “no surprise” that Schneiderman’s tests came out negative: “Even if DNA got in, we’d expect it to be destroyed or denatured.” Meanwhile, GNC, the biggest player in supplements retailing, went back and retested the accused products from its line and found, Schneiderman notwithstanding, that all contained the labeled active ingredient.



As the chorus of scientific criticism grew, Schneiderman’s office responded with bluster, telling one news outlet: “We are confident in our testing procedures. The burden is on the industry to prove that what is on the labels is in the bottles.” Remarkably, however, it declined to disclose the methods that its testing consultant had used.



When the attorney general of a state like New York sues a national company, he virtually always manages to compel a settlement of some sort: the cost in publicity and the legal risk of mounting a long‐​term legal fight are just too high. But Schneiderman’s settlement with industry leader GNC was not only quick—it came less than two months after he filed the charges—but also turned out, in its fine print, to belie Schneiderman’s inevitable claims of a big consumer victory. Bill Hammond of the _Daily News_ sums it up:



The company admitted no wrongdoing, paid no fine and was allowed to go back to selling exactly the same products manufactured in exactly the same way.



The AG who weeks earlier had strongly implied that most of GNC’s products were fake was now affirming that he found “no evidence” that the company deviated from federal regulations.



GNC did agree to conduct DNA testing going forward—but _on its raw materials, not the finished products_ [emphasis added]. It also agreed to post signs explaining the difference between plants and processed extracts, in case consumers were confused about that.



The whole affair inflicted millions of dollars in economic damage on companies that had done nothing wrong, while sending consumers around the country into needless spasms of anger, worry, and outrage. As Hammond writes: “It turns out the one peddling snake oil was Schneiderman himself.”



 **Enforcer‐​in‐​Chief**



Within recent memory, the office of the New York attorney general has branded defendants as lawbreakers over past actions that were plainly lawful at the time; imposed penalties under New York law on activities taking place in other states, even though neither the other states’ law, nor federal law, would have imposed penalties; extracted from defendants huge settlements related vaguely, if at all, to any underlying damages or applicable fines; and sluiced the resulting cash to politically favored New York beneficiaries, bypassing the state legislature, despite its constitutional role as overseer of public spending. These practices are controversial, but none was invented by Eric Schneiderman or, for that matter, by his New York predecessors Andrew Cuomo or Eliot Spitzer. All were first pioneered by attorneys general in other states.



State attorneys general really took off as players on the national scene in the 1970s and 1980s, a period in which the number of staff attorneys in AG offices quadrupled, according to figures in Paul Nolette’s new book, _Federalism on Trial_. Once the National Association of Attorneys General, or NAAG, began to take a more active role in helping beef up and coordinate formerly scattered efforts, multistate AG litigation, in which many state offices band together to file suit, began to grow, from fewer than five cases a year three decades ago to 40 to 50 cases a year more recently.



Is this a spontaneous upsurge reflecting the decentralized genius of our system? Not quite: as Nolette explains, Congress was, in fact, busy over this period funneling federal grants to state AG offices to build up their strike‐​force capacity against business defendants, while revamping laws to give them more enforcement power. The executive branch helped, too: “[F]ederal agencies have aggressively promoted [state AG] litigation working groups,” Nolette writes.



The 1990s tobacco campaign, culminating in a $246 billion multistate settlement in 1998, changed everything. For one thing, as I note in my book _The Rule of Lawyers_ , it sent far more money than anyone had imagined through AGs’ offices, resulting in logrolling, cozy fee‐​sharing deals, and outright corruption. It also encouraged the fateful idea that AGs can and should bypass the national legislature by, in effect, making new law on issues of public interest for which progressives lacked the votes in the U.S. Congress. Thus, as Nolette demonstrates, Spitzer led a successful challenge to outlaw pharmaceutical pricing practices that were well known to federal regulators—and that Congress had declined to disturb—by going to court seeking to have them redefined as “fraud.” He also tried to use AG power to achieve nationwide gun control through litigation, though that effort failed.



When Schneiderman and Cuomo fought their 2014 tug‐​of‐​war over whether banking‐​settlement money should go toward the attorney general’s announced priorities or be shifted to the state’s general fund, they were reenacting a script played out many times in other states. It’s common for AGs’ offices to keep at least enough money from settlements to cover their own investigation; state laws vary widely, however, on whether they have to turn over surplus money to a general fund. When they don’t do so, the AG office can quickly become a power center, handing out (in effect) appropriations that bypass the state legislature’s scrutiny. In states like Arkansas, Massachusetts, and West Virginia, AG offices have channeled settlement funds to health nonprofits, police and fire charities, and agencies of their own choosing within state, county, and local government. Other favored beneficiaries include legal‐​aid programs, bar associations, and law schools—the legal profession being, of course, a key political constituency of any AG’s office. With control over big money flows, smart AGs can populate a political landscape with grateful allies. California AG Bill Lockyer was famous for doing this; he even once steered $200,000 to a stridently combative Sacramento pressure group whose activities included an “Arnold Watch,” which kept tabs on Lockyer adversary Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.



Forty‐​three of the 50 states’ attorneys general are elected on ballot lines separate from their governors; the job has become legendary as a power base and springboard to higher office. With little or no involvement in the nitty‐​gritty of violent crime prosecution but near‐​total discretion over the filing of civil cases, most AGs are free to focus on popular actions that will reap uncritical publicity. Targets may murmur privately about grandstanding demagogues, but they usually want to settle fast and quietly—especially if they’re respected companies with a public image to protect. Political rivals hold their tongues, too, while campaign contributions roll in: hardly anyone wants to get on the wrong side of his state’s chief law enforcement officer. Small wonder that Bill Clinton, a former state AG himself, called it the best job he’d held in politics—and that was after he’d been elected president.



At the center of the Schneiderman record are the various settlements made between banking and financial institutions and state attorneys general. One of the AG’s biggest publicity hits came early in his tenure, when he derailed an all‐​but‐​finished deal between the other 49 attorneys general and large mortgage servicers over “robo‐​signing” and related practices, saying that it wasn’t punitive enough toward the companies and should be renegotiated. After winning concessions in that battle, he pulled a sequel by barging into a nearly completed settlement between investors’ lawyers and Bank of New York Mellon, bringing new allegations against the bank. (New York State wasn’t even a party to that case; Schneiderman’s office said that it was representing the public interest under what is known as the doctrine of _parens patriae_ , or the state suing on behalf of its citizens.) Many of the lawyers who had negotiated the deals—including, in the robo‐​signing case, some of Schneiderman’s fellow state AGs—were furious with the late‐​arriving New Yorker for blowing up the product of months of negotiation. The lawyers felt that, while no settlement was perfect, battling for another year or two in court would delay the intended benefit to underwater homeowners.



But the body of opinion leftward of Senator Elizabeth Warren—what you might call the Occupy or Greek Left—was smitten. In these quarters, after all, certain articles of faith prevail: that criminal business misconduct, not foolishness or error or wrongly stimulative government policy, was the key driver of the financial bubble and subsequent crash of the 2000s; that the losses sustained by ordinary people were not primarily a function of a more general wealth destruction but were siphoned into the coffers of the superrich; and that these crimes had gone essentially unpunished, to the lasting shame of the Obama administration.



Yet the particular legal claims that these settlements address are, at best, distantly related to the Left’s narrative about the ultimate meaning of the bubble and crash. Yes, processors did improperly robo‐​sign paperwork that they were under obligation to review individually, much as you or I certify with a click that we “have read and agree with” contract boilerplate terms that we have no interest in reading, and much as elected officials auto‐​sign constituent mail that they consider to hold no surprises. A bank that was intent, for whatever reason, on writing a chancy loan—remember, the critique is that banks were misbehaving purposefully rather than by foolishness—would have done so whether or not it had waited until a human had eyeballed each page. Likewise, if one believes that the bubble immiserated America’s working classes, it’s not clear that the ideal fix is a set of securities suits insisting that returns to investors in securitized mortgages should have been higher, all culminating in remedies meant to funnel _more_ money to investors as a class.



But why carp? Even his critics find it hard to deny that Schneiderman’s willingness to make a nuisance of himself paid off handsomely over the short and medium term. New York and other states got more money from the deals—sometimes a lot more. President Obama, tired of the friction, changed tactics and began paying the New York AG flattering attention, appointing him to head an investigatory panel and featuring him prominently at a State of the Union appearance. Just as the real‐​estate owner with a blocking position in a site assemblage can insist on terms, so New York could play on its holdout status to extract a high ransom in settlements—at least until the act began to wear thin from repeated use. And Schneiderman’s aggressiveness is hardly confined to the banking settlements—he has eagerly pressed redlining charges (see “ ‘Arbitrary and Capricious,’ ”) and pursued an expansion of insider‐​trading laws to cover a broader swath of behavior.



Altogether, the banking cases yielded billions to New York’s coffers, some tens of millions of which Schneiderman directed to legal‐​services programs, housing counselors, and assorted “community‐​development” nonprofits. These include New York Communities for Change, which shares an office building with the Working Families Party and is closely intertwined in its campaigns. “Mr. Schneiderman and the bank negotiated the terms so that he would be given sole discretion over how to allocate the money,” the _New York Times_ reported of one nine‐​figure fund. That led to further fights: following a battle with Governor Cuomo, Schneiderman consented to turn over some of the windfall to the state’s general fund.



One legacy, however, was hard feelings with his fellow attorneys general—no small matter, since most big cases these days are multistate actions requiring cooperation and delicate trust among groups of AGs. In a 2013 _New York_ magazine profile, Chris Smith relates how, when Schneiderman found out that California attorney general Kamala Harris, an up‐​and‐​coming liberal, was unwilling to upset the mortgage deal, he dispatched his union‐​trained chief of staff to the Golden State to start up a ground game against her to motivate her to switch, even collaborating with Harris’s political rivals to do so. Such tactics are practically unheard of in the clubby world of AGs. Short‐​term, it worked; Harris got on board.



And long‐​term? One of the liberal lions of state attorney general enforcement, veteran Iowa AG Tom Miller, was scathing when he spoke to Ben Smith for his Politico profile of Schneiderman. “Can a bipartisan group of public officials form an agreement that furthers the public interest—but that’s not totally one‐​sided or the other and that has some elements of compromise in it? Or can something like this always or usually be destroyed by the left or the right?” And Miller was contemptuous of Schneiderman’s charge—repeated on the AG’s website even today—that the original deal would have given banks a get‐​out‐​of‐​jail‐​free card for a wide range of misconduct. It’s “not going to be a broad release,” Miller said. “He’s essentially made that up.”



 **Insider Trading 2.0**



Eliot Spitzer took pride in the idea that, as New York attorney general, he could impose rules he saw as fair on national securities markets—regardless of whether the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington or judges interpreting federal securities law went along. His successors have continued in this vein. Under the federal law of insider trading, for example, there’s usually nothing illegal about letting your clients trade ahead of other people on market‐​moving information that you yourself have generated. (That’s assuming that you haven’t obtained the information by, say, violating a trust of employment or a duty that you have as an actor in an exchange.) But Eric Schneiderman, in a series of enforcement actions he refers to as “Insider Trading 2.0,” has sought to enforce a much broader prohibition. Most notably, he forced Thomson Reuters to abandon its sponsorship of a University of Michigan consumer‐​sentiment survey, which had been predicated on getting for its own subscribers early access to the survey findings. (The survey had been sponsored in similar ways since the 1940s, with no complaint from regulators.)



It all has to do with Schneiderman’s idiosyncratic ideas about a level playing field, or, as he described it in a speech, ensuring that America remains “a little more equal than the rest of the world.” As Gordon Crovitz wrote in the _Wall Street Journal_ , the underlying principle here would have banned the original Paul Julius Reuter “from using carrier pigeons in the 1850s to get news to his subscribers in Europe faster than anyone else.”



Politically, it’s hard to argue with Schneiderman’s success. Bill de Blasio is just starting to explore a place on the national stage, but the New York attorney general is already there, with a high‐​profile job not limited to a city constituency. “An increasingly beloved figure among progressives,” as Sam Stein called him in 2012, Schneiderman has managed to weather his famously testy relationship with Cuomo. When Zephyr Teachout mounted a lively challenge to Cuomo in the Democratic primary, it was Schneiderman (with de Blasio) who went before a Working Families Party assembly to urge activists to stand by the governor.



What’s more, in Schneiderman’s current job, the political advantages of incumbency are usually decisive: sitting AGs rarely lose their bids for reelection (New York’s Dennis Vacco was a rare exception in 1998). Last year, no AG incumbents lost their general election bids, and only one, a Republican in Arizona, lost in a primary. While Republicans in recent years have made considerable inroads into the once‐​Democratic‐​denominated AG ranks, they’ve done so almost entirely by capturing open seats. That spells years of likely incumbency ahead, should he want it, for Eric Schneiderman—and for his potential targets, years of unease about becoming his next target.



 **Grudge Match**



Like his predecessors, Eric Schneiderman has doggedly pursued what is now a decade‐​long dispute over charges filed by Eliot Spitzer against Maurice (Hank) Greenberg, former chairman and CEO of insurance giant American International Group. Greenberg is a legend in American business and New York philanthropy (as well as a trustee of the Manhattan Institute, which publishes _City Journal_ ).



In 2005, Spitzer charged Greenberg and others with fraud over a reinsurance transaction between AIG and Berkshire Hathaway’s General Re that allegedly was set up to confer no real risk, thus evading accounting rules. Spitzer used the splashy charges to pressure the AIG board into removing Greenberg as chairman and CEO. In the years since, all the criminal charges and most of the civil ones against Greenberg have been thrown out or dropped, as has the monetary relief sought—leaving only two remaining civil charges, which may reach trial this summer.



The dispute has long since been overshadowed by the federal government’s 2008 bailout of AIG, though the company’s assets were sound and soon found to exceed its liabilities. American taxpayers came out of the AIG rescue with a profit of $22 billion. “Whether A.I.G. would have come close to collapse in 2008 had Mr. Greenberg been allowed to stay remains an open question,” the _New York Times_ ’s James Stewart wrote this spring.



Schneiderman’s remaining civil charges against Greenberg rest heavily on the testimony of a former General Re executive whose credibility a federal appeals court panel has questioned. Attorney David Boies, representing Greenberg, gained access in February to formerly sealed investigators’ notes that his firm says cast further doubt on the executive’s testimony; the _Wall Street Journal_ editorialized that the revelations were “reason enough to throw out the entire case,” a position echoing that of former governor George Pataki and the late former governor Mario Cuomo, who wrote in a joint 2013 op‐​ed that the case against Greenberg concerned “entirely proper transactions … neither of which had any impact on the net income or shareholder equity of AIG.”



Though his office has given up its fight for criminal penalties and for damages, Schneiderman is still seeking to bar Greenberg, now 90, from working in the securities business or serving as director of a public company. Wrote Cuomo and Pataki in 2013: “Mr. Greenberg has never worked in the securities industry, and he hasn’t been an officer or director of a public company for eight [now ten] years.” Grudge match? You might call it that.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German DWD National Weather Service brings us the statistics for the month of May in Germany.
Overall, using the preliminary results from approximately 2000 weather stations, the DWD reports that May in the Central European country was 0.5°C cooler than the 1981-2010 mean and 0.4°C warmer than the 1961-1990 mean. The 1961-1990 reference period is used very little and has no meaning for the general citizenry because it was too long ago. But because the DWD has adopted the warmist agenda, it likes to use the ancient 1961-1990 mean in order to be able to declare warmer than normal months.
Statistical acrobatics aside, the May result shows that Central Europe’s overall trend to cooler and later springs continues unabated, thus defying predictions of warming.
The DWD also reports that precipitation was below normal and that the month saw some severe thunderstorms and destructive tornadoes. Overall the country saw a mixed bag of May weather, from night-time frosts at some locations to daytime high temperatures of over 30°C in other locations. The country also saw a bit below normal sunshine.
Though the DWD does its best to make this recent month appear as a month with unusual, weird weather, as a whole the month was nothing out of the normal range and was everything one would expect for a month of May in Central Europe.

This is a letter from John Rofe, a self-declared “Concerned Citizen” to Professor Gerrard, the NZ Prime Minister’s Science Advisor.   
  
As it is quite long we have ‘serialized’ it over a few days. 





The fools in power accept the calculations of ignorant (but well paid) computer modellers who eliminate the fact that fossil fuels are finite and, in the case of oil, long past the global peak of oil field discovery – with the world’s largest oil field (Saudi Ghawar) now in steep decline. They presume that despite the fact we have now picked the lowest hanging and best quality fruit, their calculations are based on never ending increases in fossil fuel production. So they project human CO2 emissions to trend upwards as if to infinity. The Chinese with their “Belt and Road” and Indians with their drive to raise living standards will temporarily escalate the rate of resource utilisation. Yet it will have no significant impact on the climate and just result in the human world running out sooner. 



They ignore the huge impact of clouds and the fact that water vapour is not just 20 times more by volume than CO2, and has 12 times more potent thermal effect as a “greenhouse gas” than CO2, its sudden change in phase introduces massive weather effects with the changes in state between gas and liquid and solid. Yet the doctrinaire UN IPCC reports suggest that changing levels of atmospheric CO2 drive everything else. 



A horticulturalist who checks the sky before he/she goes to bed at night to look for the extent of cloud cover is not looking to the heavens to see how much CO2 is there, but for whether cloudiness will eliminate the chance of frost to damage his/her plants and fruit crop. With cloud cover the infra-red heat radiation from earth’s surface/atmosphere is greatly reduced. The computer modellers don’t think about the fact that CH4 is only 1.8ppm of the atmosphere and has a minute warming capability at that. Nor do they understand that oxygen, the food of life for humanity, rapidly oxidises all CH4 emissions so they change into CO2 and H2O. CH4 is totally irrelevant to the climate debate and the climate debate is irrelevant to human planning. 



We must simply learn to cope with the climate we are given. In practical terms, the growing of grapes in Central Otago will eventually become impossible during a Grand Solar Minimum, just as the growing of grapes in the UK disappeared altogether when the Maunder Minimum arrived. Dealing with these effects is the proper business of governments, certainly not doing King Canute impersonations. 



It doesn’t matter how many billions are paid to universities and computer modellers, the fraud on farmers is ridiculous, unnecessary and egregious. 



And yet your support and that of the venal computer modelling industry is essential for Jacinda and James to perpetrate their deliberate if ideologically appealing fraud. We should join President Trump and withdraw from the Paris Accords. 



Please inform yourself and then isolate yourself from the fraudsters and their criminality before it is too late. You must consider your options wisely because at this point in time you are a part of the fraud, having attempted to justify it in writing to Mr Morgan. On the other hand, I believe you should check the fates of people like Dr Nils Axel Moerner (sea levels), Dr Judith Curry, Dr Peter Ridd (Gt Barrier Reef), Dr Susan Crockford (polar bear numbers). All have been destroyed by the fraudsters despite being right in point of fact. It doesn’t always pay to stand against frauds – particular in this case, one which is worth about USD1-1.5 trillion per year. The globalist billionaires have a lot riding on their support for the fraud. They control the news media. 



And remember this. Fraud is not a popularity contest, it is about facts. It can be proven that CO2 has not demonstrably affected climate change and cannot do so. That truth is the basis of this government’s credibility gone for good. 



Yours sincerely  
John Rofe

Share this...FacebookTwitterTanzania’s sea level over the past 4500 years likely succeeded today’s level. Sea level at the Seychelles stable over the past 10 years
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
Global sea level is rising and rising  – and that has been so for the last 15,000 years. However there are indications that the rise was not continuous and that there have been phases where sea level was stable, and perhaps even dropped. That may have happened during the natural cold phases, which occurred about every 1000 years.
Using geological methods it is possible to reconstruct the sea level history. A group of scientists led by Sarah Woodroffe of the University of Durham in North England took a close look at the sea level in Tanzania and the Seychelles far off the east coast of Africa. In a first study that appeared in the May 2015 issue of The Holocene journal, Woodroffe and her colleagues reconstructed the fluctuations at the coast of Tanzania over the past 10,000 years. At first the sea level rose rapidly and reached a level 7900 years ago that is 3.5 meters below today’s level. 900 years later the sea level reached today’s level. After that sea level rise slowed down. It cannot be excluded that sea level afterwards did not exceed today’s current level. In the last 4400 years sea level dropped and then remained constant.
The following is the abstract of the paper:
“Radiocarbon dating of mangrove sediments to constrain Holocene relative sea-level change on Zanzibar in the southwest Indian Ocean
Mangrove sedimentary deposits are sensitive to changes in sea level and can be used to reconstruct mid- to late Holocene sea-level fluctuations in intermediate and far-field locations, distant to the former polar ice sheets. However, they can be difficult to date using 14C because mangrove sediment can contain mixtures of carbon of different ages. The two main potential causes of error are younger mangrove roots penetrating down through the sediment column and bioturbation by burrowing animals which moves carbon up and down the sediment column. Both processes may introduce carbon not representative of the age of deposition of the layer being dated. This study reports new 14C dates on organic concentrates (10–63 µm) from mangrove sediments from Makoba Bay on Zanzibar (Unguja) where previous bulk sediment 14C age–depth profiles contained inversions and were therefore less useful for relative sea-level (RSL) reconstruction. Dates on organic concentrates provide a more coherent sequence of 14C ages compared with those from bulk sediments. These new data provide an improved environmental history and mid- to late Holocene RSL record for this site. Our reconstructions show that RSL rose during the mid-Holocene and reached within −3.5 m of present by c. 7900 cal. yr BP. RSL slowed as it reached present at or shortly after c. 7000 cal. yr BP, with falling and/or stable RSL from c. 4400 cal. yr BP to present. We are not able to determine whether there was a RSL highstand above present on Zanzibar during the mid- to late Holocene. The RSL reconstruction agrees broadly with changes predicted by the ICE-5G geophysical model, which includes 4 m of ice equivalent sea-level rise between 7000 and 4000 cal. yr BP. Our new dating approach has the potential to provide improved chronologies with which to interpret sea level data from this and other mangrove environments.”
What a surprise: Over the last 4500 years sea level along Tanzania has fallen or remained stable. And what do the coastal tide gauges of the country say? Luckily there’s a gauge at Sansibar which has been delivering data since 1984 (Figure 1). No real long-term trend can be discerned for the past 30 years. Interestingly a cycle can be suspected, with a decline until 2000 and then followed by a rise. Today’s sea level was reached on multiple occasions over the last 30 years.

In a comparison study, Sarah Woodroffe’s team also examined the Seychelles, which are located at a distance far from the Tanzanian coast. At this remote location in the middle of the ocean tectonic lifting and sinking effects can be practically excluded. Also here the scientists found a very stable sea level for the past 2000 years. Within the framework of the reconstruction accuracy, it could be determined that during this period the sea level was never 2 meters below today’s level. However a sea level of a few decimeters over today’s level could not be excluded.
The paper appeared also in May 2015 in the Quaternary Science Reviews. The abstract reads as follows:
“New constraints on late Holocene eustatic sea-level changes from Mahé, Seychelles
This study provides new estimates of globally integrated ice sheet melt during the late Holocene (since 4 ka BP) from Seychelles in the western Indian Ocean, a tectonically stable, far field location where the necessary Glacial-Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) correction is small and is relatively insensitive to predictions using different Earth viscosity profiles. We compare sea level data from Seychelles to estimates of eustasy from two GIA models, ICE-5G and EUST3, which represent end-members in the quantity of global melt during the late Holocene. We use data from a range of coastal environments including fringing reef, present day beaches, fossil plateau and mangrove deposits on the largest island of the Seychelles archipelago, Mahé to reconstruct relative sea-level changes. Our data suggest that extensive coastal deposits of carbonate-rich sands that fringe the west coast formed in the last 2 ka and the horizontal nature of their surface topography suggests RSL stability during this period. Mangrove sediments preserved behind these deposits and in river mouths date to c. 2 ka and indicate that RSL was between −2 m and present during this interval. Correcting the reconstructed sea level data using a suite of optimal GIA models based on the two ice models mentioned above and a large number (c. 350) of Earth viscosity models gives a result that is consistent with the sedimentological constraints. When uncertainties in both model results and data are considered, it is possible to rule out eustatic sea levels below c. 2 m and more than a few decimetres above present during the past two millennia. This uncertainty is dominated by error in the reconstructions rather than the model predictions. We note, however, that our estimates of eustasy are more compatible with the EUST3 model compared to the ICE-5G model during the late Holocene (2–1 ka BP). Our evidence from Seychelles shows that the timing of when eustatic sea level first rose close to present is between the predictions of the two end-member GIA models presented here (4 ka BP for ICE-5G and 1 ka BP for EUST3). Using all lines of evidence currently available from Mahé we suggest that the eustatic contribution during the last 2 ka has been less than 2 m. This conclusion is drawn from a tectonically stable, far-field region that is relatively insensitive to earth and ice model uncertainties, and implies that global eustasy has been relatively insensitive to climate fluctuations over the pre-industrial part of the last 2 ka.”
Here as well we examine the coastal tide gauges. The Point La Rue station, which apparently has been inactive since 2012, shows an interesting trend. Sea level has not risen at all since 2002 (Figure 2).

What do the satellite measurements tell us? Also here we see there has been no sea level rise over the past 10 years! (Figure 3).

"**Health misinformation on Facebook was viewed 3.8 billion times in the past year, peaking during the Covid-19 crisis, a report suggests.**
Activist group Avaaz, which conducted the research, said Facebook posed a ""major threat"" to public health.
Doctors added false claims about vaccines on the social network could limit the numbers prepared to have a Covid jab if one became available.
Facebook said the findings did ""not reflect the steps we've taken""
In a statement the firm said: ""We share Avaaz's goal of limiting misinformation. Thanks to our global network of fact-checkers, from April to June, we applied warning labels to 98 million pieces of Covid-19 misinformation and removed seven million pieces of content that could lead to imminent harm.
""We've directed over two billion people to resources from health authorities and when someone tries to share a link about Covid-19, we show them a pop-up to connect them with credible health information.""
Despite its efforts, Avaaz's report suggests only 16% of the health misinformation it identified on Facebook carried a warning label.
The top 10 websites identified by researchers as spreading health misinformation had almost four times as many views on Facebook as information from official sites, such as the World Health Organization, according to the report.
A significant amount of health misinformation was shared from public pages.
And 42 of those pages were followed by more than 28 million people.
The type of content highlighted includes:
The research looked at accounts from the US, UK, France, Germany and Italy.
Avaaz campaign director Fadi Quran said: ""Facebook's algorithm is a major threat to public health.
""Mark Zuckerberg promised to provide reliable information during the pandemic.
""But his algorithm is sabotaging those efforts by driving many of Facebook's 2.7 billion users to health-misinformation-spreading networks.
""This info-demic will make the pandemic worse unless Facebook detoxifies its algorithm and provides corrections to everyone exposed to these viral lies.""
Avaaz called on the social network to provide everyone who had viewed health misinformation on its platform with independently fact-checked corrections.
It also said it should downgrade misinformation posts in news feeds, in an attempt to lessen their reach.
Prof Frank Ulrich Montgomery, who chairs the World Medical Association, said: ""This pandemic should be a powerful reminder of how successful vaccines have been.
""But instead anti-vaxxers are using Facebook to spread toxic lies and conspiracy theories.""
European Union of Medical Specialists secretary general Dr Joao Miguel Grenho said: ""Mark Zuckerberg must take immediate action to stand with us to stop this info-demic.
""Otherwise the number of people poisoned against taking a vaccine will be too high for us to beat this pandemic.""
Facebook insists it is combating dangerous health myths.
And if you put the word ""vaccines"" in its search box, you do get pointed towards reliable information.
But it is also easy to find thousands of groups and individuals spreading misinformation with no apparent intervention from Facebook.
A case in point is a page called Kate Shemirani - who calls herself Natural Nurse in A Toxic World and stresses her qualifications.
In fact, Ms Shemirani's nursing registration was suspended by the Nursing and Midwifery Council in July, after complaints she was spreading false information about Covid-19 and about vaccines.
A glance at what she posts on Facebook and Twitter reveals relentless attacks on Bill Gates, the wearing of masks and NHS staff, whom she calls criminals and liars for perpetuating the ""hoax"" that is the coronavirus.
But much of her content is about vaccines - this week she claimed the polio vaccine caused polio and had harmed and killed thousands.
We forwarded this post to both Facebook and Twitter to ask if it broke their rules.
While Twitter would not give a public statement, it indicated its rules covered Covid-19 only, so did not affect this post.
Facebook said that while it doesn't prevent people from saying things that are factually incorrect, it has acted to make this and similar posts less prominent in people's news feeds."

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale –

The National Science Foundation press release Cause of California drought linked to climate change found its way into the mainstream media, with science reporters around the globe adding their hype. That press release is based on the recently published study Swain et al. (2014) “The Extraordinary California Drought of 2013/2014: Character, Context and the Role of Climate Change”, which can be found in the Special Supplement to the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS report)Vol. 95, No. 9, September 2014, Explaining Extreme Events of 2013 From A Climate Perspective.
I’ll publish a few comments about Swain et al. (2014) in a few days. But this post is not about that paper.
THE CALIFORNIA DROUGHT – WHO’S TO BLAME FOR THE LACK OF PREPAREDNESS?
As I was reading Anthony Watts excellent post about Swain et al. (2014), Claim: Cause of California drought linked to climate change – not one mention of ENSO or El Niño, a number of reoccurring thoughts replayed, thoughts that have struck me numerous times as the Western States drought unfolded last year and intensified this year.
Was California prepared for a drought? 
Obviously, California was not prepared for a drought this intense, and the impacts of that lack of preparedness on California residents will grow much worse if the drought continues.
Why wasn’t California prepared for a short-term (multiyear) drought this intense?
The realistic blame should be the focus of climate science in general under the direction of the IPCC. In the opening paragraph of the IPCC’s History webpage, they state (my boldface and caps):
Today the IPCC’s role is as defined in Principles Governing IPCC Work, “…to assess on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of HUMAN-INDUCED climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation.
The fact that the IPCC has focused all of their efforts on “understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change” is very important. The IPCC has never realistically tried to determine if natural factors could have caused most of the warming the Earth has experienced over the past century. For decades, they’ve worn blinders that blocked their views of everything other than the possible impacts of carbon dioxide. The role of the IPCC has always been to prepare reports that support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the burning of fossil fuels. As a result, that’s where all of the research money goes. The decision to only study human-induced global warming is a political choice, not a scientific one. In efforts to justify agendas, politicians around the world jumped on the climate change stump and funded computer model-based studies of human-induced global warming…to the tune of billions of dollars annually.
Because of that political agenda, the latest and greatest climate models still cannot simulate the basic underlying processes that govern the naturally occurring, coupled ocean-atmosphere processes like ENSO (El Niños and La Niñas), like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation…processes that have strong influences on temperature and precipitation in west coast states. So there is no possible way climate models, as they exist today, could forecast what precipitation might be like in the future there. And that basic problem will persist until there is a redirection of climate-research funding. Yes, funding. Research follows the money.
What value do climate model-based studies provide?
None.
The paper Pierce et al. (2013) The Key Role of Heavy Precipitation Events in Climate Model Disagreements of Future Annual Precipitation Changes in California provides an overview of why the climate models have no value when it comes to forecasts like California drought. In their abstract Pierce et al. write (my boldface and caps):
Of the 25 downscaled model projections examined here, 21 agree that precipitation frequency will DECREASE by the 2060s, with a mean reduction of 6–14 days yr−1. This reduces California’s mean annual precipitation by about 5.7%. Partly offsetting this, 16 of the 25 projections agree that daily precipitation intensity will INCREASE, which accounts for a model average 5.3% increase in annual precipitation. Between these conflicting tendencies, 12 projections show drier annual conditions by the 2060s and 13 show wetter.
[Hat tip to blogger “Jimbo” on the WUWT thread Claim: Cause of California drought linked to climate change – not one mention of ENSO or El Niño.]
So some climate models say that daily precipitation intensity will increase and others say it will decrease. In other words, the climate science community is clueless about what the future might bring for west coast precipitation.
Some might say that climatologists for the State of California and other west coast states have been hampered by climate science. It’s tough to make recommendations to state and local governments for long-term planning when the climate science community provides them with nothing to work with.
Is California prepared for a drought that lasts multiple decades or even centuries?
Anthony Watts’s post included a graph from a paleoclimatological study of West Coast drought that showed past droughts have lasted for hundreds of years. For the original graph and discussion, see Figure 10 of Cook et al. (2007) North American drought: Reconstructions, causes, and consequences. (Note: That’s not the John Cook from SkepticalScience.)
Now I hate to make you think about bad news. But if it’s happened in the past, can it happen again?
Why are mainstream media simply parroting press releases?
Climate-change news reports have become echo chambers of the press releases put out by colleges, universities and government research agencies. Individual reporters might provide a more in-depth report by asking the scientist-authors for a few extra word of wisdom.
But why aren’t the media asking the tough questions, like:

Why weren’t west-coast residents warned 10 or 15 years ago that a severe drought is just a weather anomaly away?
Why aren’t there enough desalinization plants in place to supplement rainfall deficits?
Why are the people of the west coast protesting for, and why are state governments funding, more wind farms and solar arrays when they need something more basic to maintain life there, water?

Seems to me we may very soon be seeing a reversal of Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath, with vast flocks of California residents migrating back to the Midwest, which also is subject to periodic droughts.
Poor planning on the parts of a few—based on politically motivated, unsound science—may make for emergencies for millions.

 **Macca**



A very ‘English’ gentleman called Williams yesterday morning to say how gutless National are. The context of the conversation was the latest TePapa climate change display which was heavily weighted against the farmers and was interactive where the scone grabbers could push a button to reduce cow herds and the sun would come out – or something similar. In a nutshell, it portrayed the biggest ogres of **[the religion of lies](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/climate-change-lies-exposed-jones-co-june-18-2019/)** (ha, I might be on to a new phrase there), as the farmers.



The point of the caller was that National continually bring this criticism from the left upon themselves by leaving them all in these positions of influence when they gain power. They are just too nice! Key was a prime example by thinking he could get on with all the unions and high placed public servants. All they did was stab him in the back and make National’s life a misery for the next 9 years. You have to give one [credit to Labour](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/the-number-one-difference-between-the-left-the-right/) and the left worldwide, **they go through all the departments with a hatchet** (probably soon to be a Glock), and anyone who doesn’t ‘think left’, is off like a pork chop in the hot sun!



Prior to this call, Williams had an interview with Bridges. When Peter queried the age of the new Palmerston North candidate, Bridges replied with [‘ **OK boomer’!**](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/blaming-the-baby-boomers/) Now I’m not sure whether it’s just me but boy, that comment **went down like a cup full of cold sick** and really got my hackles up to the point that had that been said to my face, said Simon may have been sporting a fat lip! 



Boomers helped build this bloody nation when the brave men like my father came back from WW2 – and earlier and even later calls to arms! For Bridges to come out in defence of the little snot-nosed snowflakes who think they know everything but are incapable of getting out of bed to do a days work whilst insulting National’s core voter base…I think I’ve made my point! 



There were a good many callers saying how **National were trying to out green the Greens** and would be voting with their feet. Once again, when God was handing out brains, National thought he said trains and are still waiting at the station!

Here we go again. History repeats itself with classified-ad website Backpage.com’s announcement yesterday that it's shuttering its “adult” section after years of unrelenting pressure from public officials at all levels of government.   
  
Most recently, the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) hauled several Backpage.com officials before it for a public shaming without bothering to wait for a ruling on the legality of its “investigation.” In California, just before Christmas then-attorney general (now U.S. Senator) Kamala Harris refiled criminal charges against Backpage’s CEO and its former owners in the face of a December 9 ruling throwing her initial charges out.   
  
These tactics represent a marked escalation since September 2010, when Craigslist caved in to pressure from a group of 17 state attorneys general and shut down its “adult advertisements” section. As a federal court had already ruled at that time—and numerous courts have held since—the government cannot assume that ads that mention sex are advertising illegal transactions, much less coercive sex-trafficking. Laws censoring such websites have been roundly and repeatedly held to violate the First Amendment.   
  
But the law is one thing, and less-direct pressure tactics are quite another. It's harder to hold government accountable when it tries to hide what it's up to with public letters, demands, and investigations, even if meritless.



For years, Backpage has been the target (after Craigslist) of the same state AGs, members of Congress, and even local officials like Chicago’s vigilante-with-a-badge, Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart. Backpage has fought these First Amendment battles and won almost all of them. Cato filed an amicus brief (along with DKT Liberty Project and the Reason Foundation) in its case against Sheriff Dart, who was running his own personal Operation Chokepoint to force the credit-card companies to sever ties with Backpage.   
  
Dart claimed he had written to the card companies only as “a father and a caring citizen,” but Seventh Circuit Judge Richard Posner saw through the ruse. He enjoined Dart’s campaign as a government organized boycott and a prior restraint. If not checked, Judge Posner wrote, such pressure tactics constitute “a formula for permitting unauthorized, unregulated, foolproof, lawless government coercion.”   
  
And that's what's happening with the PSI investigation, which was styled as an inquiry into human trafficking, but has resulted in onerous subpoenas targeting Backpage’s editorial practices. Congress has broad investigatory authority that can be misused, as it was by Senator Joseph McCarthy when he chaired PSI. Honest investigations are perfectly salutary, but congressional subpoena power is particularly circumscribed when the First Amendment rights of the subpoena recipient are at issue, as they are here.   
  
That's why Cato again teamed up with DKT and Reason Foundation on an amicus brief in the D.C. Circuit, opposing PSI’s subpoena of Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer. Our brief showed that the PSI was improperly engaging in an effort to punish Ferrer and Backpage for running a website that publishes third-party content that the subcommittee finds offensive.   
  
Although the subcommittee has repeatedly denied any ties to Dart, a trail of emails between PSI staff and the sheriff's office suggests otherwise. Before the PSI served its first subpoena on Backpage, subcommittee counsel corresponded with Dart’s staff, praising the sheriff and assuring him that their investigation was “rapidly progressing down a parallel track.” When PSI issued its initial document subpoena, with five sets of demands that were _identical_ __ to those served by Sheriff Dart.   
  
The punitive rather than legislative nature of PSI’s investigation is further evidenced by the statements made by subcommittee members and other senators after Ferrer’s recent arrest on charges that also collide with Ferrer’s constitutional rights (and which were thrown out by a California court). Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO), the PSI's chairman and ranking member, issued a joint statement in which they heralded the subcommittee’s specific role in bringing about the arrest. Senator Mark Kirk was even more explicit, saying, “This arrest means we are one step closer to holding Backpage accountable for underage internet sex trafficking through their site and stopping these illegal activities."" It could hardly be more evident that the subpoena was issued pursuant to the punitive aim of “holding Backpage accountable,” rather than a desire to study the issue of human trafficking or any other specific _legislative_ need.   
  
PSI’s subpoena to Carl Ferrer plainly fails the standards set forth for a valid exercise of the congressional subpoena power. The subcommittee did not identify a specific legislative need for the information; it did not show a compelling interest in obtaining the information nor a strong nexus between the information sought and the interest asserted; and it wielded the subpoena as a tool for punishing Ferrer for his operation of Backpage because it disfavored the content of the speech on Backpage. PSI’s overreach is emblematic of a disturbing pattern by legislative committees and state attorneys general of brandishing their subpoena power as a weapon to attack individuals and entities that engage in disfavored speech or conduct.   
  
For example, the New York and Massachusetts attorneys general recently issued a civil investigative demand requiring ExxonMobil to produce all of its climate-change research analysis, its internal communications regarding climate change, and its communications with a dozen conservative and libertarian non-profits. Piggybacking on that investigation, the Virgin Islands attorney general issued a subpoena to the Competitive Enterprise Institute demanding that CEI turn over its research, communications, emails, statements, and drafts (over nearly a decade) regarding climate change and energy policy. Only after CEI moved for sanctions under the D.C. Anti-SLAPP Act did the attorney general withdraw the subpoena.   
  
Given such awesome investigative power, it's easy to see how the targets of investigations can be brought to heel by a government that disregards constitutional limits. It is sad, but understandable, that Backpage, like Craigslist before it, chose to shutter its entire “adult” section.

Europe cannot afford to have its foreign and domestic policies dictated by Putin’s blackmail 
Guest essay by Paul Driessen 
European Union nations want to impose tougher economic sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine and providing the missiles that shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17. However, they are worried about biting the hand that feeds them – with the natural gas that fuels much of its economy.
Russia is the world’s second-biggest natural gas producer and third-biggest oil producer, so it can inflict tremendous pressure and damage on its neighbors without firing a shot. The 28 EU nations as a whole depend on Russia for one-third of their oil and gas. However, Estonia, Finland, Latvia and Lithuania get 100% of their natural gas from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Six other European countries get more than half of their gas from the powerful Russian Bear: Czech Republic (57%), Poland (59%), Ukraine (60%), Hungary (80%), Slovakia (84%) and Bulgaria (89%).
That makes the Europeans highly vulnerable to cuts in the fuel supplies they need to power their cars, keep their businesses, factories and economies running smoothly – and heat homes, to literally keep people alive during brutal winters like those they’ve experienced recently. A simple “nyet” from Mr. Putin could reduce or cut off energy exports, leaving the continent hostage to Russia and creating a potential disaster. European officials know this but so far are frozen by their own fears and policies.
Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) calls Russia “a gas station masquerading as a country,” because 60% of its exports are oil and natural gas. Cutting these exports to pressure Europe politically might hurt Russia’s economy. However, it has already done so, is currently squeezing Ukraine over winter gas supplies – supposedly over late payments for past deliveries – and is making export arrangements with China and other countries, to reduce any economic harm it might suffer from engaging in renewed energy blackmail.
Moreover, during one week this September, Russia supplied up to 45% less gas than Poland requested, the Poles’ largest oil and gas company reported. Over the past decade, “Russia has halted the flow of gas through Ukraine three times, directly affecting eastern and southern European countries most reliant on Gazprom, the giant Russian energy monopoly,” the Christian Science Monitor has observed.
Indeed, 16% of Russian natural gas exports flow through Ukraine. In yet another pressure tactic, Russia began tightening the export spigot in June. Russian gas supplies through Ukraine to Slovakia have been cut by 25%, says Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuriy Prodan.
There’s no question that the EU and USA must punish Russia for seizing Crimea, infiltrating troops and military equipment into eastern Ukraine to support secessionists, aiding terrorism, and killing hundreds of innocent jetliner passengers. Since no one wants a shooting war with Russia, economic sanctions are all that’s left. Failure to do even that would give Putin a green light to move more forcefully against Ukraine – or even try to occupy other former Soviet Union nations.
Putin has called the breakup of the Soviet Union “the greatest tragedy of the 20th century.” Before invading Ukraine, Russia invaded the former Soviet territory of Georgia in 2008 to support separatists who had declared independence for the Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It’s not at all hard to imagine Putin moving against Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, other former Soviet possessions or even Finland, to bring them into Mother Russia’s suffocating embrace. But how can the EU end the blackmail, enjoy some foreign policy independence and improve its faltering economy with less reliance on Russia?
If European countries faced food shortages due to import restrictions, they would offer their farmers incentives to grow more. EU members need to act the same way on the energy front. Otherwise, they give Russia tremendous sway over their future. European nations certainly have the ability to take action.
For one thing, they could import more natural gas from the United States and other countries besides Russia, until it can produce more domestic energy. Europe is blessed with enormous quantities of oil and natural gas – including enough gas to supply all its needs for at least 28 years, during which it could develop viable alternatives to gas and the dozens of coal-fired generators it is now building. US Energy Information Administration data reveal that Sweden has enough gas to meet its needs for 250 years. Denmark, Poland, Bulgaria, France and Spain also have extensive potential, as do Great Britain and other countries. Unfortunately, those deposits aren’t economically recoverable using traditional drilling.
However, they can be captured using hydraulic fracturing (fracking) – which has been used safely and with great economic and employment benefit more than a million times in the United States since 1947. It has made the United States the world’s largest natural gas producer.
Not surprisingly, environmental extremists strenuously oppose fracking – further crippling Europe’s ability to meet its energy needs and chart its economic destiny and foreign policy. Also not surprising, Russia is secretly funding the European anti-fracking movement “to maintain European dependence on imported Russian gas,” NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently revealed.
But if there’s a silver lining to unfolding Middle East events and Russia’s naked aggression, it’s that more sensible Europeans are finally looking more critically at their self-destructive energy and environmental policies. The European Union announced in September that it will combine previously separate energy and climate ministries into one office. The decision infuriates radical greens, but it reflects growing business, worker, consumer and family concerns about reliable, affordable electricity and motor fuels.
Next, Europe needs to allow fracking. Right now, virtually every EU nation except Poland and Britain bans fracking. Besides making Europe more energy independent, fracking would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by enabling European nations to rely more on natural gas and less on coal. Fracking would also reduce EU natural gas, electricity and even oil prices, as it has in the USA. It would also create or save millions of jobs that are endangered (or gone) because of Europe’s outrageously high energy costs. In fact, many EU companies and families pay three to eight times more than Americans do for electricity.
Another problem in Europe is that people living above the shale deposits have no ownership or economic interests in developing them. They are inconvenienced, but the state and drilling companies get all the money. The EU needs to devise incentives that give landowners and residents a positive stake in development – such as a royalty or percentage of every Euro of oil and gas produced and sold.
On this side of the pond, US petroleum production must be further increased. The huge gains in American oil and gas output since 2009 were all on private and state lands, while the Obama administration has presided over a nearly 40% decline in production from onshore and offshore federal lands. The President and congressional Democrats need to stop being energy obstructionists, and let American companies tap these energy treasure troves. That would create jobs, generate billions in government revenues, make more gas available for European purchase, and strengthen our economy and balance of trade. Congress should also consider prohibiting state and local fracking bans as unconstitutional constraints on trade.
Congress and the President should also fast-track US natural gas exports to Europe, by speeding permits for liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. These actions would encourage further drilling, technology improvements and job creation. As Europeans adapt and improve America’s rapidly advancing fracking technologies and develop their own gas, these exports will be less vital. But they are essential now.
The world is not going find safe, efficient, affordable, environment-friendly alternatives to oil, natural gas and coal in the next decade or so. (Right now, Europe gets just 1.3% of its energy from wind and solar, but 75% from fossil fuels – and both wind and solar exact significant environmental costs.) In the meantime, we need to rely more on realistic opportunities and initiatives, and on our oil supplier friends in Canada and Mexico. If we don’t, we’ll have to continue importing from increasingly unstable and unfriendly parts of the world – and being constantly at their tender mercies, just like the Europeans.

"**This week, after seven years of building up thousands of Instagram followers, a small company on the south coast of England found its account had been hacked.**
The English Stamp Company tried to let Instagram know. But in a response that evening, the social media giant said the account had been permanently deleted.
""We're sorry for any inconvenience this causes,"" Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, said in the automated message.
""It's gutting, the fact that it's the last seven years of work, and it's disappointing that Instagram appears unwilling to help,"" says Bella Dorey, 27, one of three people in the firm who manage the account.
The company, which makes rubber stamps, was founded in 1992 by Bella's father and mother, Jon and Sasha, and has seven employees.
It had built up nearly 29,000 followers on its Instagram account, and was hoping to get to 30,000 by Christmas.
It uses Instagram as its main marketing tool, and was relying on the social media platform to boost Christmas sales, especially as coronavirus has put a stop to the usual exhibitions the company uses to showcase its wares.
""We are going to suffer a loss financially,"" says Bella. ""How do you put a value on more than 28,000 followers?""
On Tuesday the company got a message from Instagram saying there had been an unusual login to its account from a computer in Huddersfield.
The BBC verified with a computer security expert that this message was genuine.
Bella and a colleague immediately tried to get in contact with Instagram but just four minutes later, they got an email from the hackers, who called themselves ""Carlo Minhift"".
""Good Day! We apologize for the inconvenience. Your account has been temporarily blocked,"" the email said.
The hackers said they would wait two hours, then start ""clearing"" the account by deleting photos if Bella and her colleagues did not respond.
The next day, the hackers revealed their intention had been to extort money from the small firm. But they were too late, Instagram had already deleted the account.
""We didn't want to ruin your account, but you don't respond to us. We realized that you will not pay us. No, not really. We apologize for not being convenient, but we unfortunately start clearing the account after 30 minutes and sell it. See you later,"" the hackers said.
Attacks on Instagram users, while rarer than other forms of cyber attack, are becoming increasingly common as a growing number of influencers and companies market themselves on the platform, according to Professor Alan Woodward, a cyber security expert at the University of Surrey.
He said the decision of the English Stamp Company not to engage with the hackers was ""brave"" but he said it was the right one.
""You shouldn't pay the ransom,"" he said. ""There's no guarantee you'll get the account back, the money will be used to fund further crime, and you'll just paint a big target on your back as a 'payer'.""
Quite a lot of attacks of this nature rely on so-called phishing emails which try to trick users into revealing sensitive information, like usernames and passwords, by posing as a reputable website.
""Credential stuffing"" is another ploy used by hackers who use personal data, harvested elsewhere, to gain unauthorised access to accounts
The best way to deal with an Instagram attack is to try to pre-empt it by beefing up your security beforehand, Professor Woodward said. Make sure passwords are strong, and don't reuse them across sites, he added.
Instagram offers two-factor authentication by sending a code to your phone. People can check whether their usernames or passwords have been breached through a website called haveibeenpwned.com, which is run by Troy Hunt, a Microsoft security expert.
Facebook says Instagram is working with The English Stamp Company to try to recover their account as soon as possible. ""Businesses are an important part of our community and we take their safety and security seriously,"" the company said.
""We notify people if we see any unauthorised changes to an account and in the few instances hacking occurs, people can recover accounts through the app and website.""

"TAVEUNI ISLAND, Fiji  —   In Fiji, flowers can take on a spiritual, magical significance. They are strung together as garlands for ceremonies and festivals or worn as an ornament behind the ear on any given day. The South Pacific archipelago is home to about 800 species of plants found nowhere else in the world. But the most special is the tagimoucia, a crimson and white flower that hangs down in clusters like a chain of ruby raindrops. Because of its beauty and rarity, it has attained a kind of celebrity status. “Just to touch it and see it with my own eyes,” said Lina Sena, 41, her sentence trailing off as she held a clipping recently. “See how we are treating it? It is history. ” Except for scattered sightings on a neighboring island, the flower grows only on a single mountain ridge on Taveuni, one of the northern islands. The tagimoucia is the unofficial floral emblem of Fiji and has a prime position on the nation’s $50 bill. But to Fijians, its significance stems from several legends of romance and heartbreak. Seeing the flower “was on my bucket list,” said Ravi Kumar, 31, who grew up in Fiji but later moved to Australia. Mr. Kumar spent a recent day on Taveuni, traipsing through the forest before finally sighting the flower atop its woody vine. Taveuni, known as the Garden Island for its rich volcanic soil and farming, is crowned with dense, dark rain forest that is often shrouded in mist. Mr. Kumar said he made the trek because the flower’s legend was “one of the tales you grew up with” in Fiji. Those tales can vary depending on whom you ask. The song “Tagimaucia ga” by Percy Bucknell, a traditional composer, describes how an outsider seized power on Taveuni and made the flower a symbol of his chieftainship. Another tells of a young girl whose tears became tagimoucia flowers when her parents scolded her for not doing her housework. According to Emori Tokalau, a governmental liaison to Taveuni’s clan leaders, only the flower’s custodian can tell the true legend. That is Ratu Viliame Mudu, the chief of Somosomo village on the island’s western side. Mr. Tokalau described the custodianship “as a form of copyright,” giving the holder authority to grant permission for outsiders to visit the flower or use its likeness. He had to get the chief’s approval before using the tagimoucia on his office letterhead, he said. To receive permission, one must arrive at the village with a sevusevu  —   a gift or offering  —   often the traditional root drink kava. A small ceremony is performed, with men in sarongs and women in long skirts gathered around. On a visit to the village in November, the chief’s son, Akuila Cavuilati, spoke about the flower’s history. “When I was growing up, it was the legend that my   carried and gave to us,” he said. The tagimoucia already existed before the legend, but only as a simple white flower, Mr. Cavuilati said. That changed when a young princess fell in love with a man from another village, a union her parents vetoed. She ran away in despair. Village warriors searching for the princess could hear her crying in the forest (tagimoucia can be translated as “crying tears,” Mr. Cavuilati said). However, all they could see were tagimoucia flowers with a mysterious new addition: the ruby red petals. Those petals are the girl’s tears, Mr. Cavuilati said. As a boy, Mr. Cavuilati often climbed the mountain with his brothers to pick tagimoucia flowers, sometimes sending them into the capital, Suva, for display at festivals. “During that time there were so many flowers,” he said. “Nowadays, it is very hard to find. ” Until about 30 years ago, access to the flower came only by foot. But then a cellphone tower went up on the mountain’s peak, along with a service road. Now people can drive the   pass more easily. Mr. Cavuilati said rarely did anyone come to him to hear the legend or receive his blessing for their journey to the flower. The path up the mountain is a    hike that starts near Somosomo. Along the way, it was easy to see why the forested mountain was the tagimoucia’s natural protector before the access road was built. The trail is littered with felled trees and craters from giant root systems that were ripped out of the ground by cyclones. After several hours of hiking, the grandson of Somosomo’s chief, Viliame Mudu, spied a small cluster of flowers halfway up a tree. That was the sole sighting of ruby red petals by our group that day. The tagimoucia’s peak flowering season of November and December coincides with school’s end, so the flower is a “hot commodity” for graduation garlands, said   Lin, an anthropologist who completed his Ph. D. thesis on conservation in Taveuni. During that period, local hotels bring flowers down for their guests. One morning, Alfred Lewenilovo, 26, headed up the mountain carrying a sugar cane knife and an empty backpack. He said his sister in Suva requested tagimoucia flowers for her 21st birthday garland. The flower’s popularity worries some on Fiji. “People are going there to see it and put it around their necks, then they come down. After two days they throw it into the rubbish bins,” said Marika Tuiwawa, a botanist with the University of the South Pacific. The fragility of the flower’s existence has always been a concern because of the small areas, or microhabitats, where it grows. While the opinion that the flower is now overpicked is widely held, no research has been done to confirm that, said Dick Watling, from  . The conservation group had investigated the possibility of a Taveuni National Park that would provide more protection to the tagimoucia as well as the forest it inhabits. But its Taveuni office closed in 2014, from a lack of interest and funding. The area where the flower is found is currently a forest reserve, but it is often encroached upon by farmers, Mr. Watling said. “The real issue is that we have this enormous area of almost pristine forest, the last in Fiji,” he said. Unless the government realizes the value of that “it will become increasingly fragmented. ” For now, the tagimoucia continues to inspire Fijians. On a ferry that sails from Taveuni to Suva, I held a tagimoucia clipping given to me by the village chief of Tavuki. The flower turned heads. A young boy whispered “tagimoucia” as he walked past. A woman pointed and mouthed the flower’s name before breaking into a smile. And Ms. Sena indulged in a mini photo shoot. “Take another one  —   a good one,” she said as her daughter repositioned her camera to capture the flower, now perched behind Ms. Sena’s ear."

By Ed Caryl
In Natural Cycles In A Random World Are Unmistakable…Future Holds Nothing To Fear, we showed plots of simulated temperature generated in Excel using the sum of three cycles and a random number generator.
Some commenters realized that if you averaged many runs, like the professional climate “scientists” do, the result would be the underlying cycles. Some realized that doing the averaging step is unnecessary, as the underlying cycles are simply three columns in the Excel file. Here is that plot.

Figure 1 is the sum of the three natural cycles, the 62, 204, and 1040-year cycles. The green rectangle outlines the historical temperature record, from 1850 to 2015. The blue rectangles highlight cold periods, the red rectangles the warm periods. The numbers are the beginning and end years for each period. Yellow highlights the future. 
Note that in figure 1, the cycles in the green rectangle follow the known temperature record. See figure 2, below. The rest of the plot, before the known period, reflects what we know generally about the Medieval Warm  Period and the Little Ice Age. I leave it to the reader to interpret the future.

Figure 2 plots the natural cycles from figure 1 and the HADCRUT4 global anomaly index. The vertical offset is due to the HADCRUT4 baseline choice.

The three natural cycles are not, of course, as fixed in frequency or amplitude as in these Excel plots. As we go back in time, the climate that actually occurred will drift from these calculations. But we know that the Roman warm period occurred about a thousand years before the Medieval warm period, and that it happened with about a 200 year cycle imposed on it.
There are several papers that discuss 1470 ±500 year cycles. Those that occurred during the last ice age are labeled Dansgaard-Oeschger events. In the Holocene, they are called Bond events. The Bond events tend to happen at 1000 year intervals, thus the ±500 year error margin. Solar scientists refer to a thousand year plus Hallstaat Cycle that looks like the thousand-year cycle used here. Bond events and the Hallstaat Cycle appear to be the same thing.
During the last ice age there were also deeper periods of cold known as Heinrich events. These occur at approximately 10,000 year intervals. During the last ice age, these events tended not to be sine-wave in shape, but punctuated cold intervals. Bond events in the Holocene such as the 5.4 and 8.2 kilo-year events also appear as abrupt cooling followed by equally abrupt warming. Figure 3 is a plot of Bond events from Bond et al. data here. The last column “stacked” data was used for this plot. It is a combination of several proxies. The resolution is 70 years between points, so only the longer cycles are resolved. Both scales have been reversed to match figure 1.

Figure 3 is a plot of Bond events in the Holocene. The outlined area is the time covered by figure 1 up to the present. Down is cold, up is warm. The 70-year resolution captures only the longest of the warm and cold periods in the last one thousand years, the Medieval Warm Period, and the Wolf, Spörer and Maunder cold periods.

Figure 4 is a plot of carbon-14 production at the top of the atmosphere. This plot is also from Bond et al. from the same source as above. The cold and warm periods are highlighted as in figure 1.
The 200 year cycles appear solar-based. The resolution in figure 4 is 10 years. Cold periods happen when 14C production is declining, warm periods when it is increasing. As 14C is produced by cosmic rays at the top of the atmosphere, there is a delay before it appears as captured carbon in living things.
If past temperatures are related to known solar and ocean cycles with increasing precision in the modern era, then future temperatures will also be related. The present warming is simply a Bond warming event just like more than a dozen similar and even more dramatic warming events in the last 10,000 years. The recent warming is simply climate following natural cycles. We are now at the peak of the sum of three cycles, each cycle also at a peak, a grand maximum. What follows will be cooling as all those cycles go negative.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman financial daily Handelsblatt here reports that a former shipyard which later turned to building offshore wind turbine sub-structures has filed for insolvency.
According to the company’s Managing Director Thierry Putters, the filing is due to “a looming inability to pay” its creditors. The Handelsblatt writes that 188 employees will be impacted. They already had been working reduced hours.
The Nordseewerke, located at the northwest seaport of Emden, was originally founded as a shipyard in 1903. After financial setbacks over the past five years it was taken over by other companies. Recently in a bid to stem losses it retooled to build offshore wind turbine sub-structures to supply North Sea wind park demand. However investment decisions on future offshore wind parks have been put off as uncertainty over Germany’s move into renewable energies grows.
Over the years huge technical problems have plagued North Sea offshore wind parks.
Nordseewerke is just the latest in a years-long series of insolvencies that have been crippling Germany’s renewable energies industry. In the solar industry, almost every major German solar manufacturer has gone bust since 2012.
Spiegel here reports on Nordseewerke:
The political framework conditions are marked by considerable uncertainties concerning the support for offshore wind energy after the year 2020, the company reported.”
During its ship-building heyday, the company employed some 5000 workers. The labor union blames poor management for the company’s demise.

The Washington Post just published an alarmist article titled: Giant earthquakes are shaking Greenland — and scientists just figured out the disturbing reason why. The article claimed that earthquakes were caused by icebergs calving off the Helheim Glacier, and that these were increasing because of increased outflow from this glacier. Here is the glacier in question, on the East side of Greenland opposite Iceland.

 Figure 1 is the location of Helheim Glacier. Source: Apple maps.
Here is a map of all the earthquakes that have occurred in this region since January 1st, 1980.

 Figure 2 is a map of the earthquakes that have occurred in this region since 1980. Source link.

Figure 3 is a date versus magnitude plot of all those earthquakes.
Only one of these 15 earthquakes is directly associated with Helheim Glacier, the last one. All the others were scattered all over the region, a few under or at the edge of the ice, most at sea or on land away from the ice.
They also occurred in two clusters, four in the early 1990s, then an eight year pause, then the rest in the eight years between 2002 and 2010. None have occurred since. There is nothing unusual to be seen here. Move along…
This is an example of scientists seeing what they wish to see. Instead of a full investigation, they just assumed that any earthquakes in the region were originating at Helheim Glacier, and because they stopped looking in 2010, they assumed that the earthquakes were continuing.
Instead of investigating a longer time period, they assumed that the period of their study was significant. None of their assumptions were true.

"MOSCOW  —   The war in eastern Ukraine that simmered quietly for months has erupted in a lethal bout of fighting in recent days. The violence, which killed at least eight Ukrainian soldiers and three on the   side, shifted the front lines by only a few hundred yards in several spots, but potentially complicates American efforts to improve relations with Russia. The United States Army helps to train and equip Ukrainian soldiers, who are fighting   separatists in two eastern provinces of Ukraine, in the only active war in Europe today. In the latest outbreak, the sides vied for control of what are known as “gray zone” territories, areas between the front lines that had previously been in buffer zones. The Ukrainian Army advanced in at least two places, according to news reports and official Ukrainian accounts, but it said it did so to rebuff rebel attacks. Each side blamed the other for the escalation. Referring to one   town, an adviser to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, Yuri Kasyanov, told Radio Free Europe on Tuesday, “The defenders of Avdiivka preferred to advance the line” to a more defensible position. Ukraine’s Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement appealing to Western governments to intervene diplomatically. “For the last two days, the Russian occupation forces carried out massive attacks across the line,” firing with rocket artillery, heavy mortars and other   weapons, the statement said. European monitors reported heavy shelling of  Avdiivka since Sunday. Journalists who visited the town reported evidence of a psychological warfare operation of a sophistication that suggested Russian involvement. Cellphones in the town received text messages addressed to Ukrainian soldiers, who often carry phones, saying, “You are just meat to your commanders. ” The shelling disrupted electrical and water supplies. The Ukrainian authorities set up heated shelters for residents whose homes had been damaged, as nighttime temperatures dropped to minus 18 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 28 Celsius). “Given harsh weather conditions and the continuing shelling by the militants, the humanitarian situation in the area continues to deteriorate,” the Foreign Affairs Ministry’s statement said. The authorities said they were preparing to evacuate the town’s 16, 000 residents. The rebel governments of the Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, which are not recognized internationally, issued a joint statement addressed to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Trump that also called for a diplomatic solution. The Trump administration’s maneuvering for better relations with Russia has alarmed Ukrainian officials, who fear that Western pressure could ease on Russia to withdraw its unacknowledged military forces in eastern Ukraine. But Ukraine is not without options in defending itself, including using its army, which showed an ability to fight even before American training began. Since the   line of contact was initially negotiated in a   in September 2014, the Ukrainian Army has in places given ground after separatist attacks. With its recent advance, the army moved back into at least one such area, near Avdiivka, without crossing the original   line, Mr. Kasyanov, the adviser to the Interior Ministry, said."

The Fall 2019 edition of the _Cato Journal_ , the Cato Institute’s interdisciplinary journal of public policy, is now available online. Readers of Alt-M will find the articles on monetary and financial topics of special interest. Their topics range from financial inclusion, to macroprudential policy, to Modern Monetary Theory, to the politicization of the Federal Reserve, to European monetary policy. Here are links to the full-text articles–followed by a summary of each.



Drawn from remarks he delivered at the Cato Institute’s Financial Inclusion Summit this past June, Brian Johnson’s article, ""Consumer Protection and Financial Inclusion,"" explores the relationship between financial inclusion, consumer protection, and free-market innovation. At the same time, Johnson–currently Deputy Director at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau–draws a sharp contrast between promoting these ideals and ""giving license to government actors to supplant consumer preferences with their own."" Too often, he writes, regulators conflate the two: intervening in private markets, corrupting the principles of competition and choice, and jeopardizing consumers’ interests. While these sorts of regulations are ""market-replacing,"" Johnson says, others can be market-enhancing. He identifies three approaches to consumer protection, the first two of which promote private choice and innovation, whereas the latter restricts them. The first, which Johnson calls the ""disclosure-based"" approach, favors regulations that prioritize transparency, facilitate the flow of information from businesses to consumers, promote trust between free-market participants, and grant individuals greater autonomy over their financial decisions. The second, which Johnson calls the ""consumer welfare"" approach, favors regulations that prevent businesses from obstructing consumer choice through unlawful exclusion, discrimination, or deception.



Yet businesses aren’t the only parties capable of consumer exclusion or obstruction: the government can also impede product access and financial innovation by taking a ""product restriction"" approach to regulation. This third and final approach, Johnson explains, blocks consumers’ abilities to access products and business’ abilities to design them. By ""den[ying] consumers the choice to which they should be entitled,"" he writes, product restriction represents a ""conscious policy of financial exclusion."" Debates surrounding which of these approaches will promote a free and prosperous society are not new, he adds. They are merely new iterations of ""the age-old debate about liberty and security."" In identifying the optimal level and scope of financial regulation, agencies should choose those policies that promote consumer responsibility and provide individuals with the greatest opportunity ""to make their own choices in free markets.""



Allan M. Malz, Adjunct Associate Professor at Columbia University and former Vice President at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, explores a new trend in monetary policy that emerged in response to the 2007–09 global financial crisis. Called ""macroprudential policy,"" its advocates believe it can help prevent future crises by supplementing, and sometimes superseding, ""microprudential"" policies like inflation targeting and interest rate targeting. Malz begins by explaining the differences between the two. Microprudential policy, as its name suggests, applies to discrete measures of financial stability, like prices and economic growth. Macroprudential policy, on the other hand, attempts to measure and enhance _overall _financial stability. As a result, the range of macroprudential metrics and tools is broader, vaguer, and more likely ""to vary over time, parametrically or at the discretion of regulators."" In other words, the success of any macroprudential policy requires regulators to accurately ""recognize threats to [financial] stability and react quickly and correctly."" This concerns Malz, who considers regulatory discretion one of the chief causes of financial instability, rather than the cure. Too many regulatory policies shower undue favoritism on firms that are ""too big to fail"" and grant guaranteed bailouts to financial behemoths, he argues. Such policies only aid and abet the ongoing—and equally significant–problem of chronically undercapitalized banks. By increasing the scope of regulatory discretion—and the number of lopsided policies that often result–Malz argues that macroprudential policy ""doesn’t fix this problem, but tries to ward off its consequences.""



Malz would rather tackle that problem head-on. Calling for ""higher ratios of better-quality capital,"" he discusses a series of proposed measures for enhancing banks’ capital requirements, removing guaranteed government bailouts, and improving the accuracy and transparency of bank asset risk assessments. Such measures can strengthen banks’ financial resilience without requiring regulators–or taxpayers–to foot the bill, although they also leave open the question of how (or whether) regulators should provide support to failed or failing banks. Malz warns that imposing any sort of immediate no-bailout policy could create market whiplash, and that as a result, ""unwinding [bailout] guarantees cannot be done overnight, but only gradually.""



This issue of the _Cato Journal _features two articles on Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), an increasingly popular monetary philosophy that, as Sebastian Edwards (Henry Ford II Distinguished Professor at the UCLA Anderson Graduate School of Management) explains, hinges on the belief that ""it is possible to use expansive monetary policy–money creation by the central bank (i.e., the Federal Reserve)–to finance large fiscal deficits, and create a ‘jobs guarantee’ program that will ensure full employment."" Although MMT has garnered plenty of disciples and detractors in recent years, there is little empirical literature on how well its policies would work in vivo.



Edwards’ article takes the first step toward changing that. He begins by illuminating the parallels between MMT and another approach to political economy, called ""macroeconomic populism."" Similar to MMT’s policy goals, macroeconomic populism’s ""set of [expansive monetary] policies"" are ""aimed at redistributing income by running high fiscal deficits."" Macroeconomic populism also parallels MMT’s rejection of free market principles, distrust of competition, fear of economic globalization, and support for ""price and exchange controls, high minimum wages, high import tariffs, and large subsidies."" Both approaches also favor ""state-owned enterprises and… large multinationals (often associated to natural resources, such as oil and mining).""



Edwards then outlines what he and other economists call ""the four phases of [macroeconomic] populism,"" which he uses as a framework for comparing three Latin American monetary regimes: Chile under Salvador Allende; Peru under Alan García; and Venezuela under Hugo Chavez and Nicolás Maduro. All three implemented policies and deployed rhetoric characteristic of MMT, and all experienced an eerily similar progression of events. In the very short term, the new regimes’ expansionist monetary policies produced a fleeting patina of economic prosperity. Inevitably, however, runaway inflation followed and grew higher with every effort made to conceal it. Both Modern Monetary Theorists and macroeconomic populists support financing fiscal deficits by printing more money, Edwards explains. But in the absence of true market growth, all that this means is that the _velocity_ of money skyrockets, while its overall _value_ plummets. The final inflation and unemployment data that Edwards presents from each of these countries show that ""all these cases ended up in major macroeconomic disasters""–worse off, in fact, than they were under the depressed economic conditions that precipitated the populist uprising.



Warren Coats (currently a Fellow at the Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise at The Johns Hopkins Krieger School of Arts and Sciences) takes aim at two of MMT’s core tenets: that countries with sovereign currencies can–and should–print unlimited amounts of that currency in order to fund unlimited government expenditures (partly as a means of employing jobless citizens); and that doing so will neither impede private investment nor spike inflation, since the government can always ""drain"" the markets of excess reserves through a combination of monetary and fiscal policy tools. As Coats points out, this last idea–that elected lawmakers should use fiscal policy measures, like taxation, to conduct monetary policy–would completely erode the principle of a politically independent central bank.



The article begins by juxtaposing the conventional, ""money multiplier"" narrative about the relationship between government-issued ""base money"" and market-generated ""broad money"" with the MMT narrative. According to the money multiplier theory, which informs the conventional approach to monetary policy, an increase in base money (i.e., currency held by the public plus bank reserves held at the Fed) will lead to a multiple increase in the money stock (i.e., currency plus demand deposits) as banks extend credit in a fractional-reserve system. According to MMT, however, market transactions are essentially closed systems. Quoting directly from three MMT-sympathetic economists, Coats explains that in the MMT worldview, ""‘loans create deposits’ and ‘repayment of loans destroys deposits.’"" He then reviews–and refutes–MMT’s claims that the U.S. government can ""spend more without taxing more… because it can borrow in its own currency""; that after ""borrowing"" what it needs from either the public or the central bank, it can once again ""spend more–by printing more money [or rather, by forcing the central bank to do so]–without crowding out private sector activity""; and that fiscal policy tools should also be used to manage the money supply.



Coats’ critique of MMT is both economic and normative. Before ""shifting our limited resources from the private to the public sector,"" he writes, we must ask ourselves ""whether society is made better off by such shifts."" As his article shows, it is not. Any promise that MMT reveals an untapped source of extra ""fiscal space""–one in which the government can spend more money without contributing to either deficits or inflation–rings hollow. What’s more, any proposal that would merge monetary with fiscal policy neglects a century’s worth of painful lessons about the perils of centralizing—and politicizing—both the means and the ends of production.



James A. Dorn, Vice President for Monetary Studies and a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, makes an especially timely case for a rules-based monetary policy in his new article. From President Trump’s recent insistence that the Fed buoy up his reelection prospects by lowering interest rates, to former New York Federal Reserve president William Dudley’s demand that the Fed tighten policy in order to thwart Trump’s shot at a second term, both maneuvers are stark reminders that, as Dorn puts it, ""in the absence of a monetary rule, a central bank is vulnerable to politicization.""



The Fed’s ""political independence,"" Dorn explains, is meant to insulate it from partisan interference and help it fulfill its ""triple mandate"" of promoting stable prices, maintaining moderate interest rates, and achieving maximum employment. But that mandate is far too vague a substitute for a rule–especially since, in our fiat currency regime, the Fed already has considerable discretion in setting and adjusting monetary policy. And policy discretion is hardly political independence: Dorn reviews over half a century’s worth of partisan attempts to interfere in central bank policy in order to show that the Fed’s discretion is frequently the plaything of political whims–making it neither politically independent nor politically accountable. Notwithstanding a few exceptions, he writes, Fed policy tends to be politically ""accommodative,"" promoting an economy immediately favorable to the party in power.



Yet the short-term benefits of accommodative policies–high growth, easy money, and low interest rates–often give way to extreme long-term costs: high rates of inflation, skyrocketing national debt, and greater vulnerability to financial crises that, when they do occur, help justify further increases to the Fed’s discretionary powers. That cycle will likely worsen unless the Fed adopts and adheres to a monetary policy rule–or a series of them–about how to measure the health of our economy and when to intervene if that health begins to fail. Before that, Dorn urges Congress to establish a monetary commission to evaluate the Fed’s performance and ""consider alternatives to the present discretionary government fiat money regime."" Until then, monetary policy tools will continue to double as tools for partisan meddling–and that, of course, will jeopardize the independence of more than just the Fed.



A few of the Fed’s new policy tools, however, might pose a threat to the Fed’s political ""independence"" in and of themselves. That’s the case that Robert Heller, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and former President and CEO of VISA, makes in his article. Heller begins with a brief history of the Fed’s policy of paying interest on excess reserves, or IOER. As the ""bank’s bank,"" the Fed lends to and stores deposits from other U.S. financial institutions. In 2008, it began paying interest on those deposits, not only for banks’ required reserves (the amount banks need to meet the minimum legal threshold for solvency) but for their ""excess"" reserves as well. This radically altered the Fed’s relationship with the private market: whereas the Fed could once only ""target"" the rate at which banks borrow and lend among one another, its IOER policy now allows it to influence those rates directly. The Fed’s IOER rate, which it sets and adjusts at its discretion, creates an interest rate ""floor"" that private banks have little reason to borrow above or lend below. Taken alongside a second Fed policy tool, called Quantitative Easing (or QE), Heller explains that IOER also significantly blurs the lines between monetary and fiscal policy. Initially a strategy for injecting further reserves into the economy (not to mention adding to the Fed’s own capital surplus), QE involves the Fed purchasing large, high-risk (and therefore high-return) assets from large, private sector “dealer” banks, directly crediting those dealers’ Fed accounts as payment. As those dealers’ Fed accounts increase, so do their IOER returns. The Fed, in turn, profits from the interest paid on its new assets. Both QE and IOER simultaneously complement, and supplement, one another.



In some ways, this strategy worked too well: the Fed’s large-scale asset returns proved so profitable that lawmakers began leeching from its newfound surplus to finance their own pet projects–everything from government programs to entirely new bureaucratic agencies. (Ironically, Heller notes, this now makes the Fed ""one of the least well-capitalized banks in the country""). Things soured, however, once the Fed decided to combat inflation by tightening monetary policy in 2015. This meant raising market interest rates–which the Fed could only do if it, too, increased its _own _interest payments to its members’ accounts. The more money it shunted to depositors, the less it had to delegate to lavish spending programs. As a result, every time the Fed raises interest rates, it also raises the level of tension between itself and our elected officials. This explains why we now see politicians across the aisle ""blam[ing] the Fed for making excessive payments to the banks and for growing Treasury deficits.""



Heller concludes by urging the Fed to change course on both policies. Whatever costs may come from doing so, he argues, are benign compared to the potentially irreversible damage that will befall to our economy–not to mention our political institutions–if the Fed stays on its current path. Unless the Fed winds down its balance sheet expansion and reduces its market footprint, he writes, ""increased political pressures may well… threaten the position of the Fed as a separate and independent government agency.""



Gunther Schnabl, Professor for Economic Policy and Director of the Institute for Economic Policy at Leipzig University, lends some historical perspective to present-day debates about what the European Monetary Union (EMU) should do to mend an increasingly fragile and uncertain European economy. Schnabl suggests that the EMU revisit the monetary policies and economic philosophy of ordoliberalism, which many scholars today credit for Germany’s remarkable post-World War II socioeconomic recovery. Ordoliberalism, Schnabl explains, is a ""concept for a market economy"" in which the state does little more than provide the regulatory foundation most conducive to private competition and innovation. Its core principles are monetary and currency stability; free prices; open markets; individual ownership of the outcomes of their financial decisions; and a ""constant and forward-looking"" economic policy that defends ""market principles against interest groups.""



Schnabl presents data supporting his claim that ordoliberalism fueled Germany’s postwar growth and facilitated the rapid increase in prosperity and economic integration that spread throughout Europe at the same time. He then chronicles the dramatic shift in European monetary policy that followed the creation of the European Central Bank (ECB). Particularly in the aftermath of the 90’s dotcom boom, the ECB concentrated its economic stabilization efforts on lowering interest rates, raising inflation, expanding government asset purchases, and increasing government spending. These policies had detrimental and far-reaching consequences the German economy and for Europe as a whole. Schnabl even traces Europe’s current climate of political unrest and factional extremism to the ECB’s post-2000 policy stance. The first step toward mitigating that political and economic unrest, he says, is for the ECB to wind back its dangerously loose monetary policy. Beyond that, however, the EMU should undertake further reforms to restore the legacy of ordoliberalism. ""Just as the stable German mark was the backbone of the German economic miracle,"" he writes, ""a stability-oriented European monetary policy is today the prerequisite for economic and political stability in Europe.""



With the 2020 elections heating up, so are debates about what an ""optimal"" tax rate for the wealthiest Americans would be. But as Cato Institute Senior Fellow Alan Reynolds explains, the terms of that question are themselves open to debate. Before we settle on what an ""optimal"" top tax rate _is, _we have first to determine what the word ""optimal"" even _means. _Is an ""optimal top tax rate"" one that maximizes economic efficiency, innovation, and productivity? Or is it one that maximizes tax revenue itself? As Reynolds notes: ""what is optimal from the point of economic efficiency… is not necessarily optimal if the government’s priority… is to maximize tax revenue collected from high incomes, ostensibly for the purpose of redistributing that extra revenue to the poor."" Nor is it clear, even if the goal _is_ to increase the amount of tax revenue the government collects, that raising taxes on the very wealthy will do the trick. This is because the sheer act of raising or lowering income tax rates changes the way in which individuals report that income. The metric that most economists use to measure that change–the Elasticity of Taxable Income (ETI)–calculates the difference in individuals’ income tax returns before and after major tax adjustments. This is why Reynolds calls it ""treacherous"" to ""derive optimal tax rates from tax return data,"" since ""when marginal tax rates go up, reported top incomes go down.""



Even within the economic literature, the specific rate of ETI is fungible, and Edwards’ article refutes several of the most extreme claims that ETI is, or can become, virtually nonexistent. One reason for this is called ""tax avoidance,"" which has less to do with outright fraud and more to do with the fact that high earners can shift portions their income to things like stock options, capital gains, and employer benefits. Indeed, Reynolds shows that after top tax rates increased in 1993, so did stock-based executive compensation–although he also provides plenty of data to disprove what proponents of higher tax rates call the ""CEO rent-extraction hypothesis,"" whereby executives relocate massive amounts of their income to stock options following a tax hike. At the same time, Reynolds shows that when marginal tax rates go down, reported income levels rise. In addition to ""tax avoidance,"" ETI accounts for the effect that tax adjustments have on ""incentives for productive activity such as work effort, research, new business start-ups, and investment in physical and human capital."" These, of course, are far more difficult to measure, as are their resulting downstream effects. Yet a number of empirical studies reveal a strong inverse correlation between marginal tax rates, GDP, and ""long-term real activity."" In sum: ETI is higher than what most proponents of high marginal tax rates would suggest, and this is worth taking into account when we calculate ""optimality"" from any objective standpoint. Regardless of whether the aim of taxation is to heighten productivity or to raise government revenue, Reynolds concludes, the latter requires the former. ""Income that is not created is not taxed,"" he writes, and the ""growth of real government revenues ultimately depends on growth of taxable income and wealth.""

"The Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus is under threat from a deadly virus. Panulirus argus 1 (PaV1) is found throughout the Caribbean, infecting up to 30% of lobsters in some areas. Alongside overfishing, it is the biggest danger spiny lobsters are facing today. This is important because the species plays a vital role as both predator and prey in Caribbean seagrass and reef ecosystems. The annual catch of about 40,000 tonnes supports local fisheries and provides a food source for people across the world. The virus replaces blood cells, eventually turning infected lobsters’ blood (referred to as haemolymph) milky white, leaving the disease visible to the human eye through their translucent abdomens. Once this happens, it’s usually not long before the lobster dies. The virus is contagious and can be transmitted through direct contact, ingestion of diseased tissue via cannibalism and through water. This is worrying as spiny lobsters tend to hang out in groups.

      Mystery virus that turned millions of starfish into goo is finally identified


 Research efforts – including my own – have been trying to uncover more about the disease, which was only discovered in 1999. We already know that clinically diseased lobsters are generally smaller than healthy ones – but colleagues and I wondered if this might be related to their choice of habitat. Depending on its life stage, a spiny lobster lives in different habitats. Larvae float in open oceanic waters, while postlarvae and small juveniles like shallow, vegetated habitats where they can hide from predators. When they outgrow the protection afforded by the vegetation, they seek structured shelters such as rocks and crevices around the seagrass meadows. Finally, on the cusp of adulthood they start migrating to coral reefs. In a recent study with colleagues at the National Autonomous University of Mexico’s Reef Systems Unit in the Caribbean, we surveyed three very different habitat types – a shallow, sparsely vegetated area, an algae and seagrass meadow, and a coral reef. We found that significantly more lobsters with PaV1 lived in the highly vegetated seagrass meadow. It’s not yet clear why the seagrass habitat is a disease hot-spot. While further research is needed, it could be that seagrass is an environment in which the virus naturally reproduces, or that the habitat prevents the virus from escaping. Recent research elsewhere has shown that coastal seagrass meadows can trap some pathogens, greatly reducing the number that reach the open ocean and benefiting humans and marine life. In our case, it would be the coral reefs that are more pathogen-free, and the adult lobsters that reap the benefits. But the spiny lobster isn’t helpless to avoid this deadly disease. While undertaking surveys a few years ago, scientists in Florida noticed that healthy lobsters avoided sharing shelters with individuals infected with Pav1 – an unusual behaviour for this usually sociable species. How they do this is fascinating. Lobster sensory organs are very different to ours – instead of using human-like eyes, nose and ears to help them go about their daily business, they flick their antennae to detect chemicals in the water. Lobsters suffering from PaV1 release chemicals unique to the virus, but symptomless carriers don’t. It therefore seems that the healthy lobsters are able to “sniff” out the disease and can avoid sick lobsters and boost their chances of survival. From our study it seems that lobsters in seagrass habitats that are unable to avoid becoming diseased are much less likely to live long enough to migrate into the reef habitats where larger lobsters live. In terms of species health this can be seen as a positive, as the diseased population becomes isolated, while the best sniffers make it out onto the reefs to live and breed – natural selection in action. The other side of the coin is that, overall, less lobsters are making it out to the reefs in the presence of the disease. This isn’t ideal for fishermen who rely on spiny lobsters migrating to the reef and reaching a size worth catching to make a living. What’s more, even those that do reach adulthood are becoming harder to catch. In much of the Caribbean, fishermen use “casitas” to trap lobsters. Spanish for “little house”, these artificial shelters mimic those that juvenile lobsters live in when in seagrass habitats. Lobsters normally gather under these shelters and fishermen dive down and pick them up, or hook them. But we now know that if a diseased lobster is under a casita, other, healthy lobsters won’t enter as readily – meaning a reduced catch. For numerous small fishing cooperatives across the Caribbean, this could be devastating. Much still remains to be answered about how Pav1 and lobsters’ response to it will affect the health of the species and the fishing and tourism industries that rely on it. Our research on these questions continues, so watch this space."

At the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), retired climate scientist Hans-Joachim Lüdecke and two colleagues have responded to the Senate testimony given by Pat Michaels (video follows).

Video of Prof. Patrick Michaels before a Senate committee. Transcript here.
Lüdecke and his colleagues agree with Dr. Michaels’ assertion that the projected increase in the earth’s temperature from CO2 is getting smaller and smaller.
F. Gervais, C.O. Weiss and H.J. Lüdecke write at EIKE:
“Anyone who has been tracking the scientific journals on climate science has observed over many years that the supposedly expected temperature increase from CO2 has steadily been decreasing over the years.”

At EIKE Lüdecke and his colleagues provide the following chart from Landshape to back up the point:

The above chart from landshape.wordpress.com/2015/06/20/6921/ is a graphical compilation of published CO2 climate sensitivity results since 2000. The trend for a temperature increase from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 (so-called climate sensitivity) has fallen from over 4°C to under 2°C today.
This means that all the assumptions and claims made by the IPCC in the past were based on hype and totally inaccurate results.
Gervais, Weiss and Lüdecke conclude in their EIKE piece:
“We can now tell politcians that they can call off the warnings. There’s no chance of a global warming of more than 2°C .
The decrease in the projected temperature rise from CO2 will continue on its present trend. By 2025 the warming by CO2 will be close to zero. We can thus expect that the quality of the forecasts will increase to the point where they will actually reflect reality.”

Australians are being ripped off for more than a billion dollars a year for publicly-funded broadcasters who bully and belittle ordinary Australians – and assiduously lie to them. Not only do the public broadcasters repeatedly peddle garbage fake news, they also strenuously hide inconvenient truths from the Australian public. Truths which are inconvenient to their left-wing narrative, that is.



Australia’s public broadcasters, the ABC and SBS, are absolutely rusted-on to climate hysteria. With typical watermelon arrogance, they have been relentlessly pushing the narrative that the current bushfires are solely the work of climate change. **Far from “respecting the science”, any scientist who contradicts their dogma is silenced. Inconvenient truths are Memory-Holed.**



Yesterday I tweeted a quote from an SBS News article from 2013 which featured top bushfire researcher David Packham calling links between bushfire disaster and climate change “an absolute nonsense”…I tagged SBS News in it, but that may have been a mistake. Within an hour several followers noticed the article had mysteriously and coincidentally suddenly disappeared.



Using my super-sleuth, investigative journalism skills (Google) I discovered a cache of the article.



What heresy did this article speak, that it had to be so swiftly consigned to the bonfire of leftist inanity?



Linking the bushfire disaster in NSW to climate change is “an absolute nonsense” and reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush is urgently needed, a leading scientist says.



Retired Monash University researcher David Packham says global warming is a gradual process which doesn’t explain major bushfires.



Greens deputy leader Adam Bandt has been accused of playing politics by linking the NSW bushfires to the new federal government’s climate change policies.



But Mr Packham says there is no link.



“It’s an absolute nonsense,” he told AAP.



That was six years ago. Now, with another bushfire disaster unfolding, Bandt has reverted to odious type and used the tragedy to push his nasty little barrow.



True to form, as well, **the public broadcasters are desperate to silence a scientist speaking truth to their taxpayer-funded power**.



“Bushfire expert David Packham tried to tell 7.30 we had to burn our bush every 10 years to cut the leaf litter that turns our fires into infernos, a level of burning NSW doesn’t come close to reaching. But after just 69 words, 7.30 handed back his microphone to chatterers whose living depends on the warming scare – two green activists and a scientist from Climate System Science.”



…Packham describ[ed] the experience with the other taxpayer-funded national broadcaster…



“Briefly, at 7.30 request I came into Melbourne a three-hour drive and spent 50 minutes with the 7.30 folk. I estimate about 35 minutes was in interview. I was asked to confirm that the fires in NSW were unprecedented in being so early in the season. I said no, they were not and offered information from Luke and Mc Arthur “Bushfires in Australia -1976” (Aust Govt Publishing Service) which was not accepted.



When the question was put as to the role of global warming, again I said “not involved”. That was not an acceptable answer and it was clear that it did not fit with the predetermined agenda. My sadness at the termination of my life-long love of the ABC because of this very unethical journalism – at least of the news division – is not only sadness but also a touch of fear for our democracy.”



Packham is to be congratulated for risking ostracism from the science establishment for telling the plain truth. But, one must also wonder why it’s only taken him until **now** to notice how unethical and agenda-driven the taxpayer-funded broadcasters are.

As I [wrote recently for _Insight_](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/gaia-macht-frei/), there is an alarming sub-strata of the “deep-green” eco-activist movement which eagerly anticipates a mass genocide of the human species to “save the planet”.



This is not just a fringe element either: David Attenborough is a patron of the Population Matters group, which wants to urgently reduce the human population. Extinction Rebellion argue that not only must the population be reduced – urgently – but that industrial civilisation must be eradicated.



Fortunately, as I also wrote, so far only a handful of genuine lunatics on the fringes of the deep greens, like the Unabomber, El Paso shooter Patrick Crusius, and Christchurch terrorist Brenton Tarrant, have been motivated enough to put their beliefs into murderous action. To date, the mainstream deep greens have been content to merely talk.



 **But their talk is becoming more and more ominous.**



One of the British eco-warriors who founded Extinction Rebellion has been disowned by his allies and rebuked by the German government after insisting there was nothing “unique” about the Holocaust.



Roger Hallam created a schism in the radical protest movement on Wednesday with an interview with the German newspaper Die Zeit in which he described the Third Reich’s systematic murder of six million Jews as “just another f..kery in human history” and said genocide was “almost a normal occurrence”.



This is part of another alarming pattern in left-wing politics: **dehumanising Jews** , minimising the Jewish experience (such as [erasing any mention ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/europe-is-erasing-the-jews-again/)of Jews in Holocaust Memorial Day literature) and, at worse, mainstreaming [outright anti-Semitism](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/australian-jews-sound-warning-on-leftist-anti-semitism/).



Thankfully, so far (at least) Hallam’s gauche explicit linkage of Holocaust dismissal with the deep green movement has alarmed his chums into doing the decent thing. For now.



The comments drew a swift rebuke from German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who called the industrial-scale murder of Jews “uniquely inhuman”.



“We must always beware of this to ensure: never again!” Mr Maas wrote on Twitter.



German Greens co-leader Robert Habeck told the newspaper Bild “there must be no place for anti-Semitism or downplaying of the Holocaust”.



But, [as _Die Zeit_ writer Hannah Knut wrote](https://www.zeit.de/2019/48/extinction-rebellion-roger-hallam-klimaaktivist/komplettansicht), “it does not do Germans any good that they mistook him for being unique”. Because the truth is that Hallam is the very model of the modern climate protester.



Hallam actually studied a “PhD in civil disobedience” (yes, apparently there **is** such a thing) at King’s College London. An institution which he proceeded to harass into acquiescing to his extremist demands. This is a bullying radical incubated in the heart of an establishment white-anted by the left’s Long March through the institutions.



Hallam is not an outlier on the deep green movement. He is merely one willing to push the Overton Window furthest into [the darkness inherent in deep green philosophy](https://adevilscurmudgeon.wordpress.com/2019/11/24/just-what-is-eco-fascism/).

"**There's an election scenario that is giving social media company bosses nightmares.**
The period between the polls closing and the declared result usually takes a few hours.
But this time it's likely to take days - perhaps even weeks. Millions of postal votes will take time to process.
Social media companies believe this period - of claim and counterclaim - could push the US over the edge.
If both Donald Trump and Joe Biden declare themselves the winner, there are fears of violence between the already polarised communities of the US.
And all of this could be played out on social media.
Three weeks ago, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said he was ""worried"".
On Facebook he wrote: ""With our nation so divided and election results potentially taking days or even weeks to be finalised, there could be an increased risk of civil unrest across the country.""
In what may well be a first, several of the Big Tech companies have been working together to ""scenario plan"" different results of the vote.
They've essentially been war-gaming election night.
There's one scenario that worries the tech bosses: postal votes are expected to be weighted towards the Democratic candidate, while voting at the ballot box is expected to favour the incumbent Republican.
This is because Mr Trump has told his supporters to vote in person. He says the postal voting process is rigged (there is no evidence of this).
The Democrats, by contrast, have no such problem with encouraging postal voting.
As a result, these two ways of voting have become politically skewed.
This could create what is being coined as a ""red mirage"" on the night of the poll and a ""blue shift"" in the days after.
In this scenario, Mr Trump would ""win"" on the day because ballot box votes will have been counted.
But then, after the postal votes slowly rack up, Mr Biden would claw away at Mr Trump's lead.
What would Mr Trump do? Well almost everything he's said and tweeted thus far suggests he'd declare victory - or at the very least question the result.
""[We] must know election results on the night of the election, not days, months, or even years later!"" he tweeted in July.
His constant talk of postal voting fraud also points to him questioning the final tally.
And last week he refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.
In fact, Mr Trump has already done something similar. During the Florida mid-term elections of 2018, as recounts were beginning to haul in a Republican majority, he tweeted the following:
So the evidence points one way. Mr Trump doesn't want to hang around for all those postal votes to be counted.
This is where the Big Tech bosses come in.
If Mr Trump is going to declare victory, it's likely he'll do it via Twitter and Facebook.
And these platforms have said - unequivocally - that they will not allow him to do that.
Twitter has said it will ""label or remove misleading information intended to undermine public confidence in an electionâ¦ eg claiming victory before election results have been certified"".
Facebook has said it will reject ads from US political campaigns prematurely claiming victory before results have been declared - and remove disinformation about the vote.
On Friday, news site Axios reported that Google would block election ads after election day as a response to this same concern.
So we now have this possibility: Mr Trump claims victory, but is blocked from spreading the word on social media.
This could create perhaps the most dangerous moment that any of these social media companies have faced.
They will have to censor potentially thousands of politically charged posts.
As passions intensify, the presidential candidates may vow revenge for decisions taken about what to leave up or take down that they disagree with.
What could Mr Trump do to punish them? Well in the future he could seek to repeal Section 230 - which protects social media companies from being responsible for the content people publish.
He's already indicated - through executive orders - that he's willing to do this.
Biden too could refuse to concede defeat - or go too far in claiming that Republicans are trying to ""steal"" the election.
And if Mr Biden wins but feels social media fanned the flames of division? Well there are many Democrats who are concerned with the power that these companies have. Some believe they should even be split up.
Of course, this might not happen. Mr Trump could win by a landslide and Mr Biden accept defeat immediately. Or Mr Biden could win the popular vote on the night, and Mr Trump could go graciously.
But all of the evidence so far suggests that's not going to happen.
And that could mean serious problems for not just the United States, but the future of social media itself."

Approves Asia Supply Route, Ignores US Route
H/T Eric Worrall and Breitbart – Obama’s inability to make a decision on Keystone has finally yielded a result – Canada has made the decision for him.
Breitbart reports Canada has just approved the Enbridge Northern Gateway Project – a major pipeline to ship Canadian oil to Asia.
The Canadian oil will still be burnt – in Asia, instead of America. 
All the jobs and energy security which Canadian oil could have delivered to America, will instead be delivered to Asia.
Rather than purchasing crude from a friendly and allied neighbor, the United States will most likely need to continue its reliance upon hostile sources like Venezuela. Energy analysts had hoped that construction of Keystone could have replaced almost half of the current U.S. daily crude purchases from that volatile, anti-American dictatorship, depriving Venezuela of the resources it relies upon to stay in power and fund its Cuban allies.
You can’t say Canada didn’t give America a chance – they waited years for the American administration to come to their senses. But in the end, they couldn’t wait any longer, and have put the interests of Canadians first.
Below is a helpful timeline of Keystone events, courtesy of Al Jazeera.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis Vatican site here teaches Catholics the 10 Commandments of God.
Yet, on topics of energy and climate, the Pope’s latest Encyclical arguably serves to incite many of the world’s citizens and powerful institutions to violate 3, if not 4, of these Holy Commandments.
On the subject of climate science and energy, the overall attitude of the Pope with regards to skeptic voices has been a colossal disappointment. Pope Francis has purposely refused to listen to the critics of climate pessimism and alarmism, has outright dismissed them, and, as He communicates in His Encyclical, He now calls for the forced redistribution and reorganization of the world’s goods.
Though the Encyclical gives the appearance of an appeal to alleviate pain and suffering among the world’s most vulnerable, It is in part a deeply rooted and disturbing desire to seize and control the world’s life-sustaining wealth and resources. History threatens to repeat.
Rather than teaching Catholics to voluntarily share their wealth (as many already do), Pope Francis instead proposes that Catholics and all citizens be forced to do so by law, against their will, and to do so to a draconian extent. This is an uncharacteristically harsh and aggressive doctrine. So harsh in fact that executing the Encyclical’s underlying demand would de facto involve the violation of 4 of God’s 10 Commandments:
NO. 10: YOU SHALL NOT COVET YOUR NEIGHBOR’S GOODS
When you boil down the issue of climate change, it gets down to the confiscation, redistribution and re-ownership of global wealth. Catholic and PIK economist Ottmar Edenhofer even confirmed this in no uncertain terms. It is clear that much of the issue is all about coveting thy neighbor’s goods. It is about inciting the world’s poor to covet the wealth of others, and inciting powerful institutions to seize that wealth on the poor’s behalf. Worse, rightful owners are being coerced by false threats (e.g. computer-generated doomsday scenarios) should they resist going along.

NO. 7: YOU SHALL NOT STEAL
The climate issue and the Encyclical itself demand that a global authority be set up with the purpose of denying and/or redistributing the world’s wealth and energy. Redistribution here means seizing property rights from their rightful owners, and transfering these rights to others, all under the guise of the common good. The confiscation of property through gross acts of scientific deception and computer-generated threats of natural calamities is ‘stealing’.
NO. 8. YOU SHALL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS AGAINST YOUR NEIGHBOR
When it comes to the claimed “consensus” on the science, its funding, the accuracy of climate models, presentation of data, proxy reconstructions, etc. there’s been an over-abundance of false witness. This has been the most unfortunate aspect and the root of the whole issue. The Pope’s characterization of the non-alarmist climate skeptics, one he seems to have hastily adopted from the powerful and well funded, is one that bears false witness against these very skeptics. The skeptics of alarmism and climate science are in fact in great numbers, and most are operating humbly on a shoestring and with no support from the powerful institutions, let alone Big Oil. Moreover there is no consensus whatsoever, and the Pope is spreading a grave untruth here when He implies there is. The skeptics are poor, have had their voices muffled – and yet, rather than showing them compassion as Jesus would, the Pope has callously dismissed them, refused to hear them, even marginalized them, opting to side with the rich and powerful.
NO. 5: YOU SHALL NOT KILL
Here killing means the premeditated act of taking another’s life. Of course no one believes the Vatican endorses this. But if you know your actions and policies lead to lives being lost in mass, then you are guilty of killing. It is clear that taking affordable energy away from the poor (and even the lower middle class) leads to horrible deaths from exposure – real deaths today that we witness winter after winter. Instead the Pope appears indifferent to the poor’s need of cheap fuel to stay warm and to care for their families, and seems obsessed with the fictitious computer-generated “deaths” 50 years down the road that some see in models, which so far have been proven to be totally flawed. Has he bought into the notion that climate scientists are prophets?
These are 4 Commandments that Pope Francis is sadly neglecting and possibly abusing in his Encyclical. Many of us have already come to realize that this Pope did not even author the encyclical himself, and that he likely was duped into endorsing It. Executing the Encyclical would lead to moral anarchy.
Good Catholics will choose to ignore the Pope’s Encyclical with respect to the still very much unsettled and hotly debated topics of climate science, energy, and especially the calls for the forced redistribution of (coveted) goods.

Of those 11,258 ‘scientists’ (including [Mickey Mouse](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/taking-the-mickey-out-of-the-other-11257/)) who declared that the world was going to hell in a handcart due to a climate emergency, 195 were from New Zealand. What were their fields of **climate science** expertise that lead them to this conclusion?



With a bit of jiggery-pokery, the PDF list of ‘scientists’ from the original article was converted to Excel, sorted by country and then by their self declared “Professional Position and/or Discipline”. Those from New Zealand were copied to this post along with their “Institution”.



There are a few on that list that are clearly involved in the climate science field but **most are not.** They have no more credibility than the average person. 



An obstetrician, a software engineer, a specialist in Edible Mycorrhizal Fungi, a plant breeder, a genetics technician, a clinical psychologist and and a botany compliance officer! 



Well, I’m convinced.

"**Facebook has unveiled its second-generation Oculus Quest virtual reality headset, promising higher-quality visuals at a significantly lower price than many had predicted.**
It also revealed two blockbuster franchises - Assassin's Creed and Splinter Cell - were being developed for the platform.
The firm has been unable to meet demand for the first Quest in recent months.
But one industry-watcher suggested it is likely to remain a ""niche"" product.
The launch comes 16 months after the original Quest's release.
The all-in-one machine distinguished itself by offering users six degrees of freedom - meaning they could walk around virtual worlds in a limited space as well as look up, down, left and right - without needing separate external sensors or to have its software run off a PC.
The new model features higher-resolution displays, which now offer ""almost 2K"" per eye. The firm says that represents 50% more pixels than before, and they have been arranged so that the gaps between each pixel are less apparent.
Facebook suggest one benefit is that text will be easier to read.
However, the trade off is that it has moved from using OLED to LED screen technology, meaning the blacks may be less deep than before, affecting contrast.
Other improvements include:
Many of the details had leaked in advance.
However, the price has proved to be a surprise.
Experts the BBC spoke to ahead of the launch expected it to be anywhere from the same price as the original quest up to about a third more.
Instead, Facebook has cut the entry level price from Â£399 to Â£299 for version with 64 gigabytes of storage. A second version costs Â£399 and provides 256GB of storage.
That could help drive interest at a time when many gamers are focused instead on the forthcoming launches of new PlayStation and Xbox consoles.
""At this price, we believe the device is a loss-leading product, demonstrating Facebook's desire to simultaneously drive greater adoption of virtual reality and capture a larger share of the market,"" said Leo Gebbie from the consultancy CCS Insight.
""We fear that rivals like HTC will not be able to keep pace with Facebook's aggressive approach.""
But another industry-watcher had doubts that this represented VR's breakthrough moment.
""The upgraded image quality is important, but this is still a stepping stone, an incremental step towards mass adoption,"" commented Kevin Joyce from the VR consultancy Tiny Brains.
""The Quest still needs to come further down in size and weight, and the graphics are still what you would have got from a console two generations ago.
""But Facebook is steadily paving the way for VR to go mainstream with what is a very calculated effort.""
One challenge facing the firm is that it remains difficult to convey the appeal of VR until a person tries it, which is challenging at a time Covid-19 prevents stores putting out headsets to test.
Another is suspicion of Facebook itself after a series of privacy scandals.
A number of existing owners have suggested they will ditch the platform because of its insistence they use Facebook logins with the headsets rather than a separate system.
The Quest 2 will be released on 13 October.
Oculus Quest headsets have sold out within hours of coming into stock for most of 2020.
But while the coronavirus pandemic may have made the tech more appealing to consumers living under lockdown, it also constrained Facebook's ability to order more from its suppliers.
""Shipment volumes across the VR sector are still extremely low compared to many other categories, and for now gaming is still the only category driving sales of the products,"" commented Francisco Jeronimo from the research firm IDC.
A deal with Ubisoft to create made-for-VR entries in the Assassin's Creed and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series that will run natively on the Quest should add to its appeal.
Until now, many of the games on offer have been from smaller independent studios working with relatively low budgets.
Facebook said it would also soon release a multiplayer version of its rhythm-based game Beat Saber, which is already one of the Quest's most popular titles, along with an expansion pack featuring the K-pop band BTS.
It also showed off the latest footage from Population: One - a Fortnite-like battle royale shooter designed for VR, which has already been years in development.
It is also making it easier to link the machine up to a PC to play titles off a more powerful computer, and would soon support gameplay at up to 90 frames per second.
But the company is also looking beyond gaming, and showed off a concept it called Infinite Office.
This allows people to enter a huge virtual working space where they can run multiple screens of all sizes. And it said it was working with Logitech to develop a physical keyboard that would work in VR.
Facebook said that it was also continuing to work on augmented reality glasses, which will overlay graphics over a view of the real world.
It now calls the initiative Project Aria and said a few hundred of its staff would soon be equipped with prototypes to collect data while moving within their homes, Facebook's offices and in public spaces.
**By Simon Hancock, BBC Click's Editor**
Unboxing the previous Quest was the first time I really had the feeling that VR was at last ready for consumers.
A sleek looking bit of kit, from top to bottom everything just worked. All it needed now were some users.
While the second generation's improvements in processor, storage and display resolution will be appreciated by those already active in the area, it is the pricing - the cost of a low-end smartphone - and blockbuster gaming tie-ups that Facebook hope will win it new eyeballs.
In the year of big console launches the question is whether even this ultra-aggressive pricing strategy will turn enough heads.
But if any supply chain issues beset the PS5 or new Xbox series, you can be sure the Quest 2 is ready to make some very real in-roads into the gaming market."

"Promising to “clear the rubble” of corruption within the government, Malawi’s new president is beginning his term by raising the country’s minimum wage in an attempt to win over both doubters and international donors. In an interview with the Guardian, Lazarus Chakwera, who won a historic victory over Peter Mutharika in June, urged Malawians to trust that he will deliver on his promises.  “We’ve just hit the ground running. We are really looking at setting up systems and making sure they are functional. Like I say in my inaugural address, part of what we have to do is to clear the rubble,” he said. Since taking office, Chakwera, 65, has launched investigations into some of the deals agreed by the previous government, suspending contracts. Police have arrested Mutharika’s bodyguard, Norman Chisale, and deputy commissioner general for Malawi’s revenue authority, Roza Mbilizi, in connection with a cement deal. Mbilizi has been fired. Meanwhile, a number of police officers and former government officials have been arrested over allegations of violent conduct. Chakwera won a decisive 59% of the vote, the first time an incumbent president in Africa was beaten by the opposition after a court-ordered rerun. Judges in February overturned the result of the May 2019 election, won by Mutharika, citing evidence of irregularities. Business tycoon Thom Mpinganjira is currently on bail facing charges of attempting to bribe judges to rule in favour of the Democratic Progressive party. Mpinganjira denies any wrongdoing. Chakwera, a former Pentecostal church leader, says he does not want to be seen to target political rivals in his anti-corruption drive. Instead, he said: “We want to create an environment in which every institution functions freely, independently, and we are doing that. “We want to make sure that the ministries have benchmarks and we’re in the process of doing that. We want to make sure that we liaise with those who are in the public service in terms of what reforms are needed, and that process has started well.” He added: “I want institutions to be able to do their job freely, investigate, and if they do have evidence of whatever has been stolen, then they should follow whatever the law says.” Chakwera has been criticised for the makeup of his cabinet, 70% of whom are from the country’s central region, the president’s home turf. It includes six ministers who are related – although not to the president. But Chakwera hopes his provisional budget will win over doubters. About 3.5 million smallholder farmers will benefit from a proposed government-subsidised fertiliser programme which will see the cost of 50kg of fertiliser slashed from about 18,300 Malawian kwacha (£20) to MK4,495 (about £5). The tax-free threshold will also be raised and the minimum wage increased, although both are subject to parliamentary approval next year. An initiative started under the previous government to encourage more women and young people to start businesses will be expanded. More money will be allocated to the scheme to support the creation of 200,000 businesses, in turn expected to generate more than 600,000 jobs. Chakwera comes to power as Malawi grapples with Covid-19. Chakwera said he was talking to UK-based Zimbabwean billionaire businessman and philanthropist Strive Masiyiwa, who has promised to provide ventilators and investment. “This is a serious challenge,” Chakwera said, one that he is quick to point out could affect his ability to keep his promises in the short term. Chakwera also needs to garner the support of international donors. About half of Malawi’s population are below the poverty line, while about 20% are described as “extremely poor”. Heavily reliant on agriculture, which employs 80% of the population, the economy is vulnerable to the climate crisis. The previous government enjoyed close ties with China. Malawi has a sports stadium, a five-star hotel, roads, a parliament building and a grand shopping mall, thanks to loans and grants from Beijing. Chakwera could not be drawn on whether he will continue to foster the relationship but said he is willing to work with any country that shares his vision. “We have programmes aimed at empowering youths, women and smallholder farmers so that they get out of subsistence living. We will lay them before the development partners and those who want to support that vision, they are free,” he said. “We realise the responsibility for developing this nation lies in our hands. So that vision is my policy. Let partners be there, let them come and help.” He added: “My plea and prayer is that people would give us a chance and trust us and let us do what we believe is best. But they [must] also speak about where they think we can do better, and that relationship will enhance our ability to serve Malawians a lot better. “We will like to ensure that our democratic principles should give Malawians the dignity and development they deserve, because these two things must speak to each other, and have the vibrant society where people are able to prosper.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate skeptic book “The Neglected Sun” by German scientists Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt is now
available in paperback
. Geologist George Devries Klein has published a book review at the blog of the Heartland Institute:
In both my opinion and experience, this book is by far the best book I have encountered and read on the issue of climate change and anthropogenic global warming. Anyone interested in this topic should read a copy. It’s that definitive.
The book is a translation of the German version, Der Kalte Sonne, published in 2012. Thus, some of the policy discussions are set in a German context. They do provide a glimpse of what could happen if similar policies are adopted elsewhere as one sees today in the UK.
Here are some critical things I learned from the book (this is an incomplete list):

The sun, including its magnetic cycles, and inner dynamics, exerts the major control on climate variability and climate change.


Six different cycles of solar activity are documented. The climate history of the earth, including the last 150 years, correlate closely with these cycles which range from 11 to 2300 years. Moreover, some are amplified long term by Milankovich orbital parameters.


The sun’s quantitative influence on climate change exceeds the influence of anthropogenic CO2, although the authors acknowledge that anthropogenic CO2 has a minor role to play in raising global temperatures (I concur with this interpretation). The supporting arguments are well-buttressed and convincing


The current temperature “Pause” is explained in terms of solar cycles and decreasing solar radiation. Likely, a period of cooling is ahead as solar radiation entering a diminished phase.


Chapters 5 (Has the IPCC really done its homework?), 6 (The misunderstood climate amplifiers), and 7 (A look into the future) provide the most detailed and accurate critique of the UN-IPCC’s reports I have read (I call it a withering dissection). Thus, projected future temperature increases are expected to be much less than the UN-IPCC infers and the climate ‘crisis’ is overblown far too much. These chapters are incisive.


The last two chapters deal with German climate and energy policy. They are instructive because the policies are failing, particularly as electricity costs have skyrocketed since implementation. This is becoming a universal problem.


A trivial (or perhaps not) fact I did not know. Before Angela Merkel became Chancellor of Germany, she was the minister of the environment. It appears she was co-opted by the green movement well before her rise to global prominence.

Summary recommendation: Buy this book. Our future may depend on it.

"As soon as my partner and I completed two weeks’ quarantine after returning from Europe in late March, I went around to visit my mother. We had talked on the phone every day throughout the lockdown, and twice during our quarantine she had defied the warnings against elderly citizens leaving their homes to drive to our place and deliver food parcels. There are images of the pandemic that will forever be part of our cultural memory: the long lines at Centrelink after thousands of Australians lost their jobs; the furious scrambling for goods in the supermarkets; and the desperate faces at the windows of those poor souls in Melbourne’s public estate towers who were sent into cruel and immediate detention when the city lurched haphazardly into a second lockdown.  But every single one of us will have a unique memory that will define the staggering dislocation that we all experienced in 2020. For me, it is my mother standing outside our house. I am at the window, waving at her and mouthing “thank you” for the food. And she is weeping. She so wants to embrace and welcome home her child. Covid-19 still makes that impossible. Negotiations and calculated risks: they become second nature over the period of the pandemic. My mother is 82 years old and the health advice is that she should stay at home. My brother and I argued with her on the phone, explaining that the protocols are for her own good, that her demographic is most at risk. She has read and listened to the advice in the Greek-language media but she decided to continue driving and to do her own shopping while maintaining the rigours of social distancing and sanitation. After my third attempt to convince her to stay home, she snapped at me. “I refuse to be a prisoner. Let the Lord take me if He wants. I need to breathe!” She pleaded with me to visit when I was free from quarantine. I drove over to her house and we sat at opposite ends of her kitchen table. At one point, as we were deep in discussion, she leaned forward and I gauged that it was her instinct to touch my hand. I sprang back in my seat, knocking the chair against the wall. “My Lord,” she exclaimed, hugging herself tight as if to rein in the humanity of her impulses, “I’ve lived through hunger and occupation and civil war but even in the worst of times we were allowed to touch, we were allowed to hug each other.” And then, quickly, she crossed herself. “We’re lucky,” she said. “We’re not ill and we’re not homeless. Let’s be thankful for that.” That afternoon she asked me about being in the UK as the whole world stumbled punch-drunk into lockdown. I tried to describe the astonishing disorientation we experienced while navigating the crowds at Heathrow, Dubai and Melbourne airports. For the first time in my life I was disturbed by the cavalier assumption so many of us had that there was nothing extraordinary in assuming the right to air travel. We were women and men. We were young and old. We were black and brown and Asian and white. And we were from across the globe. Why were we all taking this miracle of flight for granted? I made her laugh when I described the young woman sitting next to me at the back of the economy section. That woman was cheerful and loquacious, but from time to time was wracked by a terrible cough, and she would huddle herself into a ball to make sure she coughed into her armpit. At one point, seeing her distress and her guilt, I tapped her on the shoulder and pointed around the crammed cabin: people in line waiting for the toilets, a mother nursing her crying child, the harried stewards trying to navigate the meal trolleys in the narrow aisles that made nonsense of the pilot’s takeoff pleas for maintaining social distancing. “It’s OK, if there’s Covid on this flight, we’re all going to get it.” My mother and I both laughed. “Who knows when I will fly again?” My mother shrugged at my question, and then, turning, she pointed to the myriad postcards Blu-Tacked on the kitchen cupboard doors that I had sent her over the years. India and Mexico, Turkey and Jordan and Spain, New York and Tokyo and Paris. “You’ve travelled enough.” It wasn’t an admonishment; it was a simple statement of fact. My father, who migrated on a ship to Australia in 1955, returned twice to his homeland in Greece. The first time was in the early 1970s to farewell his father who was dying, and the second time was in the early 1990s to bury his mother. It is only recently that I realised the immense financial cost of that first trip back home. My parents were saving up for a new house but, when he received the call that his father was ill, they sat down together and made the decision that it was his duty to return home. Everything else would have to wait. At that point, air travel was a luxury and even though my father organised the cheapest flight possible, one that took him from Melbourne to Manila and from Manila to Karachi and then to Athens, my mother’s recollection was that it still ended up costing $2,000. In 1972, that money would have been a sizeable deposit on a house. It was not conceivable that we could go as a family. My parents were labourers in inner-city factories. The costs would have been prohibitive. In the nearly 50 years that my parents were married, they never flew on a holiday together. I looked at the postcards in my mother’s kitchen, those pretty vistas of Europe and Asia and the Americas, and I felt shame. For most Australians, two events will clearly define 2020, and they are events imbued with an atavistic, biblical solemnity: fire and plague. The new year began with the catastrophic fires that destroyed lives, communities, towns and forests all down the eastern seaboard of Australia. Yet, amid the distress and mourning, the evaluation and the taking stock, I found myself hopeful. I travelled up to the New South Wales south coast and was humbled by seeing a large group of firefighters emerge from a smouldering forest, their faces scorched by the detritus. They were heroic and they were noble, and I didn’t give a damn whether they individually voted Labor or Coalition, Shooters party or Greens. And there were so many people wanting to contribute money, assistance and resources to those most affected by the fires. These expressions of unity and goodwill, of compassion and sorrow, seemed to cut across the ugliness of partisanship and hectoring outrage that has defined our politics for so long. It even seemed possible that, after a decade of political bickering and inertia, we would finally as a nation take definitive steps to address climate change. When I reflect on that time in January – only a few months ago, but the subsequent arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic makes it seem like another age – I realise that my optimism was naive. The idiocies of rightwing culture wars and the equal absurdity of leftwing identity politics soon re-emerged to clog the sewerage that is social media. Nevertheless, there was something undeniably sobering for all of us in acknowledging the terror caused by the fires. We had to contemplate tragedy. There are many Australians who have known tragedy already: generations of refugees and migrants who fled wars and dictatorships to create new lives in this country; and the First Australians, engaged in the too-long struggle to unshackle themselves from the bondage of dispossession. There is individual tragedy, too, of course: the loss of a child or the loss of a partner. But it has been a long time since we have faced tragedy collectively. The fire and the plague are a call and response, a motif I borrow from music, but which seems to me appropriate for this time. The bushfires of last summer and the pandemic of this present moment are two distinct phenomena. Yet they have occurred in a specific moment in time when accelerating globalisation has undermined the centuries-old legitimacy of the nation-state. These historic forces have bound together the fires and the pandemic. But the fire and the plague have disrupted the exultant progress of globalisation. Most of us understand that combating climate change requires an international response. The severity of the fires also made us understand that a continent such as Australia will face unique challenges from a warming climate. And if you were stuck in an airport in mid-March, as the immensity of the Covid-19 crisis dawned on the whole of the world, as you tried desperately to plead for a ticket on a flight back home, you would have realised that no other element to your identity was as important as the stamp on your passport. I was in Europe but my Greek heritage mattered naught. Borders were slamming shut at breathless speed. Fuck off back to where you came from. The messaging was as succinct and as clear as that. The shame I experienced looking at the postcards I sent my parents was ignited on that wretched return flight home from Dubai to Melbourne. Looking around at that overcrowded cabin, I recognised that, for all my smug self-belief that I was on the winning side of history when it came to climate change, the many flights that I have taken over the last few decades – from Melbourne to the world, from Melbourne to Sydney, to Brisbane, to Alice Springs, to Perth – have contributed so much more to carbon emissions than if I had been living in an air-conditioned McMansion at the outer suburban edge of my city. Call and response. One voice declares, “I am righteous and cosmopolitan and a compassionate citizen of the world.” The other voice rises and asks, “Who the hell are you to throw the first stone?” There is a cohort of my friends – people I love and adore, with whom I have partied and worked and cried – who sometimes lament my allegiance to family. Strongly feminist and proudly progressive, they are suspicious that my respect for family tilts me towards conservatism. They are probably right. The last few months I have been describing myself as a conservative socialist, wary of the moral shapeshifting required from contemporary progressivism. The importance of family for me clearly has to do with the symbolic and material consequences of my parents’ migrations. In leaving their country at a time of war and poverty, in forging a new life in a new country in which they did not speak the language and which was on the other side of the earth, my mother and my father endured hardships that are inconceivable to a soft generation like my own. Their call is sacrifice. My response has to be gratitude. But it isn’t only about migration. It also has to do with class. My father’s knees were destroyed by the long years on assembly lines, as were my mother’s wrists. Soon after coming out of quarantine I caught up with an elder distant relative. She has spent her life here in Australia, working in factories and in retail and as a cleaner, and though she admits that she never reads – the literary world is another planet for her – she has always expressed pride in my being a writer. Seeing her again, we spoke of the fires and we spoke of the pandemic. She’s never asked anything of me. But she did this time. We spoke of what the world was like before Covid-19 and she sighed and said, “It’s hard. There’s no security in the work my children do, everything is too expensive, and there’s no faith in politics.” We both lamented the pace of globalisation. And then, shrugging, I said, only rhetorically, “What can any of us do?” That’s when she said, “There’s nothing I can do, Christo. But you’re a writer and you have a voice. Tell them how hard globalisation is for us. Tell them we need industries and jobs in this country. Tell them we need a future and tell them we need dignity.” Her call. My response? A few weeks ago, before Melbourne went into a second lockdown, I dared to catch a tram again. I had my hand sanitiser in my jacket pocket, I made sure to wear gloves. Behind me were three young women, VCE students from the inner-city high school down the road. They started discussing the Black Lives Matter rally they had all attended the week before. My ears pricked up. For one brief moment, I had contemplated going to the protest. If I’m truly honest, not for the murder of George Floyd. That murder was sickening and wretched and unjust; but it happened in the US and if this pandemic has taught me anything it is that, contrary to a belief that I myself have espoused in the past, we are not the US. Thankfully, we are not the US. But the unconscionable rate of incarceration of Indigenous people and the continuing blight of Aboriginal deaths in custody gave the rallies in Australia a clear moral purpose. However, I knew that if I did attend, I would immediately choose to return to a fortnight’s quarantine. Given my responsibilities to my mother, and given that my partner’s mother is also elderly, I decided against going. The young students were passionate about anti-racism, and they dropped the word “privilege” a few times. But very soon their conversation turned to how Covid-19 had ruined their plans for schoolies week. They had been planning to fly up to Byron Bay but that now seemed impossible. “It’s so unfair,” one of them sighed. Did I speak up? Of course I didn’t. I remember being young. But I thought of the many gifts my parents had given me: the gifts of patience, of compassion, of sacrifice. I realise now that one of the greatest gifts I received from them is the gift of gratefulness. My mother crosses herself and declares, “We’re not ill and we’re not homeless. Let’s be thankful for that.” It was in the interplay between gratitude and the responsibilities that ensue from that understanding that my ethics and my politics were formed. That gift is my bedrock. I recall the faces of the weary, dirty firefighters emerging from the scorched bush at the start of this calamitous year. I remember the chaos at the airports in March and my dawning realisation that our reckless indulgence in travel might be over. I think of that pretty row of postcards. So, my response to this year of plague and of fire is to offer you the gifts my parents gave me: now is the time for patience, for compassion, for gratitude. Now is the time for sacrifice. • This essay will be part of the anthology Fire, Flood and Plague, edited by Sophie Cunningham and published by Penguin Random House in December"

From Purdue University , a press release related to tornado activity without any mention of a climate change link.
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Significant tornado outbreaks and especially strong tornadoes are more likely occur within periods of activity lasting three or more days, according to a Purdue University tornado expert. 
Jeff Trapp, a professor of earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences, examined 30 years of U.S. weather records and found that an outbreak of 20 or more reported tornadoes had a 74 percent probability of occurring during a period of tornado activity lasting three or more days. During those same periods, a tornado rated 3 or higher on the Enhanced Fujita scale had a 60 percent probability of hitting.
The Enhanced Fujita scale rates tornadoes from EF0 to EF5 with damage rated as “light,” including broken branches and windblown signs, to “incredible,” including leveling of strong-frame houses.
“Two extreme tornado events last year led to 32 deaths, injured more than 377 and cost $2 billion in damage and inspired this study,” Trapp said. “Unfortunately, the devastating tornadoes these past few days, tragically, seem to be bearing out the results.”
Tornadoes swept through Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa and Mississippi on Sunday (April 27); Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee on Monday (April 28); and North Carolina on Tuesday (April 29). The National Weather Service received 100 preliminary tornado reports for April 27 and 28, and multiple deaths have been attributed to the violent storm system.
Trapp also found the multiple-day periods were more likely to occur during the warm months of April through July.
“The encouraging news is that the larger, more slowly evolving and moving systems that appear to contribute to multiple-day tornado periods may be more predictable,” he said. “The weather system responsible for the tornadoes this week falls in this category and was revealed in the forecast models at least five days in advance with good fidelity.”
Trapp examined tornado activity entered into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s historical record of tornadoes in the United States from 1983-2012, which included 3,129 tornado days and 1,406 unique periods of tornado activity. Multiple-day periods made up 24 percent of the unique periods of activity.
A paper detailing his study and the results was published in the April issue of the journal Monthly Weather Review and is available online.
The idea for the research began while Trapp was participating as a lead investigator in the National Science Foundation’s Mesoscale Predictability Experiment (MPEX), a national field project to improve predictions of severe weather.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith 20 academics sending a letter to the US Department of Justice, it’s highly ironic how those who are totally wrong (see chart) are demanding a criminal investigation of those who are correct!

Original chart: John Christy, U of Alabama.
I asked veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi of Weatherbell Analytics to comment on the news of these seemingly fanatic academics demanding the US federal government step in and suppress scientific dissent. Here’s what he sent.
Joe Bastardi’s commentary:

The people that have penned this despotic missive, which sad to say, has a chance to carry weight, should identify directly who this is targeted at. Who are the people taking all this money, for I know of no one this applies too?
It reeks of paranoia, creating a shadowy strawman argument, in an attempt to silence dissent. This is siimilar to lawsuits that have tied people up in courts for years, an attempt to intimidate into silence anyone that dares speak up against their position. I noted with great interest that I could find no signee who has to make global forecasts on a daily basis where their livelihood depended on actually BEING RIGHT, where if they are not right they get fired. Not one.
In addition, given the amount of money that has been allocated to the promotion of AGW, it can be easily argued that some of the people pushing that issue would not have a job if it wasn’t for their position. My job actually depends on the accuracy of my forecasts. Climate is a major tool for getting that forecast right, and so my knowledge of past weather events is needed for my success. If I see something I disagree on, given what I know, I speak up. Nothing more, nothing less.
I fail to see how any of these signees can be objective, given all they have to lose if they are indeed proven wrong by nature itself. That they actually would do such a thing speaks volumes as to their character, which is no different than a bully on the playground, except their playground is other peoples lives and their protected towers from which they seek to dictate their agenda.
I find it rich in that one of the signees, Alan Robock, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, appears to have been to Cuba twice to yuck it up with Fidel Castro, a master at silencing those who dare dissent to his ideas. Maybe that is where he is getting his ideas, from the man who claimed in 1963 the US forced hurricane Flora to stall over his island in an attempt to wipe him out.”

In a world aflame, religious minorities are among those who suffer most. Pakistan is notable for its failure to protect religious liberty, the most basic right of conscience.   
  
The State Department recently reported on Pakistan that “The constitution and other laws and policies officially restrict religious freedom and, in practice, the government enforced many of these restrictions. The government’s respect for and protection of the right to religious freedom continued to be poor.”   
  
Minority faiths frequently face violent attack. Although Islamabad does not launch these assaults, it does little to prevent or redress them. This failure, the State Department explained, “allowed the climate of impunity to continue.”   
  
The most common tool of persecution may be the charge of blasphemy which, explained the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, is used to “target members of religious minority communities and dissenting Muslims and frequently result in imprisonment.” The blasphemy laws are made for abuse: “The so-called crime carries the death penalty or life in prison, does not require proof of intent or evidence to be presented after allegations are made, and does not include penalties for false allegations.”   
  
With evidence unnecessary, the charge is routinely used in personal and business disputes. Penalties are not limited to the law. Since 1990, at least 52 people charged with blasphemy have been killed before reaching trial.



Judges who acquitted defendants and politicians who talked of reforming the blasphemy laws also have been assassinated. In May, gunmen killed a human rights lawyer who was defending a professor accused of blasphemy.   
  
Although Pakistan is not alone in punishing religious free speech, it has jailed more people for blasphemy than any other nation. The group Freedom House published a detailed report on the detrimental impact of blasphemy laws: these measures “impose undue restrictions on freedom of expression” and are “prone to arbitrary or overly broad application, particularly in settings where there are no checks and balances in place to prevent abuses.”   
  
Pakistan originally respected religious liberty. Alas, the government of dictator Mohammed Zia ul-Haq not only criminalized blasphemy, but, as Freedom House noted, also imposed “harsh Shari’a punishments for extramarital sex, theft, and violations of the prohibition of alcohol.”   
  
The impact of such laws fell most heavily on religious minorities and liberals. Again, Freedom House: “it is clear that Pakistan’s blasphemy laws are used politically and applied disproportionately to non-Muslims. Although many other countries have laws against blasphemy, the situation in Pakistan is unique in its severity and its particular effects on religious minorities.”   
  
Unfortunately, there are spillover impacts from abusive blasphemy prosecutions. Freedom House warned: “Pakistan’s blasphemy laws foster an environment of intolerance and impunity, and lead to violations of a broad range of human rights, including the obvious rights to freedom of expression and freedom of religion, as well as freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention; the right to due process and a fair trial; freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment; and the right to life and security of the person.”   
  
Obviously, there is little the United States can do directly about policy in Pakistan. However, the International Religious Freedom Act empowers the State Department to designate countries as Countries of Particular Concern.   
  
As I noted in my latest _Forbes_ online column: “A state which fails to protect the right of individuals to respond to their belief (or unbelief) in God is more likely to leave other essential liberties unprotected. And a society in which life and dignity of the human person is not respected is more likely to become a hothouse to hostile ideas and beliefs, "" which we see in Pakistan today. Rising religious extremism, exemplified by abusive blasphemy prosecutions, threatens the integrity of the Pakistani state and thus the security of its nuclear program.   
  
Although Americans cannot control policy in Pakistan, they can help highlight a problem that threatens people in that nation and ultimately others around the world.

"Apple has pledged to become a carbon-neutral operation by 2030, a commitment that covers its entire supply chain and the lifecycle of all its products, including the electricity consumed in their use. The company is aiming to achieve the goal by means including: Low-carbon product design, using recycled materials where possible, and developing new techniques such as a carbon-free aluminium smelting process. Use of renewable energy, including projects funded by and built for Apple directly, which in total provide 1GW of capacity to the company’s corporate operations. Carbon removal, through forest planting in Colombia, China, Kenya and the US. The chief executive, Tim Cook, said: “The innovations powering our environmental journey are not only good for the planet, they’ve helped us make our products more energy-efficient and bring new sources of clean energy online around the world. “Climate action can be the foundation for a new era of innovative potential, job creation, and durable economic growth. With our commitment to carbon neutrality, we hope to be a ripple in the pond that creates a much larger change.” The majority of the progress, Apple says in its 2020 environmental progress report, will be made by cutting its carbon emissions directly. But the last 25% will come from “carbon removal solutions” such as forest planting and mangrove swamp restoration. The company is investing some of a recently announced $100m (£78.5m) fund for a racial equity and justice initiative on minority-owned businesses that can help clean up its supply chain. “Systemic racism and climate change are not separate issues and they will not abide separate solutions,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s environmental lead. In January, Microsoft announced a plan to become carbon-negative – removing more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere than it emits – by 2030, and a goal of erasing all of its historical emissions by 2050. In doing so, the company committed to deploying carbon capture and sequestration technology, a more hi-tech – but untested – approach than tree planting."

It is a great pleasure to have been invited to share my views concerning “Trade Promotion Agencies and U.S. Foreign Policy” with the subcommittee. The invitation asked that I provide thoughts on three broad — and broadly related — topics:



Before providing some thoughts on those topics, I would like to applaud the subcommittee for taking up these important issues in a public hearing. Committed oversight of the executive branch by the legislative branch is crucial to our system of checks and balances, which must remain functionally robust to ensure the health of our constitutional republic and protect it from even the most subtle encroachments.



Congress, the president, and the public have turned their attention to so‐​called trade promotion agencies in recent years, as there have been (and continue to be) reauthorization and funding battles; renewed, post‐​recession focus on export growth beginning with the announcement by President Obama in 2010 of his National Export Initiative; and, on‐​again‐​off‐​again efforts to consolidate, streamline, or simplify the maze of U.S. federal agencies that seem to have some overlapping responsibilities, functions, and missions with respect to trade policy.



To the extent that today’s hearing will help clarify some of these issues and prompt a serious effort to reform and retire some of the redundant, distortionary, and, frankly, scandal‐​prone agencies among the panoply of federal offerings, I am pleased to be of assistance.



 **The General Folly of Export Promotion Programs**  
Let me begin by offering some clarity about what is meant by “trade promotion” in Washington. Whereas trade includes both the selling to foreigners (exports) and purchasing from foreigners (imports) of goods and services, trade promotion is exclusively about promoting exports. There are no federal programs devoted to import promotion and, in Washington, the benefits of exports are what most people have in mind when they talk about the benefits of trade. U.S. trade promotion agencies are in the business of promoting exports, not trade in the more inclusive sense.



That is worth noting because despite some of the wrongheaded mercantilist presumptions undergirding U.S. trade policy — that exports are good, imports are bad, the trade account is the scoreboard, and our trade deficit means that the United States is losing at trade — the economic fact of the matter is that the real benefits of trade are transmitted through imports, not through exports. As Milton Friedman used to say: imports are the goods and services we get to consume without having to produce; exports are the goods and services we produce, but don’t get to consume.



The purpose of exchange is to enable each of us to focus on what we do best. By specializing in an occupation — instead of allocating small portions of our time to producing each of the necessities and luxuries we wish to consume — and exchanging the monetized output we produce most efficiently for the goods and services we produce less efficiently, we are able to produce and, thus, consume more output than would be the case if we didn’t specialize and trade. By extension, the larger the size of the market, the greater is the scope for specialization, exchange, and economic growth.



When we transact at the local supermarket or hardware store, we seek to maximize the value we obtain by getting the most for our dollars. In other words, we want to import more value from the local merchant than we wish to export. In our daily transactions, we seek to run personal trade deficits. But when it comes to trading across borders or when our individual transactions are aggregated at the national level, we forget these basics principles and assume the goal of exchange is to achieve a trade surplus. But, as Adam Smith famously observed: “What is prudence in the conduct of every private family, can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom.”



The benefits of trade come from imports, which deliver more competition, greater variety, lower prices, better quality, and innovation. Arguably, opening foreign markets should be an aim of trade policy because larger markets allow for greater specialization and economies of scale, but real free trade requires liberalization at home. The real benefits of trade are measured by the value of imports that can be purchased with a unit of exports — the so‐​called terms of trade. Trade barriers at home raise the costs and reduce the amount of imports that can be purchased with a unit of exports. Yet, holding firm to those domestic barriers while insisting that foreign markets open wider is both the U.S. trade negotiating strategy and the rationale for the existence of our export promotion agencies.



Nowhere among the web of federal agencies is import promotion found to be a program objective or mission. In Washington, “import” is a four‐​letter word. Whereas exports are associated with increased economic output and job creation, imports are presumed to cause economic contraction and job loss. But that is demonstrably false.



The first1 of the two charts below plots manual changes in imports and annual changes in GDP for 44 years. If imports caused economic contraction, we would expect to see most of the observations in the upper left and lower right quadrants — depicting an inverse relationship. Instead, we see a strong positive relationship. In 43 of 44 years, imports and GDP moved in the same direction.





The second2 chart plots annual changes in imports and U.S. employment. Similarly, there is a fairly strong positive relationship between these variables, as well.





In keeping with the conventional Washington wisdom that exports are Team America’s points and imports are the foreign team’s points, in his January 2010 State of the Union address President Obama set a national goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years. That goal was subsequently enshrined as the “National Export Initiative,” which decreed establishment of an Export Promotion Cabinet “to develop and coordinate the implementation of the NEI.” Six months later, the new cabinet produced its recommendations in a 68‐​page report titled “The Export Promotion Cabinet’s Plan for Doubling U.S. Exports in Five Years,” which became the centerpiece of the administration’s trade policy agenda.



Though the NEI missed its target of $3.14 trillion of annual exports by the end of 2014, some of its objectives were laudably atypical of the average five‐​year plan. For example, the goal of clarifying, simplifying, and streamlining U.S. export control procedures — though unattained — offered the promise of reducing regulatory obstacles and spurring meaningful export growth without imposing new burdens or diverting resources from elsewhere in the economy. Likewise, the goal of passing long‐​pending bilateral trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama (which was achieved), and concluding the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership negotiations (which is in progress) to reduce trade barriers were worthy components of the NEI.



But most prominent in the plan was a larger role for government in promoting exports, including expanded non‐​market lending programs to finance export activity, an increase in the number of the Commerce Department’s foreign outposts to promote U.S. business, an increase in federal agency‐​chaperoned marketing trips, and other sundry subsidies for export‐​oriented business activities. U.S. trade promotion agencies suddenly had more prominent roles to play.



Shortsightedly, the NEI systemically neglected a broad swath of opportunities to facilitate exports by contemplating only the export‐​focused activities of exporters. The NEI presumed that the only barriers impeding U.S. exporters were foreign made. But before companies become exporters, they are producers. And as producers, they are subject to a host of domestic laws, regulations, taxes, and other policies that handicap them in their competition for sales in the U.S. market and abroad.



For example, nearly 60 percent of the value of U.S. imports in 2014 comprised of intermediate goods, capital goods, and other raw materials — the purchases of U.S. businesses, not consumers.3 Yet, many of those imported inputs are subject to customs duties, which raise the cost of production for the U.S.-based companies that need them, making them less competitive at home and abroad. Indeed, U.S. duties on products like sugar, steel, magnesium, polyvinyl chloride, and other crucial manufacturing inputs have chased companies to foreign shores — where those crucial impediments are less expensive — and deterred foreign companies from setting up shop stateside.4



The potential dividends from removing these and other impediments to a more competitive domestic production environment are surely greater than any benefits derived from export promotion.



In the 21st century, it is inaccurate to characterize international trade as a competition between “us” and “them.” Because of foreign direct investment, joint ventures, and other equity‐​sharing arrangements, quite often “we” are “they” and “they” are “we.” And as a result of the proliferation of disaggregated, transnational production and supply chains, “we” and “they” often collaborate in the same endeavor. As trade barriers have diminished, opportunities for new combinations of labor, investment, and human capital have emerged in defiance of what were once formidable obstacles to wealth creation. “Autonomous” or “unilateral” liberalization of trade barriers has accounted for most of the trade liberalization in developing countries over the past two decades and, on average, applied tariff rates globally are well below their maximum allowable rates or “bound” rates under World Trade Organization agreements. Global economic integration has enabled enterprises to flourish on scales unimaginable just a generation ago.



To nurture the promise of our highly integrated global economy, policymakers should stop conflating the interests of exporters with the national interest and commit to policies that reduce frictions throughout the supply chain — from product conception to consumption. Why should U.S. taxpayers underwrite — and U.S. policymakers promote — the interests of exporters, anyway, when the benefits of those efforts accrue, primarily, to the shareholders of the companies enjoying the subsidized marketing or matchmaking? There is no national ownership of private export revenues. And the relationship between revenues (domestic or export) and jobs is today more tenuous than in years past.



Globalization means that companies have growing options with respect to where and how they produce. So governments must compete for investment and talent, which both tend to flow to jurisdictions where the rule of law is clear and abided; where there is greater certainty to the business and political climate; where the specter of asset expropriation is negligible; where physical and administrative infrastructure is in good shape; where the local work force is productive; where there are limited physical, political, and administrative frictions; and so on.



The crucial question for U.S. policymakers is: why not focus on reforms that make the U.S. economy a more attractive location for both domestic and foreign investment?



Relative to attracting domestic investment, export promotion is a circuitous and uncertain path to economic growth and job creation. If policymakers seek a more appropriate target for economic policy, it should be attracting and retaining investment, which is the seed of all economic activity, including exporting.



 **What is the impact on the U.S. economy of U.S. Trade Promotion Agencies, specifically the Export‐​Import bank?**  
According to the Congressional Research Service, there are approximately 20 federal government agencies involved in supporting U.S. exports, either directly or indirectly. Among the nine key agencies with programs or activities directly related to export promotion are the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Small Business Administration, and the three agencies that are the subject of this hearing: the Export‐​Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency.



The mission of the Ex‐​Im is “to support American jobs by facilitating the export of U.S. goods and services.” OPIC’s mission is “to [mobilize] private capital to help solve critical development challenges and in doing so, [advance] U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives.” The U.S. Trade and Development Agency’s mission is to “[help] companies create U.S. jobs through the export of U.S. goods and services for priority development projects in emerging economies.”



Although the three subject agencies have slightly different missions, each uses U.S. export sales supported as its chief success metric. Given the exalted status of exports in Washington’s economic policy narrative, it is understandable why agencies would want to portray themselves as indispensable to U.S. export success. It’s a reasonable survival strategy. But on the metric of contribution to export success, none of these agencies is scarcely relevant. Ex‐​Im supported $27.4 billion in exports in 20145; USTDA supported approximately $2.5 billion6; and, OPIC supported less than $2 billion7.



In aggregate, these three agencies “support” less than 2 percent of all U.S. exports. Of course, $32 billion is nothing to sneeze at, but the implication that most, if not all, of those sales would never have happened in the absence of these federal middlemen agencies is unrealistic. But the relevant economic question is not whether these agencies support U.S. exports. That’s the political question. The relevant economic question concerns the costs and benefits of these agencies to the U.S. economy.



Supporters of Ex‐​Im and OPIC limit their analyses to the impact their agencies’ operations have on taxpayers. In recent years, both programs have generated positive returns to the Treasury, but their myopic focus doesn’t come close to approximating the appropriate cost‐​benefit analysis.



The remainder of these written remarks will be devoted to the Export‐​Import Bank, which I have studied more closely and for which I have recent data. Moreover, the problems identified below are generally problems associated with the other agencies, as well. Namely, while the benefits of each program’s activities are visible (the value of exports supported, projects financed, insurance policies underwritten), the costs imposed on non‐​beneficiaries go unseen — or at least unacknowledged by Ex‐​Im and its supporters. Identifying and quantifying those costs are necessary to measuring the net benefits of the respective programs.



Ex‐​Im supporters claim that the bank fills a void left by private sector lenders unwilling to finance certain riskier transactions and, by doing so, contributes importantly to U.S. export and job growth. Moreover, rather than burden taxpayers, the Bank generates profits for the Treasury, helps small businesses succeed abroad, encourages exports of “green” goods, contributes to development in sub‐​Saharan Africa, and helps “level the playing field” for U.S. companies competing in export markets with foreign companies supported by their own governments’ generous export financing programs. So what’s not to like about Ex‐​Im?



First, by dismissing the risk assessments of private‐​sector, profit‐​maximizing financial firms and making lending decisions based on nonmarket criteria to pursue often opaque, political objectives, Ex‐​Im misallocates resources and puts taxpayer dollars at risk. That Ex‐​Im is currently self‐​financing and generating revenues is entirely beside the point. Ex-Im’s revenue stream depends on whether foreign borrowers are willing and able to service their loans, which is a function of global economic conditions beyond the control of Ex‐​Im. Given the large concentration of aircraft loans in its portfolio, for example, Ex‐​Im is heavily exposed to the consequences of a decline in demand for air travel. Recall that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also showed book profits for years until the housing market suddenly crashed and taxpayers were left holding the bag.



Second, even if taxpayers had tolerance for such risk taking, the claim that Ex‐​Im exists to help small businesses is belied by the fact that most of Ex-Im’s loan portfolio value is concentrated among a handful of large U.S. companies. In 2013, roughly 75 percent of the value of Ex‐​Im loans, guarantees, and insurance were granted on behalf of 10 large companies, including Boeing, General Electric, Dow Chemical, Bechtel, and Caterpillar.



Third, the claim that U.S. exporters need assistance with financing to “level the playing field” with China and others doesn’t square with the fact that the United States is a major export credit subsidizer that has been engaged in doling out such largesse since well before the founding of the People’s Republic of China. It implies the United States is helpless at the task of reining in these subsidies. And it implies the United States lacks enormous advantages among the multitude of factors that inform the purchasing decision. But, somehow, 98 percent of U.S. export value is sold without the assistance of trade promotion agencies.



Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, by trying to “level the playing field” with foreign companies backed by their own governments, Ex‐​Im “unlevels” the playing field for many more U.S. companies competing at home and abroad. This adverse effect has been ignored, downplayed, or mischaracterized, but the collateral damage is substantial and should be a central part of the story.



A proper accounting reveals that Ex-Im’s practices impose significant costs on manufacturing firms across every industry and in every U.S. state. When Ex‐​Im provides financing to a U.S. company’s foreign customer on terms more favorable than he can secure elsewhere, it may be facilitating a transaction that would not otherwise occur. That is the basis for Ex-Im’s claim that it helps the U.S. economy by increasing exports and “supporting” jobs. But the claim is questionable because those resources might have created more value or more jobs if deployed in the private sector instead. If that is the case, Ex-Im’s transaction imposes a net loss on the economy. But suppose it could be demonstrated that Ex‐​Im transactions grow the economy larger or create more jobs than if those resources had been deployed in the private sector instead.



Would Ex‐​Im then be correct in its claim? No. Further analysis is required.



Ex‐​Im financing helps two sets of companies (in the short‐​run): U.S. firms whose export prices are subsidized by below market rate financing and the foreign firms who purchase those subsidized exports. It stands to reason, then, that those same transactions might impose costs on two different sets of companies: competing U.S. firms in the same industry who do not get Ex‐​Im backing, and U.S. firms in downstream industries, whose foreign competition is now benefiting from reduced capital costs courtesy of U.S. government subsidies. While Ex‐​Im financing reduces the cost of doing business for the lucky U.S. exporter and reduces the cost of capital for his foreign customer, it hurts U.S. competitors of the U.S. exporter, as well as U.S. competitors of his foreign customer by putting them at relative cost disadvantages.



These effects are neither theoretical nor difficult to comprehend. Yet proponents of Ex‐​Im reauthorization rarely acknowledge, let alone concede, that these are real costs pertinent to any legitimate net benefits calculation. Instead, they speak only of the gross benefits of export subsidies, which they consider to be the value of exports supported by their authorizations.



But there are at least three sets of costs that are essential to determining the net benefits of Ex‐​Im:



Opportunity Cost is difficult to estimate, but suffice it to recognize that opportunity costs exist. Indeed, opportunity costs exist whenever there are foregone alternatives to the path chosen.



The Intra‐​Industry Cost is somewhat easier to calculate, in theory. If Ex‐​Im provides a $50 million loan to a foreign farm equipment manufacturer to purchase steel from U.S. Steel Corporation, the transaction may benefit U.S. Steel, but it hurts competitors like Nucor, Steel Dynamics, AK Steel, and dozens of other steel firms operating in the United States and competing for the same customers at home and abroad. The $50 million subsidy to U.S. Steel is a cost to the other firms in the industry, who can attribute a $50 million revenue gap between them (aggregated) and U.S. Steel to a government intervention that picked a winner and made them, relatively speaking, losers. The $50 million “benefit” for U.S. Steel is a $50 million cost to the other steel firms.



But then that distortion is compounded when taking into consideration the dynamics that would have played out had the best firm — the one offering the most value for the best price — secured that export deal instead. Reaching revenue targets, raising capital, and moving down the production cost curve to generate lower unit costs all become more difficult to achieve on account of the original intervention, amplifying the adverse impact on other firms in the industry.



When government intervenes with subsidies that tilt the playing field in favor of a particular firm, it simultaneously penalizes the other firms in the industry and changes the competitive industry dynamics going forward. Every Ex‐​Im transaction touted as boosting U.S. exports creates victims within the same U.S. industry. Without Ex-Im’s intervention, Nucor might have been able to win that foreign farm equipment producer’s business, which is a prospect that undermines the premise that Ex‐​Im boosts exports at all and reinforces the point that it merely shifts resources around without creating value, possibly destroying value instead. What is given to U.S. steel is taken from Nucor and the other firms, among whom may be the more efficient producers.



The Downstream Industry costs are those imposed by the transaction on the U.S. companies that compete with the foreign customer. When a foreign farm machinery producer purchases steel on credit at subsidized interest rates, it obtains an advantage over its competitors — including its U.S. competitors. So, when that subsidized rate comes courtesy of a U.S. government program committed to increasing U.S. exports, it only seems reasonable to consider the effects on firms in downstream U.S. industries before claiming the program a success: Has the subsidy to the foreign farm machinery producer made John Deere, Caterpillar, New Holland, or other U.S. farm machinery producers less competitive? Has it hurt their bottom lines?



Delta Airlines has been vocal in its objection to Ex‐​Im‐​facilitated sales of Boeing jetliners to foreign carriers, such as Air India. Delta rightly complains that the U.S. government, as a matter of policy, is subsidizing Delta’s foreign competition by reducing Air India’s cost of capital. That cost reduction enables Air India to offer lower prices in its bid to compete for passengers, which has a direct impact on Delta’s bottom line. This is a legitimate concern and it is not limited to this example.



Consider the generic case. A U.S. supplier sells to both U.S. and foreign customers. Those customers compete in the same downstream industry in the U.S. and foreign markets. Ex‐​Im is happy to provide financing to facilitate the sale, as its mission is to increase exports and create jobs. The U.S. supplier is thrilled that Ex‐​Im is providing his foreign customer with cheap credit because it spares him from having to offer a lower price or from sweetening the deal in some other way to win the business. The foreign customer is happy to accept the advantageous financing for a variety of reasons, among which is the fact that his capital costs are now lower relative to what they would have been and relative to the costs of his competitors — including his U.S. competitors, who are now on the outside looking in. Ex‐​Im helps some U.S. companies increase their exports sales. But it hinders other U.S. companies’ efforts to compete at home and abroad.



Moreover, by subsidizing export sales, Ex‐​Im artificially diverts domestic supply, possibly causing U.S. prices to rise and rendering U.S. customers less important to their U.S. suppliers. Especially in industries where there are few producers, numerous customers, and limited substitute products, Ex‐​Im disrupts the relationships between U.S. buyers and U.S. sellers by infusing the latter with greater market power and leverage. Delta was able to connect the dots. Other companies have, too. But most of the time, the downstream U.S. companies are unwitting victims of this silent cost‐​shifting.



According to the findings in a recent Cato Institute study that I authored, the downstream costs alone amount to a tax of approximately $2.8 billion every year.8 The victims of this shell game include companies in each of the 21 broad U.S. manufacturing industry classifications used by the government to compile statistics. And they are scattered across the country in every state. Among the stealthily taxed were companies such as Western Digital and Seagate Technologies — two California‐​based computer storage device producers that employ 125,000 workers; Chicago‐​based Schneider Electric Holdings, which employs 23,000 workers in the manufacture of environmental control products, and; ViaSystems, a St. Louis‐​based printed circuit board producer with 12,000 employees. These companies haven’t received Ex‐​Im subsidies, but companies in their supplier industries have, which effectively lowers the costs of their foreign competitors.



While it is relatively easy for a big company like Delta to connect the dots and see that Boeing is being favored at its expense (airplanes constitute a large share of Delta’s total costs), most manufacturing companies are unaware that they are shouldering the costs of government subsidies to their own competitors. But the victims include big and small producers — of electrical equipment, appliances, furniture, food, chemicals, computers, electronics, plastics and rubber products, paper, metal, textiles — from across the country. Companies producing telecommunications equipment incur an estimated collective tax of $125 million per year.



The industries in which companies bear the greatest burdens — where the costs of Ex-Im’s subsidies to foreign competitors are the highest — are of vital importance to the manufacturing economies of most states. In Oregon, Delaware, Idaho, New Jersey, Nevada, and Maryland, the 10 industries shouldering the greatest costs account for at least 80 percent of the state’s manufacturing output. The most important industry is among the ten most burdened by these costs in 33 of 50 states. The chemical industry, which bears a cost of $107 million per year, is the largest manufacturing industry in 12 states.



For all the praise Ex‐​Im heaps upon itself for its role as a costless pillar of the economy, it is difficult to make sense of the collateral damage left in its wake. Thousands of U.S. companies would be better off if Ex-Im’s charter were allowed to expire, as scheduled, on June 30.



 **What to do about foreign governments’ trade promotion agencies?**  
Of all of the arguments put forward by Ex‐​Im supporters, the “leveling the playing field” rationale is the most difficult to dispense with. It is appealing intuitively. But the implication that the United States is an innocent party that has no choice but to follow suit is laughable. The United States invented this stuff.



The notion that because Beijing, Brasilia, and Brussels subsidize their exporters Washington must, too, is a rationalization that sweeps under the rug the fact that there are dozens of criteria that feed into the ultimate purchasing decision, including product quality, price, producer’s reputation, local investment and employment opportunities created by the sale, warranties, aftermarket servicing, and the extent to which the transaction contributes toward building a long‐​term relationship between buyer and seller. To say that U.S. exporters need assistance with financing to “level the playing field” suggests that they lack advantages among the multitude of factors that inform the purchasing decision. Moreover, the fact that less than 2 percent of U.S. export value goes through export promotion agencies suggests this rationale for Ex‐​Im is bogus. If the offer of cheap financing is the determining factor in these international transactions, what is to stop a growing number of inefficient low‐​quality producers from contesting these markets with ever‐​increasing subsidies from their own governments? U.S. companies and the taxpayers that would support them would be better off not competing for business in these markets if the key to winning foreign customers is participating in an endless subsidies race.



There is a way to end the madness. The United States should allow Ex‐​Im to expire at the end of next month and then announce plans to bring cases to the World Trade Organization against governments operating their export credit agencies in violation of agreed‐​upon limits under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The combination of the carrot of U.S. withdrawal from the business of export credit financing and the stick of WTO litigation would likely incent other governments to reduce, and possibly eliminate, their own subsidy programs.



 **The Relationship between the Export‐​Import Bank and U.S. foreign policy**  
For better or worse, at different times and for different purposes over the years, U.S. trade policy has been a tool of U.S. foreign policy. Trade preference programs, trade agreements, the TransPacific Partnership, investment treaties, trade sanctions, infrastructure funding, and trade financing have all been pursued or deployed for reasons not entirely economic in nature.



Pursuing strategic objectives through trade policy has a long history. Certainly, one of the rationales for preserving the Export‐​Import Bank is that it provides the U.S. government some leverage to influence policies or actions abroad and to monitor and possibly counter strategic investments underwritten by other foreign governments. That may be true. And there may be convincing evidence to demonstrate that these considerations warrant one or two export promotion agencies. But there are at least 20 such agencies within the U.S. government with overlapping responsibilities and, in some cases, working at cross purposes.



Despite the rhetoric of U.S. decline, the United States maintains enormous commercial advantages over other countries. We have the world’s largest market; strong institutions, including respect for private property and the rule of law; relatively free markets; a highly educated and productive workforce; the world’s best research institutions; a society that encourages innovation and produces deep and broad capital markets to fund it. From these commercial advantages comes security and strength, so it is important that we maintain and build on those advantages.



By subsidizing the export sales of generally large U.S. multinational corporations, Ex-Im’s policies penalize the smaller, dynamic, up‐​and‐​coming businesses that are the well springs of new ideas, better mousetraps, and smarter business practices that will spawn subsequent generations of businesses in perpetuity. That process underlies the strength of the U.S. economy, which is crucial to reaching U.S. security and foreign policy goals going forward. On the other hand, U.S. economic strength is undermined when subsidies are deployed in a spiraling race with other nations to the detriment of the next crop of leading U.S. businesses.

“Market failure” is a common justification for new government policies. Proponents of interventions love to point to instances of apparently imperfect markets and assume that government taxation, subsidies, and regulation can seamlessly perfect them, thus maximizing social welfare.



Academic economists have long doubted this way of thinking. Comparing market outcomes to some unattainable and unidentifiable ideal is not useful in a world of imperfect knowledge and government failure. It is far better to compare outcomes from an intervention against actual realistic alternatives. Yet public debate often seems stuck on this rudimentary understanding of what market failure is and how it should be dealt with.



Worse, in many instances this basic framework of market failure is misused, leading to misguided policies. Government services, for example, are often labeled public goods even when they do not fulfill economists’ definition of public goods as being nonrivalrous and nonexcludable, and in situations where markets have clearly found means of delivery without government. This creates the public perception that some goods and services must be provided by government simply because they are or could be.



Likewise, proponents of Pigouvian taxation to address negative externalities often exaggerate how high these taxes should be by including private costs (such as lost productivity) as external costs, failing to apply the logic of dealing with externalities consistently, and ignoring how taxes affect the demand for substitute products, which themselves can generate negative externalities. Externality arguments are also often used to justify uniform consumption taxes even when only certain consumption levels generate the external costs, and they are increasingly used to justify outright bans on various goods. Both responses can lower social welfare.



“Market failure” is regularly used as justification for government spending, taxes, and regulation. In policy areas ranging from schooling to the consumption of sugar, claims that unfettered markets do not achieve socially optimal outcomes allow advocates of various government policies to argue that those interventions are economically necessary and beneficial. Yet there is a huge chasm between how market failure is used in public debate and how modern academic economists think about the efficacy of markets.



Advocates for intervention often implicitly define market failure using the theoretical framework presented in introductory economics textbooks. Markets are said to fail if they are not perfectly competitive, with prices equating to the marginal cost of production. This requires the market to be characterized by full and complete information, an absence of externalities or transaction costs, and by the free entry and exit of firms.



Given that few markets live up to this ideal, market failure defined this way is ubiquitous. Most commonly, markets are said to under­deliver public goods and fail to account for how production or consumption affects third parties (which economists refer to as positive or negative externalities).



Proponents of intervention then jump to assuming government can correct these failures by providing goods or services or by imposing taxes, regulations, or mandates. Indeed, thinking of market failure as an aberration from perfect competition implies that markets can be perfected through targeted intervention. The expansive definition of market failure is thus crucial in justifying interventionist policies.



But academic economists have long recognized the inadequacy of this framework. Models of perfect competition are not, in fact, guides to the real world. They can be useful for heuristic purposes, allowing comparison of real outcomes against some imagined ideal. But finding deviations from some imagined perfect world is not reason enough for intervention.



One reason for this is “government failure.” Just as perfect competition is unrealistic, believing markets to be perfectible by intervention requires highly questionable assumptions about government. To identify and account for market failures requires policy­makers to be rational, consistent, fully informed, and not self‐​interested or beholden to vested interests, but focused solely on maximizing social welfare.1 Clearly, these assumptions do not always hold.



Often, too, bad outcomes arise not because markets fail but because they are absent. Clear property rights and contracts can open the way for mutually beneficial trade. The 1991 Nobel Prize–winning economist Ronald Coase famously observed that, absent transaction costs, externality problems could be traded away in markets. His work had two implications. First, that simply taxing or subsidizing various activities based on who caused them would often not lead to efficient results. Second, that rather than trying to replicate some theoretical ideal market through taxes or subsidies, governments should assess means of reducing transaction costs. Only if this proves difficult or does not work at all should direct interventions be used. Even then, careful cost‐​benefit analysis should try to find the intervention with the biggest net social benefits.



Accordingly, economists today broadly understand market failure in a simpler way: “the failure of the market to bring about results that are in the best interests of society.”2 As the economist and libertarian theorist David Friedman has written, there are situations in markets where “individual rationality does not lead to group rationality.”3 To spell this difference out clearly: the definition of market failure often used by policy advocates judges markets against a theoretical world of perfect competition. On the other hand, high‐​quality economic analysis now compares outcomes from an intervention against actual realistic alternatives, rather than an “unattainable and unidentifiable ideal.”4



Sadly, public debates are still dominated by the rudimentary understanding of market failure and the belief that government can easily correct market inadequacies. Politicians and commentators often consider it sufficient to exclaim “Public good!” “Externality!” and “Monopoly!” to justify new interventions, taxes, and regulations. The remainder of this paper shows six specific, yet common, misuses of the concept of market failure in public debate, focusing on public goods and externalities, which can result in bad policy conclusions.



One type of potential market failure involves the provision of public goods. Economists define these goods as having specific characteristics. First, they are nonrivalrous in consumption, meaning use by one person does not prevent or restrict use by others. Second, they are nonexcludable, meaning it is impossible to prevent someone from using the good once it has been produced.5 Classic cited examples are missile defense systems and radio signals. In both cases, once provided or emitted, it is difficult to stop any one individual from enjoying the benefits of either. Also, one person’s protection from a missile defense system or reception of a radio signal does not “use up” defense or radio signals, meaning others do not have less access. Hence those goods are nonexcludable and nonrivalrous.



In the traditional market‐​failure paradigm, a public good constitutes a market failure because, although the community would be better off if it were produced, it would likely be underprovided in a free market. People have an incentive to “free ride” by consuming the good without paying, wagering that they could enjoy the benefits of provision at no cost. Hence, at a societal level, not enough is spent on the good’s provision.



Yet in public debate the term “public good” is often used to refer to government‐​provided goods and services that do not hold these clearly defined characteristics.6 Libraries, museums, highways, and even K–12 and higher education, for example, have all been variously described as public goods, but are clearly either rivalrous, excludable, or both.7



One can deny entry to libraries and museums, for example, for those who refuse to pay or register. Beyond a certain capacity, the cost base of the museum and congestion within it increases as the number of guests rises, meaning consumption at any given time becomes rivalrous. One might have to queue to either enter an exhibit or to get close enough to enjoy an attraction (as anyone who has visited the Louvre in Paris in peak hours to see the Mona Lisa will attest). While there may be other theoretical justifications for government support for the arts, arguing that museums and libraries are public goods in the economic sense is not convincing.



Highways and bridges likewise suffer from the congestion problem beyond a certain point, and the existence of toll roads and road or congestion pricing systems around the world shows that access can be restricted and the “user pays” principle imposed. In Virginia, for example, the Dulles Greenway opened in 1995, having been financed entirely privately. So, too, were the toll lanes on the I-495 Capital Beltway financed overwhelmingly by private investment.8



Claims made by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–VT) notwithstanding, education and schooling clearly do not possess either characteristic of a public good.9 As the Cato Institute’s Corey DeAngelis has outlined, putting an additional child into a classroom or university not only necessitates new resources, but also reduces the amount of personalized education time a teacher or tutor can grant to each child.10 One can deny service to someone who fails to pay or fails to adhere to the conditions required to be taught within a school.



That is not to say that no goods exist that meet the public‐​good criteria. Knowledge itself can be nonrivalrous and nonexcludable, at least in theory. Although most knowledge accrues as a kind of side effect or externality arising from business ventures, prominent economists have argued that some components of scientific know‐​how might be underprovided in a free market, given that innovators or inventors are unable to capture the rewards associated with their research.11 (This will be discussed in greater detail in the next section.) Very large national parks might be another example of a good that gets close to fulfilling these characteristics, although even here it is possible to put fences around them.



Yet it’s clear that politicians and commentators frequently mislabel goods currently provided by government, or that they desire to be provided by government, as public goods even when that label is inappropriate.



In part this might just be because non­economists use the term incorrectly. But another explanation has been offered by economist Frances Woolley.12 She explains that, because of the nonexcludability characteristic, determining whether something is a public good is really a question of whether the technology exists to make a good or service excludable. For instance, because governments have been unable or unwilling to enforce exclusion for some goods or services in the past, this is often taken as indicative of the impossibility or undesirability of doing so. In other words, as Woolley says, because “actual exclusion is so much easier to conceptualize than hypothetical excludability,” many wrongly presume that government‐​financed goods provided free of charge are innately public goods.



One can certainly argue that certain goods and services have social benefits beyond the private benefits to individuals, and thereby make the case for taxpayer support because of these supposed positive externalities. (See later sections.) But the term public goods implies specific characteristics. Very few goods that government provides are public goods. And just because the government deigns not to impose exclusion for various goods does not mean that it _cannot_ exclude.



By misusing the concept of public goods, the public is misled into believing the government must provide various goods, and that these should be provided free at the point of delivery, even when this makes little sense economically.



Even goods with the apparent characteristics of being nonrivalrous and non­excludable (public goods in the economist’s sense) are often, in fact, delivered by private‐​market activity. Consider TV transmission signals picked up by aerials. Signals used to be transmitted free‐​to‐​air via broadcast towers, meaning one person watching TV didn’t affect the ability of others to do so. Also, it was difficult to prevent someone with an aerial connected to a TV from tuning in. Terrestrial television could therefore have been argued to be non­rivalrous and nonexcludable—a true public good. The case for public broadcasting was therefore strong according to the market‐​failure paradigm.



And yet markets found ways to deliver seemingly adequate TV and radio broadcasts absent extensive government provision. One means was to tie in the costs of the trans­mission to either the purchase of the TV itself or to a receiver. This roughly approximated the users of the service paying the price associated with its delivery. Alternatively, TV and radio have been funded via advertising revenues, with companies and their customers willing to shoulder the costs of service to reach TV and radio audiences with their product messages.13



As new technologies, such as digital decoders, have proliferated, the transaction costs involved with individual contracting and tailored television packages have fallen substantially. TV providers are now able to exclude nonpaying customers easily. As a result, television is better thought of as a “club good.” It is still nonrivalrous at the point of consumption, but the service can be restricted to paying customers via subscription or pay‐​per‐​view requirements.14 As a result of these technological developments, public‐​service broadcasters such as the United Kingdom’s BBC have shifted from justifying their government subsidy by saying they are a public good to emphasizing the supposed external benefits from their output. This is a completely different argument.15



A similar example of private activity delivering a seemingly nonrivalrous and nonexcludable good was documented in a classic paper by Ronald Coase.16 He examined the history of general navigation lighthouses in Britain, which economists before and afterward held up as an example of a classic public good. Coase’s research found that through the late 18th and 19th centuries large numbers of lighthouses were, in fact, built privately. The funding stream for lighthouses came from dues on per voyage payments for all vessels arriving at or departing from ports in Britain (with limits applied after a certain number of journeys) or annual payments for other types of vessels for which per voyage payments were impractical.



In more recent years, there has been some intellectual push‐​back against Coase’s view. David van Zandt’s research showed that while English lighthouses were indeed privately owned, building them required government permission, and their viability was dependent on government‐​bestowed monopoly privileges and government‐​mandated fees.17 Yet whether this proves lighthouses would not be provided independently of government, or simply reflects the historical role government had actively decided to play, is an open question.



Evidence on the private operation of the world’s first modern lightship suggests the latter. The _Nore_ , which ultimately became a series of lightships, was first launched in 1732 to mark a dangerous sandbar, also known as the Nore, where the River Thames meets the North Sea. In a recent paper, Rosolino Candela and Vincent Geloso showed that the _Nore_ originally operated privately, profitably, and without the need for government enforcement on payments. The pair argue that private provision was subsequently crowded out by the public authority responsible for light­houses in England and Wales.18



Today one of the most important ongoing debates around public goods occurs in the discussion of knowledge, particularly scientific knowledge. Accumulated knowledge, to the extent that it is available, is nonrivalrous and nonexcludable in consumption. Knowledge is easy to share, does not get “used up,” and once provided cannot be taken away. This led economists, such as Richard Nelson and Kenneth Arrow, to argue that private entities will be reluctant to undertake their own research and development through fear of competitors copying them. Research, in other words, would be underprovided in a free market because of the high fixed costs of undertaking original research against the low marginal cost of production or replication.19 A classic example might be research into new drugs within the pharmaceuticals industry.



Even in the case of knowledge, though, subsequent analysis, not least by 2018 Nobel Prize–winning economist Paul Romer, acknowledged that market mechanisms, such as basic corporate secrecy, can allow firms to capture the gains of their own endeavors. Private research societies, think tanks, and universities have long existed, and at least part of what they do can be considered pure research. If knowledge is underprovided in free markets but is crucial to growth, how does one explain the Industrial Revolution in England, where government support for research was limited, and yet observers such as Adam Smith documented extensive innovation by private entities?20



One theory advanced by biochemist Terence Kealey concludes that the public‐​good “problem” associated with knowledge was overcome through knowledge‐​sharing institutions such as the Royal Society, which made the results of research a “contribution good.” Clubs of scientists or researchers can band together, benefiting from the spillovers of knowledge to each other, but with broader excludability to those outside of the group. Researchers have incentives to undertake their own research to obtain the tacit knowledge and permission to access the research of others. This substantially increases their probability of discovering something worthwhile, which can be commercialized.



This is one example of markets developing institutions to create excludability. More recently, types of contracts, such as noncompete clauses, have arisen as ways to prevent trade secrets from being transferred to other companies through the transfer of employees. All these mechanisms, as well as some government‐​supported institutions, such as patents, make investment in scientific knowledge less of a public good.



These practical and historical examples highlight that even goods or services that themselves appear to be nonrivalrous and nonexcludable can be delivered privately if payment can be tied to a complementary product or service, or when technological, clubs, or contractual institutions can significantly reduce the transaction costs associated with delivering excludability. Yet still many commentators misuse the market‐​failure framework by simply pointing at things with public‐​good characteristics as slam‐​dunk justifications for government provision.



Economic consumption or production decisions often impose costs or benefits on third parties. In public debate, these are described as a market failure because private consumers and producers, it is believed, only consider the private costs and benefits to themselves, and not these external effects, when deciding whether to consume or produce. As such, goods and services with broader external benefits might be underproduced in a free market, and those with external costs overproduced.



The classic recommended government remedy for this problem is to try to calculate the marginal external costs or benefits associated with a given activity (beyond the private costs or benefits) and implement taxes or subsidies so these externalities are priced in when consumption or production decisions are made.21 Joseph Stiglitz’s Nobel lecture is a good description of this policy solution.22



Given the pervasiveness of externalities, applying this logic consistently and universally would result in an extremely intrusive government. Yet, in public debate, externalities are often exaggerated by stretching the definition of external costs to cover effects that are not truly external or else cannot be easily quantified or measured. The most obvious example of this comes in relation to so‐​called “sin” products, such as junk food, soft drinks, and alcohol.



Alcohol consumption, for example, can clearly impose external costs.23 The costs of alcohol‐​related crime and drunken driving are borne by people other than the drinker. There may be net external costs relating to health care, too, given that alcohol‐​related diseases and incidents could necessitate higher taxpayer subsidies or insurance premiums. (Although, to be applied consistently, one must also account for the effects of alcohol consumption on longevity. Excessive alcohol consumption may reduce the lifetime Social Security and health care costs of a drinker, relative to a nondrinker, thus resulting in taxpayer savings.)24



Most would accept that alcohol consumption could have net external costs. Seeking to account for these is defensible. Taxation may even be the most efficient way of achieving this goal.25 But those campaigning for alcohol tax hikes sometimes expand the charge sheet of alcohol’s external costs to include things that primarily affect consumers rather than third parties.



A 2015 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated, for example, that alcohol consumption costs the United States $25 billion per year from crime‐​related activity, $13 billion for collisions, and $28 billion for health care. Yet these were all dwarfed by what they identified as the major cost to the economy: a reduction in workplace productivity accounting for $179 billion.26 Yet little of a reduction in workplace productivity is really an external cost. If individuals’ alcohol consumption affects their work performance, or their human capital accumulation, the vast proportion of that cost would ultimately be borne by the individuals themselves through worse employment prospects and lower wages. Some people may prefer (hard as it is for public health campaigners to believe) a work‐​life balance where they stay out later to socialize and drink, rather than maximizing at‐​work productivity. As such, acting on their preferences improves their economic welfare rather than detracting from it.27



It is certainly true that some part of that productivity deterioration would hurt the individual’s employer or the ultimate consumer of the product. Lost productivity could also be considered at least partially an external cost in that lower wages or worse employment prospects may reduce an individual’s net tax contribution. If this necessitates higher tax contributions from other taxpayers to maintain government revenues, there is a clear fiscal third‐​party effect.



But applying such reasoning consistently would profoundly change the scope of economic policymaking. Many decisions throughout our lives affect our measured productivity, pecuniary rewards, and net tax contributions. Implicitly assuming a baseline in which all individuals maximize measured productivity and net fiscal contributions, and considering deviations from this to be a market failure, would be an absurd principle. Taking time off to have children or to care for a sick relative, regularly staying up late to watch TV and being tired at work, or choosing not to invest in one’s own human capital might all reduce measured productivity or earnings, or both, and so reduce one’s net tax contributions. This is to say nothing of career choices. Opting to become a French teacher or a public‐​interest lawyer, even when the opportunity exists for one to be a Wall Street trader, means people clearly do not always make decisions to maximize their net tax contributions. Yet in a free society such decisions are rightly considered within the realm of free choice. Singling out the productivity effects of alcohol consumption as a unique externality in need of correction, when every day individuals make decisions that affect their productive potential and, indirectly, their net tax contributions, would be unworkable, arbitrary, and wrong.



Nevertheless, in the public health literature, chalking up lost productivity as an external cost is increasingly common. A recent paper from academics at the University of Oxford, calculating supposed optimal tax rates on red and processed meat, cited productivity losses from mortality and morbidity for those aged under 65 as one of the costs requiring corrective taxation.28



Again, the lion’s share of any effect would represent private costs, and not external costs. The most obvious potential external effect is on net tax contributions, but here we should note that mortality or morbidity itself may also result in some fiscal savings (through lower lifetime Social Security and Medicare payments). The most important point is this: the implication that policy should encourage us to maximize our productivity levels would result in thousands of taxes and subsidies on all kinds of activities.



External costs exist. Where things such as alcohol consumption are concerned, they may even be significant. It can be appropriate to levy taxes as a least‐​bad means of attempting to account for this marginal external harm, such that the full social costs of activities are reflected in prices.



But too often in policy debates, campaigners misuse the concept of externality‐​induced market failure by defining external costs too broadly. By including effects that are primarily private costs, they advocate corrective taxation at far too high a rate than what is justified by the genuine external costs of an activity. In what contexts to consider certain effects externalities also appears arbitrary and inconsistent.



For the reasons outlined in the last section, identifying negative externalities can be extremely difficult. But, once identified, it is often treated as a matter of faith that a simple, uniform tax can be applied to “internalize” the externality and shift us to some socially optimal level of consumption. Such reasoning has been applied to sugar or soda taxes (to account for obesity), alcohol taxes (to account for costs associated with drunken driving), and more recently to red‐​meat taxes (to account for health‐​related costs).



Yet even acknowledging external effects, externalities can be corrected efficiently using _uniform_ taxes only if all levels of consumption generate the same external costs. Otherwise, one would only want to tax consumption that generates external costs. Yet sin taxes, such as those on sugar, soda, alcohol, and red meat, apply to all consumption, regardless of whether there are external effects.



People who drink one can of soda per month to replenish their energy levels after a long run are likely to impose minimal health costs on others. Someone drinking gallons of soda every day while already being obese and covered by a federal health program may, on the other hand, be imposing much larger external costs on other taxpayers. If we want to reach efficient levels of consumption, we’d want a system of taxation or regulation that accounts for this heterogeneity, increasing the price of consumption units that impose external costs.



Of course, it would be extraordinarily costly (and possibly illegal) to impose such price discrimination through taxes, even if it were theoretically possible. It is also difficult to ascertain how much an individual’s health outcome is affected by marginal soda consumption. Indeed, where obesity is concerned, it is unclear what the rationale is for taxing one potential cause of the perceived problem and ignoring the broader diet or exercise. Why taxes on soda, but not subsidies for kale smoothies or gym memberships? If sugar is regarded as the key cause of obesity, why not have taxes on drinks such as milkshakes? Again, there appears to be an inconsistency in the way externalities are considered where policy is concerned.



If ultimately obesity itself is believed to be the problem, perhaps a more rational solution would be to impose taxes on obese people themselves (although this would clearly be socially unacceptable). But in other lifestyle areas, there are more options for dealing with the external costs associated with hetero­geneity among consumers.29



Consider alcohol consumption. Some drinkers consume alcohol regularly without ever driving under the influence, while others drive under the influence often. Ideally, we would impose financial penalties only on those who impose the risks and external costs on others.



In a world with perfect detection, this could take the form of direct penalties and fines for drunken drivers. Even without perfect detection, one could impose larger fines on those caught and convicted (although given low detection rates these fines could be financially ruinous for many). Eventually, it could be technologically feasible and cost‐​effective to install breathalyzer equipment within cars, too, linking the drivers’ alcohol levels with their ability to start the car.



The problem with alcohol taxes and other sin taxes is that they impose the same marginal charge on both responsible and irresponsible consumers. This can worsen economic efficiency overall if irresponsible drinkers’ consumption behavior is less responsive to the increase in price than responsible drinkers. Academic research tentatively suggests this is the case. A review of the literature by Jon P. Nelson of Pennsylvania State University found that only 2 of 19 studies on the consumption behavior of heavy drinkers found “a significant and substantial negative price response.”30



In short, identifying external costs relating to an activity is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition, for uniform consumption taxation to advance us to a socially efficient level of consumption. Unless consumption or production of the good at every level produces the same external costs, this type of taxation will certainly not take us to the theoretical perfectly competitive market outcomes described above. In some cases, it may still increase overall economic welfare, but in other areas it might worsen it. Policy proponents and commentators misuse the market‐​failure framework by ignoring that external costs often are not the same at all levels of consumption. As a result, they advocate for uniform taxes to be applied to consumption or production activities even when this will clearly not maximize social welfare.



Taxes and regulation designed to account for externalities can also fail to acknowledge tradeoffs caused by the intervention. Consider childcare. Intervention and regulation in this sector are often justified by arguments that high‐​quality childcare provides broader “positive externalities,” such as improved child development, and that support for it can incentivize mothers of young children to return to work. Greater maternal attachment to the labor force is sometimes said to bring other external benefits, such as boosting female productivity and net fiscal contributions. All these factors have been used to justify minimum staff–child ratio regulation, qualification requirements for workers, and, more recently, childcare subsidies.



Yet by raising the costs of provision, regulations on staffing reduce the number of infant centers, particularly in poor areas.31 This raises prices and reduces the availability of care. The increased cost and lack of available care can, in turn, lead to substitution toward other forms of care, such as home daycare, the quality of which could conceivably be worse. Even if the regulation ensured higher quality care for those using formal centers, then the effect on prices and the availability of care could mean that, overall, the quality of care available to the population could fall.



Similar unintended consequences could come from subsidizing childcare with a desire to improve mothers’ labor force participation. Even if a planner could estimate the external benefits of parents working, parents should not be incentivized to work unless the social value of their market output is greater than the social value of activities they might otherwise be engaged in. This could include any positive parental role to the development of their own children (which could have broader external benefits), or broader external welfare gains from engaging in charitable or family activity.



Yet often the discussion of externalities is partial, with little attempt to think about the external effects of the intervention itself.



Consider the recent debate around plastic‐​bag fees, taxes, and bans. The National Council of State Legislatures documents that California and Hawaii, as well as a host of major cities, have enacted legislation to ban or tax the bags.32 These actions are usually justified according to environmental externalities associated with plastic bags, such as carbon emissions in production, spillovers from landfill sites, and, most emotively, visible pollution and harm caused to natural habitats and ocean wildlife.



According to the traditional market‐​failure paradigm, a tax or fee should account for the marginal external cost of the next bag to the environment. The tax should make consumers face the full social cost associated with its consumption.



Nevertheless, proponents of taxes or fees seem to consider their use in isolation, rarely acknowledging that increasing the price of plastic bags causes substitution to other means of transporting groceries. These also have environmental effects.



One of the reasons plastic bags are so cheap, for example, is because they are energy‐ and water‐​efficient to produce. For an equivalent amount of groceries, the National Center for Policy Analysis has estimated that production of paper bags consumes three times as much energy.33 Paper bags also produce substantially more landfill waste, potentially higher greenhouse gas emissions, and more waterborne wastes than their plastic cousins.34



Some studies have tried to compare the environmental effects of different bags. One UK government study found that reusable plastic tote sacks and cotton bags would need to be reused more than 11 and 131 times, respectively, before they yielded net environmental benefits (as measured by their contribution toward climate change) compared to single‐​use plastic bags.35 But cotton bags tend to only be reused around half that amount, making them worse for the environment, on net, than plastic bags. A Danish study assessing the life‐​cycle of bags estimated that, looking across all environmental effects, to provide the same performance as an average single‐​used plastic bag (used once before being used as a bin liner), paper bags would have to be used 43 times and cotton bags 7,100 times.36



The point here is not to downplay some of the environmental externalities associated with plastic bag use. It is to show that, by considering the consumption of one good in isolation, policy proponents misuse the framework of market failure with potentially damaging policy consequences. All goods and their substitutes here entail production processes using chemicals and water, and have the potential for pollution, carbon emissions, and much else besides. Advocating for taxes or bans associated with one type of product on the basis of externalities, without considering the environmental consequences of substitutes, can lead to policies that reduce social welfare.



Environmental externalities can be real and significant. But of late, the existence of external costs from certain activities has been used to justify banning or curtailing the availability of products entirely. This represents a misuse of the concept of social cost and goes against the insights of the market‐​failure paradigm, practically ensuring social welfare is not maximized.



The most recent example of this mistake relates to the “War on Plastic.” In July 2018, Seattle banned plastic straws and utensils from bars and restaurants.37 Restrictions have also been implemented in certain Californian towns, too, such as Malibu and San Luis Obispo. Beginning in 2019, California will prohibit restaurants from providing these utensils unless customers explicitly ask for them.38 In the United Kingdom, the government will ban the sale of single‐​use plastic straws starting in 2019.39



The driver for this policy seems to be the evident pollution from straws in the world’s oceans, which can cause physical harm to marine wildlife. Awareness of this damage has already led many individuals and restaurants to voluntarily cease or cut down use of plastic straws. But, self‐​evidently, large numbers of businesses and consumers continue to use them, implying that they perceive the benefits of doing so exceed the costs.



Although it is difficult to estimate the environmental damage caused by marginal straw use, a reasonable policy prescription here would be to impose a tax on the straws themselves. In doing so, one must consider that substitute products may come with their own environmental costs. And there may be deleterious dental costs from making plastic straws more expensive, which could have effects on people through higher dental insurance premiums, for example. But assuming one considered these effects, one could attempt to price in the external costs of straw use, difficult as they would be to estimate.



The goal of such taxation is not to eliminate use entirely. The point is to ensure that when individuals and businesses make consumption decisions, they do so bearing the external costs of their actions. Even with such a tax imposed, those who consider the marginal private benefits of using straws to be higher than the marginal social cost would continue to buy them.



The logic of banning or adopting prohibitively high sin taxes, in contrast, is that the optimal consumption level of anything with external costs is zero. This is an absurd principle, albeit one that is regularly espoused. It is common, for example, to hear commentators and policymakers advocate for a zero‐​carbon economy.40 The UK government’s recent announcement that it plans to ban all gas and diesel vehicles by the year 2040 is an example of a policy that will almost certainly impose net social costs on society.



Yet consider those individuals with disabilities who cannot drink a beverage without the assistance of a straw and so rely on plastic straws to be able to dine or drink in public. For these individuals, the private benefits from straw use are almost certainly high enough that they would be willing to pay a high tax per straw, and so face the full social cost of their actions. Yet with a plastic straw ban, they would not be able to use them.



Similar reasoning would arise if one considered banning gas‐​consuming automobiles. Many people would want to continue to drive their gas‐​consuming car even if all the external costs of gas consumption were embedded within the gas price. Yet, with a ban, those consumers for whom the benefits vastly exceed the social costs are no longer able to drive their gas‐​fueled automobiles.



Banning products therefore creates a situation where gains from trade go unfulfilled. Society as a whole is made worse off than if the external costs of the activity were approp­riately priced. Again, using plastic straws and driving gas and diesel vehicles do impose externalities. If one believes these negative effects increase uniformly with consumption, then it is defensible to impose corrective taxation to price in the external costs when individuals make consumption decisions. But it is a complete misuse of the market‐​failure framework to go further and point at externalities as justification for banning activities. Trying to outlaw consumption of a product leads to a situation where the marginal social benefits exceed marginal social costs, meaning trades go unfulfilled and society as a whole is worse off than if externalities are priced in appropriately.



Markets are imperfect. Sometimes government interventions, through taxes, subsidies, and regulations, can be used to improve social welfare in the face of evident problems. But this paper has shown that bad arguments by advocates of intervention often result in suboptimal policies.



Armed with a rudimentary understanding of market failure and a belief that government is well placed to correct markets, policy advocates sometimes push for government provision of certain goods even when there is no economic rationale, or ignore evidence that markets themselves can deliver public goods. They often argue for Pigouvian taxes at rates much higher than necessary to account for genuine external costs, or fail to apply the logic of dealing with externalities consistently. They sometimes ignore the effects of taxes on markets for substitute goods or wrongly use externalities to justify outright bans. All these mistakes can lower social welfare. 



The best academic economic analysis these days considers the effects of intervention on outcomes against real‐​world alternatives, including nonintervention and other policies, not against the outcomes of some theoretical perfectly competitive market. But, too often in public debate, advocates for intervention deem it sufficient to point out some market imperfection in order to justify government subsidies, taxes, or regulation. This simplistic approach—predicated on the idea that government can perfect markets—leads to more intervention or higher taxes than what is optimal and has significant unintended consequences.

Hardy, geoscientist who was among 11 co-authors of the paper in the journal Science that sparked the pessimistic Kilimanjaro forecast. “None of us had much history working on that mountain, and we didn’t understand a lot of the complicated processes on the peak like we do now.” In October 2007 Mr Justice Burton of the UK High Court ruled, for the purpose of teaching, against unqualified use of this passage summarised from the Gore book “An Inconvenient Truth”. Mr Gore’s assertion was that the disappearance of snow on Mount Kilimanjaro in East Africa was expressly attributable to global warming – the court heard the scientific consensus that it cannot be established that the snow recession is mainly attributable to human-induced climate change.
2. “… researchers believe that most central and eastern Himalayan glaciers could virtually disappear by 2035.” P.14
This arose from a brochure from India to the World Wide Fund for Nature, not peer reviewed, which eventuated in year 2350 being replaced by 2035 in the IPCC 2007 report – and missed by the peer-review process. The correction process by the IPCC was tortuous and lamentably acrimonious when a single direct statement should have sufficed.
3. “… raising average global sea level between four and eight inches in the past hundred years.” P.19 This estimate was conventional wisdom until the specialist satellite era, when measurement technology improved. As the NOAA figure shows, Jason 1 (data from 2002) and Jason 2 (2009) have complicated the story, with data showing ocean levels falling at times. The Jason instruments were specifically designed for ocean level measurement. More time is needed before the modern estimate of ocean change can be calculated. It is noted that Ocean Heat Content, OHC, a cause of ocean level change, has barely changed since measurements became acceptable through an increase in the number of Argo buoys in year 2002 or so.

And so it goes, as listed below. The following abbreviated quotes from NatGeo 2004 need examination in the light of accumulated knowledge. Note that peer-review, having been repeatedly found wanting in the years before 2012, is not a requirement for commentary, though it can be desirable. In several important ways, such as immediacy, the modern blog world has adequate accurate commentary, to allow suggested revisions or retractions of the quotes below.
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
1. “The famed snows of Kilimanjaro have melted more than 80% since 1912.” P.14
2. “… researchers believe that most central and eastern Himalayan glaciers could virtually disappear by 2035.” P.14
3. “… raising average global sea level between four and eight inches in the past hundred years.” P.19
4. “But the recent rate of global sea level rise has departed from the average rate of the past two to three thousand years and is rising much more rapidly – a continuation or acceleration of that trend has the potential to cause striking changes…” P.19
5. “Even relatively small storm surges in the past two decades have overwhelmed the system of dikes, levees and pump stations … upgraded in the 1990s to forestall the Gulf of Mexico’s relentless creep.” P.19
6. “Vulnerable to sea-level rise, Tuvalu, a small country in the South Pacific, has already begun formulating evacuation plans.” P.19
7. “The scenarios are disturbing even in wealthy countries like the Netherlands, with nearly half its landmass already at or below sea level.” P.19
8. “The 20th Century has seen the greatest warming in at least a thousand years, and natural forces can’t account for it all.” P.20
9. “Both greenhouse gases and temperature are expected to continue rising.” P.20
10. “Thick smoke towers over a forest near Fairbanks, one more sign that Alaska is getting hotter…. Computer models predict that CO2-induced warming could eventually raise the incidence of fires by more than a half.” P.25
11. “If the West Antarctic ice sheet were to break up, which scientists consider very unlikely this century, it alone contains enough ice to raise sea level by nearly 20 feet.” P.27
12. “Ocean temperatures are rising in all ocean basins and at much deeper depths than previously thought (NOAA)” P.27
13. “Oceans are important sinks …. and take up about a third of human-generated CO2.” P.28
14. “ … three greenhouse gases … orchestrating an intricate dance between the radiation of heat from Earth back to space (cooling the planet) and the absorption of radiation in the atmosphere (trapping it near the surface and this warming the planet).” P.29
15. (At Barrow) “There are no words, though, to describe how much and how fast the ice is changing.” P.33
16. “Researchers long ago predicted that the most visible impacts from a globally warmer world would occur first at high latitudes: rising air and sea temperatures, earlier snowmelt, later ice freeze-up, reductions in sea ice, thawing permafrost, more erosion, increases in storm intensity. Now, all these impacts have been documented in Alaska.” P.33
17. “The Fleishmann’s glass frog is barely hanging on …. As Earth’s temperatures rise, scientists are exploring climate’s role in a worldwide amphibian decline.” P.34
18. “Alpine plants are edging uphill and beginning to overrun rare species near mountain summits.” P.41
19. “This is the first instance in which humans appear to be accelerating the change, and warming could take place so quickly that species will not have the time to adapt and avoid extinction.” P.41
20. “At some point, as temperatures continue to rise, species will have no more room to run”. P.41
21. “Coral necropolis …. Increasingly the planet’s coral is in hot water, parboiled in periods of calm, sunny weather … In 1998 the world’s coral suffered its worst year on record, which left 16% bleached or dead.” P.41
22. Re: turtle breeding “Storms amplify the trend (to more females) shearing away trees that provide cooling shade to nests on beaches. ‘Severe weather events … really knock the socks off in favour of the females’.” P.47
…………………………………………………….
Fast forward to page 73 because there are enough quotes already, to find –
23. “A warming world will harm some – and benefit others. Home heating costs will likely fall in New England … The prospects are grim for drought-plagued Ethiopian children, who could see rainfall decline by 10 percent over the next 50 years. Widespread poverty and dependence on subsistence agriculture make Africans the most vulnerable to climate change.” P.73.
There are a couple of boxed headers along the way. Two are
24. “IT’S NOT A BELIEF SYSTEM; IT’S AN OBSERVABLE SCIENTIFIC FACT.” P.33.
25. Then “WE’LL HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF THE ACTUAL CHANGES IN 30 YEARS. BUT IT’S GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD.”
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
To the Editor of National Geographic, we are a third of that way to that very different world and many can’t pick the difference yet. Given the possibility that NatGeo 2004 was an enthusiastic issue, we think it would be a good idea to bring out a more measured NatGeo 2014.
Our blog readers are a skilled and diverse. They will prepare and distribute the actuality of the NatGeo 2004 claims as understood in 2012. Please feel free to use these in the re-write, a step which would gain you prestige because scientifically, it is the ethical move.
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
NatGeo has apologised for some past errors. The July 2004 edition had some images of hunters with tusks captioned to be from a dead elephant found in the bush. Trouble was, the tusks had numbers on them showing capture several years before in another country. Earlier, there was the apology and subsequent stronger rules when an altered image of the Pyramids of Egypt was printed on the NatGeo cover of Feb 1982. That lead to a statement of NatGeo rules for altered images.
Finally, on photography, we note the dark photograph, double spread a few pages into the 2004 issue captioned “Heating Up …” It used back lighting and a low sun angle to help give water condensate the appearance of particulate smoke, two vastly different entities, going skyward from what seems to be one chimney of 4, plus some out-of-view cooling towers in Ohio. It fails criterion 2 below.
The National Press Photographers Association (NPPA) Code of Ethics offers nine ethical standards to member journalists. The basic premises of the NPPA’s nine standards are:
1. Accurately represent subjects
2. Do not be manipulated by staged photos
3. Avoid bias and stereotyping in work; provide complete information and context
4. Show consideration for subjects
5. Avoid influencing the actions of the photographic subject
6. Editing should not give the wrong impression of the subjects in the photograph
7. Do not compensate persons involved in photographs or in getting a photograph
8. Do not accept gifts or other favors from those involved in a photo
9. Do not purposely interfere with the work of other journalists.

The United States confronts increasingly complex challenges. Iraq faces disaster at the hands of Jihadist extremists, Syria’s horrific civil war rages on, and Russia is underwriting separatist forces in Ukraine. Washington’s policies are failing.



The Obama administration has been doing a little better, but not good enough, with China. There is no open conflict between the two, but tensions are high. Territorial disputes throughout the South China Sea and Sea of Japan could flare into violence. North Korea is more disruptive than ever. Other important issues lurk in the background.



While there should be no surprise when important powers like the U.S. and People’s Republic of China disagree, the two must work through such issues. Unfortunately, the U.S. is far better at making demands than negotiating solutions. In particular, Washington seems to ignore the interdependence of issues, the fact that positions taken in one area may affect responses in others.



For instance, the U.S. famously initiated a “pivot” to Asia, or “rebalancing” of U.S. resources and attention to the region. In practice, the plan hasn’t amounted to much. Washington moved a few thousand Marines to Australia—enough to irritate the PRC but not to achieve anything if hostilities occurred.





The U.S. is far better at making demands than negotiating solutions.



Washington implausibly claimed that the shift had nothing to do with China. But the residents of Zhongnanhai are not stupid. For what other reason would the U.S. reaffirm _military_ alliances and augment _military_ forces in Beijing’s backyard?



Yet at the same time the Obama administration was pressing the PRC to apply greater pressure on North Korea to end the latter’s nuclear program and constant provocations. The North has no other close relationships and relies on the PRC for most of its energy and food, as well as the vast majority of outside economic investment. If only China would step on Pyongyang’s windpipe North Korea would have to yield, runs the argument.



The U.S. acts as if it was asking for a small favor. In fact, no one knows how the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea would react. Attempting to coerce Pyongyang would risk China’s relationship with its only ally in the region.



The DPRK might grudgingly give ground, while shifting its economic and political ties to Russia or the West, leaving China with another hostile power on its border. Or Pyongyang might successfully resist Beijing’s pressure, while making a similar geopolitical shift to others.



Or the North might resist and collapse. China then would face the prospect of chaos next door, losing its economic position, facing a flood of refugees, and risking a violent spillover. Worse geopolitically would be eventual Korean reunification, which would leave an expanded U.S. ally hosting American troops on the Yalu.



The latter would be unpleasant for Beijing even without the “pivot.” A unified Korea could play a significant role in any campaign to contain the PRC. What matters most are not Washington’s professed or even actual intentions, but America’s perceived intentions.



The Obama administration’s attempt to moderate territorial disputes in the region runs into the same problem. America is committed to one side, maintaining defense relationships, deployments, and treaties with several interested parties including Japan. While Washington’s call for a peaceful resolution of disagreements is well founded, in practice it acts as an endorsement of the status quo—which favors America’s friends and allies.



The PRC likely would be skeptical even if it saw the U.S.-led bloc as benign. However, America’s senior ally is Japan, still remembered for its World War II depredations in China. Other nations, such as the Philippines, also contribute to what Beijing perceives to be an attempt at containment. Why should China comply with U.S. demands?



The U.S. has sought Beijing’s aid in overthrowing the government of Syrian President Bashar al‐​Assad and forcing Iran to abandon any nuclear weapons ambitions. Washington sees these issues as matters of moral and practical necessity. However, the PRC’s acquiescence would expand American influence and even perhaps create a new U.S. client state. That is not obviously in the PRC’s interest, especially when America is seen as attempting to maintain its dominance in East Asia.



Other issues also cannot be considered in isolation. While human rights are not a security question, American pressure on Beijing to respect political activities hostile to the Communist Party’s monopoly of power may be seen to be no less threatening than Washington’s military moves. Talk of values and rights are coming from a country attempting to preserve its privileged geopolitical position in China’s neighborhood.



Moreover, U.S. attempts to convince Beijing to combat climate change by limiting energy use—which would inevitably slow China’s economic growth—look more sinister when Washington is working to constrain the PRC’s influence. Talk of necessary sacrifice is less convincing in the context of the larger geopolitical struggle. Suggesting that this policy is part of a sinister plot gives Washington too much credit, but perception matters more than reality.



In foreign policy the urgent often pushes out the important. The Ukrainian and Syrian conflicts, for instance, are dominating headlines today. But over the long‐​term the status of Ukraine and Syria are not important, let alone vital, to America. Relations with China, the world’s second largest economy and potential military superpower, matter far more.



There inevitably will be disagreements and misunderstandings. The two nations must manage such controversies. And doing so will require recognizing that issues are interrelated. In particular, the U.S. must accept the necessity of trade‐​offs, most notably that it cannot be seen as leading a coalition against Beijing if it hopes to convince the PRC to adopt policies seemingly against its own geopolitical interests, such as sacrificing its ally North Korea.



Much can be achieved if the world’s superpower and incipient superpower develop a sustained cooperative relationship, as did imperial Great Britain and rising America. That requires Washington to manage the important even as it confronts the urgent.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Die kalte Sonne site here features a worrisome essay by German climate scientists Horst-Joachim Lüdecke, Dr. Alexander Hempelmann and Carl Otto Weiss. They carefully examined climate changes of the past and have found that the recent changes (of the last 40 years are nothing out of the ordinary and that we need to worry about a global cooling that will persist until 2080.
They published 2 papers on the subject in the journal European Geophysical Union (EGU) [2], [3]. According to the 2 scientists, climate is often cyclic. The first study appeared in February 2013 and it examined six of the longest existing thermometer data series recorded in Europe, as well as one dataset from an Antarctic ice core and another from a data series extracted from stalagmites. The datasets were covered the period of 1757 – 2010.
The second publication appeared in February 2015 and it examines the past 2500 years.

The last 2500 years
The analysis of the past 2500 years involved data from tree rings, sediment cores, stalagmites, etc. A plot of the data yields a climate operating with cyclic behavior.

Figure 1: Temperature changes of the past 2500 years (with linear regression).  
Compared to the maxima and minima of the past, the current minima and maxima show that there is nothing unusual happening today. The scientists say today’s temperature changes are within the normal range. The German authors write: “Especially the 20th century shows nothing out of the ordinary.”

Figure 2: Sinusoidal representation of solar activity and 3 proxy datasets. Red: solar activity using 10Be proxy, Sine period = 208 years, correlation 0.68. Green: Büntgen data series [4], Sine period= 186 years, correlation 0.49. Brown: Christiansen/Ljungqvist  data series [5], sine period = 189 years, correlation 0.58. Blue: Cook data series [6], sine period= 201 years, correlation 0.41.
Global cooling next 60 years
The German scientists write that one result of the well established cyclic behavior over the past 2500 years is that it is justified to assume that the De Vries / Suess solar cycle will continue in the future.
They write that this means that “global cooling is to be expected over the next 60 years (Figure 3)“.

Figure 3: Sinusoidal behavior shown from the datasets by Christiansen/Ljungqvist [5] (brown) and Büntgen [4] (green) together with the Antarctic series [7] (blue) confirms that the De Vries / Suess cycle acts globally and that cooling is to be expected for the future.
“No trace of aperiodic effects”
Lüdecke, Hempelmann and Weiss also examined the oldest existing thermometer datasets going back some 250 years [2] taken at the locations of Kremsmünster, Vienna, Prague, Hohenpeißenberg, Munich and Paris. Their study also included ice cores and stalagmite datasets, which the scientists say “show exclusively periodic climate changes in fine detail. There is no trace of aperiodic effects, such as from the continuously rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (Figure 4).”

Figure 4: Central Europe temperature (black, smoothed, agrees with the Antarctic temperatures) and the sum of the 6 strongest cycles (red), as found with the cycle analysis of the black curve. The perfect agreement between red and black shows that non-cyclic impacts (such as the steadily increasing atmospheric CO2) play no role for the temperature. Only the cycles correctly reflect the measured temperatures.
Globe may cool to 1870 levels!
The German trio of scientists says the 0.7°C of warming occurring since the late 19th century is the result of the increase in the De Vries / Suess solar cycle and that the well-known oceanic AMO/PDO oscillations can also be seen. “These two cycles practically determine by themselves the earth’s temperature.”
The scientists add that the “pause“ in global warming is caused by the AMO/PDO, which has been on the decline since 2000. The De Vries / Suess solar cycle allows a general cooling up to the year 2080 to be predicted and that the global temperature will reach a level last seen in 1870.
“Results have been confirmed”
Strong doubts will certainly be fired at the findings by Lüdecke, Hempelmann and Weiss. But they remind us that in the solar physics literature other authors have already used their findings and arrive at practically the same conclusions (see the footnotes at the end of their two papers). The three German scientists sharply criticize the IPCC for refusing to acknowledge the sun as an obvious driver of the global climate.
Finally the German scietists say that in view of the increase in CO2 seen thus far, 50% of the temperature increase expected to happen by 2100 should have taken place by now – if such a CO2 warming were true. The scientists say that the way things stand now, if the CO2 effect were real, the future warming up to the year 2100 could be at most 0.7 °C.

"TEHRAN  —   Until two weeks ago, Iran’s clerics felt comfortable leading worshipers in a chorus of “Death to America” while simultaneously signing a $16. 6 billion deal with Boeing. Now, that status quo seems very long ago and the establishment is treading carefully, with even most   concerned that the smallest provocation could lead to military conflict. But some question how long their caution will last in the face of a Trump administration that has brought a new level of hostility and confrontation to a relationship that under President Barack Obama had been brittle but stable. Tensions flared this week after Iran confirmed that it had conducted a missile test and the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, warned Iran that it had been put “on notice. ” On Thursday, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Qassemi, gave a mild rejoinder, saying, “It is a shame that the U. S. government, instead of thanking the Iranian nation for their continued fight against terrorism, keeps repeating unfounded claims and adopts unwise policies that are effectively helping terrorist groups. ” Mr. Flynn also made clear that the challenge to Iran extended beyond the missile test, holding Tehran responsible for an attack on a Saudi warship by Houthi rebels in Yemen, who the United States says are supported by Iran. Iran denies that, but the remark was taken as a veiled warning about Iran’s support of regional proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Shiite militias in Iraq. “The Trump administration condemns actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout the Middle East and place American lives at risk,” he said. Later, President Trump posted on Twitter that “Iran is rapidly taking over Iraq,” its neighbor, “while the U. S. squandered three trillion dollars there. Obviously long ago. ” During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump spoke favorably of unpredictability in foreign policy, pointing to President Ronald Reagan as an example of the benefits of keeping opponents off balance. Since taking office, he has been good to his word, and Iranians have noticed. “Trump is not predictable for Americans, not for Europeans and not for us,” said Nader Karimi Joni, a war veteran and analyst close to the government of President Hassan Rouhani. “He and his team are not trustworthy. They will not honor any agreement. Nothing good is coming from this. ” Certainly not for Mr. Rouhani, a moderate who came to power promising to ratchet down tensions with the West, cinch a nuclear deal and get Iran’s economy moving again. Now, all those goals are in jeopardy, and Mr. Rouhani’s   this spring is far from assured. On Thursday, an aide to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called Mr. Trump’s remarks “hollow rants” and said that they “would bring losses for his country’s national interest. ” The adviser, the former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, also said that Iran would continue to test missiles. Mr. Rouhani has called Mr. Trump a political novice. But there is little doubt that the clerics have been thrown off balance. One analyst with access to government deliberations said that   in Iran were confused and did not know how to deal with the situation. Some in the establishment are opting for the same rhetoric and tactics they used under Mr. Obama, but in reality, this is uncharted territory, he said. Mr. Trump has filled his foreign policy team with advisers like Mr. Flynn and the secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, who consider Iran to be the greatest cause of instability in the Middle East, if not the world, and who think the Obama administration treated Tehran with kid gloves. When Iran test fired a missile on Sunday, it did not announce the launch on state television, something the country’s leadership usually likes to do to send a message to its adversaries. Missile tests are commonplace in Iran, but Sunday’s muted test was clearly meant to test the Trump administration’s reaction. Mr. Flynn did not elaborate what he meant by saying he was putting Iran on notice. But in Iran, many agreed that whatever it meant, it did not bode well. “When they say we are put on notice, it means we should be very careful,” said Soroush Farhadian, a reformist journalist. “We need  . Our military men need to be prevented from making blunders. One incident in the Persian Gulf can lead to conflict right now. ” In recent months, speedboats belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps have made a practice of aggressively approaching United States naval vessels, then veering off. During the campaign, Mr. Trump vowed that if they tried that under his watch, he would “blow them out of the water. ” There have been no reported incidents since Mr. Trump took office. Ayatollah Khamenei was uncharacteristically mute during a visit on Thursday to the martyr’s graves, usually a moment for brief remarks about current affairs. The position of Mr. Rouhani is more sensitive, as he has been promoting ties with the United States and executed the nuclear agreement, with the blessing of Ayatollah Khamenei, who also has been critical of the deal. Having tied his political future to the nuclear agreement and promised to normalize relations with the West, Mr. Rouhani is rapidly losing influence, analysts say. He now finds himself faced with an American travel ban for his citizens and an American president who thinks the nuclear pact “is a really, really bad deal. ”   are deeply critical of Mr. Rouhani and are increasingly dismissing him as a figure of the past, the right answer in the Obama era but the wrong one now. Many expect the next president to be a far more combative figure, in the mold of the former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. “For this Trump, we need to talk and act tough,” said Hamidreza Taraghi, a   analyst. “Mr. Rouhani speaks beautiful words, but they are empty. We can deal with Mr. Trump. He is a businessman, but we should not compromise. ”"

=====================================
By Ed Caryl
The climate calamity crowd claims that the warming we experienced in the Twentieth Century is unprecedented… it has never happened before in human history. Because we didn’t have thermometers until about 300 years ago, and even then records exist from just a few locations, it is difficult to prove that this is not so.
The only reliable temperature record we have with continuous reasonable resolution data is the ice core oxygen isotope data from Greenland. I downloaded the GISP2 data and did a point-by-point difference calculation, computing the warming and cooling trend between each data point, and produced this plot.

Figure 1 is a plot (blue) of the GISP2 temperature data and the calculated warming or cooling (red) between each point expressed as change (warming or cooling) per decade. The horizontal scale is in years before present. Because Excel places zero on the left side and counts up to the right, the present is on the left.
There have been 73 warming periods…
Temperatures in the Holocene have been quite volatile. Excel counts in this data 73 warming periods of at least 0.1 degrees per decade, and 80 cooling periods of that same amount. The time resolution of the points in the data are from about six years to about twenty years, so many of these warming and cooling periods are short. But some span a century or longer as we will see in figure 2.
I processed the HADCRUT4 data set to six year resolution to simulate the ice core data here. The highest warming was in the six year period from 1975 to 1981, a rate of 0.27°C/decade. There were two periods in the ice core data with higher warming rates, one was in 1370 BCE where in a 12 year period the warming rate was 0.357°C/decade. This period was bracketed by similar length periods with 0.25 and 0.16°C/decade warming periods. This 34-year period saw a warming of nearly a degree (0.98°C) far exceeding the warming in the late Twentieth Century.
Another period 8200 years ago (6200BCE) saw a 1.667°C warming in 71 years. The people around at that time must have been truly panicked at the rapid climate change and probably blamed it on the invention of beer.

Here is a chart of the ice core temperature and HADCRUT4 together as an anomaly plot using the same baseline period, spliced at 1850-55, the only years they have in common.

Figure 2 is a plot of the ice core (GISP2) and HADCRUT4 as an anomaly plot. The vertical scale is in degrees C. The horizontal scale is calendar years with the present on the right.
HADCRUT4 is the thermometer-measured, small, red, “Hockey-stick” at the right side. All the excitement is about half of that red uptick. The big question: Is it natural, or CO2?
In Figure 2, many heating and cooling periods with high magnitude and longer duration than the current warming are seen. The two periods described above are seen at 1400BCE and 6200BCE, but there are others scattered across the plot. The current warming appears puny in comparison and only half of that is in any way attributable to CO2.
Greenland tells a lot
Some detractors have tried to make the point that Greenland ice core data only reflects Greenland temperatures. This isn’t quite correct on several counts. Oxygen isotope fractionation acts at three places: the area of evaporation and the points of condensation and precipitation. These phenomena are latitude dependent and the evaporation area is diffuse. So the ice core data reflects temperature at Greenland’s latitude.
Another point (though it only applies to the first 3000 years on this chart) is that during the Ice Age, the ice sheets removed so much fresh water from the oceans that it increased the salinity of the remainder, affecting surface oxygen isotope levels. This is also factored into the temperature calculation (link). Also, the ice core temperature data is averaged over the years represented at each section of core. This temperature represents climate over those years and not weather. The last point is that heat exchange between Greenland latitudes and the oceans, and thus the rest of the globe, insures that Greenland temperature cannot be far from reflecting global temperature.
A larger point is that the current warming is not unusual. Even greater warming has occurred many times in the last 11,000 years. It has been as much as two degrees warmer than now three times in the last 10,000 years. More important, warming episodes are followed by cooling episodes that can be disastrous for mankind. The long-term trend for the last 3000 years of the Holocene has been cooling. We are slowly sliding into the next long cold at about half a degree C per millennium.
The Excel spreadsheet used to generate the figures and calculations is here.

"Greta Thunberg has accused EU politicians of failing to acknowledge the scale of the climate crisis and said its €750bn Covid-19 recovery plan does not do enough to tackle the issue. The climate campaigner said the package of measures agreed by EU leaders proved that politicians were still not treating climate change as an emergency. “They are still denying the fact and ignoring the fact that we are facing a climate emergency, and the climate crisis has still not once been treated as a crisis,” Thunberg told the Guardian. “As long as the climate crisis is not being treated as a crisis, the changes that are necessary will not happen.” EU leaders reached agreement on the recovery fund in the early hours of Tuesday and pledged that 30% of the package would go towards climate policies, but few details were given. Thunberg, 17, and other leaders of the school strikes movement across Europe said the package was inadequate. Luisa Neubauer, 24, a central figure in Germany’s school strikes movement, said young people were becoming increasingly frustrated with politicians. “We are asking our leaders to take care of the most fundamental thing: the safety of us, the safety of people around the world, the safety of our futures,” Neubauer said. “It is worrying on a democratic level when you ask for such substantial things, which seem so obvious, and yet you see how leaders are widely ignoring it, or not considering it to be as important as other things.” Another prominent school striker, Adélaïde Charlier, 19, from Belgium, said politicians who adopted the language of climate action without following up with urgent policy measures were worse than climate deniers. “When leaders minimise the climate crisis, I feel it is more dangerous than leaders that outright deny it … because then we actually feel we can rely on them and we are actually on the right path and that is dangerous and wrong.” The group has written an open letter to EU leaders demanding they act immediately to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis. The letter, signed by 80,000 people including some of the world’s leading scientists, argues that the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that most leaders are able to act swiftly and decisively when they deem it necessary, but that the same urgency has been missing in the response to climate change. “It is now clearer than ever that the climate crisis has never once been treated as a crisis, neither from the politicians, media, business nor finance. And the longer we keep pretending that we are on a reliable path to lower emissions and that the actions required to avoid a climate disaster are available within today’s system … the more precious time we will lose,” it says. The letter argues that the climate and ecological emergency can only be addressed by tackling the underlying “social and racial injustices and oppression that have laid the foundations of our modern world”. Earlier this year the EU unveiled its green new deal proposals, which it said aimed to transform the bloc from a high- to a low-carbon economy without reducing prosperity and while improving people’s quality of life. The climate strikers dismissed the EU’s target of net zero emissions by 2050 as dangerously unambitious. Thunberg, who this week was awarded Portugal’s Gulbenkian prize for humanity and pledged the €1m ($1.15m) award to groups working to protect the environment and halt climate change, said it was up to ordinary people to stand up and demand that politicians rise to the challenge. “I see the hope in democracy and in people,” she said. “If people become aware of what is happening then we can accomplish anything, we can put pressure on people in power … if we just decide we have had enough then that will change everything.” "

Warming may not swamp islands

by Christopher Pala  Science 1 August 2014:  Vol. 345  no. 6196  pp. 496-497  DOI: 10.1126/science.345.6196.496 
In an interview with CNN last month, Anote Tong, the president of Kiribati, insisted that rising sea levels due to global warming will mean “total annihilation” for this nation of 33 coral islands in the Central Pacific and for other atoll island nations like Tuvalu and the Maldives.
In May, Kiribati bought 22 square kilometers of land in Fiji as a haven for displaced citizens, cementing Kiribati’s reputation as an early victim of climate change. No doubt, the sea is coming: Global sea levels are expected to rise up to 1 meter by 2100. But recent geologic studies suggest that the coral reefs supporting sandy atoll islands will grow and rise in tandem with the sea. The only Pacific atoll islanders who will have to move must do so for the same reason as millions of people on the continents: because they live too close to shore.

Unfortunately, the article is paywalled, if anyone has access drop me a note please. See update below.
Besides the posts from Willis and Andy above on how atolls like Kiribati float and move (unless you kill all the coral, Alling et al. 2007 shows Kirbati is ground zero for El Nino warming, plus there’s contributing environmental mis-management), the biggest fly in the ointment for the claim made by the current president of Kiribati is the fact that the Maldives (which is also mostly atolls and also claims to be threatened by sea level rise, but it isn’t true) are building new airports for tourism.
One, Kooddoo, is already open for business.
The main airport is adding a new modern passenger terminal, seen in this concept video:

And then there’s this from Wikipedia about the Male airport:
The agreement signed between the Maldives government and GMR Group included the upgrading and renovation of the airport up to the standard of a global airport by the year 2014. GMIAL announced that the development plans included reclaiming more land at the eastern end of the runway; where a new terminal is to be built. This terminal will consist of 3 separate bridged buildings. Plans for a separate cargo terminal was also announced.[15]
The Maldives, for all its troubles and supposed climate worries, doesn’t seem to get the fact that the last thing you do is spend money on new airports, passenger terminals, and cargo terminals on the islands you are supposedly going to have to eventually abandon.
Having your hand out for “climate change trust money” while building new airports to handle increased tourism doesn’t wash. “Scam” is too nice of a word to use here.

Studies suggest that atoll islands will rise in step with a rising sea
By Christopher Pala, on South Tarawa
As the minibus wobbles over the dusty, pothole-filled road that runs the length of South Tarawa island, a song blasting over Kiribati’s state radio envisions an apocalypse for this fishhook-shaped atoll halfway between Honolulu and Fiji: “The angry sea will kill us all.” The song, which won a competition organized by Kiribati’s government, reflects the views of President Anote Tong, who has been warning for years of a knockout punch from climate change.
…
No doubt, the sea is coming: In a 2013 report, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that global sea levels will rise up to 1 meter by 2100. But recent geologic studies suggest that the coral reefs supporting sandy atoll islands will grow and rise in tandem with the sea. The only islanders who will have to move must do so for the same reason as millions of people on the continents: because they live too close to shore.
Paul Kench, a geomorphologist who now heads the University of Auckland’s School of Environment in New Zealand, was the first to question the dire forecasts for Kiribati and similar island nations. In 1999, the World Bank asked him to evaluate the economic costs of sea-level rise and climate change to Pacific island nations. Kench, who had been studying how atoll islands evolve over time, says he had assumed that a rising ocean would engulf the islands, which consist of sand perched on reefs. “That’s what everyone thought, and nobody questioned it,” he says. But when he scoured the literature, he could not find a single study to support that scenario.
So Kench teamed up with Peter Cowell, a geomorphologist at the University of Sydney in Australia, to model what might happen. They found that during episodes of high seas—at high tide during El Niño events, which raise sea level in the Central Pacific, for example—storm waves would wash over higher and higher sections of atoll islands. But instead of eroding land, the waves would raise island elevation by depositing sand produced from broken coral, coralline algae, mollusks, and foraminifera.
Kench notes that reefs can grow 10 to 15 mill imeters a year—faster than the sea-level rise expected to occur later this century. “As long as the reef is healthy and generates an abundant supply of sand, there’s no reason a reef island can’t grow and keep up,” he argues. This equilibrium may not mean that all areas of atolls will remain habitable, says Scott Smithers, a geomorphologist at James Cook University, Townsville, in Australia. “The changes might happen at a rate that exceeds the recovery,” he says. But the geologic record is reassuring, Kench and others found when they drilled deep cores into reef islands to probe how they responded to past sea-level changes. In a February report in Geophysical Research Letters, the researchers found that the island of Jabat in the Marshall Islands emerged on a reef 4800 to 4000 years ago, when sea levels were rising as fast as they are expected to rise over the next century. Other support for the model has come from monitoring how shorelines respond to seasonal
…
Vanua Levu in Fiji is a less appealing refuge. The purchase was “a publicity stunt,” scoffs Teburoro Tito, a former president of Kiribati and member of the opposition party Protect the Maneaba. Already home to 270 farmers from the Solomon Islands, the steep, hilly tract may accommodate only a few hundred more people. If the optimists are right, no one from Kiribati will have to leave their country anyway.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo days ago I wrote about the cold weather that’s been gripping Germany and Central Europe. Well, things are about to get worse early this weekend, and not better.
The online Munich-based Abendzeiting (Evening News) here reports the latest weather forecast of frost and snow that are set to hit Germany – in June…on the first day of summer!
Snow in Bavaria down to 1500 meters
The online news site writes that this year “summer is starting out wet and cold: Ground frost in the north, snow in the Alps“.
Though snow is not an unusual event in the Alps at higher elevations above 2500 meters, it is unusual when it happens at just 1500 meters in the summertime. The Abendzeitung writes:
Things don’t look better down south. In the Bavarian Alps the snowfall level will drop to 1500 to 1800 meters. On Zugspitze up to 50 centimeters of snow will fall.”
This morning my wife even turned the furnace back on, as many other homes have done in Germany over the past days. “It’s too friggin cold,” she told me.

Climate forecasts of scorching hot Europe summers refuted
In the early 2000s climate scientists predicted Europe would have to get used to scorching hot and parched summers, similar to that seen in 2003. However, more than 10 years later, summers have been cooler and wetter than normal, thus so far defying the climate scientists’ predictions.
And this summer does not appear to be anything different. The Abendzeitung quotes meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetter.net:
I don’t believe we are going to experience an extremely hot July or August. The run-up to the summer this year has been similar to 2013 and 2014. In both of those years the spring was like in 2015: stable, dry and very sunny. In both years variable and only moderately warm summers followed. I anticipate the same for this year.”
The coming cold is just the latest in an extended string of well below normal temperatures. Last week northern Germany saw 5 consecutive mornings with ground surface frost, a “very unusual” event, Jung reported earlier.
Scientists got the science all wrong
Naturally the recent unusual cold weather has nothing to do with a climate trend; it is just weather – something the global warming alarmists like to forget when hot weather hits. Still, it is important to remind them that they once told us such cold events were “a thing of the past”, that children would never know them and that instead we needed to prepare for hot scorcher periods.
Surprise! The cold events have been becoming more frequent in Germany over the past quarter century, thus bluntly refuting the models. The climate scientists need to admit that they got the science on this all wrong.

—Milton Friedman (1991)



—Sebastian Edwards (2019)



Following the failed Marxist experiment of Chilean President Salvador Allende, a free‐​market revolution led by the so‐​called Chicago Boys in the 1970s and 1980s created the conditions necessary for the country to experience an “economic miracle” that captured worldwide attention.1 As Nobel laureate economist Gary Becker (1997) put it, Chile became “an economic role model for the whole underdeveloped world.” This performance, said Becker, “became still more impressive when the government was transformed into a democracy.” Along the same lines, Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman argued that the reforms introduced by the Chicago Boys “proved highly successful and were preserved intact when Chile finally returned to democracy in 1989” (Krugman 2008: 31). Indeed, from 1990 to 2010 a left‐​wing coalition called “Concertación” came to power. Despite having been comprised of opponents to the military dictatorship and by many former members of Salvador Allende’s government, Concertación kept in place the foundations of the free‐​market system. A pragmatic view prevailed, leading to the recognition and adoption of the economic legacy of the Pinochet years. As Alejandro Foxley, the first finance minister of the democratic period explained:



For conservatives in the west, Chile’s economic reforms were a symbolic victory in the fight against socialism and progressivism. As historian Niall Ferguson (2008: 216) has pointed out, the “backlash against welfare started in Chile.” Moreover, according to Ferguson, the Chilean economic reforms such as the privatization of its social security system were “far more radical than anything that has been attempted in the United States, the heartland of free market economics.… Thatcher and Reagan came later” (ibid.). Along the same lines William Ratliff and Robert Packenham (2007) have argued that Chile was the first country in the world to make “that momentous break with the past away from socialism and extreme state capitalism” preceding “Margaret Thatcher’s Britain and Ronald Reagan’s United States.” For Marxist intellectual David Harvey (2005: 7–8), “the first experiment of neoliberal state formation occurred in Chile after Pinochet’s coup” providing “helpful evidence to support the subsequent turn to neoliberalism in both Britain (under Thatcher) and the US (under Reagan).”



George H. W. Bush’s visit to Chile in 1990 affirmed the symbolism of the Chicago Boys’ success story. On his arrival in Santiago, Bush (1990) declared that “Chile’s peaceful return to the ranks of the world’s democracies” was cause for “pride and celebration.” He went on to emphasize the importance of the free‐​market revolution that had taken place under the military government of General Pinochet: “Chile’s record of economic accomplishment is a lesson for Latin America on the power of the free market. Nowhere among the nations of this continent has the pace of free‐​market reform gone farther, faster than right here in Chile.” Along the same lines, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1999) declared that Pinochet’s regime had turned Chile “from chaotic collectivism into the model economy of Latin America.”



The available data overwhelmingly support these views. Chronic inflation, which had peaked at over 500 percent in 1973, fell below 10 percent by the 1990s and under 5 percent by the 2000s (World Bank 2019). Between 1975 and 2015 per capita income in Chile quadrupled to $23,000, the highest rate in Latin America (CNP 2016). As a result, from the early 1980s to 2014 poverty fell from 45 percent to 8 percent (CNP 2016). Several indicators show that this “economic miracle” benefited the majority of the population. For example, in 1982 only 27 percent of Chileans had a TV set. By 2014, 97 percent did (CNP 2016). The same is true for refrigerators (from 49 percent to 96 percent), washing machines (from 35 percent to 93 percent), cars (from 18 percent to 48 percent), and other items. More importantly, life expectancy rose from 69 to 79 years in the same time period and housing overcrowding fell from 56 percent to 17 percent. The middle class as defined by the World Bank, grew from 23.7 percent of the population in 1990 to 64.3 percent in 2015 and extreme poverty fell from 34.5 percent to 2.5 percent (Libertad y Desarrollo 2017: 3). On average, access to higher education grew by a factor of five in the same time period mostly benefiting the bottom quintile, which saw its access to higher education increase by eight times (PNUD 2017: 20). This is consistent with the growth of income in the different socioeconomic groups. While between 1990 and 2015 the income of the richest 10 percent grew a total of 30 percent, the income of the poorest 10 percent saw an increase of 145 percent (PNUD 2017: 21). In turn, the Gini index fell from 52.1 in 1990 to 47.6 in 2015 (PNUD 2017: 37). If income inequality is measured within the different generations the reduction is even greater (Sapelli 2014). Other measures of inequality also show a narrowing of the gap between the rich and the rest of the population. The Palma index, which measures the income inequality of the richest 10 percent relative to the bottom 40 percent, fell from 3.58 to 2.78 in the same time period while the ratio between the incomes of the bottom and the top quintiles decreased from 14.8 to 10.8 (PNUD 2017: 21) In addition to this decline in income inequality, a 2017 OECD report showed that Chile had more social mobility than all other OECD countries (2018).2 Chile also held the highest position among Latin American nations in the 2019 UN Human Development Index (PNUD 2019).



In short, thanks to the free‐​market reforms introduced by the Chicago Boys and maintained by the democratic regimes that came later, Chile became the most prosperous country in Latin America, which mostly benefitted the poorest members of the population.



To many, the enormous economic and social progress that Chile has achieved in the last four decades seems to be in full contradiction with the crisis that broke out in October 2019, characterized by mass demonstrations, coordinated violence by small groups, and demands by the political left and others to abandon Chile’s free‐​market model. The crisis upended Chilean politics and society, leading to a planned referendum on writing a new constitution.3 Some have described Chile’s current situation as a “paradox” (Edwards 2019). Indeed, it seems paradoxical that a country that has achieved so much prosperity has bitterly turned against the very institutions that made that prosperity possible.



Part of the explanation for the rage showed by the Chilean population has to do with the collapse in public trust of traditional civic and state institutions, including democracy. Between 2009 and 2015 people who believed that Chile’s democracy worked well or very well plummeted from 26 percent to 10 percent, and those who believed that it worked poorly rose from 16 percent to 32 percent (Aninat and González 2016: 3). From 2015 to 2019, the first group shrank further to 6 percent and the second group rose to 47 percent. (CEP 2019). Institutions such as the Catholic Church, radio broadcasters, the police and armed forces, political parties and businesses have experienced similar or in some cases even more dramatic declines in public trust (Aninat and González 2016: 4).



Chile has also experienced a systematic decline in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, which assigns countries with higher public perceptions of corruption a lower ranking. From 2012 to 2018, the South American country’s corruption perception index fell every single year—that is, the public viewed it as progressively more corrupt—ultimately dropping a total of six positions to become the 27th least corrupt country among 183 nations (Libertad y Desarrollo 2019). Even more troubling are the results of a 2017 OECD report on the level of trust Chile’s population has in its judicial system. Chile scored last among all of the nations the OECD surveyed, with the exception of the Ukraine, lagging behind countries like Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Russia, among others (OECD 2017). A more general survey in 2019 showed that 58 percent of Chileans believed that state institutions in Chile were corrupt (Datavoz 2019: 4). In a 2017 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study, 34 percent of Chileans surveyed declared to have been mistreated by a public employee (PNUD 2017: 211).



Not only corruption but also chronic inefficiency contributed to the loss of legitimacy of state institutions. According to the 2016 World Economic Forum Competitiveness Index, government inefficiency was the main obstacle to doing business in Chile (World Economic Forum 2016: 144–45). All these problems have led to major proposals for reforming Chile’s inefficient state apparatus, which is a crucial step for strengthening its democracy.4



Without a doubt, the recent decline in public trust of Chile’s private and state institutions contributed to the climate of discontent and frustration that manifested in the crisis that broke out in October 2019. But this alone cannot explain Chile’s departure from the free market formula that made it so successful. If Chile’s elites and general population truly understood that free market institutions are crucial for the country’s continued path to prosperity, then large groups among the protesters and the intellectual and political elites would not be demanding drastic changes to what is derogatorily referred to as Chile’s “neoliberal” system.



If, as Friedrich Hayek believed, ideas and ideologies are the main drivers of social evolution (Hayek 2006: 98), then Chile is a clear example of how ideas hostile to economic freedom and favorable to state interventionism can gain traction, which in Chile’s case undermined the legacy of the Chicago Boys. Indeed, material equality, the old obsession of the left, became the creed of the majority of Chile’s political and intellectual class. Material equality was also endorsed by the Catholic Church, a large part of Chile’s business community and highly influential among its cultural elites. The results of this egalitarian narrative were gradual institutional changes that over the years, leading to declining rates of economic growth. As René Cortázar, former minister in Michelle Bachelet’s first administration, put it:



Cortázar, an MIT economist at the center‐​left think tank CIEPLAN, crucially noted that the “emphasis was placed only on distributive aspects” adding that “distributive results were criticized with bitterness” although wages were rising like never before (Cortázar 2019: 12). By far the most aggressive egalitarian government along the lines denounced by Cortázar was Bachelet’s second term (2014–18), in which several statist reforms were passed with the aim of “terminating neoliberal vestiges,” as Bachelet herself put it.5 Bachelet’s labor, tax, and educational reforms, combined with an extremely hostile narrative against businesses and market ideas, caused one of the most unprecedented economic downturns in decades. Indeed, between 2014 and 2017 Chile’s average economic growth rate was 1.8 percent, the lowest since the early 1980s and almost a third of the rate of 5.2 percent achieved in the previous four years of Sebastián Piñera’s 2010–14 administration (Bergoeing 2017: 7).6



Many on the left tried to blame Bachelet’s poor economic performance on international factors, but during her “anti‐​neoliberal” administration the world enjoyed an average growth rate of 3 percent. As economist Raphael Bergoeing pointed out, international conditions were favorable to Chile’s economic growth under Bachelet. Moreover, a moderate estimate indicates that in absence of Bachelet’s statist reforms Chile would have grown at rates of 4 percent a year (Bergoeing 2017: 7). The climate of uncertainty that Bachelet created was clearly reflected in the rates of investment. Since data collection began in the early 1960s, until Bachelet’s administration, Chile had never shown four consecutive years of decreasing investment (ibid.: 12).7



A crucial document for understanding the Bachelet administration’s anti‐​liberal philosophy was a book written by five members of her brain trust shortly before she was elected for a second time. The book was titled _The Other Model: From the Neoliberal Order to a Regime of the Public_ ( _El otro modelo. Del orden neoliberal al régimen de lo público_ ), and the cover showed five workers destroying a brick (Atria et al. 2013).8 “The brick” was the name given to the economic program written by the Chicago Boys in the early 1970s and implemented after the fall of Allende. The message of the cover—and the book itself—was clear: the Chicago Boys’ economic model had to be terminated, and Bachelet, who was the star speaker at the book’s launch in 2013, should lead that process. According to _The Other Model_ , neoliberalism and individualism had created an unequal, selfish, and unjust society where a privileged few had access to things that should be considered rights for everyone. In the view of the authors, governments were responsible for making sure that no differences existed when it came to economic goods such as education, pensions, or anything else the authors defined as a “social right.” The authors further argued that it was only when the market logic had been expelled from these spheres that an equal and fair society based on solidarity could emerge. Although it did so in different terms, _The Other Model_ presented and defended a socialist ideology and political system. Bachelet’s second government embodied this radical ideology, and the reforms followed.



Due to the persistence of the egalitarian narrative over the years, large parts of the public bought into the idea that neoliberalism had led to more inequality and injustices even though income inequality was actually decreasing. When, in February 2020, Bachelet, as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, declared that inequality was the cause of the demonstrations in Chile and Ecuador, she reinforced the perception of large parts of Chile’s population.9 Indeed, according to opinion polls published in December 2019, Chileans believed that the main reason for the social crisis had been the high level of income inequality (CEP 2019). ECLAC’s 2015 Index of Perceived Inequality showed that Chile was the country with the highest perceived income inequality in Latin America. In addition, the same index showed that the perception that income distribution was unfair had increased over the years.



If the consensus among elites was that inequality was Chile’s main problem before the social crisis, it is no surprise that after the crisis broke out this consensus was reinforced. In reference to the popular explanation for the crisis, Carlos Peña, an influential center‐​left scholar, observed: “If we take at face value the immediate reactions of these days, the cause of the phenomena would be injustice and especially the unquestionable inequality that affects Chilean society” (Peña 2020: 11–12).10 Peña himself correctly noted, however, that the country had never been more prosperous and equal than in present times. This meant that the well‐​established idea that economic inequality had been the cause of the social crisis was “intellectually incorrect” (ibid.: 13). Instead, Peña rightly argued, it was the perception of inequality that had changed. Thus, even if inequality had decreased in Chile, people had become more sensitive to it because the feeling that the existing inequality was legitimate had eroded (ibid.: 128–29). It was precisely this feeling of unfairness, to a large extent created by egalitarian narratives, which paved the way to the disastrous reforms of Bachelet’s second administration. In turn those reforms created additional frustration with the system by bringing the train of economic progress to a halt. After Bachelet, Piñera came to power a second time by promising to bring back “better times,” in the words of his campaign slogan. After failing to deliver, the social crisis erupted.



Part of the reason why the crisis will be so hard to resolve in Chile is that opinion makers do not realize that its origins are mainly ideological. It is through this lens that the widespread attacks on the free market have to be understood. Center‐​left sociologist Eugenio Tironi was correct when he argued that the massive demonstrations of 2019 were ideologically opposed to the economic model of the Chicago Boys (Tironi 2020: 26–27). Like Peña and many others, however, Tironi did not seem to understand that perceptions of that model’s legitimacy had been eroded by the egalitarian ideologies that intellectuals like himself and others had popularized. This shifted the country’s political and economic institutions almost entirely towards redistributionism.



As Douglass North (1988: 15) observed, ideologies refer to the “subjective perceptions that people have about what the world is like and what it ought to be.” Insofar as ideologies entail a prescriptive component, they “affect people’s perception about the fairness or justice of the institutions of a political economic system” (ibid.). Moreover, because the ideologies and beliefs available in a given culture ultimately define the form of government that determines the formal rules of the game—namely, property rights and enforcement characteristics—it is not a surprise, said North (1993), that efficient economic markets are so exceptional.



North (1990: 110–11) also argued that ideology is key to understanding the poor economic performance of Third World countries, since their ideologies usually promote policies that provide institutional constraints and discourage productive activity. Indeed, in the case of Chile, the nation’s egalitarian ideology led to changes in its formerly free market institutional framework, transforming its system into one increasingly incapable of delivering beneficial economic results. This fueled egalitarian narratives even further because, as is typical of ideological dogmatists, proponents of the egalitarian system refused to change their views. Against all evidence, frequent repetition of the idea that the country’s troubles were the result of extreme inequality and social injustice ended up convincing many people that the system had to be socialized further. As psychologist Daniel Kahneman has argued, “a reliable way of making people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth” (2012: 62).



In a sense, the Chicago Boys’ economic model was doomed to be dismantled with the passing of time. The fact that the governments that came after the Chicago Boys accepted their reforms does not mean that these administrations had a profound understanding of the positive nature of market forces, let alone a genuine moral commitment to economic freedom. Patricio Aylwin, the first president after the Pinochet years, best reflected the center‐​left view on the market when in the early 1990s, he declared:



The lack of real commitment to economic freedom on the political and intellectual left—as well as on growing segments of the right—allowed more radical socialist narratives to gain greater acceptance. The influence of socialist groups grew so powerful that the center‐​left political parties responsible for administrating the Chicago Boys’ market reforms felt too ashamed to vindicate the enormous prosperity that market forces achieved under their own governments. With almost no exceptions, they never defended their legacy from the attacks by the radical left.



Legal scholar and former Concertación minister Jorge Correa explained that one of the causes of the demise of the moderate Concertación, which in turn enabled the rise of the radicalized left wing coalition Nueva Mayoría,11 was that its members were “ashamed” to say that they were “supporters of the market.… Never did we really dare to defend with clear theses what we were embracing in practice” (Correa 2018: 223). Recognizing the importance of the battle of ideas in political warfare, the former minister added: “The defeat was cultural rather than political. It’s impossible to be successful in politics if you feel ashamed, even less so if you don’t dare to show your set of ideas” (ibid.). Concertación, he concluded, “committed suicide … she stopped believing in herself, defending her work” (ibid.).



The center right did not really engage in a strong defense of market principles either. Piñera best expressed the compromising tone the center right took toward egalitarian ideologies during his first administration. In a famous speech given in 2010, he declared:



Following this vision, in his second administration, Piñera launched a program to expand social benefits to the middle class called C _lase Media Protegida_ (Protected Middle Class). The program reflected a social democratic philosophy that validated the idea that the government’s role was to take care of the population’s well‐​being. Thus, Piñera moved Chile one step further along the path toward becoming a welfare state.13



Along these lines, after the social crisis broke out in October 2019, Piñera made a speech apologizing to the Chilean people for the injustices of the country’s economic system, and announcing a massive increase in government spending:



Piñera further declared that “there were many coincidences, both in the diagnosis and in the solutions” of the crisis with the leaders of the left—the same politicians who were blaming “neoliberalism” and inequality for the crisis.



The unwillingness of Concertación—and many center right politicians such as President Sebastián Piñera—to clearly defend the free market precipitated the collapse of the political and social consensus upon which Chile’s economic institutions had been based. This climate opened the door for a complete transformation of Chile’s economic model, the degree of which will only be clear with the passing of time and once the new constitutional experiment Chile set in motion in 2019 is complete. In any case, and regardless of the exact outcome of the constitutional question, if there is anything that the fall of Chile can teach the world, it is that, once again, the power of ideas and ideologies is far greater than the appeal of facts. In other words, Chile confirms the old classical liberal lesson that there is no hope for the survival of the free market absent the moral case for economic liberty. That case, which must be accepted by the minds of the public, must also be made, at least in part, by the intellectual, political, and economic elite.

1 In the 1950s the Catholic University and the University of Chicago began an exchange program that enabled Chilean students to pursue postgraduate studies at the Department of Economics of the University of Chicago. These students came to be known as the “Chicago Boys,” a label that was also applied to other students who graduated from American universities other than Chicago and took part in the implementation of free‐​market reforms under the Pinochet regime.



2 According to the study, it was more likely for people with parents in the bottom 25 percent of the income scale to move to the top 25 percent of the income scale in Chile than in any other OECD country.



3 In October 2019, Sebastián Piñera’s government announced a small increase in the price of public transportation fares in Santiago. Demands for a withdrawal of the increase became widespread after the new fare was implemented. Initially, the government showed no willingness to reconsider what it correctly called a “technical” measure. As a result, hundreds of students began to evade payment of the subway. On October 18, two weeks after the price increase had been announced, the country exploded. Coordinated groups burned and destroyed almost 80 subway stations bringing Santiago’s public transportation system to a halt. Riots and massive attacks on public and private property followed unleashing chaos in the capital city. By the end of the day, the situation was so desperate that Mr. Piñera had no choice but to declare a state of emergency and put the military in control. Massive demonstrations followed and Piñera gave in to the demands of the left to substantially increase the size of government and to create a new constitution through a constitutional assembly or a convention. The referendum that would initiate the constitutional process was supposed to take place in April 2020 but it was postponed to October 2020 due to the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis.

6 Even though Chile experienced high economic growth under Piñera’s first administration, the capacity of the Chilean economy to grow did not reverse its declining trend. From 1990 to 2016, potential GDP declined from close to 7.5 percent to around 4 percent (see Le Fort Varela 2016).

10 There is another cause of the social crisis that Peña correctly mentioned in his work—namely, the excessive emotionality of the younger generations. According to Peña, Chilean students nowadays lack normative frameworks capable of orienting their lives beyond their mere subjectivity. As a result, they have grown intolerant, showing a tendency to break the socially accepted rules of conduct (Peña 2020: 142). This argument closely resembles Jonathan Haidt and Gregg Lukianoff’s analysis of the American youth in their work _The Coddling of the American Mind_ (2018). It should also be mentioned that another cause for frustration among middle class young people and their families is what can be called the “paradox of progress.” This refers to the fact that the economic returns on higher education—the main driver of social mobility in Chile over the last decades—have declined along with its massification. In other words, the same process that has allowed millions to move upward in the income scale has made the goal of a high income and the social status associated with it more elusive (Klapp and Candia 2016).



11 Nueva Mayoría was the coalition of leftwing political parties that succeeded the Concertación and which came to power with Bachelet in her second administration. Although it incorporated all former members of Concertación, it also included far leftwing political parties such as the old Communist Party. It also made alliances with the new far left populist coalition Frente Amplio.

Former presidential candidate Joaquin Lavin, one of the most emblematic and popular centre‐​right politicians in the country went even further than Piñera. In a column published in _El Mercurio_ , he argued that Chile needed to “change its development model” because it had created two separate countries just like the Berlin Wall had created two separate Germanys. Lavin called for a social “reunification” and attacked Chile’s economic elite for hindering social mobility. He also denounced the “horizontal inequality” that in his opinion characterized Chilean society. By this concept, Lavin was referring to inequalities in health care, housing and education. In Lavin’s view, these injustices had to be “terminated” trough more efficient government spending, higher levels of taxation and different public policies than those implemented thus far (Lavin: 2019).

"The East Asian monsoon covers much of the largest continent on Earth leading to rain in the summer in Japan, the Koreas and lots of China. Ultimately, more than 1.5 billion people depend on the water it provides for agriculture, industry and hydroelectric power.  Understanding the monsoon is essential. That is why colleagues and I recently reconstructed its behaviour throughout its 145m-year history, in order to better understand how it acts in response to changes in geography or the wider climate in the very long term, and what that might mean for the future.  Our study, published in the journal Science Advances indicates that the East Asian monsoon is much older and more varied than previously thought. Until quite recently the general consensus was that the monsoon came into being around 23m years ago, some time after the Tibetan Plateau was formed. However, we show that it has been ever present for at least the past 145m years (except during the Late Cretaceous: the era of T. Rex), regardless of whether there was a Tibetan Plateau or how much CO₂ was in the atmosphere.  At its most simple level a monsoon is a highly seasonal distribution in precipitation leading to a distinct “wet” and “dry” seasons – the word even derives from the Arabic “mausim”, translated as “season”.  The East Asian monsoon is a “sea breeze monsoon”, the most common type. They form because land and sea heat up at different rates, so high pressure forms over the sea and low pressure over land which results in wind blowing onshore in the summer. Although The Tibetan Plateau is not strictly needed to form the East Asian monsoon it can serve to enhance it. At 5km or more above sea level, the plateau simply sits much higher in the atmosphere and thus the air above it is heated much more than the same air would be at a lower elevation (consider the ground temperature in Tibet compared to the freezing air 5km above your head). As that Tibetan air is warmer than the surrounding cold air it rises and acts as a heat “pump”, sucking more air in to replace it and enhancing the monsoon circulation.  We found the intensity of the monsoon has varied significantly over the past 145m years. At first, it was around 30% weaker than today. Then, during the Late Cretaceous 100-66m years ago, a huge inland sea covered much of North America and weakened the Pacific trade winds. This caused East Asia to become very arid due to the monsoon disappearing.  However, rainfall patterns changed substantially after the Indian tectonic plate collided into the Asian continent around 50m years ago, forming the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. As the land rose up, so did the strength of the monsoon. Our results suggest that 5-10m years ago there were “super-monsoons” with rainfall 30% stronger than today.  But how can we be sure that such changes were caused by geography, and not elevated carbon dioxide concentrations? To test this, we again modelled the climate for all different time periods (roughly every 4m years) and increased or reduced the amount of CO₂ in the atmosphere to see what effect this had on the monsoon. In general, irrespective of time period chosen, the monsoon showed little sensitivity (-1% to +13%) to changes in CO₂ compared to the impact of changes in regional geography.  The monsoon in East Asia is mainly a result of its favourable geographic position and regional topography – though our work shows that CO₂ concentrations do have an impact, they are secondary to tectonics.  The past can help us better understand how the monsoon will behave as the climate changes – but its not a perfect analogue. Although rainfall increased almost every time CO₂ doubled in the past, each of these periods was unique and dependent on the specific geography at the time.  The reassuring thing is that climate models are showing agreement with geological data through the past. That means we have greater confidence that climate models are able to accurately predict how the monsoon will respond over the next century as humans continue to emit more CO₂ into the atmosphere."
"Before you read this story, take a minute to stop and look around you. Now imagine your surroundings under two feet of dirty, sewage-filled water. If you’re at home, everything is trashed. Never mind your car, your furniture or washing machine. They will be ruined, but those things can be replaced. Think of your wedding album, soaked and spoiled. The music box your grandmother gave you, full of stinking mud. That is the reality of being flooded. And sadly, it’s a reality that many people in the UK – in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire – have faced in the recent floods. Tragically, floodwater can also be life-threatening.

      Flood defences simply aren't good enough – here’s what needs to be done


 Given the huge costs to people and property when it floods, it’s a reasonable question to ask why, in one of the richest countries in the world, more cannot be done to prevent flooding. And if not prevent it, to know more precisely when and where it will hit. As a hydrologist and a flood and hazard forecaster, I spend my life doing just that. And despite the work of some of the brightest scientists, the world’s most advanced supercomputers and the commitment of hardworking people on the ground, floods are just difficult beasts to pin down. And if you’ve ever thought that your home could never be affected, you should know that floods can happen almost anywhere, at any time. Some of the most wonderful aspects of the UK – the changeable weather and spectacular landscape – are also what makes the country so susceptible to flooding. When beautiful river valleys and low-lying plains – as well as cities and urban areas – are inundated with persistent rain, sudden downpours or high tides with storms, flooding can quickly follow. Especially if there is an unexpected fault in the infrastructure designed to hold back water or prevent flooding, as was seen at Whaley Bridge in Yorkshire in August 2019. In Doncaster in early November 2019, only a slight variation in a fairly typical weather system was enough to cause flooding. Cold and warm air masses regularly press against each other close to North America, creating an Atlantic storm factory. These weather systems are often fired towards Europe too by the strength and direction of the jet stream. Damp ground in the north of England is also par for the course. But add one heavy downpour, caused by a rotating weather front getting “stuck” over one area – and you have a flood. Weather predictions have come a long way in the past few decades – today’s three-day forecast is as accurate as a 24-hour forecast was in the 1990s. But they are never perfect. 


      Read more:
      Rivers are changing all the time, and it affects their capacity to contain floods


 Multiply all the uncertainty within the weather forecast with all the complexity of modelling the path of water travelling through the landscape – both above and below ground – then you start to get an idea of the difficulties forecasters face. We have to take account of all the different routes through the landscape that a single raindrop might take. There are billions upon billions of different possibilities. It requires lots of assumptions. So much for looking into the future. What about learning from the past? Many people in flood-hit areas have said that the floods are unprecedented. Older residents have said they have never seen anything like it. But we must remember our landscape is thousands – even millions – of years old. We need to think about much longer timescales than single human lifespans. And of course on top of this, the landscape and climate are changing – so even the best historic data don’t provide a good proxy of the future. Fishlake may not have flooded in recent years, but it is right on the floodplain of the River Don. Its watery name is probably no coincidence. Neither is that of Meadowhall, the shopping centre in Sheffield, more than likely built on a flood meadow. On November 8, it was marooned. But people tend to like living by the river – and they don’t associate a beautiful riverside development with dirty water and destroyed wedding photos. Flooding is hard to predict and prepare for. But floods happen. They always have – and we know that as the global climate warms due to human activity we are likely to see more of some types of flood in Britain. It’s hard to convince people who don’t know they are at risk that they should prepare for the worst. This is where the government must step in. To better prepare for floods, we need difficult, expensive, but rational decision-making on flood defences. That would mean seriously considering the risk of building homes and businesses in the floodplain, and planning away from these areas as much as possible. If there is no other option, then the flood-proof design standards must be substantially higher. Developers must also be held to account for ensuring these standards are met and householders must be made fully aware of the risks. Forecasts and communications of flood risks can always be improved, and my colleagues and I will be working hard on it for years to come. But residents, farmers and businesses can’t be expected to face off the problem of floods on their own."
"Takes initiative. An independent thinker. Engages in study outside of the curriculum. Cares deeply about her community and the world around her. Stands up for her convictions and beliefs. These are all qualities that would appear to make Ou Hongyi a suitable candidate for studying at her dream institution of Harvard University. For Ou, however, those qualities may scuttle her chance of even graduating from high school or taking college entrance examinations. As the first young person in China to engage in Greta Thunberg-inspired Fridays For Future climate strikes, Ou, 17, has become a target for the authorities who see that activism as a challenge to their control. Ou claims she has been told by authorities to ditch her climate activism as a condition for her restarting studies at Guangxi Normal University affiliated high school in Guilin, where she studied until late 2018. Ou, who also goes by the English name Howey, suspended her studies in December 2018 after being told she was “not suitable” for the international programme there and decided to study for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and US college admissions SAT test on her own.  But, following the wishes of her parents, and with dreams of pursuing higher education, she has been attempting in recent months to re-enter the school. Her parents have been called several times by provincial education authorities, Ou told the Guardian, urging them to stop her climate activism and not to conduct interviews with foreign media. Ou said her principal, Li Linbo, also told her in a meeting on 29 May that she must promise to end her climate activism before being readmitted, a claim corroborated by her father. Several attempts to reach her principal, including calls to his office and personal number, as well as faxed questions, were not responded to. “I don’t want to stop,” Ou said of her climate activism. “I want more people to know.” Authorities also required Howey to have a psychological test before applying for readmission. “The only negative thing it said was I’m stubborn,” she said. Ou Jun, her father, told the Guardian that her parents would not force her to give up her beliefs, but added that they were worried about her obsession and how it could derail her future. “She has anxiety about the climate,” he said. “We hope that she can graduate from high school, enter university, and hope that she can pay less attention to climate change issues.” While currently the top global carbon dioxide emitter, China is expected to meet its Paris Agreement pledge of peaking carbon emissions at or before 2030. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has also put the development of an “ecological civilisation” at the core of his policies, which would appear to be a natural fit with Ou’s own obsessions. It is not necessarily her concerns for the climate that have sparked a pressure campaign from authorities, Kecheng Fang, an assistant professor at the school of journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told the Guardian. “Most importantly, because it is about collective action,” he said. “No matter what kind of collective action it is, it’s considered highly sensitive.” While expressing concern about climate change is not forbidden, there has been a narrowing of discourse on the subject, particularly if it calls into question the ambition of authorities, Fang said. “The underlying logic is that basically you can talk about those topics that are considered less sensitive, but it matters how you talk about it.” While she waits to return to school, Ou has started her own initiative called Plant for Survival, whereby she is encouraging young people in China to plant more trees. From last November through to this January, the group planted more than 300 trees in and around Guilin."

This is a letter from John Rofe, a self-declared “Concerned Citizen” to Professor Gerrard, the NZ Prime Minister’s Science Advisor.   
As it is quite long we have ‘serialised’ it over a few days. 





I guess you probably won’t read this, so I will copy this email to a lot of people and perhaps it will resonate with someone. I am writing to you because I am told you are the NZ Prime Minister’s Science Advisor. The truth I have found from my research over 15 years. I will be happy to provide you with whatever further details you require. I am only an informed private citizen and only represent my own interests. 



I am not a scientist but I had a long career as a consultant and turnaround specialist to and for distressed organisations and that led me into being asked to sort out various frauds and scams over a long international career as a top consultant and forensic accountant. I find there are many similarities between those frauds and the biggest ever – the “Great Anthropogenic Global Warming fraud” that you have unwittingly become a peripheral player in. 



Now retired from my profession, my method was always to look closely at the actions of people who are running organisations and almost inevitably, to be drawn into dispute between those governing an organisation’s actions and the reality of their circumstances. It is common to see people trying to fix the effects of a problem because they cannot get their heads around causation. Human frailty and greed are often present in their actions. 



In the case of James Shaw and Jacinda Ardern, they were warned of their complicity to fraud in 2018 and have confessed to me they are – for whatever reason – accepting someone else’s dogma (the UN IPCC, no less). That is contrary to their fiduciary duty to the public of New Zealand, yet it is their excuse, and yet regardless of any excuse, **a fraud is just a fraud.**



Every day we see virtue signalling by people who know absolutely nothing about the scientific basis of the biggest madness of modern times. Today it just happens to be the turn of Lawyers…telling the NZ Herald how committed they are to what they do not realise is populist stupidity. 



The inability to deal with causation always happens on an enterprise scale as well as on either a city scale or a country scale. Folk like Jacinda and James are easily persuaded to deal with the minutiae of effects because it is those effects that most sway the voters. This is also reflected in the actions of Simon Bridges and his team as well, and I mean no disrespect by the comment. But if/when I start firing off writs, all that will change. 



I am involved, solely because I am a long term investor in international energy projects, mostly involving renewable and cutting edge technologies, so I unwittingly benefit from the incentives provided pursuant to the fraud. So with my fraud investigation experience and incentive to find out who is correct between the AGW alarmists and global warming sceptics, I have delved into the bowels of the science and find myself supporting an unpopular but empirically supported rejection of the UN IPCC line of lies and misdeeds. You and I find ourselves on different sides and yet I believe you and your career are the ones in the greatest danger. 



If necessary I will begin litigation in 2020 to sort this out. But in 2019 I had two humanitarian projects that spun from the fraud which took up my time and suing a Government whose regulations I have a hand in administering for the last 23 years did not seem a sensible course of action. I have now been granted leave to retire as a Justice of the Peace for New Zealand effective 5 November 2019. I sought leave to retire despite enjoying my duties, so I can clear the decks for action. **And one way or another, action is what we will see in 2020.**



Even so, I am not sure whether I will need to go to the bother of litigation as I expect unforeseen and terribly unfortunate climate change effects may intervene to lay the fraud bare for all to see. Perhaps in New Zealand, it is hard to imagine these occurring, because most of us never saw the warming that I witnessed the Northern hemisphere countries experiencing when I was commuting there in the 1980s and 90s. I then supported the UN IPCC position because I too was ignorant of causation and because it was not my problem to solve, so I never checked the facts. Similarly, the recent temperature crash and shorter growing seasons that have been witnessed in North America, Asia and Europe over the last three years are not yet visible here. Even so, recent events have forced me into a study of the difference between weather and climate and the causation of both warming from 1975-1998, and the current prognosis for cooling.

"To understand the resources of the near future, geologists need to understand the volcanoes of the distant past. Exploration of ancient magma chambers in places such as Greenland has the potential to provide new sources of the rare metals that underpin modern green technologies. Many rare metals – such as neodymium, niobium and dysprosium – essential to the production of wind turbines and electric cars, are mined from fossil volcanoes. Volcanoes are nature’s way of bringing material from deep within the earth up to the surface. Melting processes within the mantle – the interior part of the Earth between the super-heated core and the thin outer crust – produce magma which rises up hundreds of kilometres and eventually erupts on to the surface as volcanoes. The earth’s crust is made up of semi-rigid tectonic plates which move around and collide to form mountains or sink underneath one another at regions called subduction zones. The volume of material brought to the Earth’s surface by volcanoes is balanced by similar amounts of material going back into the mantle via sinking tectonic plates.  This points to what we call “element cycles”, where material from depth comes up to the surface via volcanoes and then returns again to the mantle via subduction. One of the big questions in Earth Sciences is what happens to this subducted material and how long it resides in the mantle. Our recent research studied a group of ancient volcanoes in southern Greenland. Around 1.3 billion years ago, Greenland was a volcanic landscape with deep rift valleys much like modern East Africa. Substantial volcanoes erupted on to the land surface and major river systems similar to the Nile carried minerals from these volcanoes over huge areas. The rivers and volcanoes in Greenland are now long eroded, but the sediments that the river transported can still be found, and the volcanic “plumbing systems” that operated beneath these ancient volcanoes have preserved samples of the magmas that erupted. We wanted to understand how element cycling relates to the concentration of critical metals in these ancient volcanoes in Greenland. While it is useful to study the valuable elements themselves, sometimes we can learn more about Earth’s element cycles by studying other elements associated with them.  In our study we used the element sulphur of which there are four stable forms (called isotopes). Each has a slightly different mass. This is important because natural processes can selectively separate lighter isotopes from heavier isotopes. Much like snacking on a bag of M&M’s where you prefer the red ones and leave behind the brown M&Ms, geological processes lead to variations in the relative abundances of each element in different materials. By measuring the amount of isotope in rocks, we can learn about the processes that formed them. Sulphur isotopes are particularly useful because bio- and geochemical processes on the Earth’s surface (at low temperatures) are very efficient at modifying sulphur signatures, whereas magmatic processes (at high temperatures) do not create much variation between light and heavy sulphur.  So the variations in sulphur signatures in magmatic rocks allow us to fingerprint traces of recycled crustal material in the mantle source. By choosing volcanoes that were active at different periods of geological time, we reconstruct how the mantle composition and sulphur cycling have varied over Earth’s history. Geologists have known for a long time that Earth’s surface has changed profoundly over the past 4.5 billion years as life emerged and became progressively more complex. The increasing imprint of life on the sulphur cycle has dramatically changed the sulphur isotope ratio of sediments at the surface of the Earth, but this imprint has not previously been documented in rocks from the mantle. Our work shows for the first time that the sulphur signature of the Earth’s mantle changed in a manner that broadly matches the changes in sulphur on the Earth’s surface. Biological and atmospheric impacts on the surface sulphur signature appear to have been transferred all the way into the Earth’s interior. This means that the Earth’s surface and mantle are strongly connected – one responding to changes in the other – although timescales of this recycling remain unknown. Our data show that sulphur that was once on the Earth’s surface went back into the mantle through tectonic plate activity and then – 1.3 billion years ago – found itself coming back to the surface in the Greenland volcanoes. It’s like geological déjà-vu. How many times has sulphur been recycled between the Earth’s crust and mantle over geological time? We do not currently know the answer to this but our research paints a picture of the Earth as a global element conveyor belt with surface sulphur and mantle closely linked.  The study has many implications. A major question in geology is how rare metal deposits form, particularly the high-tech metals that are essential for the green energy revolution. The story from sulphur seems to be consistent with our work on other isotopes. For example, one of the world’s biggest deposits of the element tantalum (used in electronics and also concentrated in one of the ancient volcanoes in Greenland) has isotopic fingerprints that also hint at crustal recycling. It may be that these global cycles have taken elements from surface to mantle and back again many times, effectively concentrating those elements each time. The global cycle that we have documented in sulphur may be an essential precursor to generate the metal deposits that are crucial to modern technologies. By understanding plate tectonics and magmatic processes that took place billions of years ago, we gain insights into how to identify and understand the mineral resources of the future."

It’s striking just how thoroughly bourgeois is the climate change phenomenon, at every level from the Eton old boys behind [Extinction Rebellion](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/extinction-rebellion-its-never-been-about-the-climate/) to the Greens-voting wealthy inner suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney. Climate change is the ultimate first-world problem, the almost exclusive preserve of the anxious middle-classes. The sort of people Eliot mocked as “Gumbie Cats”, “deeply concerned with the ways of the mice”, and whom Orwell derided as “that whole dreary tribe…flocking to the smell of ‘progress’ like bluebottles to a dead cat”.



 **What’s even more striking is that for all their self-proclaimed “compassion” and supposed concern for “the planet”, they don’t give a rat’s arse about the poorest people on it.**



Almost every “climate change” proposal that obsesses the tiny minds of the _Guardian_ -reading elite **shafts the poor and benefits the wealthy.** Government subsidies for “renewable energy” steal poor peoples’ taxes and reward middle-class homeowners. “Energy transition” sends electricity costs spiralling and forces poor people to choose between freezing or going broke. In Britain last year, more than 5000 lower-class electricity consumers [paid the ultimate price](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/yes-greta-people-are-dying-you-your-friends-are-killing-them/) for salving the green consciences of the middle classes.



But the biggest, dirtiest secret of the bourgeois eco-pharisees is nestled away in the hearts of their smug-mobiles, the electric cars, and in their beloved [eco-crucifixes, wind turbines.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/disposal-problem-number-two/) The minerals in the batteries so essential to the “renewables” industry are often mined under horrendous conditions by child labourers. **Forget “blood diamonds”, these are the blood-batteries.**



For more than a decade the global digital revolution has been enabled by places like Kolwezi, a mining town dotted with small Chinese casinos and faded Belgian colonial bungalows. The world’s largest mining companies rub shoulders with miners who dig copper and cobalt out of the earth by hand with little or no safety protection. 



It would be easy (and sometimes accurate) to blame “corporations”, but the reality is that the problem is as much caused by the perverse incentive given to the impoverished citizens of a country wracked by decades of war. A growing proportion of cobalt originating in the Congo is mined by “artisanal” miners: anyone who can grab a shovel and dig a hole.



Untraceable metal — from these informal miners — leaks into the global supply chain via refineries in China, ending up in batteries, cars and smartphones sold in the west […]The road into Kolwezi is dotted with dozens of corrugated-roofed depots with names like “Boss Wu” — traders who buy cobalt and copper from whoever is willing to sell to them. Most of that metal makes its way to China, where it enters the global battery supply chain.



In villages across the Congo, the discovery of deposits of cobalt triggers a modern-day gold rush.



The scale of the challenge can be vividly seen in the bustling village of Kasulo, on the outskirts of Kolwezi. In early 2014 residents discovered rich seams of cobalt beneath their houses. But after people started to dig in their gardens, cracks began to appear in the houses triggered by the mining frenzy. 



“You would come out of your house and there’d be a big hole,” says one Chinese executive. There were regular deaths and injuries, and the local road had to be closed after tunnels were dug into its foundations.



Government and big companies will then try and convert these free-for-alls into something like an ordered, regulated activity. But even co-operative efforts become a source of tension, as miners become convinced that they are being ripped off.



Meanwhile, the dirty secret of the renewable industry fails to stir the consciences of EV-driving green elites.



“Emotionally an EV is supposed to be a good deed — you’re buying an EV you’re thinking you are saving the planet — the last thing you want to hear is that the car is not clean,” [Nicholas Garrett, chief executive of RCS Global] says. 



It used to be said, in the days of the often-deadly industry of commercial whaling, that every lamp that burned in England held a drop of blood. Today, the same can be said of every battery in every EV, solar installation and smartphone.

Federal, state, and local governments seek to assist poor households financially using transfers, minimum wage laws, and subsidies for important goods and services. This “income‐​based” approach to alleviating poverty aims both to raise household incomes directly and to shift the cost of items, such as food, housing, or health care, to taxpayers. Most contemporary ideas to help the poor sit firmly within this paradigm.



A “cost‐​based” approach would instead reform existing government interventions that raise living costs for the poor. Shelter, food, transport, and apparel and footwear alone account for 59 percent of spending by the average household in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution, and government policies raise prices in all those sectors. Local land‐​use and zoning regulations constrain housing supply, which raises housing costs and deters labor mobility. State child‐​care staffing regulations reduce the number of infant centers in poor areas, increasing prices and reducing the payoff to work. The federal sugar program, milk‐​marketing orders, and ethanol mandates make grocery shopping more expensive. Federal fuel‐​standard regulations and state‐​level automobile dealership laws increase the cost of driving. Protectionist tariffs raise clothing and footwear prices, and state occupational licensing creates barriers to entry that raise the price of many services, from hair braiding to dentistry, while reducing labor‐​market opportunities.



Using cautious assumptions, I estimate that these interventions, combined, cost typical low‐​income households between $830 and $3,500 per year directly through higher prices. Pro‐​market reforms in these areas could significantly reduce living costs for the poor, while also improving labor mobility and job matching. With the federal budget deficit growing and demands for radical labor‐​market policies proliferating, such an agenda would represent an economically efficient means of improving the well‐​being of the poor without requiring more government spending or intervention.



American government at the federal, state, and local levels delivers policies intended to help households on low incomes. Total annual expenditure on U.S. anti-poverty programs is estimated to exceed $1 trillion per year.1 Governments redistribute income, provide benefits-in-kind, and subsidize the provision of certain services on the basis of need. They also pass mandates and regulations, such as minimum wage laws or limits on drug prices.



Though liberals and conservatives have different theories about the causes of poverty, the dominant paradigm for alleviating it rests on “income-based” approaches.2 Policies attempt to raise the incomes of the poor directly through cash transfers, tax breaks, and minimum wage laws or to raise the poor’s disposable income indirectly by shifting expenditure on goods and services to taxpayers through programs such as Medicaid.



This income-based approach underpins contemporary policy ideas. Senate Democrats advocate a $15 per hour federal minimum wage.3 Their 2016 presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), proposed new universal preschool and child-care programs.4 More recently, Senator Sanders backed a federal jobs guarantee designed to ensure a labor market wage floor.5



Universal basic income and negative income taxes, regularly touted as more efficient and freedom-enhancing means of income redistribution, nevertheless remain firmly in the income-based school of poverty alleviation.6 “Reform conservatives” have likewise long advocated for increasing the generosity of the earned income and child tax credits.7 Even conservatives who want to see less generous redistributive programs agree that income growth is important to reduce poverty.8 They want to improve incentives and broaden economic growth so that the poor can earn their own way out of poverty.



Income _is_ important to well-being. But focusing on earnings and transfers overlooks another way to help the less fortunate: reforming existing government policies that raise the prices of basic goods and services and thereby hurt the poor through higher living costs.



In markets where low-income households spend significant amounts — on housing, childcare, food, transport, clothing, and services regulated through occupational licensing — interventions designed to achieve other objectives restrict supply and in turn raise prices. Since these goods are relative necessities, these interventions impose disproportionate burdens on the poor. They are left with less disposable income, heightening calls for further taxpayer-funded redistribution or government interventions to counteract the effects of the policy.



This paper sets out nine policy areas across all levels of government that, combined, directly raise spending for typical households in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution by anywhere from $830 to $3,500 per year. This list is hardly comprehensive; to avoid subjective judgments about the effect on prices relative to other objectives, this analysis focuses exclusively on anti-competitive interventions and regulations that both raise prices and reduce overall economic efficiency.9 A “cost-based” approach to poverty alleviation through reform in these areas could therefore provide a significant financial boost to low-income households.



For too long, scholars on the left and right have thought about alleviating poverty as something that should occur after market-based activity has taken place. But removing misguided regulatory interventions would reduce poverty while expanding markets, simultaneously reducing the cost of living for low-income families and growing the economy. Even on cautious assumptions, the indicative numbers outlined here suggest that reform in these areas could be a powerful tool against poverty and should take precedence over new programs, regulations, and interventions.



The dominant “income-based” approach to helping the poor can directly alleviate financial hardship. Accounting for federal cash benefits, tax credits, and benefits-in-kind, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that the U.S. poverty rate fell from 18.9 to 10.9 percent between 1964 and 2011, as redistributive spending increased substantially.10 Bruce Meyer and Derek Wu recently concluded that five of the six programs they examined — Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, housing assistance, and food stamps — help reduce measured poverty substantially.11



Of course, these types of analyses fail to model a counterfactual world in which extensive government redistribution does not exist. With lower tax burdens, civil society institutions and charities would surely offer more generous support for those in need. Without extensive welfare and entitlement programs, worker and household behavior in the long run would be very different. The real net effect of government redistribution on the financial position of poor households is uncertain and theoretically ambiguous.



But it would be unsurprising if government transfers and benefits-in-kind raised disposable incomes for some recipients above what they could obtain from market-based activity and civil society assistance, particularly in the short run. Minimum wage hikes likewise raise incomes for workers from poor households with low pay rates who are lucky enough to keep their jobs and hours (though minimum wages are not a well-targeted poverty reduction tool generally).12



Yet, even accepting that the “income-based” approach raises income levels for many today does not mean that further expanding this approach is the best way to help the poor going forward. Consider the following:



You do not have to believe existing anti-poverty programs have failed in order to acknowledge these unintended consequences, diminishing returns, and need for taxpayer goodwill.



A “cost-based” agenda focused on removing damaging government interventions, in contrast, would not require additional government spending. By making essential goods cheaper, such a policy may reduce spending levels by lowering the political demands for redistributive transfers. If delivered through reforms to policies that currently undermine economic efficiency, it would also raise GDP and market-obtained incomes without the risks of unemployment from minimum wage hikes or the need for higher marginal tax rates. A beneficial side effect might also be restored faith in the market economy to deliver affordable goods and services, resulting in a political environment more conducive to pro-growth reforms in other sectors.



None of this means a pro-market cost-of-living agenda would be easy to deliver. Powerful supporters of existing interventions will resist such change. Zoning and land-use planning reforms often run counter to the interests of existing homeowners and will be opposed by coalitions of NIMBYs.21 Professionals with occupational licenses will argue that licensing improves service quality. Industries that benefit from extensive government protection, such as dairy and sugar farmers, textiles producers, and automobile dealerships, will petition state and federal politicians to protect their own interests. The bureaucracies that implement these programs and regulations also have a vested interest in ensuring their continuation.



Yet, these interventions currently come at a high cost to the poor. A pro-market “cost-based” reform agenda to reduce prices of essential goods and services should be considered an important tool in an effective and enduring “first do no harm” approach to reducing poverty.



The Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey shows the average amount spent by households across the income distribution on categories of goods and services. Table 1 shows households in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution tend to spend a much higher proportion than the rest of the population on “essential” goods and services. Shelter, food, transport, and apparel together account for 59 percent of the $25,318 spent by the average household in the poorest income quintile, compared with 50.9 percent for the average household across the whole population and 46.5 percent for the average household in the richest quintile.



 **Table 1: Expenditure by category**





This masks substantial differences by household composition and region. The average single-parent family spends proportionately more on apparel than do two-parent families. Households in some major U.S. cities spend much more on shelter. In San Francisco, even the average household apportions as much as 28.7 percent of spending to shelter, and similarly high figures are seen in New York (26.5 percent), Boston (25.2 percent), Los Angeles (24.2 percent), and Miami (24.0 percent).22 Families with young children where both parents are employed face very costly child-care bills too. In Washington, D.C., Child Care Aware estimates an average annual cost of formal infant care of $23,089.23



Without data disaggregated by region, household composition, and income level, one cannot reach firm conclusions about the financial costs of existing policies to individual families. Nevertheless, this high-level analysis shows markets where a meaningful anti-poverty agenda will have the biggest effect. Housing and child-care costs are likely to be particularly significant for those households in major metropolitan cities or with young children.



The remaining analysis highlights current government policies that drive up the cost of housing, childcare, food, transport, apparel and footwear, and services with occupational licensing requirements, and estimates their likely cost to poorer households.24



The single largest expenditure for most families is shelter (rent or the cost of owner-occupied housing). It makes up 25.2 percent of total spending for the average household in the poorest quintile, and 21.8 percent for the average single-parent household. Since the poorest quintile includes many older and poorer households with low incomes, spending as a proportion of income is higher still. The Pew Foundation estimates households in the bottom third of the income distribution spent 40 percent of their income on housing in 2014, while renters spent nearly half.25



The United States has relatively cheaper housing overall than other major developed English-speaking countries. But prices and rents are extraordinarily high in certain metropolitan areas. Demographia’s median multiple index (median house price divided by median income) is over 9 in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and just below 6 for Seattle and New York (see Table 2).26 Thirty overall housing markets and 13 major metropolitan markets are defined as “severely unaffordable,” meaning they have median multiples of 5.1 or over. But even these are quite broad markets, including suburban areas on the outskirts of cities. The online housing marketplace Zumper estimates that the median one-bedroom rental price in March 2018 was $3,400 per month in San Francisco; $2,900 in New York; $2,450 in San Jose; $2,300 in Boston; and $2,220 in Washington, D.C.27



 **Table 2: Severely unaffordable housing markets**





High housing costs have major consequences for the poor, both in direct financial terms and, indirectly, in terms of labor mobility and job match. They encourage families to live in smaller apartments and condominiums, to commute greater distances to jobs, and can even act as a prohibitive financial barrier to taking up employment opportunities in certain cities.



Regulatory restraints at the local-government level have a significant effect on housing affordability. Land-use planning and zoning laws — including urban growth boundaries, minimum lot sizes, density and height restrictions, and design requirements — raise the costs associated with providing new housing, restricting the potential supply and making it less responsive to changes in demand. The result of the latter is structurally higher prices as incomes rise and the population grows.



Because of the vast, complex, and differentiated nature of regulations across the country, it is difficult to measure and compare the permissiveness toward development across regions, but economists have used two techniques to measure the effects of regulations.



Some estimate an implied “regulatory tax” as the deviation between new house prices and marginal building costs. Using this method, Ed Glaeser, Joseph Gyourko, and Raven Saks estimated that Manhattan condominium prices were 50 percent higher in the early 2000s than under a free development regime.28 For single-family homes across the country, their estimates show regulatory costs much higher in some areas than others — being indistinguishable from zero in cities such as Baltimore and Houston, but as high as 53 percent in the San Francisco Bay Area, 34 percent in Los Angeles, 22 percent in Washington, D.C., and 19 percent in Boston. Work by the Cato Institute’s Vanessa Brown Calder has subsequently found that regulatory burdens have intensified in many areas since the Glaeser et al. article appeared. We would therefore expect these implied regulatory taxes to be higher in many cities today.29



Other economists estimate the effect of land-use regulations on prices and rents econometrically. Results from these studies, again, consistently suggest that tighter regulatory constraints drive higher housing costs. A 1996 paper by Stephen Malpezzi examining metropolitan markets found that increasing regulation by one standard deviation from average lowered construction by 11 percent and raised house prices by 22 percent.30 A more recent assessment found that a similar one-standard-deviation increase reduced construction by a larger 17 percent, with twice the upward effect — 34 percent — on housing prices.31 A study of cities in Florida also found that restricting growth through farm preservation and open-space zoning made housing more expensive, with the most pronounced effects on the price of smaller houses.32



Anti-development regulations have regressive effects. Poorer households are more likely to rent (61 percent of households in the bottom quintile and 66 percent of single-parent households rent, compared with just 38 percent for the population as a whole). An increase in housing costs has unambiguously negative consequences for renters. Poor households also tend to spend relatively more on housing, are more likely to value lower housing costs over improved amenities, and are more susceptible to being locked out of rich, productive cities and the economic opportunities they bring. This can have a big macroeconomic impact. Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti estimate that lowering the level of housing regulation to the median level across all U.S. cities for New York, San Francisco, and San Jose alone would raise long-term U.S. GDP by nearly 9 percent.33



The negative consequences of land-use and zoning laws can also result in policies that exacerbate these regressive effects further. Local rent control laws, for example, are notionally justified as attempts to keep rents affordable, but binding controls deter investment in the rentable stock and encourage existing landlords to convert units to noncontrolled tenure types or to be more discerning about tenants. A recent study on the expansion of rent control in San Francisco in 1994 shows how this hurts the poor.34 Landlords converted some properties to owner-occupied apartments and condos better suited to higher-income families. The overall supply of new housing fell too, increasing market rents by over 5 percent. Rent control both increased the cost of rental accommodation and intensified gentrification.



Federal taxpayers foot the bill for these mistakes, with relatively more housing aid flowing to states with restrictive zoning and land-use rules.35 Treating the symptoms in this way helps entrench unnecessarily restrictive regulations. Subsidies ease the pressure on local governments to address the cause of high housing costs.



How much do existing regulations raise house prices or rents for households in the poorest 20 percent of the income distribution? It depends on where they live. Residents in many rural areas face no real housing cost increases. But estimates of regulatory taxes for major metropolitan areas by Glaeser et al. imply that average annual housing costs in New York are $2,060 more than in a competitive housing market; $3,200 in Boston; $5,230 in Los Angeles; $3,939 in D.C.; and a whopping $11,500 in San Francisco.36



Some degree of regulatory tax in major cities might be appropriate given the externalities associated with new building, not least congestion. In cities such as San Francisco, the income distribution is very different from the national average too, meaning that there are fewer poor people residing in the city who would benefit directly from liberalization (though this is partly the result of high housing costs).37 On the flip side, the Glaeser et al. estimates apply to the housing markets of nearly 20 years ago; since then the regulatory burden has intensified. New York as a whole has an income distribution similar to the overall U.S. population. Even using Glaeser’s older regulatory tax estimate implies that the poorest 20 percent there currently pay $1,044 per year more for shelter than they would under a permissive development regime.38 These calculations would be much higher still for several cities in California.



Calculating an average effect for poor households across the country is difficult. Salim Furth has estimated that the average household’s annual housing costs increase by $1,700 as a result of land-use regulation. This implies housing costs for the poorest fifth are about $1,000 higher than they need be annually, given relative differences in spending on shelter. A similar result arises using Calder’s alternative measure of land-use regulation. Making the assumption that those states with above-average regulatory burdens were able to reduce these to the average of the rest of the country implies annual savings of $1,075 per year for poor households. But given that poorer households are more likely to live in rural areas, those figures may somewhat overestimate the effect.



Nevertheless, the direct cost of land-use planning and zoning regulations on low-income households could reasonably be anywhere between $0 and around $2,000 per year in the long term, depending on location. The broader economic costs are much greater still, given the secondary effect of poorer families finding it more difficult to move to areas with high-paying jobs. For single-parent households the range would be even wider, with regulatory costs up to around $3,500 or more for wealthier single-parent households in California’s most restrictive cities. Land-use and zoning liberalization could, in the long term, reduce housing costs significantly and greatly increase economic opportunities.



Childcare is expensive. The average annual cost of infant-center care varies from a low of $5,178 in Mississippi to a high of $23,089 in D.C. (25.7 percent and 114.5 percent of the federal poverty income level, respectively).39 Even accounting for income variance by state, care costs for an infant average 89.1 percent of median single-parent family income in D.C.; 70.9 percent in Massachusetts; and 57.0 percent in New York. Even in cheaper states, these costs average 27.2 percent in Mississippi; 28.9 percent in Louisiana; and 30.0 percent in Alabama.40 For a family with two young children, the cost burden can be extremely heavy.



State governments control child-care policy, and variation exists in terms of assistance for poorer families.41 Overall, though, U.S. out-of-pocket costs for a typical single parent working full time are higher than any other OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) country.42 Not only are U.S. market prices higher than average, but parents receive less in the way of taxpayer subsidies.



These high prices can have negative consequences for poor families. Poorer single mothers are sensitive to child-care prices when making decisions about entering the labor market.43 Mothers from poorer families, or those with low levels of educational attainment, are least likely to be working.44 Previous data from the U.S. Census Bureau also show that poorer families are price sensitive in the type of care they choose. Children with employed mothers living in poverty are more than twice as likely to be cared for by an unlicensed relative.45



More mothers of young children are choosing to work (in 1975, 28.3 percent of mothers with children under the age of 3 and 33.2 percent of mothers with children under the age of 6 were employed, compared with 59.4 and 61.5 percent, respectively, in 2016), making high child-care costs a salient political issue. Pressure is building for governments to help poor families with these costs.46



There are good reasons why prices for formal childcare are high. It is a labor-intensive personalized service entailing the care of children, whom parents tend to value highly. A strong correlation between areas with high child-care costs and costs as a proportion of income suggests childcare is strongly “income-elastic” too — richer people want to spend relatively more on it.



Yet economic evidence suggests child-care prices are also driven higher by state-level regulations. Input requirements designed to improve care “quality,” including staff-qualification requirements and minimum staff-to-child ratios, significantly raise prices, with little evidence that they achieve other objectives.



These regulations are particularly regressive but get justified on “market failure” grounds. Parents are supposedly unable to observe accurately the quality of care in the sector, or underestimate the social benefits arising from “high-quality” childcare, necessitating minimum quality standards.



But these theoretical arguments are not robust and ignore the market context.47 Most importantly, the regulations cannot ensure quality directly, not least because the true child-care market includes much more than formal infant-center care. If regulations affect prices, they can be the cause of substitution away from formal centers into more informal arrangements, the quality of which varies greatly.



Suppose a new regulation requires an increase in the staff-child ratio or child-care workers to achieve higher qualification levels. The former could increase quality by increasing staff interactions with individual children and the latter by making caregivers better trained to interact with the child in ways that foster development. The combination of the regulations may satisfy some parents that their children will be well cared for, and this “quality assurance” effect may raise overall demand for formal care.



Yet, raising the staff-child ratio has the effect of restricting the revenue-raising potential of each worker or of raising staffing requirements for a given number of children. These increased costs reduce the supply of formal care, thus increasing prices, and could lead parents to choose less costly alternatives. If centers compensate by paying staff lower wages to avoid this, the industry may attract lower-quality workers. Child-care providers likewise may respond to the cost increase arising from higher government certification requirements on caregivers by hiring cheaper, lower-quality support staff or purchasing lower-quality equipment. The effects of both regulations on the quality and use of childcare are therefore theoretically ambiguous.



Empirical work suggests that staff-child ratio regulation increases child-care prices substantially. Diana Thomas and Devon Gorry analyze variation in prices and staff-child ratios across states, estimating that loosening the requirement by one child across all age groups (regulations tend to vary by child age) reduces prices by between 9 and 20 percent.48 This supports an older result from Randal Heeb and Rebecca Kilburn, who found that reducing the number of children per staff member by two would raise the price of childcare by 12 percent.49



The poor suffer disproportionately from these higher prices. Thomas and Gorry show that a small but measurable number of mothers stop working altogether. These are more likely to be low-income people for whom the payoff for moving into work is smaller. Joseph Hotz and Mo Xiao, using a panel dataset across three census periods with extensive child-care center data, data on home care by state, and a host of control variables, find that tightening the staff-child ratio by one child reduces the number of child-care centers by 9.2 to 10.8 percent, without increasing employment levels at other centers.50 This reduced supply occurs exclusively in lower-income areas and leads to substitution to home daycare. Importantly, there is no evidence that increasing the stringency of this regulation improves quality. It simply reduces accessibility to formal care for the poor, making it more expensive and leading to substitution toward other care settings.



Staff qualification requirements also appear to have a big effect on prices. Thomas and Gorry find the requirement for lead teachers to have a high school diploma increases prices by between 25 and 46 percent. Hotz and Xiao likewise find that increasing the average required years of education of center directors by one year reduces the number of child-care centers in the average market by between 3.2 and 3.8 percent. Again, this effect manifests itself overwhelmingly in low-income areas, with quality improvements (proxied here by accreditation for the center) occurring in high-income areas.



Like housing, childcare is a sector where government regulations restrict the supply of the service to the financial detriment of the poor. For those on the margins of the labor market, child-care regulations can reduce the payoff to work. In return for these higher costs, there is little evidence that they yield much improvement in child-care quality. In fact, higher prices appear to cause demand substitution to potentially lower-quality childcare settings. (Though in the case of childcare, there is also a question about what “quality” actually means.)



Despite this evidence, some city and state governments continue undeterred. The D.C. government has passed regulations requiring teachers at child-care centers and caregivers at home-based centers to have associate degrees in early childhood education and assistant caregivers to obtain new child development associate certificates.51 Even if these do raise the quality of care, the requirements will further constrict supply — which is presumably why the District has delayed implementation and is engaged in new attempts to subsidize provision.52



Deregulation of staffing requirements could therefore significantly reduce prices to the benefit of the poor, who tend to put much less weight on the “quality” desired by richer families and regulators. The current costs of these regulations to low-income families are significant. The cautious end of Thomas and Gorry’s estimates suggests that even modest relaxation of staff-to-child ratios by one child at all age groups alone could reduce average child-care prices by $466 per year in Mississippi and $2,078 per year in Washington, D.C.53



Eliminating statutory regulations on child-care staffing entirely could reduce the cost of care even more significantly. Market mechanisms in the form of accreditation or certification agencies will arise if significant numbers of parents put a high premium on certain staffing structures and outcomes. Many major European countries already do not bother with mandated staff-to-child ratios, for example, seemingly with few ill effects.54



But extensive deregulation might be a leap too far for state policymakers. For the purposes of examining the cost of child-care regulations for a typical family with a young child in the poorest quintile, then, I assume that the “cost” of regulation equates roughly to the potential gains from a modest relaxation in the staff-child ratio, as outlined above. The net benefits to poor households of more extensive deregulation would be much larger. The broader economic benefits are greater still since lower prices allow more low-income family members to fulfill their labor market preferences.55



The average household in the poorest 20 percent of the income distribution spent $3,682 on food in 2016 (15.4 percent of total spending and the highest proportion of any income group). Single-parent households spend proportionately more than other household types. Yet, the federal government makes groceries more expensive through such policies as milk-marketing orders, sugar programs, and ethanol mandates.



 **Milk-Marketing Orders.** The federal government operates a byzantine system of marketing orders, price and income supports, and trade barriers in dairy markets.56



Federal milk-marketing orders set monthly minimum prices that dairy processors must pay dairy farmers in 10 regions. These account for around 60 percent of total production, with another fifth of the remaining 40 percent from California, which operates similar schemes at the state level.57 The marketing orders set regional prices for fluid milk and use complex formulae to determine nationwide prices for three other classes (soft manufactured products such as ice cream, hard cheese and cream cheese, and butter and dry milk).



The Milk Support Program supplements this with guarantees that the government will purchase any amount of cheese, butter, and dry milk from processors at a set minimum price. In order to ensure that these prices are not undercut by foreign producers, import barriers then insulate domestic dairy producers from competition through tariff rate quotas.



With modern storage techniques, there appears to be little need for this regional balkanization of the sector. The marketing orders and price supports stymie entrepreneurship and producers’ ability to provide low-cost milk to regions with higher milk prices. Import barriers further raise product prices and distort economic activity toward the dairy sector rather than allowing resources to be used most efficiently. The main economic effect of all this is higher average prices borne by consumers.



The best evidence of these price effects comes from Chouinard et al., who review the existing literature on what would happen if milk-marketing orders and associated supports were abolished.58 All studies suggest retail fluid milk prices would fall by between 15 and 20 percent. The effect on manufactured milk and processed dairy products is less clear. Averaging previous studies suggests butter and ice cream prices would fall by 3 percent and 1 percent respectively while, counterintuitively, fresh cream, coffee additives, and yogurt prices would increase by 1.3 percent and cheese prices would rise by 0.5 percent.59



The average poorest quintile household spent $246 per year on dairy products in 2016 ($97 on milk and fresh cream and $149 on other manufactured products).60 But this masks significant variation. The average single-parent family spends $353 on dairy products.61 African Americans, who are more likely to be in poverty, experience high rates of lactose intolerance, so spending on dairy products for poor whites is likely to be higher than the average figures suggest. The Consumer Expenditure Survey is not sufficiently disaggregated to calculate the cost of these programs to the average household in the poorest quintile. We need information about how consumers would react to price changes and how far they will substitute away from some dairy products to others to calculate net savings.



The Chouinard et al. model seeks to do just that. It suggests that “lower income families [would] benefit more than wealthier families” from eliminating federal milk-marketing orders, meaning the regulations currently are very regressive. They also find that families with young children benefit far more than the childless.



Their results suggest annual savings for white families with annual incomes of $10,000 from the abolition of federal milk-marketing orders of $44; $38 for those with incomes at $20,000; and $33 for those with incomes at $30,000. They estimate the regulatory burden for black families to be somewhere between a third and a half of this, meaning that the average black family would save somewhere between $14 and $22 per year.



Taking into account these differential racial burdens, the average household in the bottom quintile faces a current regulatory cost of approximately $38 per year from dairy interventions, and the average single-parent family a higher cost of $54 per year.62



 **Sugar intervention.** In similar fashion, the U.S. federal government also effectively cartelizes the sugar market. As Cato scholar Colin Grabow has explained in detail, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) facilitates loans to sugar processors using raw sugarcane and refined beet sugar as collateral, effectively creating a floor for the domestic sugar price.63 To ensure that loans will likely be repaid, it then restricts the supply of domestic sugar through allotment quantities, raises demand by making purchases, and limits the amount of sugar that can be imported either without tariffs or with low tariffs.



Unsurprisingly, these anti-competitive actions, which restrict supply and inflate demand, raise domestic sugar prices substantially. Data from the USDA show that in March 2018 the U.S. raw sugar price was 24.73 cents per pound, almost double the world price of 12.83 cents.64 Not only do consumers pay higher retail prices for sugar but they also pay more for manufactured foods that contain sugar as an ingredient.



Economic analysis of the consumer cost of the program has examined the aggregate effect on consumers. Economist Michael Wohlgenant has suggested that the burden amounts to $2.4 billion per year, or an average of around $19 per household.65 A 2017 paper by John Beghin and Amani Elobeid estimated the loss to consumer welfare from the sugar program at between $2.4 billion and $4 billion in 2009 dollars.66 Adjusted for inflation, that is equivalent to $2.8 billion to $4.7 billion today.



This suggests that the program costs between $22 and $36 per year for the average household.67 Determining a more precise figure for low-income households is fraught with difficulty. On the one hand, poorer households tend to contain fewer people, and on the other, some evidence suggests overall sugar consumption is highest among those with the lowest incomes.68



In the absence of more complete evidence, I take the midpoint of these household estimates and assume that the costs of the program are spread evenly across individuals, such that the average poor household (with 1.6 members) is $18 per year worse off as a result of the policy, and the average single-parent family (with 2.9 members) is $33 worse off.



 **Renewable Fuel Standard.** The federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates quotas for the amounts of biofuels blended into transportation fuel sold. The origins of the standard are the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which amended the Clean Air Act, and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which expanded the ethanol mandates.



These regulations raise food prices for consumers. The increased demand for corn for biofuels raises the prices of corn and corn-based products directly. This higher price then raises production costs for meat and dairy products, since corn is used as animal feed. Dedicating agricultural land to growing corn also restricts available land supply for other crops, such as soybeans, raising their price too.



A 2009 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis found that demands for ethanol subsequently raised total food spending by between 0.8 and 1 percent.69 This corroborates the work of Richard Perrin, who estimated that growth in demand for ethanol raised overall food prices by 1 to 2 percent in 2008.70 But how much consumers would benefit financially from the repeal of the RFS at any given time depends on the oil price.



In 2014, when oil prices were much higher than today, CBO analysis suggested “suppliers would probably find it cost-effective to use a roughly 10 percent blend of corn ethanol in gasoline in 2017 even in the absence of the RFS,” meaning that total food spending would fall only very slightly were the RFS repealed (by 0.1 percent).71 Today, however, oil prices are significantly lower, meaning that there is a bigger incentive to use relatively more oil in gas production.



Given that the price of oil today falls between the levels seen in 2008 and 2009, I assume that the RFS currently raises food prices by 1 percent. Assuming that food spending is price inelastic, the direct cost of this policy can be estimated at about $39 per year for the average family in the lowest income quintile, or $58 for the average single-parent family.72



The average household in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution spent $3,767 on transport in 2016 (15 percent of total spending). The vast majority was on private vehicles: $1,332 on vehicle purchases; $902 on gasoline and motor oil; and $1,308 on other vehicle expenses.73 Just $225 was spent, on average, on public transportation.



Averages mask the real experience of families, of course. Whereas 9 percent of all households do not have a vehicle,74 this increases to 20 percent for households in poverty and 11 percent for households with incomes at 100 to 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Spending on motor vehicles for vehicle-owning households is therefore higher than the figures above suggest.75



Two government regulations increase motoring costs: Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards at the federal level and dealership franchise laws at the state level. These not only increase transport costs for the poor directly, but also make it more difficult for poor families to have physical accessibility to jobs, health care, training, and childcare.76



 **Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards.** First created in 1975, Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards (CAFE) sought to increase the fuel economy of cars and trucks to limit dependence on foreign oil. It was originally thought that consumers undervalued fuel savings from more efficient vehicles, though recent research suggests fears over consumer short sightedness were overstated.77 Now CAFE standards are justified as a tool to reduce carbon emissions.



The regulations require manufacturers to achieve a sales-weighted fuel economy average for car and light-truck fleets. Their stringency has increased since they were tied to a vehicle’s physical footprint beginning in 2012. President Barack Obama had agreed to raise the standards significantly from 2022 through 2025, to 60 miles per gallon for small cars and 46 for large cars, and 50 miles per gallon for small trucks and 30 for large trucks. But President Trump has outlined plans to relax these rules.78 More recently, the administration proposed freezing the standards entirely at 2020 levels and preventing states (particularly California) from unilaterally imposing stricter regulations.79



CAFE standards increase costs to consumers overall, although the effects are not uniform across vehicles. Meeting fuel economy standards requires high fixed-cost investments in technological improvements by manufacturers. But to hit the sales-weighted averages, manufacturers have to adjust prices to incentivize purchases. Evidence suggests consumers prefer larger, more powerful vehicles. Firms therefore have to offer discounts for smaller, more fuel-efficient models, cross-subsidized by higher prices for larger vehicles. Increased prices for new cars lead to higher prices in the used car market too, as consumers substitute toward older models of the larger vehicles they tend to prefer.



It is beyond the scope of this paper to assess the merits of curbing carbon emissions. Economists are, in any case, doubtful this type of policy will have large effects on emissions, not least because making vehicles more expensive leads consumers to keep older, less fuel-efficient cars on the road longer and incentivizes owners of the more efficient cars to drive more.



If one is worried about the externality of carbon emissions, theory and evidence show that CAFE standards have more regressive effects than an equivalent gas tax for such a goal.80 CAFE standards are roughly equivalent to a tax on the gasoline used per mile of travel. The difference between the consumption of rich and poor on this metric is lower than the total gas consumed. This makes CAFE standards more regressive than a simple gas tax. Additionally, larger vehicle categories also face less stringent standards. The fact that vehicle size tends to increase with income exacerbates the regressive impact of the standards.



Economists Lucas Davis and Christopher Knittel estimate the implicit tax from CAFE standards in 2012 to be around $180 per vehicle for those in the poorest income quintile.81 Adjusted for inflation, that’s more like $194 today.82 The standards have become much more stringent since then, suggesting the effect today would be far larger.



Other academic studies find larger effects for broader long-term consumer welfare losses (which include the welfare costs of substituting away from preferred vehicles). In today’s prices, for example, Mark Jacobsen estimates a long-run consumer surplus loss of $226 for every one-mile-per-gallon standard increase for people with incomes below $25,000.83 Assuming that this effect was linear (we might assume the marginal cost increases with the standard), this implies that the tightened standards seen between 2011 and 2018 caused consumer welfare losses of more than $2,230 per vehicle. If the standards planned by President Obama were implemented through 2025, this loss would more than double.84 This corresponds closely to figures from much older studies. David Greene found that for every one-mile-per-gallon increase in vehicle fuel economy, the average per-vehicle cost was from $225 to $450 in today’s prices, and figures of these magnitudes have been corroborated in a broader review of the literature.85



Given that the average used car price is now around $20,000, this suggests the ratchet in standards since 2011 is likely to account for over 10 percent of the price of a used vehicle.86 A 10 percent reduction in vehicle prices would save the average poorer household $133 and the average single-parent family $307 annually.87



This appears to be a reasonable estimate. A 2015 paper by Mark Jacobsen and Arthur van Benthem estimated that the standards enacted in 2012 would cause used vehicle prices to rise by $103 per year relative to the old standards enacted in 2007.88 An earlier paper by David Austin and Terry Dinan found an annual cost per vehicle per year of $153 for an increase in the standards of just under 4 miles per gallon.89 More recently, the Reason Foundation’s Julian Morris estimated that the average price of a new pickup truck has risen by 25 percent since 2013, overwhelmingly because of the CAFE standards. That works out to a net cost of about $100 per year.90



While a range exists, all these estimates suggest CAFE standards increase new and used vehicle prices for consumers. Theory and evidence suggests the effects are regressive. While manufacturers are unlikely to undo technological changes that have delivered improved fuel efficiency, President Trump’s planned policy of capping standards at 2020 levels would deliver significant annual savings for purchasers of vehicles relative to the trajectory planned by President Obama.



 **Dealership Franchise Laws.** Every state has laws governing the economic relationships of car manufacturers with new car dealers. These require dealers to be licensed and can also incorporate restrictions on when franchise relationships can be terminated, canceled, or transferred, restrictions on opening new dealerships in existing market areas, and requirements that manufacturers buy back vehicles or other accessories when a dealership franchise is terminated.91



The most prominent effect of these laws is the restriction of direct sales by manufacturers. But the broad effect of all of them is to insulate dealerships from competition and prevent manufacturers from optimizing their inventory and distribution to best match the demands and preferences of consumers.



“Good cause” regulations, for example, mean manufacturers can only terminate a franchised dealership for a set of enumerated reasons, often not including efficiency. Manufacturers can face penalties and charges if they terminate dealerships because of demand patterns. Though states often allow termination for noncompliance of a franchise agreement, even then the manufacturer faces the burden of proof in showing that they have acted in good faith, the termination is reasonable, and they have given notice with an opportunity for the franchisee to deal with the issue at hand.



Plenty of states have laws that protect existing franchisees from “encroachment” too. Manufacturers must show the need for a new dealership if it is proposed within the same relevant market area as an existing one. Protection of exclusive territories creates effective monopoly power for dealers, raising profits, when manufacturers might prefer to increase the quantity of sales.



These regulations were justified in the early 20th century as correcting for asymmetric information between the franchiser (the manufacturer) and the franchisee (the dealer) that led to manufacturers exploiting dealers. But today, calls for auto dealership laws are based on the supposed “social benefits” of dealerships, including their roles in the community and as sponsors of local events. Because such claims could be made about all local businesses, they do not provide robust “market failure” justifications for the interventions.



These regulations raise consumer prices, though the magnitudes of the effect are disputed. A paper exploring data from 1972 suggested that new car prices were raised by around 9 percent.92 A report for the Federal Trade Commission in 1986 found an average price increase of just over 6 percent across all car types.93 In 2001, the Consumer Federation of America summarized the existing literature, concluding that these laws raised new automobile prices by between 6 and 8 percent.94 This was subsequently questioned by the National Automobile Dealers Association, which concluded that the true effect was much lower, at 2.2 percent.95 But papers focusing on other countries have found effects similar to the 2001 study.96



Unfortunately, little modern evidence exists on this subject, and it is beyond the scope of this paper to develop new calculations. The internet may have helped to reduce some of the burden on consumers, and though the price effects will induce substitution to the used car market, we perhaps would not expect prices to be affected to the same extent. Given the best estimates from older work, the average regulatory cost on a household in the bottom quintile is likely to be around $61 annually, or $140 for the average single-parent family.97



In 2016, the average household in the bottom income quintile spent $860 on apparel and footwear, or 3.4 percent of overall spending — the highest proportion of any income quintile.98 The average single-parent household put 4.5 percent of total expenditure toward these goods.99 The poor spend a disproportionate amount on clothing and footwear, and family structures most likely to be recipients of means-tested welfare programs (single-parent households) spend most of all.



Yet the federal government makes clothing and footwear more expensive through import tariffs, which are often higher than those imposed on other goods. The United States raised $33.1 billion overall in tariff revenue in 2017, but $14 billion of that came from tariffs on apparel and footwear alone. These items account for 4.6 percent of the value of U.S. imports, but 42 percent of duties paid. The average effective tariff rate for U.S. imports overall is just over 1.4 percent. Rates for apparel and footwear are 13.7 percent and 11.3 percent, respectively.100



The Cato Institute’s Daniel Ikenson has examined the evolution of clothing and textile protectionism.101 He concludes that such high tariffs do not exist to protect domestic apparel manufacturing. Data from the U.S. Trade Representative estimated that 91 percent of manufactured apparel goods and 96.5 percent of footwear are imported despite the tariffs.102 In February 2018, just 116,400 people were employed in domestic apparel manufacturing, a collapse from 939,000 in January 1990.103



Why then are such highly regressive tariffs imposed? The answer appears to be the lobbying efforts of the capital-intensive U.S. textile industry. Textiles are the major input for labor-intensive apparel production, which largely occurs overseas. To quote Ikenson:



The U.S. textile industry insists on preserving those tariffs as leverage to compel foreign apparel producers to purchase their inputs. Preferential access [to U.S. markets] is conditioned on use of U.S. textiles. The high rates of duty apply, generally, to all “normal trade relations” partners. But those duties are much lower or excused entirely for trade agreement partners, provided that the finished garment comprises of textiles made in countries that are signatories to the agreement.104



U.S. consumers pay the price of this protectionism, and poorer consumers especially. In fact, protectionism is doubly regressive. Not only do poorer households spend relatively more on clothes and footwear, but Edward Gresser’s work has shown how often luxury clothes and shoes face lower tariff rates than inexpensive products.105



Consider Table 3 (an updated version of Gresser’s work) below. Where duties are applicable, a pure cashmere sweater import incurs a 4 percent tariff, a wool sweater a 16 percent tariff, and an acrylic sweater a whopping 32 percent. Men’s silk shirts would see a 0.9 percent tariff, cotton shirts a 19.7 percent tariff, and cheaper polyester shirts a 32 percent tariff. Leather dress shoes have an 8.5 percent tariff, whereas cheap sneakers would see a 43 percent tariff. Windbreakers, leggings, tank tops, and other clothes made cheaply from synthetic fabrics face a 32 percent tariff if sourced from countries that the United States does not have a free-trade agreement with.



 **Table 3: Regressive tariffs (percentage on various goods)**





Assuming poorer households tend to buy cheaper products, these differential tariffs have perniciously regressive effects. (And not just for clothes; as Table 3 shows, similar trends are seen for consumer goods such as handbags, necklaces, and blankets).



It is difficult to calculate the true overall cost of these tariffs to poor families. That would require detailed information on the effect on domestic substitute goods prices, knowledge of products bought by poor families and their propensity to import in the absence of protectionism.



Nevertheless, we can develop cautious lower-bound estimates of the financial cost. The average household in the poorest income quintile spends $655 on apparel and $206 on footwear per year. Assuming the import propensities for the population as a whole apply to poorer people implies $595 of apparel spending and $199 of footwear spending is on imported goods. Taking average effective tariff rates for apparel and footwear for this spending (13.7 and 11.3 percent) implies a combined direct tariff cost of $92 per year for the average household in the poorest income quintile, or $204 per year for the average single-parent household.106



These figures underestimate the true burden, though, because they only represent the direct cost from current spending on imported goods. They assume tariffs do not raise domestically produced goods prices, though in reality the anti-competitive effect of the tariffs would be expected to raise prices here too. The calculation also assumes the same effective tariff rates for apparel and footwear apply for the poorest households as for the whole population, but we have seen that products that the poor are more likely to buy tend to face higher tariff rates. Consumer welfare losses from tariffs are higher than the implied savings here, of course, since tariffs make consumers less willing to buy imported products that they would otherwise prefer.



Nevertheless, these figures correspond well to calculations by Jason Furman, Katheryn Russ, and Jay Shambaugh that provide an estimate of the overall tariff burden (all goods, not just apparel and footwear) of around $100 and $238 per year for poorer and single-parent households, respectively.107



State governments regulate numerous occupations through education, training, or test requirements, creating barriers to entry to practicing a trade. This restricts the supply of providers within the state and discourages movement of professionals across state lines, raising the price of services.



Licensing gets justified on grounds of imperfect information between buyer and seller, particularly when harm could result from low-quality service. This argument is most forcefully made about medical professionals, where it is argued that “quack” practitioners might do substantial harm to patients. Yet restrictions on entry come with tradeoffs, including higher prices and deterring talented people from entering a profession. Ideally, one must weigh up any benefits of reduced quackery against these supply-restricting consequences.



Other sectors commonly licensed include hair braiding, barbers, and sign-language interpreters, where any costs associated with low-quality providers are likely much smaller. In these cases, consumers are best placed to judge a price-quality bundle, and intermediate institutions such as online rating sites can provide information about the nature and quality of service. Markets may even deliver certification mechanisms for safety- or quality-sensitive customers. Instead, licensure boards are often dominated by existing providers with a vested interest against competition. The arguments that licensure corrects for some “market failure” are therefore increasingly difficult to justify. Yet 25 to 30 percent of Americans now work in licensed occupations.108



A plethora of research has found licensure raises wages in licensed sectors (relative to no licensure or no certification). A recent study found that “having a license when it is not required has no influence on wage determination, but, when it is required, licensing raises wages by 7.5 percent,” even controlling for a host of worker and occupational characteristics.109



Whether this raises prices depends on whether consumers would demand equally robust entry barriers in the form of certification absent government intervention. Without licensure constraints, prices of services are likely to be lower, unless state governments provide economies of scale in license provision relative to private certificates. However, in many cases consumers are unlikely to demand substitute certification at all, and so the wage premium would evaporate.



Research on individual markets confirms this intuition. Relaxing licensing laws to allow nurse practitioners to perform tasks without medical doctor supervision was found to reduce well-child exam prices by between 3 and 16 percent.110 Delicensing of funeral servicing providers in Colorado lowered funeral prices significantly.111 Older papers estimated that dental assistant and hygienist licensing raised prices of dental visits by between 7 and 11 percent, and optician licensing the price of eye care by between 5 and 13 percent.112



Two attempts have been made to estimate the aggregate costs of occupational licensing to consumers. Morris Kleiner, Alan Krueger, and Alex Mas estimated a $203 billion annual cost, or $1,567 per household.113 The Heritage Foundation’s Salim Furth estimates a lower figure, with a cost to the average household of $1,033 per year.114



Ideally, we would produce a more accurate estimate using detailed data of the cost of licensure by sector mapped against spending patterns for poor households. We know, for example, that poorer households spend relatively more on health care than richer households but also that richer households spend more on other grooming services affected by the licensure premium. Poorer households are likely to be more price sensitive and less discerning about “quality.” One must bear in mind, too, that because licensing restricts people from practicing certain occupations, the potential labor supply is increased in nonlicensed sectors, putting downward pressure on labor costs and hence prices in other industries.



Bearing these caveats in mind, I assume that the total spending ratio of poorer and single-parent households to the average household is the same as the ratio of spending on licensed services between the groups. Using the household costs of licensure from Kleiner and Furth implies an average annual cost to poorer households of between $450 and $690 per year, and between $760 to $1,160 per year for the average single-parent household.115 Again, this is a lower bound to the true economic costs for poorer people, not least because occupational entry barriers prevent individuals from taking up new and better job opportunities because of the time and financial costs of meeting the licensure requirements.



This paper has demonstrated how government interventions raise the cost of living for poor and single-parent households.



Debates on policies to help the poor tend to focus on redistribution, tax breaks, minimum wage hikes, and government-provided services. But liberalizing reform in the markets outlined above could improve the financial well-being of less well-off households without new government expenditure or risky labor-market interventions. A “cost-based” approach to poverty alleviation should be considered a key tool in helping the less well-off.



Table 4 summarizes the estimated direct costs to poorer and single-parent households of existing interventions. These are based on extremely cautious assumptions and likely understate the true financial impacts. The ranges are wide, reflecting differences in household location and composition. However, a reasonable central range for poorer households would be a lower bound cost of $830 per year for a household with no children living in a rural area, up to $3,500 for a poor family living in an expensive city such as New York with a young child in full-time infant care.116



 **Table 4: Summary of costs of interventions on the poor and single parents (dollars per year)**





The figures here relate only to the direct effects of these policies on prices and so ignore the broader effect on productivity and market incomes. For land-use and zoning laws, child-care regulations, policies that increase driving costs, and occupational licensure these secondary effects could be very large indeed. Liberalization could improve labor mobility, willingness to move into the labor market, and job options available to the unemployed and existing low-paid workers.



The calculations are cautious for other reasons. Estimates of the cost of sugar interventions and tariffs on clothing and footwear assume that the poor have the same consumption habits as the broader population, though there are reasonable grounds to suspect the cost borne by them is even higher. The cost of child-care regulations is pegged at the savings from very modest relaxation of existing staffing regulations, rather than full repeal, which could deliver huge price reductions. This analysis also ignores regressive interventions in other areas where the poor spend significant amounts, especially health care and utilities.



Individual households will face very different costs depending on exactly where they live, whether they have young children, their means of transportation, and other spending tastes and preferences. This paper has shown, though, that a “cost-based” reform agenda could deliver major financial savings for poor families.



A concerted anti-poverty agenda across all levels of government overturning these damaging policies could have political benefits too. The lower cost of living would lessen political demands for government to redistribute income. The aspirations of the “living wage” campaign would be much more likely to be achieved, but through lower living costs rather than demands for states or cities to raise minimum wages. Better financial outcomes for the poor through market activity might lead to greater support for economic liberalization in other sectors.



Reform would be politically challenging. But with the federal finances suffering from large and growing imbalances and widespread concern about the future of labor markets, now is an opportune time for a new approach to assist those on low incomes. For too long an obsessive focus on the role of government transfers and minimum wage laws in alleviat­ing poverty has blinded campaigners and poli­ticians to areas where existing policies raise living costs. We should aspire to undo this damage, rather than doubling down on a more interventionist agenda that, in part, seeks to treat the symptoms of current mistakes.

9. For example, it is widely acknowledged that policies that seek to ameliorate climate change by raising the cost of carbon emissions hit the poor hard. But the objective of these policies is to internalize the social costs of carbon, which theoretically raises overall economic efficiency. Though one can debate whether existing policies do this well, or whether they are needlessly regressive, this paper avoids issues where these kinds of judgments are required, instead focusing on areas where market failure arguments are weak and the policies have clear regressive effects.

38. Calculation by author subtracting Glaeser et al. estimate of implied regulatory tax for New York (12.2 percent) from average New York household expenditure on shelter of $16,882 in 2016 (taken from Consumer Expenditure Survey 2016, Table 3004). This implies regulation raises average household expenditure by $1,836 per year. Given those in the poorest quintile, on average, spend 57 percent of average household expenditure on shelter across the whole of the United States (Consumer Expenditure Survey 2016, Table 1101), this suggests these households pay $1,044 more for shelter than they would if the regulatory tax was zero.

53. Author’s calculation applying Thomas and Gorry’s lower bound estimate of price fall from loosening staff-child ratios by one across the board (9 percent) to the average annual cost of the most expensive care in the country (D.C. at $23,089 per year) and the cheapest (Mississippi at $5,178). This implies prices would fall by around $2,078 in DC and $466 in Mississippi, assuming a linear relationship.



54. Ryan Bourne and Len Shackleton, “Getting the State out of Preschool and Childcare.” 



55. Though not analyzed here, it is likely that the cost of childcare is also pushed up by other, broader government policies which have damaging economic consequences. Zoning and land-use ordinances quite often prohibit new facilities in residential areas, and home daycare has to comply with requirements on lot size, parking, and architectural regulations. Barriers to immigration from poorer countries also restrict the supply of lower-cost child-care workers.

62. Calculated by author. Based on a regulatory cost of $44 for a white household earning $10,000 and $38 for a household earning $20,000, a straight-line extrapolation suggests the cost to a household with average income for the quintile ($11,363) would be $43. Assuming this cost holds for all nonblack households, and that the burden is one-third of this for black households, one can use the proportion of black to nonblack households in the bottom quintile (20:80) to calculate the overall average regulatory burden for the quintile (80% x $43 + 20% x $14) = $37.51. Given that we know the ratio of spending by the average single-parent household to the average household in the poorest quintile on dairy is 1.43, the average regulatory cost for single-parent households can be estimated $37.51 x 1.43 = $54.31.

Dr Megan Woods [(Minister of House Building and Windfarms)](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/06/its-an-ill-wind-that-blows-everybody-no-good/) recently announced the results of the latest handouts to boffins from the Marsden Fund.



“Climate change is long-term challenge that requires out-of-the-box thinking and that’s why the Government has made more progress in two years than the last Government did in nine.



“Science and research have been critical in the progression of our Zero Carbon Bill that returns to parliament today, as well as giving New Zealanders more choice on electric cars, and drives our work alongside businesses to reduce emissions.



“We welcome today’s investment that tackles head-on both climate change and our goal of running the country exclusively on renewable electricity by 2050.



“The knowledge and solutions that will be created because of this research will put us in good stead towards creating a productive, sustainable and inclusive New Zealand. I congratulate all of the recipients announced today,” Megan Woods said.



 **Projects aimed at addressing climate change**





 **Projects aimed at renewable energy issues**





The fat end of a million bucks to find out how the South Pacific got on when it rained in the last glacial period. Yeah, that’ll really help us all. How many ‘research’ trips to the tropics will that require?



I trust that the locals have properly preserved the rainfall records from that time.

"UNITED NATIONS  —   Already furious over President Trump’s visa ban, Iran warned the United States on Tuesday not to escalate tensions over tests of Iranian missiles  —   tests that his administration’s new United Nations ambassador called “absolutely unacceptable. ” The Iranian warning, made in Tehran by Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, came a day after American and Israeli officials accused Iran of having conducted a missile test that they said had violated a United Nations Security Council resolution. The United States called an urgent meeting of the Council on Tuesday to discuss the grievance, making Iran the subject of the first diplomatic skirmish at the United Nations by Nikki R. Haley, the former governor of South Carolina who is Mr. Trump’s new ambassador. “The United States is not naïve,” she told reporters after the closed meeting. “We’re not going to stand by. You’re going to see us call them out as we said we would, and you are also going to see us act accordingly. ” Ms. Haley took no questions after her Security Council debut and proposed nothing concrete. The council agreed to refer the issue to its own sanctions committee for further inquiry, which is what it did last year after the last missile test by Iran. Iran has not confirmed that it conducted a test. But Mr. Zarif, at a joint news conference in Tehran with his visiting counterpart from France,   Ayrault, said he hoped that the new American administration would not use Iran’s military defenses “as a pretext to create new tensions. ” When the nuclear deal with Iran was reached in 2015 with major powers including the United States, they agreed sanctions on Iran would be relaxed in exchange for its verifiable pledges of peaceful nuclear work. A Security Council resolution “called upon” Iran not to undertake any tests of missiles designed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Iran contends that it has not violated the resolution and that its missiles are not designed to carry nuclear warheads  —   which it already has promised not to make as part of the nuclear accord. Nonetheless, the American and Israeli accusations have created what amounts to an early test of the Trump administration’s toughness on Iran. During the presidential election campaign, Mr. Trump denounced the nuclear agreement and sometimes conflated it with the Iranian missile program. Arms control experts have cautioned that Iran’s missile tests are not prohibited under the nuclear accord. Ms. Haley used tough words about such tests but did not say whether her administration regarded them as a violation of the accord. “We have said with this administration that we are not going to show a blind eye to these things that happen,” she said. “We’re going to act. We’re going to be strong. We’re going to be loud and we’re going to do whatever it takes to protect the American people and the people across the world. ” Iran’s United Nations mission added to Mr. Zarif’s warning, issuing a Foreign Ministry statement asserting that Iranian ballistic missiles are “exclusively for legitimate defense. ” The statement said missile tests “are an integral component” of Iran’s   and that “we reject politically motivated comments regarding Iran’s missile program. ” Mr. Zarif also used the news conference on Tuesday to emphasize Iran’s anger over the Trump administration’s executive order on Friday suspending refugee admissions and prohibiting the issuance of visas to Iran and six other   countries. Mr. Zarif called the order “a shameful act. ” The order has upended the lives of thousands of Iranians, who are by far the largest population affected among the seven countries, which also include Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Iran’s government has pledged a reciprocal response to the order. Mr. Ayrault told reporters at the news conference that France had “expressed its concern” over Iran’s missile tests, according to an account by Agence  . Earlier, upon Mr. Ayrault’s arrival in Tehran, Iranian news media quoted him as saying the Trump administration’s order on refugees and visas amounted to “discrimination” and should be revoked."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few weeks ago the University of Bremen put out a  damning press release on smart meters, which are intended to save power and to balance out supply and demand.
Scientists at the University of Bremen looked at how markets and the power grid would react to their use. Since 2010 these smart meters have been mandatory for new buildings and for those being renovated. The meters are designed to recognize the lowest electricity rates and thus allow programmable appliances to switch on automatically.
The press release writes:
Scientists at the Institute for Theoretical of the University of Bremen, however, are expressing doubts that the approach will actually deliver what it promises – namely reducing power fluctuations in the grid. They simulated a market that uses intelligent power meters and have reached a surprising result: The intelligent power meters will produce an artificial power market that – as is the case with all markets – that can also produce bubbles and even crashes. The Bremen physicists published their results in the largest and oldest physics journal of the world, the Physical Review of the American Physical Society.”

As more and more solar and wind energy gets fed into the European power grid, the power fluctuations have become more pronounced. The smart grid and meters are intended to even out the fluctuations. The University of Bremen press release writes that when the wind blows, the extra power added to the grid will make the prices fall and thus lead to more appliances turning on to take advantage of the low rates. For example a homeowner will have the possibility of programming his washing machine to turn on as soon as a certain low price level is reached. Thus theoretically the market will be ruled by the economic law of supply and demand. Sounds good.

But Professor Stefan Bornholdt of the Institute for theoretical Physics of the University of Bremen sees major obstacles and warns that it will not be that simple, saying “the standard theory of supply and demand is however incomplete when a huge number of consumers compete at the same time for the best price.“ Their computer simulations show things likely will not happen like as they should. The press release writes:
They simulated the competition between consumers with the computer and discovered that in this newly created power market segment things could become ‘chaotic, wild and fidgety’ – just like in the financial markets.”
They provide an example:
‘When there is little power in the grid and the price as a result is high, then washing will simply be put off. But that cannot be the case forever because washing is a basic necessity,’ explains Stefan Bornholdt. ‘The more preprogrammed machines you have waiting for their start, the greater the potential demand rises: A demand bubble forms.’ And it pops as soon as the price again drops a bit more: Because many consumers will suddenly start countless washing machines all at once because they will have reprogrammed upward because of they will have reached their threshold of pain with backed up washing needs. ‘This will spark a collective avalanche mechanism that will burden the power grid extremely – blackouts due to unexpected overloads cannot be excluded,’ says the Bremen physicist.”
The team of physicists says that the massive use of new intelligent power meters was “a hasty decision that had been poorly thought through“.

"**The Philippines is playing a key role in the wave of disinformation sweeping the world. So-called troll farms are being used to create multiple fake social media accounts that post political propaganda and attack critics. But a group of people calling themselves the Troll Patrol are trying to use their own tactics against them, as the BBC's Howard Johnson reports.**
In 2016, Gina - not her real name - and others, watched with alarm as a group of Catholic schoolgirls in the Philippines came under attack from online trolls.
The girls had been filmed and photographed standing on a street in the capital Manila in their uniforms, chanting: ""Marcos is no hero! Marcos is no hero!""
They were angry that former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos had just been buried in a nearby hero's cemetery with military honours.
In the 21 years he ruled, billions of dollars of public money went missing while thousands were arrested and tortured for opposing his regime.
But his family have remained both politically influential and popular and are closely aligned to the current President Rodrigo Duterte.
Within hours of the photos being posted on the school's Facebook page, and then widely reshared, comments began to appear defending the Marcos legacy and attacking the girls' actions. Some of them were from genuine accounts, but many were from pro-government trolls using fake accounts.
""If Marcos is no hero, I would say most of you are no virgins and that's the trend of young girls nowadays,"" said one. There were also rape threats.
""We're talking about kids here. Nobody was doing anything about it,"" says Gina. ""We realised that we should beat them at their own game.""
Gina and a group of equally-concerned individuals, who would go on to be known as the ""Troll Patrol"", took action.
Much like the trolls, the group began creating fake Facebook accounts - Facebook doesn't require photo ID proof of identity - so they could defend the girls without risking personal attacks themselves.
They created scores of accounts whose posts were designed to counter the narrative of the online pro-government bullies through logic and reasoning.
Night-after-night the group would log into Facebook scanning for threatening posts or abusive behaviour and begin posting their counter-comments.
""We realised that if [opponents] feel that you are part of the group that actually opposes the views of government, people would never listen to you,"" says Gina.
""You have to make them feel that you are actually part of their circle who just happened to have a change of opinion. You can educate the people and at the same time you can say whatever you wanted to be able to protect the people who were being cyber-bullied.""
Within a week the controversy over the protest began to die down, but the problem of trolling has far from gone away in the Philippines. And it's not just used to support President Duterte and those aligned with him, it's also used to silence critics.
Journalists, human rights defenders and politicians have all reported receiving systematic abuse and death threats. I too have received threats online for my reporting, saying I would be ""hunted down"" and ""beaten"". One comment read ""watch your back"", accompanied by a skull and crossbones emoji.
Many of the most ardent trolls are supporters of the president - they call themselves DDS (Diehard Duterte Supporters), a play on the lettering of the Davao Death Squad, an execution squad, which according to the United Nations, killed more than 1,000 people in the city in the southern Philippines while Duterte was its mayor.
Mr Duterte has even admitted paying people to promote him or defend him on social media, though he insisted he only did so during his successful 2016 election campaign.
According to Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) undersecretary Jose Joel Sy Egco, the government has never used paid-for ""keyboard warriors"" to attack critics while Mr Duterte has been in office.
Mr Egco told the BBC that online troll threats come from a ""myriad of sources"", which could include ""somebody's neighbours"" to ""any local official you had a brush with recently"".
There have been reports in the Philippine media about ""troll farms"" - centres where people are allegedly paid to write abusive comments on peoples' social media accounts. I asked Mr Egco what the government had done to investigate these claims:
""If you're asking us, if you're asking me as a government official here, I am definitely against any such practice, if there's any at all.""
I hadn't asked Mr Egco if the government was behind the troll farms, but he went on to elaborate:
""In government, we are very diligent in spending our budget and we don't have budgets for those kind of things. Maybe some people did that in the past and maybe some people are still doing it right now, but definitely I tell you, in all honesty, and I swear to God, I myself do not believe in such.""
Mr Egco said that his team had received ""a lot of complaints"" by media workers about cyber-harassment and cyber-bullying and that the department had investigated the cases but had run into a brick-wall when social media companies refused to disclose information on the people posting the comments.
Facebook wouldn't confirm whether it had any plans to make it harder for people to set up fake accounts, but a spokesperson said the company was ""committed to removing content that violates our policies, disrupting coordinated inauthentic networks, and limiting the spread of misinformation"".
This week the company took down two networks based in the Philippines and China for violating their policy on ""foreign or government interference."" The networks, which included more than 200 accounts, targeted Filipino Facebook users with, among other things, content supportive of President Rodrigo Duterte.
Despite the online abuse, I have never been threatened in real life in the Philippines. But online troll behaviour can precede deadly outcomes. Recently two human rights defenders, who had been repeatedly trolled and threatened online were killed within a week of each other.
On 10 August, unidentified assailants killed peasant leader Randall Echanis, 72, inside his home in Quezon City, in Metro Manila. Then on August 17 unidentified gunmen fatally shot Zara Alvarez, a legal worker for the human rights group Karapatan. The group says 13 of their activists have been killed in the past four years.
Within minutes of Ms Alvarez's killing, another member of Karapatan, Clarizza Singson, received a message on Facebook warning that she ""would be next.""
The group say they are the repeated targets of ""red-tagging,"" in which the authorities and online trolls label them as Communists, linking them to the country's decades-old Communist insurgency.
And rights groups fear a newly passed Anti-Terrorism Act could weaponise the troll's posts.
The law allows for the detention of 'terrorist' suspects for up to 24 days without charge. An Anti-Terror Council, made up of Duterte appointees, has the power to designate people as suspected terrorists, subject to surveillance for 60 days and arrest, based on mere accusations.
Supporters of the law say it is needed to bolster efforts against ongoing armed insurgencies mainly in the south of the Philippines.
But rights group Amnesty International says even the mildest government critics can be labelled terrorists, based on accusations thrown online by anonymous pro-government trolls.
""In the prevailing climate of impunity, a law so vague on the definition of 'terrorism' can only worsen attacks against human rights defenders,"" said Nicholas Bequelin, AI's Asia-Pacific Regional Director.
Gina says she and the Troll Patrol make no apologies for adopting similar tactics to get their message across.
""We justify [our] actions because they are all part of free speech, which we really hold in high regard,"" says Gina. ""It would have been easy to report the pro-government accounts. But honestly, let them say whatever they want to say. Bad speech can only be fought by better speech. I don't really believe in censure.""
And with more Filipinos expressing free speech, Gina believes the need for the Troll Patrol is diminishing.
""Nowadays, we no longer hide under these personas,"" says Gina. ""We still speak out against abuses whether by the administration or the opposition. But this time, we speak as ourselves."""
"Before today, sea level rise and flooding were already forecast to wreak havoc for millions now and in the coming decades. Now, the story looks much worse – three times worse, to be precise. According to new research, hundreds of millions more people are already at risk from climate breakdown-caused coastal flooding and sea level rise than previously thought. And by the end of the century, large swathes of the coastal land we live on today could be unihabitable – even with immediate and deep emissions cuts. Existing estimates of risk from sea-level rise – taken from NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission – didn’t exactly paint a rosy picture for coastal communities. But in using space-based satellite imagery to measures the elevations of surfaces closest to the sky, much of the data actually reported the elevation of treetops and rooftops, rather than the ground itself. As a result, it overestimates coastal elevations by more than two metres on average, and more than four metres in urban areas. This may not sound like much, but for millions of people two or three metres is the difference between safety or loss of livelihood and forced relocation. Thankfully, a handful of nations have now scanned coastal elevation using airborne laser-based radar equipment, and the new research, published in Nature Communications, uses the difference between these much more precise data and previously existing figures to recalibrate global estimates for land at risk of sea-level rise and flooding.  Based on the new model, the authors estimate not 28m but 110m people are already living below the current high tide line. And instead of 68m people living below annual flood levels, the figure is now 250m – the same number that live less than one metre above sea level. That’s the equivalent of the UK, Russia, and Spain combined. This increase in vulnerability to sea-level rise and flooding is not evenly distributed. More than 70% of those living on at-risk land are in eight Asian countries: China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Japan. And for many of these countries, the increase in risk that the new model predicts for the coming decades is much higher than three-fold. Of course, it’s not just Asia that’s vulnerable – 20 other countries outside of the continent are expected to see land that is currently home to 10% of their total populations fall below end-of-century high tide lines, even if emissions peak by 2020 and are then cut deeply. This count is up from two using NASA’s data. All but three are island nations, and 13 of the 20 are small developing island states. For these countries in particular, how we react to the climate crisis is hugely important. If emissions peak by 2020, land now home to roughly a fifth of the populations of Bangladesh and Vietnam may be lower than high tide lines in 2100. But if emissions continue unchecked, this proportion rises to a third. What’s clear though is that even in best case scenarios, levees, seawalls and other defences are going to be vital in protecting hundreds of millions of coastal residents. Countries are yet to agree on who will pay for new defences against sea-level rise and flooding, and the costs of losses and damages. In light of the sharp rise in the forecast vulnerability of nations that have contributed the least to global emissions, I sincerely hope that long industrialised powers accept their historical responsibility for emissions and protect those they have placed under threat. Areas with existing defences aren’t safe either. Eight of the ten largest cities in the world are situated on the coast, and many of them have relied on existing flood defences to allow so many millions of people to flourish on or below the high tide line. These are by no means guaranteed to protect against future sea levels and storms – superstorms already breach flood defences in the most developed cities in the world. Many defences will need enhancing if they are to prevent large areas of the most populous cities from being regularly submerged underwater.

      Sea level rise is inevitable – but what we do today can still prevent catastrophe for coastal regions


 Away from urban areas, the astronomical costs of protecting large areas from sea-level rise and flooding means that millions will need to be resettled in the coming decades – or else forcefully displaced by the rising seas we’re causing. Even in countries such as the US and the UK, sea-level rise this century may require large-scale migration away from unprotected coastlines. In countries less able to cope, loss of lives and livelihoods, political chaos, and conflict are highly likely without support. The sad reality is that coastal communities worldwide look to be set for much more difficult futures than currently anticipated.

"William Nordhaus was awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Economics for “integrating climate change into long-run macroeconomic analysis”.  This implies that he worked out what global heating means for our economy, given what climate scientists say will happen to our planet.  But Nordhaus’s predictions of what global heating will cost the earth are dangerously at odds with the science. In his Nobel Prize lecture, Nordhaus described a 4°C increase in global average temperature as “optimal” — that is, the point at which the costs and benefits of mitigating climate change are balanced. In a subsequent academic paper based on this lecture, he stated that “damages are estimated to be 2 percent of output at a 3°C global warming and 8 percent of output with 6°C warming”. This is a trivial level of damage, equivalent for the 6°C warming case to a fall in the rate of economic growth over the next century of less than 0.1% per year. Nordhaus’s conclusions are based in part on the simple but wayward assumption that the weak relationship between temperature and GDP within the US today can be used to assume how future global temperature rises will affect the economy. For example, the coldest state in mainland US is North Dakota, with an average temperature of 4.9°C and a high GDP per head – US$67,000 in 2018. Slightly warmer states such as New York (9.0°C, US$73,000) tend to have higher GDPs, while the hottest state – Florida, at 22.1°C – has a lower GDP (US$43,000). This implies that past a certain point, higher temperatures reduce GDP, but the relationship is very weak: huge changes in temperature result in relatively small changes in income. If it were true that this weak relationship could be applied to global temperature change, then global warming would indeed be nothing to worry about. However, the relationship between temperature and GDP within one country today tells you absolutely nothing about how the world will change if global temperatures rise by 10°C. This can be hard to grasp, since we’re talking about the truly unknown – humanity has never experienced global temperatures that high. But we can assess how unrealistic Nordhaus’s work is because it predicts exactly the same damages for a fall in global temperature as it does for a rise. It predicts, for example, that both a 4°C rise and a 4°C fall in temperature would reduce global GDP by 3.6%. The average global temperature during the last Ice Age was 4°C cooler than today. There’s no way we can accurately predict what GDP would be in such a cool world today, but we know that most of Europe north of Berlin, and of America north of New York, would be under a kilometre of ice. To argue that this would cut GDP by just 3.6% is simply absurd. Indeed, estimates from climate scientists based on relatively conservative figures from the IPCC suggest that limiting global warming to 1.5C instead of 2C are likely to save trillions of dollars by 2100, even accounting for the costs of increased action.  Uncertainties in climate modelling mean that this analysis is by no means definite. But given the distinct possibility that 2°C of warming could set off a cascade of “tipping points” that cause the planet to irreversibly heat to catastrophic temperatures, can we afford to play with fire? The risk to organised human civilisation of sending Earth into a nightmare “hothouse” state should be sufficient alone to justify the higher cost of a decarbonisation timescale compatible with 1.5°C. Even if letting warming reach 2°C or above turned out to be more cost-effective, the saved money is not worth the moral costs of species extinctions, habitat destruction, and forcing climate refugees from their homes.

      Hothouse Earth: here's what the science actually does – and doesn't – say


 The faith that William Nordhaus and others have in the “incredible adaptability of human economies” is almost admirable in a sense. But that adaptability has occurred in a remarkably stable climate where global temperatures have fluctuated by 1℃ below or above the average for the last 10,000 years. If that climate stability breaks down, then human adaptability will almost certainly break down with it. Many climate scientists are now calling for the focus on economy efficiency and incremental change that economists have taken to global warming to be abandoned. When supposedly respected experts disagree so fundamentally over an issue, it would be understandable for the public to switch off. But in this case, such a reaction would be wildly dangerous. Just as energy companies have been accused of paralysing the political response to climate change, the trivialising of the dangers of climate breakdown by mainstream economists has paralysed bold and timely action on climate breakdown for almost 50 years. In that time, humanity’s population has doubled, and the average amount each person consumes has more than doubled. If we don’t challenge the naïve assurances of economists that all will continue to be well, the “human economies” they believed they were defending will tumble just as fast.

Republicans used the muscle of their congressional majority to push forward some of President Trump’s most controversial cabinet nominees, a sign of the struggle ahead for Democrats. The Senate confirmed Rex Tillerson as secretary of state in a narrow, contentious vote. Several more nominations cleared committees: Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general, Steven Mnuchin for Treasury secretary and Tom Price to head the Department of Health and Human Services. But Betsy DeVos, above, is in trouble, after two Republican senators said they would not back her for education secretary. Here’s our full coverage of the new administration. _____  2. Mr. Trump pushed back against any Democratic slowdowns in confirming his pick for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, above left, suggesting that the Senate majority leader could “go nuclear” in terms of floor procedures. Later in the day, Mr. Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to honor the remains of the Navy commando killed in a raid on Al Qaeda forces in Yemen on Sunday, the first combat casualty of his presidency. In our new podcast, The Daily, our reporter Michael Barbaro covers the day’s big stories and ideas in 15 minutes, five days a week. Today: making sense of the Gorsuch pick. Listen here. _____  3. The administration is beginning to confront knotty foreign policy issues. Iran argued that it had not violated a U. N. Security Council resolution with its recent missile test. The U. S. called for a Security Council meeting to discuss the matter. Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, said Iran was “on notice. ” Above left, President Hassan Rouhani at an exhibition on Iran’s achievements in space technology. _____ 4. Israeli security forces clashed with settlers defying a court order to evacuate the unauthorized settlement outpost of Amona in the West Bank. Hundreds of young activists burned tires, blocked roads and barricaded themselves at the site. Amona is a flash point for the settler movement, and the case had gone through the courts for years. But hours before the police entered Amona, the Israeli government made a major   move, approving construction for 3, 000 new homes in the West Bank and calling for a new settlement to be established. _____ 5. Ban   the former United Nations chief, said he would not run for the presidency of South Korea. The surprise announcement deprives conservatives of their likeliest candidate to succeed the country’s embattled leader, Park   who is facing impeachment. “I was deeply disappointed by outdated and   egoism among some politicians,” Mr. Ban said bluntly. “I have determined that it is meaningless to try to work with them. ” _____ 6.

 **1\. Why are we so concerned about this virus, which so far (as of mid-March) has killed many fewer people than an ordinary flu?**



The key to the answer lies in the words “so far.” The virus seems to spread at a phenomenal rate, with cases doubling more than once a week. If the number of deaths were to double once a week, then starting from about 200 deaths on March 15, by the end of May the total would be 200,000 deaths, which is about ten times the number that we get from ordinary flu.



The Imperial College paper made an extrapolation that warned of the possibility hundreds of thousands of deaths if social distancing were not encouraged.



 **2\. How do differences in testing frequency and reporting practices affect reported spread rates and death rates?**



The reported spread rate depends on the actual spread rate and the trend in testing frequency. For example, in the United States, testing ramped up the week of March 16, and the reported spread rate rose above 50 percent per day on some days, but that is probably well above the actual spread rate. It is very difficult to estimate the actual spread rate as long as testing protocols are changing.



Death rates are also very unreliable. Some people have died of the disease without being tested for it, so that they do not count in the virus death statistics.



Deaths occur with a lag so that if the number of cases is increasing, the reported death rate will understate the true death rate. To see this, assume that the true death rate is 1 percent, and death occurs 5 days after someone becomes a “case” by testing positively for the disease. Suppose that on day one there are 100 cases and on day five there are 1000 cases. As of day five, there will be one death (out of the original 100 cases), but dividing this by the number of current cases (1000), we would compute a death rate of 0.1 percent, which is far below the true number.



Other factors will cause the reported death rate to be _over_ stated. Most important, many people who have the disease in mild forms will never be tested and thus will not count as cases. So the death rate relative to the number of reported cases will be high relative to the true death rate.



 **3\. What factors affect actual death rates (not the reported death rates)?**



An important factor is the quality of care. There was a relatively low death rate on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, and it is likely because the sick passengers and crew were well cared for. In Italy, the death rate from the virus was modest for a while, but it soared once the health care system became overwhelmed. The countries with the highest death rates appear to be those with the weakest health care systems and/or those whose systems are most overwhelmed by a large caseload. But it is hard to be certain, given the challenges with reporting and calculating death rates accurately.



Age and existing health conditions are other important factors. Death rates for the very young are minimal, and death rates for the very old are high.



Although death rates among otherwise healthy people under age 60 and are low, they are not zero. Deaths of health care workers are particularly worrisome.



We should not treat the death rate as if it is some natural constant. When a large share of the cases is in the elderly population, as in the state of Washington in early March, the death rate will be high. When there are ample human and physical resources to treat patients, the death rate will be lower than otherwise. If new treatment protocols, including pharmaceuticals, prove to be effective, the death rate could plummet.



 **4\. What policies have worked best in reducing the spread rates?**



Policies to completely isolate those who have or might have the disease appear to have worked in China and South Korea. This seems to require strict quarantine and extensive surveillance. In South Korea, testing was widespread, as was “tracing and tracking.” When someone is sick, you try to trace back to see who might have made them sick, and you try to track down anyone else who might have come into contact with a sick individual. To do this, the authorities can use data on people’s phones to plot their movements. Presumably, this is not something that Americans are ready to allow.



If only sick people can spread the disease, then isolation of people with obvious symptoms can be effective. But if people who experience no symptoms or mild symptoms can spread the disease, then more general social distancing is required. Apparently, many experts believe that the disease can be spread by people who are not yet severely symptomatic.



 **5\. How is government enforcement of social distancing justified by a difference between private costs and social costs?**



The personal cost to me of risking infection is relatively low. Suppose I go to a crowded restaurant. Even if I get infected, I am unlikely to die, particularly if I get good treatment should my case be severe.



But the cumulative social cost of many people deciding to risk infection is high. First, they may infect others who have high risk. Second, as the number of people requiring treatment rises, the capacity of the health care system becomes strained, the quality of treatment falls, and the death rate rises.



Front-line health care workers are particularly inclined to stress the social cost of people risking infection. They see cases of young people requiring ventilators. They see fellow health care workers become sick and even die. They see the limits on supplies of equipment needed to treat patients.



 **6\. How can a short, unpaid vacation for some sectors of the economy have such large ramifications?**



Financial obligations don’t sleep. The small business that is temporarily closed and wants to keep its workers still has to make payroll. The individual who is temporarily laid off still has to pay rent and make car payments. The airline whose planes are grounded still has to pay the bank for the loans that it took out to purchase the planes.



Our society is highly levered. Many households have not saved enough to go even a few weeks without a paycheck. Many businesses make heavy use of debt financing and have little cash reserves. Banks deposits are supposed to be riskless and available on demand, even though the assets backing those deposits are risky, long-term loans.



When economic activity is running smoothly, this leverage is efficient. Households can enjoy goods sooner than otherwise by obtaining them on credit. Businesses can expand more by using borrowing than they could if they had to rely on cash flow from profits. Banks and other financial institutions allow households to buy homes, operate small businesses, and start new ventures.



But all this leverage increases fragility and interdependence. When households don’t have cash reserves, a short unpaid vacation means that they cannot pay rent. Then the owner of the apartment building cannot make the payment on its loans. Then the bank does not have the money to pay its depositors unless it forecloses on the apartment building and sells it at a loss, etc. 



In a crisis, everyone tries to reduce their leverage. Households cut back on spending. Banks cut back on lending. Economic activity collapses.



 **7\. What are the long-term economic consequences of this crisis?**



Behavior will change, and economic activity will alter as a result. People who are considering going on a cruise or flying overseas will be more aware of the risk of contracting an illness, and this will reduce demand. People involved in health care systems will be more aware of the risk of running into a surge in demand, and they will try to expand capacity.



People will become more facile at undertaking work, education, and conferences remotely. Businesses that help foster remote interaction will expand. Businesses that are built around large conferences and meetings will shrink.



As businesses develop supply chains, they may become less concerned with maximizing efficiency and a bit more concerned with ensuring robustness. They may prefer sources with more redundancy rather than sources that minimize cost.



An open question concerns what will happen with leverage. The financial crisis of 2008 caused some de-leveraging in the short term. But households and businesses soon got back to operating with high levels of debt and low margins of safety. Perhaps this time people will be more traumatized than they were in 2008. Perhaps this time government authorities will not be as sanguine about rising dependence on credit in the economy.



 **8\. Why aren’t policymakers taking into account the economic cost of closing restaurants and shutting down other forms of economic activity?**



This question implicitly assumes that the alternative of allowing all businesses to operate would be costless. That is, it assumes that we could avoid most of the cost of this crisis if we did not “panic.”



In fact, even if the government does nothing, many individuals and businesses will curtail their activities, based on what they know about the virus. Many private actors were ahead of the government in canceling travel and conferences. The economic costs were already going to be significant, even without government advice or mandates.



More important, an alternative strategy of allowing or encouraging ordinary economic activity could prove even more costly in the long run. One can imagine a scenario in which the health care system gets overwhelmed, causing many people to die who otherwise would not, both from the virus and from other treatable illnesses. There could emerge a social climate in which people fear and suspect strangers. This low-trust social climate would itself hinder ordinary economic transactions.



There is no way to avoid having the economy take a major hit from the crisis. Without a doubt, some of the policy responses will make things worse than would be the case otherwise, and others will make things better. It will be difficult to determine which is which, both in real-time and in hindsight.



 **9\. What about fiscal and monetary stimulus?**



I am skeptical about both. Conventional monetary stimulus involves the Fed paying for financial instruments with money that it creates at the stroke of a pen. It’s a subtle way of manipulating rates of return in financial markets. That tool now seems to me beside the point, sort of like the steering mechanism on the Titanic after it already hit the iceberg.



Instead, I think we need a lender of last resort. I have suggested giving households and firms government-backed overdraft protection. Here is further elaboration.



Fiscal stimulus means the government taking money out of someone else’s pocket to give it to you. By someone else I mean a future taxpayer. The future taxpayer may face an explicit tax bill, or that taxpayer may end up paying via the “inflation tax:” giving up some real resource in exchange for government-issued money that is going to shrink in purchasing power.



Fiscal stimulus works because you need to pay your bills today. You don’t care about the future taxpayer. The politicians sure don’t.



As the recipient of the government payment, it looks like you are getting a gift, as opposed to the overdraft privilege or credit line. If you borrow using a credit line, you know you’re supposed to pay it back. But it doesn’t look like you have to pay back your gift. Instead, the person who pays back your gift is the future taxpayer. That future taxpayer could turn out to be you, but you won’t think about it that way.



The political lobbying for these gifts will be intense. I am cynical enough to believe that whatever you and I receive will be but a fig leaf to cover up more extravagant gifts for special-interest constituents. One of the big reasons I prefer the credit-line approach is that interest groups won’t fight as hard for money if they know they will have to pay it back.

Paul Collier, Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the Blavatnik School of Government, Oxford University, acknowledges that writing _The Future of Capitalism_ was intellectually “daunting, my proposition being that what was needed was a synthesis of moral philosophy, political economy, finance, economic geography, social psychology and social policy.” In presenting a comprehensive case for what ails capitalism and his “remedies that address our new anxieties,” Collier proposes “an ethical capitalism that meets standards that are built on values, honed by practical reasoning, and reproduced by the society itself.”



The social bases of these new anxieties, found in North America, Europe, and Japan, are geographic, educational, and moral. The successful “metropolitan‐​located class” is well educated, affluent, and possesses the skills needed for the 21st century. Individuals in that class have developed a distinctive moral superiority and have elevated group characteristics, such as minority ethnicity and sexual orientation, into “victim” identities. In contrast, the stigmatized “white working class,” is made up of older workers and young, first‐​time employees, often (but not always) located outside metropolitan hubs; they are employed in less meaningful, lower paying jobs, and have declining living standards. With a growing percentage of wealth accruing to the rich, capitalism has lost some of its popular support and is regarded by many as unfair.



Collier mirrors British political analyst David Goodhart who, in his book _The Road to Somewhere_ (2017), describes this socioeconomic‐​political divide as the “Anywheres” versus the “Somewheres.” The Anywheres are cosmopolitan, educated, mobile, and networked, their lives centered on communities of affinity rather than place, which is secondary. Their politics are progressive or classically liberal. Somewheres, however, are rooted in local communities, where their jobs (often working with their hands or on their feet), commitments, and friendships are part of their families, neighborhoods, and religious congregations. Politically, they tend to be socially conservative, patriotic, and less disposed to vote with their feet.



Collier acknowledges that the parties of the center‐​left and center‐​right are incapable of addressing these new anxieties. Ideologues and populists have, since the Great Recession of 2008, replaced social democracy, which was the prevailing political force of the post‐​World War II era through 1970. Why? Because “the social democrats of the left and right each drifted away from their origins in the practical reciprocity of communities, and became captured by an entirely different group of people who became disproportionately influential: middle‐​class intellectuals,” who Collier refers to as the “WEIRDs: Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich and Developed.”



The economics profession also incorporated a bastardized version of Jeremy Bentham’s utilitarian morality into its concept of “economic man,” who Collier defines as “utterly selfish and infinitely greedy, caring about nobody but himself.” The incorporation of economic man into the public policy calculus resulted in post‐​World War II social democratic policies changing from a foundation of reciprocal obligations of all citizens (i.e., loyalty and fairness) to a toxic combination of utilitarian economics and a morally reliable state justified to redistribute income to whomever had the greatest needs. “Citizens ceased to be moral actors with responsibilities, and were and instead reduced to their role as consumers. The social planner and his Utilitarian vanguard of angels knew best: communitarianism was replaced by social paternalism,” says Collier. From the perspective of communitarianism, one concludes that the interdependence (and balance) among the self, the state, and the market had become increasingly tilted toward the state and market, with the citizen becoming less ethically and morally responsible.



Beginning in the 1970s, political parties of the left abandoned communitarian principles of social democracy, substituting utilitarian and Rawlsian ideologies, the latter ideology focusing on redress for the disadvantaged individual or “victim groups.” Likewise, political parties on the right, embracing the libertarian views of Robert Nozick and Milton Friedman, argued that individuals have rights to freedom that override collective interests, and that freedom to pursue one’s self‐​interest, constrained only by competition, produces superior results compared to what is achievable through public regulation and planning. While I agree with Collier that the political parties of the left have dutifully embraced utilitarian and Rawlsian orthodoxy, which became starkly apparent in both the United States (Democrat Party) and Britain (Labor Party) in 2019, I do not find this libertarian orthodoxy omnipresent in the U.S. Republican Party or British Conservative Party.



Collier argues in favor of an intellectual reset for social democracy, built upon a foundation of pragmatism and communitarianism. Pragmatism argues that, because societies change, we should not expect eternal truths, and the efficacy of a policy should be judged on whether it works, not on whether it conforms to tenets of an ideology. Furthermore, pragmatism is communitarian in origin, as the task of morality is to fit our actions to the values of our community and the specifics of context. Collier emphasizes that a willingness to help others is the result of combining three narratives: “shared belonging” to a group, “reciprocal obligations” within the group, and a link from an action to the well‐​being of the group that shows it to be “purposive.”



Collier proposes a manifesto that recognizes an active state, but one that embraces a more modest role; and a functioning market, but one harnessed by a sense of purpose securely grounded in the ethics and philosophy of David Hume and Adam Smith. Collier replaces “economic man” with his conceptualization of “social man,” who cares what others think of him. Moreover, social man, while still rational, views utility beyond his own consumption — namely, to include personal esteem built on a foundation of “shared belonging.” Social man enables us to understand people and induces us to care about them while assessing their moral character.



Restoring ethics to the market, says Collier, involves four societal entities: state, firm, family, and world. The state’s current lack of ethical purpose reflects a moral decline across society, with many people becoming less generously disposed toward those less fortunate. His prescription is not to instill national values (“they fail to distinguish a particular country from many others”), but to cultivate a sense of “belonging to place.” Collier argues that “patriotism” (rather than nationalism), defined as belonging to a common territory, can be used to recapture “belonging” from nationalists and to restore it as central to people’s identity.



At the level of the firm, Collier argues that the prevailing idea that the sole purpose of a firm is to make profits (“shareholder primacy”) needs to give way to a new way of thinking about corporate governance — one that explicitly recognizes that decisions of corporate boards are of importance to the greater society. Consequently, he recommends different rates of corporate taxation by company size, laws requiring due consideration of the public interest for all board members, and legally requiring representation of worker interests on the board of directors (as found in Germany). Finally, while the role of the state as regulator is necessary, policing the public interest for the firm should be the role of informed “ethical citizens.” And while the responsibility of any board of directors is to be the final arbiter of strategy formation in the publicly traded firm, directors should recognize their mutually interdependent relationships with relevant stakeholders in the firm’s environment. Corporate law does not preclude due consideration of the “public interest”; thus, making this a legal requirement would recognize a reality of the 21st century business environment.



The “ethical family” is the natural unit for creating a sense of belonging, according to Collier. However, he sees ethical family structure under siege, with marriage and child rearing diverging between the highly educated and less educated. By 2010, the divorce rate was one‐​in‐​three among less‐​educated couples compared to one‐​in‐​six among highly‐​educated couples, resulting in “many [less‐​educated] families disintegrating into empty shells” and the paternalistic state becoming more involved with child rearing. Collier’s antidote is that, while the decreasing number of children has reduced the _size_ of families, the _longevity_ of families has increased. That longevity allows patriarchs and matriarchs to help by “regenerating the force of esteem that polices the obligations of the extended ethical family.”



Building an ethical world today, argues Collier, will require a new multipurpose “club” that reflects the realities of current economic and military power. His proposed G6, consisting of China, India, the United States, the European Union, Russia, and Japan, would “fix” global problems, such as climate change, pandemics, and failing states. He believes it will take years for this club to form, but hopes for a more effective club than the existing international arrangements such as the G20 or G7. For Collier’s G6 to work, the authoritarian and strongly nationalistic governments in China and Russia will require a major infusion of enlightened self‐​interest.



To heal the cleavages now found in modern capitalist societies, Collier proposes general policies for restoring the inclusive society. The first task is addressing the geographic divide between booming metropolises and broken cities. Collier takes a page from Henry George and recommends taxing the annual appreciation in the value of land and property as a percentage of land and property values, with the revenue accruing nationally to benefit the recovery of broken cities. I hope that these policies that redistribute income will be evaluated based on pragmatism — that is, on the efficacy of whether the policy actually works — and will not continue to be ideologically driven. Of course, designing an equitable formula for distributing this revenue back to the local government will be a public policy challenge.



Collier also recommends private‐​sector solutions that may regenerate the provincial cities, including legally restricting banks to a specific city so that their futures are dependent upon the success of the local economy. That proposal, however, ignores the success of branching, which allows banks to diversify their portfolios and hence reduce the risk of failure. Public‐​sector solutions include (1) compensating pioneering firms like Amazon that locate to broken cities (attracting a mega‐​firm like Amazon reaps sufficient scale economies entirely with its own operations to justify being a pioneer for broken city redevelopment); (2) providing access to financing through local development banks; (3) establishing business zones that provide dedicated space and infrastructure; (4) organizing investment promotion agencies that forge connections with potential firms; and (5) developing mutually favorable relationships between local universities and local industry. In the United States, emphasis on state and local initiatives to guide urban redevelopment has a strong foundation in federalism.



Addressing the class divide, argues Collier, requires that stressed families be bolstered through public policies (such as an expanded earned income tax credit and supplemental income support programs) that begin early in the child’s life and help maintain two‐​parent families. Moreover, Collier holds that, when adults are parenting a child, encouraging both parents to get a job provides the wrong signal. Providing transfer payments and in‐​kind support to assist parents at this critical child‐​rearing time reflects their longer‐​term contribution to society. Collier also argues for high‐​quality technical vocational education and training that young people may choose in lieu of the cognitive‐​focused training found in most universities, and he points to Germany’s success in producing a highly productive and well‐​paid workforce. This latter dose of reality needs further support in the United States.



In conclusion, Collier accuses capitalism of generating divided societies and advocates restoring the pragmatic center to the mainstream political parties in the West. He believes that a “shared identity becomes the foundation for far‐​sighted reciprocity.” Returning to a moral pragmatism, he contends, can guide our politics and regenerate the capitalist system from its recent polarized failure to address the divisions fracturing our societies.



Collier, like Adam Smith before him, is right to focus on the explicit recognition of an ethical foundation for capitalism. I believe, however, that Collier has given short shrift to the importance of religion in Western democracies and to capitalism and its moral foundations. Moreover, the teachings of Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism, and recognition of their ethical importance in institutional development, can facilitate policy efforts to bolster democracy and capitalism in a global political climate that is increasingly receptive to nationalism, authoritarianism, and socialism.



I agree with Collier’s assessment that “the pertinent economic menace is the new and virulent divergence in geographic and class fortunes.” Like Collier, University of Chicago economist Raghuram Rajan, in his book _The Third Pillar: How Markets and the State Leave Community Behind_ (2019), also proposes “inclusive localism” to rebuild broken cities and offer people dignity, status, and purpose in life. However, I remain unconvinced that substituting _place_ for _shared values_ will work. As Goodhart notes, the lives of Anywheres center on “communities of affinity rather than place.” Considering the divergence in social and political views between the Anywheres and Somewheres, one can only hope that this secondary affinity to place is sufficient to develop patriotism at the national level and economic redevelopment at the non‐​metropolis, local level.

Guest essay by Ed Hoskins | Data for the USA, Germany and the UK since the year 2000.
These notes quantify the progress and achievement of the massive movement to install renewable energy solutions for electricity generation in Western Nations. They only concern the two most significant new renewable energy sources ie. Solar and Wind-power. They progressively gauge and quantify the nominal rated energy output for these sources and their capacity factors for the three major Western investors in renewable electricity generation, the USA, Germany and in fact to a lesser extent the UK.
The following data sources were reviewed.
United States of America: data available 2000 – 2012
http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/60197.pdf
Germany: data available from 1990 to 2013
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Germany
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_Germany
United Kingdom: data available 2008 – 2013
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_the_United_Kingdom
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_the_United_Kingdom
These data provide installed “nameplate” capacity measured in Megawatts (MW) and energy output measured across the year in total Gigawatt hours, (GWh). Thus they do not provide directly comparable values as Megawatt nameplate capacity and the consequential actual energy outputs achieved. For this exercise the annual Gigawatt hours values were revised back to equivalent Megawatts for comparative purposes, accounting for the 8,760 hours in the year. This measure eliminates the effect of intermittency and non-dispatchability characterising renewable Energy power sources. It does make direct comparisons possible.

 
For comparative purposes a normal fossil fuelled power station is rated with a nameplate capacity of about 1000 Megawatts or 1 Gigawatt. Overall the cumulative outcomes show the scale of the differential between nations and the discrepancy between installed nameplate capacity and the actual energy output achieved so far as, as follows:


 
The three graphs below summarise the available comparative data for each country:


 
In the USA the contribution from wind-power now nominally amounts to about 16 normal power stations, (1GW) and only about 1 1/2 of a normal power station is provided by US solar power. In 2013 the solar output capacity only reached 18.5% of installed nameplate capacity but the averaged over the whole data set it was as much as 21.6%. The solar capacity value has declined significantly. This relatively high capacity figure is because most solar installations are in Southern, desert states, namely California, Arizona, Nevada and Colorado.
In 2013 the wind-power capacity reached the satisfactory output capacity factor of 26.7% of installed nameplate capacity but the averaged over the whole data set was only 24.3%.
The renewable energy investment in the USA nominally now contributes about 3.8% of electricity generation.
The 25 year investment in Germany’s the renewable energy has nominally contributed about the equivalent of about 6 normal power stations, (1 GW) from wind-power. Solar power nominally contributes about 3 more normal power stations. In 2013 the solar output capacity reached 10.8% of installed nameplate capacity but the averaged over the whole data set was only 7.6%.
In 2013 the wind-power capacity reached the relatively low output capacity factor of 19.1% of installed nameplate capacity but the averaged over the whole data set was only 17.0%.
The vast renewable investment in Germany now contributes to some 15.8% of nominal electricicity generation.
In the UK the nominal contribution from wind-power is now equivalent to about 3 normal power stations, (1GW) and only about ¼ of a normal power station is provided by solar power. In 2013 the solar output capacity reached 6.8% of installed nameplate capacity but the averaged over the whole data set it was rather higher at 7.6%.
In 2013 the wind-power capacity reached the satisfactory output capacity factor of 28.5% of installed nameplate capacity but the averaged over the whole data set it only amounted to 22.5%.
The renewable investment in the UK nominally now amounts to 7.9% of electrical generation.

However there is a major problem with these renewable energy sources. Their electrical output is not dispatchable. Their output is entirely unable respond to electricity demand as and when needed. Energy is contributed to the grid in a haphazard manner dependent on the weather, and certainly not necessarily when it is required.
See: http://notrickszone.com/2014/07/21/germanys-habitually-awol-green-energy-installed-windsolar-often-delivers-less-than-1-of-rated-capacity/
For example solar power inevitably varies according to the time of day, the state of the weather and also of course radically with the seasons. Essentially solar power might only work effectively in Southern latitudes and it certainly does not do well in Northern Europe. In Germany the massive commitment to solar energy might well provide up to ~20% of country wide demand for a few hours on some fine summer days either side of noon, but at the time of maximum power demand on winter evenings solar energy input is necessarily nil.
See: http://theenergycollective.com/robertwilson190/456961/reality-check-germany-does-not-get-half-its-energy-solar
See: http://www.ukpowergeneration.info
Electricity generation from wind turbines is equally fickle, as for example in a week in July this year shown above. Similarly an established high pressure zone with little wind over the whole of Northern Europe is a common occurrence in winter months, that is when electricity demand is likely to be at its highest.
Conversely on occasions renewable energy output may be in excess of demand and this has to dumped unproductively. There is still no solution to electrical energy storage on a sufficiently large industrial scale. That is the reason that the word “nominally” is used here in relation to the measured outputs from renewable energy sources.
Overall the renewable energy output from these three major nations that have committed to massive investments in Renewable Energy amounts to a nominal ~31Gigawatts out of a total installed generating capacity of ~570Gigawatts or only ~5.5%.
But even that amount of energy production is not really as useful as one would wish, because of its intermittency and non-dispatchability.

Press Release: **New Conservative**  
Leighton Baker, Leader New Conservative



The Green MP’s call for ACC to divest of its $1Bn investment in fossil fuels overlooks a few basic truths clearly understood by New Conservative and the average New Zealander.



No 1 is that 80% of the world’s energy comes from fossil fuels. It is an economically sound investment, and, seeing as ACC is charged with investing our money wisely, it is a logical choice. (Incidentally, a further 10% comes from biofuels which are blamed for massive deforestation across the globe, and 5% from Nuclear. How palatable is that ?)



No 2 is that every tourist that comes to New Zealand does so burning fossil fuels, so banning investment in them, while being reliant on them, **is an ideological stance** rather than a logical or wise one. 



“If Ms Genter wants to take that **religious stance** with her own money and personal finances – fine, but, as a Minister of the Crown, she is charged with looking after New Zealand’s interests, and we are dependent on fossil fuels and will be for a long time yet,” says Leighton Baker, New Conservative Leader.



China is looking at[ building two large coal-fired power plants each month](https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2019/03/28/china-new-coal-plants-2030-climate/) for the next 12 years according to Greenpeace. Ms Genter is naïve if she believes that New Zealand’s stand on carbon will make one scrap of difference to the world’s ecology.



For New Zealand to have any noticeable effect on the environment, we should be investing in pollution solutions, not jeopardising industry and investments through carbon virtue signalling. Utilising New Zealand’s creativity and problem-solving capabilities means that we would be able to export solutions to the world’s pollution woes, rather than aimlessly spending billions of dollars on a substance we produce little of, without being able to quantify any benefit from the billions spent.



“We call on this government to concentrate on its mandate to look after New Zealand’s interests and not throw us under the carbon bus,” concludes Baker.

In my last article, we discussed the Greenland ice core temperature record. In this article we will discuss the Greenland thermometer record. All the long record thermometer readings are from villages and stations on the coast. Some of these records go back to the early 1800’s, though GISTemp only posts records going back to 1880.
Here is plot of seven stations. Annual averages were downloaded from GISTemp and converted to annual anomalies using the 1951 to 1965 average for each as the baseline, the only years all seven stations had in common.

Figure 1 plots seven Greenland temperature records, their average (the thin black trace), and a five-year centered average of the average (wide bright blue trace).

This result agrees with other papers that were found, for example Box et al 2009. Considering that land surface station records warm an average 40% greater than the global land-ocean average, and that Northern Latitude stations warm an average 40% higher than the global land-ocean average, with Arctic stations averaging higher than that, it makes sense that this combination of surface stations in the northern latitudes will warm at twice the rate of the global average.

Figure 2 is from Box et al 2009, figure 11.
Jason Box’s paper shows that temperatures before 1880 were generally warmer than the decade after 1880, only about one to one and a half degrees colder than at present. The interesting thing is the step-change in temperature between 1920 and 1930. Greenland temperatures stepped upward by two degrees in this decade, the same step as in the 1990 to 2000 decade. But there was no rise in CO2 in those years. Both intervals are preceded by volcanic activity, as shown in Box’s figure 11. The volcanic activity is blamed for the cooling.
But there was cooling for four decades after 1930 without any major volcanoes. If the lack of volcanic activity is to be blamed for the steps upward in temperature, but temperature declined for four decades without volcanoes, what is left for CO2?
There are several logical twists and turns illustrated here. If volcanic eruptions are blamed for the cooling periods, especially in Greenland, with lack of eruptions blamed for warming, only some of the cooling dips are explained. The other cooling episodes are presumably because of ocean current/temperature cycles or the sun. This leaves only a single one decade warming period, from 1995 to 2005, that can possibly be blamed on CO2, though it still could be from those other reasons. That period is really a step at 1998 which we know was due to the El Niño of that year. This is pretty thin gruel on which to float climate calamity.

"Online shopping continues to grow at a phenomenal rate. In 2018, the market value of UK retail was £381 billion of which online transactions made up almost one-fifth. That’s £12.3 billion of grocery items and £58.8 billion of all non-food items purchased online.  As with almost any human activity, this behaviour has a significant impact on the environment. Online shopping uses tonnes of packaging (overall British retail uses 59 billion pieces of plastic each year), and a vast number of air polluting daily deliveries on the roads.  Yet there are ways in which retailers and consumers can use home delivery to reduce the environmental impact of our shopping habits.  Take online grocery shopping, currently dominated in the UK by the big names of Tesco (42.8% market share), Asda (18.41%), Ocado (16.16%) and Sainsbury’s (14.09%). These large organisations have sufficient resources to invest in the cleanest zero-emission (predominantly electric) vehicles for their home delivery service.  The journeys these vehicles make to customers’ homes are likely to present a much smaller carbon footprint than if those customers drove to the supermarket themselves. Delivering to multiple customers over the course of a trip also significantly reduces the total number of journeys required.  So too does the wide variety of delivery slots made available by retailers, along with an increasing number of customers as the popularity of home delivery grows. These factors all allow retailers to optimise delivery routes and reduce their environmental impact.  For non-food home delivery though, the final stage of delivery to the customer is often not managed directly by the retailers, but out-sourced to independent couriers. This fragmented nature of “last-mile” service provision means there is less likely to be the same investment in low-emission vehicles. Indeed, many couriers are self-employed, using their personal vehicles to deliver parcels.  Non-food online deliveries also require each item to be not only individually packed, but also protected by additional packaging to prevent damage in transit.  Another trend having a major impact on the environment is the offer of next-day (and even same-day) deliveries. For non-food items, this means always having available stock – which requires more space to keep it and more energy to store and move it. From a fresh food perspective, the offer of constant availability results in increased levels of food waste.  Also, in order to satisfy such swift delivery requirements, additional vehicles are required to ensure such speedy delivery – often in vehicles that are only partly loaded.  Another point to consider is that online deliveries do not necessarily substitute our own journeys to shops, resulting in an increased net carbon footprint. And research indicates that returns from online purchases are significantly greater than store purchases, resulting in increased levels of waste and increased transportation.  Yet there are choices that consumers can make to reduce the impact their shopping decisions have on the environment.  When short distances (less than 3km, say) exist between shopper and retailer, it is environmentally beneficial to shop in store. It is only when longer deliveries are required that online delivery becomes a greener option.  Where possible, customers who want to benefit from an online shopping experience should opt for the click and collect option to pick up in store, reducing the logistical demands on the supplier. Locker boxes, where you pick up your delivery from a secure locker, offer a good compromise between increasing convenience and reducing environmental impact. A further green, last-mile initiative is crowd-sourcing, where members of the public drop off packages as part of their planned journey for a small fee.  From a packaging perspective, more and more retailers are now offering bag-free options or alternatives to plastic bags. Environmentally conscious consumers should seek out retailers which offer these options.  Encouragingly, retailers are well aware of all of these challenges – and many are working hard to address environmental issues. There is an increased use of biodegradable packaging throughout the supply chain, and more focus on “closing-the-loop” – where retailers are taking responsibility for reusing and recycling products.  But there are elements of the current approach to online shopping that are simply not sustainable. These need to be urgently addressed to meet global challenges regarding air quality and global warming. Overall, the environmental sustainability of the retail market is a complex conundrum. But simple consumer choices can go a long way to making the way we shop greener."
"Expectations are high for the BBC’s new series Seven Worlds, One Planet, but do nature documentaries do enough for the environment? The BBC and David Attenborough have been criticised for side-stepping environmental issues and portraying the natural world as a pristine wilderness in their shows. Even the recent Netflix series, Our Planet – which went further to highlight climate change, habitat loss and species extinctions – shied away from depicting the true scale of these problems, according to some viewers.  Natural history TV producers, including Attenborough, have insisted that alarmism is a turn-off for audiences. But on both sides, the debate seems to be largely based on impressions of how audiences behave, rather than on evidence of how audiences react to these shows. I wondered about this as I watched Planet Earth II in late 2016. I saw that the hashtag “#PlanetEarth2” was trending on social media every time an episode was broadcast, and I realised that there may be a way to measure how these documentaries affect people. Our research, published in Conservation Letters, analysed data from Twitter and Wikipedia to understand how people behave after watching nature documentaries.  Planet Earth II barely mentioned environmental issues – only 6% of the script was dedicated to topics like climate change, and audiences reacted accordingly. Analysing 30,000 tweets with the hashtag #PlanetEarth2 that were posted during episode broadcasts, we saw that only 1% mentioned topics such as species extinction or other environmental issues.  Although the show lacked a clear conservation message, we wondered whether it could still influence audience perceptions of nature, so we looked at the species featured in Planet Earth II. Mammals were hugely over-represented relative to their diversity in the wild, at the expense of invertebrates, fish, amphibians and reptiles. More than half the series was dedicated to mammals, although they are thought to account for less than 4% of all animal species.  Surprisingly, audience reactions on Twitter did not reflect the “charismatic mammal” bias. Whether people tweeted about a species in the show had nothing to do with what taxonomic group it belonged to. The animals that got the biggest reactions weren’t the most endangered either – they were simply those that got the most time on screen. Locusts actually received more Twitter attention than the giraffe-hunting lions. The Twitter data showed that audiences reacted to the species featured in nature documentaries, but in unexpected ways. Analysing Wikipedia activity, we found that almost half of the Planet Earth II species registered annual peaks in visits to their Wikipedia pages immediately after the show was broadcast. People were searching for information on the animals they had just seen and again, the species that got the most airtime also got the most visits on Wikipedia. Those same species still had higher page visit rates up to six months after the show than they did before. In fact, Planet Earth II even served to put some species on the map. Animals like the golden mole received little or no attention before the broadcast, but their Wikipedia pages were regularly visited after Planet Earth II. Galapagos racer snakes – made famous by the scene in which they chased an iguana – had no Wikipedia page before the show, but one was created only two days after the episode broadcast. While we had shown how nature documentaries can raise public interest and awareness for different species, we wondered how this compared to other conservation efforts. If you use social media, you’ll sometimes notice trending topics announcing international days dedicated to a particular species. For instance, February 16 2019 was world pangolin day – the scaly mammal that’s the most trafficked animal in the world.  These campaigns are led by conservation organisations and work similarly to nature documentaries – they’re in the public eye for a day and generate huge peaks in online activity. We found that peaks in Wikipedia activity around these international awareness campaigns was similar to those we observed after episodes of Planet Earth II. In other words, the documentary appeared to be as effective in generating interest and awareness as targeted conservation campaigns.

 We got in touch with two wildlife charities to see whether they had registered increased donations after Planet Earth II. Sadly, there was no clear link between the documentary and donations, but this isn’t altogether surprising. Donations tend to be influenced by many different aspects, including education and personal attitudes, making it difficult to track them back to specific events. But our research does show that nature documentaries can make a difference – even those that don’t appear to be overtly conservation-focused. Documentaries can help raise interest and awareness in nature, helping connect increasingly urbanised societies to the natural world. There is scope for these shows to do more though. Even super-productions like Planet Earth II, Our Planet or Seven Worlds, One Planet can help conservation efforts. Simply by giving more screen time to threatened species, they can help raise public awareness and engagement. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

He now has no vested interests in any black or green energy industries except as a consumer._



Australia is a land of deserts, droughts, floods, bushfires, flammable forests and fire-prone grasslands – these conditions have developed since the start of the Holocene Warm Era about twelve thousand years ago.



All previous Australian bushies, both black and white, have recognised the key principle of fire management in Australia – you can have many small managed “cool” fires in early spring or a few unplanned disastrous “hot” fires consuming a heavy fuel load in hot dry winds in late spring. (Arsonists have other priorities and light their fires at these most dangerous times.)



Every generation of Australians sees its fire disasters and the worst ones get names – “Black Thursday” in 1851, “Black Friday” in 1939, “Ash Wednesday” in 1983, and the worst to date “Black Saturday” in 2009. Not even an armada of expensive water bombers will stop these bushfires – at that stage fire can only be prevented or contained by fire.



 **Good fire management disappeared as rural voters were outvoted by the green leafy suburbs.** Urban greens thought we could prevent all fires and encourage wildlife by locking up more parks and encouraging fire-loving, oil-containing eucalypts and flammable weeds close to towns and dwellings. (Many native plants require fire to burst open their rock-hard seed pods.) Graham Lloyd of the Australian notes that even the Hippies of Nimbin blame greens for “the incendiary state of the Australian bush”.





  
Even more stupid are those who think politicians can control or abolish droughts and bushfires by banning the use of coal and oil in a futile attempt to lower global temperature. The sun, the oceans and recurring El Nino droughts will dwarf all efforts of puny politicians.



We need good fire and forest management and prosecution of arsonists, not costly climate distractions.

 _A BFD reader wrote to their local MP to tell them that National had lost their party vote in 2020 due to their support of the Zero Carbon Bill. To his credit, the MP sent a personal reply._



Thanks for your email correspondence regarding the [Zero Carbon Bill.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/nationals-support-for-flawed-zero-carbon-bill-disappointing/)



I do think on balance National got our position right on this bill. Firstly, the coalition had the numbers so this bill was going through regardless and our vote was more symbolic. Secondly, we have already said we will change the bill in our first 100 days if elected in 2020. **Thirdly, there’s really no teeth in this bill.** All the bill allows for is an independent climate change commission to track our progress on agreed targets and advise the government on how to reduce carbon emissions. The government of the day will always maintain **full control** over what advice they accept or don’t accept.



The changes we proposed were:





As a National supporter I’m sure you can understand the politics of this issue. Realistically we need 48% or more of the Party Vote in order to govern. It is my view and the view of the National Caucus that **we will not achieve that level of support by coming across as climate change deniers.**



I hope we can regain your Party Vote in time for next year’s election.

Climate Doomer Emeritus James Renwick has been found out. Rattled by one of his brighter students who chose not to buy the professor’s plant-food propaganda. 



Renwick worked himself into a tizzy and [raced into print](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/117226283/climate-scientist-rubbishes-his-student--wellington-councillor-sean-rush) to rebut the perfectly valid points raised in new Wellington City Councillor [Sean Rush’s submission](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/sean-rush-for-prime-minister/) to parliament’s select committee considering the Zero-Future Carbon Bill.



In his hasty response to Rush, the good professor lost his critical thinking temporarily and revealed himself, sadly, as a propagandist first and professor, well, at best, a distant second, based on this effort.



Climbing in to Rush’s reproduction of the IPCC’s famous little graph depicting ‘predicted’ global temperature-rise and Rush’s perfectly reasonable pointing-out that that the claims were largely phooey, with real-world observations of actual temperature-rise falling at the minimum, or below, of the ‘predicted’ increase, the good professor substituted his own ‘updated’ graph showing the IPCC’s estimates actually falling mid-range of the ‘predictions’, implying that they were thus ‘reliable’:





Curiously, the good professor’s ‘updated’ scale ends about 2016, an El-Nino and very warm year, but hardly recent. National were still in power then, remember that? And so was Barack Obama and New Zealand held the World Cup in Rugby. **Why then, did the good professor choose circa 2016 as the year for his ‘updated’ image?** After all, there are more-recent versions readily available; like this one:





The latest versions of the same graph show exactly the same thing as Mr Rush pointed out: actual observations reveal a ‘warming’ at the minimum, or below, of all the good and great IPCC’s ‘predictions’.



The professor’s ‘rebuttal’ gets more interesting; amazingly so: 



“he [Sean] overplays the coldness of the LIA [Little-Ice-Age] **as it was** **a regional phenomenon and not global** , like the current warming”. 



This is a particularly dubious, and important, claim – stated as fact, and one we need to pay attention to.



Doomers invented and attempt to advance the convention that the LIA was ‘regional’ (applying only to the Northern Hemisphere, and Europe in particular) to deflect claims by skeptiks of global climate variability. **Little-Ice-Age deniers** pretend the era never existed and wish it away, because to try and sell their ‘warming’ message to the masses, they need to pretend the anomalous cold period was a regional, single, blip. It’s simply bad, nay, shoddy science to measure incremental averaged ‘global warming’ beginning from an unusually chilly era; that’s why, in warmer’s eyes, the concept of a ‘global’ LIA has to go.



Unfortunately for the professor, or worse, it’s actually embarrassing for him to make that statement, very embarrassing, because important studies of which the good professor is almost certainly aware, some by fellow Doomers: _Gergis et al, 2016_ , published in the _Journal of_ Climate, and others, show the LIA was **not** a Northern Hemisphere regional phenomenon. After analysing proxy records from Australian coral and tree-ring samples from New Zealand, the Pacific Islands and Indonesia the poor buggers had to swallow a dead rat, so to speak: 



“Our results support the notion that **a pronounced cool period consistent with the timing of the LIA extended well outside of the Northern Hemisphere** **high latitudes and into the tropical and subtropical regions of the Southern Hemisphere** ”. 



Oh, dear: the Little Ice Age was **not** regional, the LIA was **global**.



Still, that’s just Aussie scientists. Is there any actual evidence of the New Zealand climate specifically being consistently, anomalously, cold, synchronous with the Northern Hemisphere LIA? Something Professor Re-butter would have certain knowledge of? Well; yes. 



There is more proof, much more, that Professor Renwick’s statement is **false** and that the LIA was a global, not a regional, phenomenon. It comes in study from 2014 entitled _“_ ** _The Little Ice Age climate of New Zealand_** _reconstructed from Southern Alps cirque glaciers: a synoptic type approach”_ published in _Climate Dynamics_ which states:



“land-based temperature and precipitation **anomalies suggest both** **colder- and wetter-than-normal conditions were a pervasive component of the base climate state across New Zealand** **during the LIA** , **as were colder-than-normal Tasman Sea surface temperatures**.”



So, there you have it. The good professor appears willing to compromise honesty for a preferred climate-catastrophe narrative; that’s what it seems, if indeed our professor was aware of the relatively recent publications. But, who cares about what I say, just a mortal right-wing-nut-job. Why not ask an expert – someone authoritative, a hallowed scientist perhaps, a ‘professor’ maybe? Like this guy, one of the authors of those words, the very “pervasive components” of the statement above, thank God that the likes of him exist:





Such a sterling bloke would never mislead you would he? Surely not – ignore the science just to support a climate-doom global-warming narrative? He would never, ever, pretend the LIA was just a NH ‘regional phenomenon’ when he knew, full well, all along, as he said it, that it was **not** , simply in an attempt to discredit someone with a countervailing point-of-view? He wouldn’t do that; would he?  




Over to you…

LA Times making frantic excuses

Eric Worrall writes: The LA Times has published an article which asks whether the faithful should worry about the rapid growth of Antarctic sea ice, an observation which sharply contradicts model predictions that the ice should all be melting away.
Naturally the article concludes that their readers should not be worried.
The prevailing theory amongst researchers interviewed by the Times, seems to be that global warming is strengthening circumpolar winds. They also suggest global warming is causing increased snowfall on the ice covered ocean.
Sharon Stammerjohn, a sea ice researcher at the University of Colorado; “It makes no sense to talk about a circumpolar average. There’s so much regional variability.”
According to Stammerjohn, it’s even possible that the current growth spurt is just a short upward wiggle in a larger downward trend. “Thirty years isn’t really that long,” Stammerjohn said.

"Citizen action on climate change has reached a new intensity: school children by the thousands regularly skip school to protest and Extinction Rebellion’s civil disobedience recently caused widespread disruption in cities around the world. Challenge and disruption is important in prompting change. But it’s also key that we consider – and show – how a zero carbon future could work in practice. This is where the field of social innovation – the development of new ideas that meet social needs – is coming of age. When climate change was last so prominent, at the time of Kyoto, 1997, and again in the mid-2000s, most of the emphasis was on targets and treaties on the one hand, and big R&D budgets for clean tech on the other. Now there is a much better understanding that if these aren’t combined with social innovation from the bottom up, they’re unlikely to stick.   One reason for this is that cutting carbon use depends on changing social norms and behaviour as much as technology – whether local food sourcing or reducing fast fashion. Another reason is the urgent need to show the sceptics that they won’t necessarily be harmed by things like higher petrol prices or shrinking traditional industries like coal mining. A low carbon economy can mean many more jobs, for example in refurbishment or recycling e-waste.

 But this requires a very different approach to innovation, in which investment in new technology is matched by investment in new ways of organising society. And investment in technology alone has dominated the last century. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a huge shift occurred in support of institutionalised science, which moved from being primarily a military concern (better warships or rifles) or a matter for enthusiastic amateurs, to becoming much more systematic.   Governments invested large sums in research laboratories and universities, alongside a huge growth of spending on military technology, which constitutes more than 50% of public research and development (R&D) in the US. Big firms set up R&D labs. The shares of GDP devoted to R&D crept up, to around 2% in countries like the UK and closer to 4% in others like Korea and Finland. The result was a tide of new technologies that has changed every aspect of our lives. Unfortunately, rapid innovation in hardware wasn’t matched by equally restless innovation in society. The same is true today. Large sums of public money are spent advancing aerospace or pharmaceuticals, but little comparable is done to innovate in homelessness or loneliness. The result has been a chronic gap between technological and economic dynamism on the one hand, and social stagnation on the other. And it’s the latter that often fuels resistance to necessary action on climate change. As head of the UK government’s strategy unit, I was closely involved in setting strategy on climate change in the early 2000s, when the UK first committed to 60% reductions by 2050. Later that decade, ambition had risen to 80%, and now Britain is aiming for zero carbon. In retrospect, we greatly underestimated the importance of bottom-up innovation. We were comfortable talking about taxes and incentives, regulations and targets. But we had little sense of the tools that are now available to mobilise mass creativity – testbeds and labs, impact investment and crowdfunding, challenges and open innovation. These tools are now becoming more mainstream, alongside the more traditional support for science and technology. They include, for example, experiments to find out what works best in persuading people to insulate their lofts, to go vegetarian or switch from a car commute to cycling. They include new kinds of social organisation – from new neighbourhoods designed for low carbon (like London’s BEDZed) to action by whole communities to cut their emissions. President Obama and California’s new governor, Gavin Newsom, both set up social innovation offices, and countries as varied as Malaysia and Canada have had national strategies for social innovation. Carlos Moedas, the EU’s commission of research, commented late in 2018 that the EU would put more money into social innovation “not because it’s trendy, but because we believe that the future of innovation is about social innovation”. This shift to a broader understanding of innovation has big implications for the transition to a zero carbon economy. It means more support for places that are deliberately pioneering new ways of life – like Freiburg in Germany, which has gone further than anywhere in designing new lifestyles into its physical structures, for example by banning and restricting cars, and building renewable energy into the city’s fabric. It means more energetic experiment with new roles for communities – like the energy co-ops in Seoul that fund solar panels through cheap loans. It means backing the thousands of local food projects around the world that are weaning people off dependence on agri-business and meat, and cutting food waste (a third of food is now thrown away). And it means backing citizen action, like Ethiopia’s extraordinary achievement in planting hundreds of millions of trees in a single day earlier this year. The key message of social innovation is that the scale of change needed in the next few years simply can’t be achieved just by top-down government policy or by grassroots action. This will become ever more apparent as the world grapples with implementing the Paris agreements, and hopefully goes further than their modest targets. Social innovation has a central role to play in mobilising society as a partner in this work. For the next decade, this is where energy now needs to be directed. Change must be accelerated, not just in the organisation of our physical systems, but also in the way in which we live and relate to each other.

"The rainfall that has inundated the North of England is the latest in a long line of flood events that are becoming the country’s new normal. Indeed, across the world, flooding is expected to become more frequent and more extreme as the planet heats up. Building robust flood defences and modelling vulnerable areas is crucial if we are to avoid loss of life and livelihoods from these devastating weather events. But our new research reveals that the capacity of rivers to keep water flowing within their banks can change quickly – and in failing to acknowledge this, some flood models and defences may be under-equipped to deal with the consequences when they do. Many assume that flooding is due to heavy rainfall. This is true, but only part of the explanation. Floods also occur when the amount of water running off the land exceeds the capacity of rivers to carry that flow – as was the case when the River Don breached flood defences in the Sheffield area recently. So, floods are partly caused by the amount of rain falling, partly by the moisture that is already in the ground, and partly by the capacity of rivers to contain water within their channels. This means that if the capacities of river channels change, then two identical rainfall events falling on similarly wet ground can cause flooding of very different severity. Most rivers are forever changing. They are shaped by the sediments and water they carry. Humans have modified most of the world’s rivers in some way. In some cases this is through direct influence, such as dam construction or river engineering. Other influences are indirect – building on nearby land reduces the capacity of ground to absorb water, agriculture draws water from rivers, and deforestation leaves more water to flow elsewhere. Rivers respond to changes in climate as well. During drier periods, less water flows through river systems. This means that there is often less energy to move the sediments at their beds, so riverbed levels may progressively rise, decreasing the capacity of the river. Abundant plant growth within the channel can also reduce a river channel’s capacity by slowing the flow. But it is not always easy to predict how rivers will change. Extreme shifts in channel shape and capacity can occur very rapidly. After a recent flash flood in Spain, one river rose almost a metre as huge volumes of sediment from upstream were displaced and dumped further along. In tropical river systems, which tend to carry more sediment than temperate rivers, these changes can be several metres. Unfortunately, such changes are typically ignored by flood engineers and modellers, who generally treat the channel as a fixed feature. If rivers actually change their capacity in space and time, then estimates of flood probability may be incorrect, putting people and property at risk. Motivated by these concerns, we investigated the pace at which channel changes occur, and to what extent these alterations might be driven by climate. We began with a simple conceptual model: climate controls rainfall, rainfall affects river flow, and river flow shapes channel capacity.  Direct observations of this link were lacking in river systems over short timescales. So, we took 10,000 measurements of the capacity of 67 rivers in the US, covering a period of nearly 70 years. We also gathered rainfall and river flow data, to assess how climatic changes affected the capacity of the rivers. We discovered that temporary shifts in river capacity, lasting years to decades, were far more frequent than had previously been assumed. Overall, river capacity tends to increase during periods that are wetter than average due to greater erosion of river channels, and decrease in drier periods. We also found that multi-year climate cycles that affect regional precipitation patterns – such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation – can cause channel capacity to expand and contract too, perhaps on a global scale. Armed with this knowledge, we may eventually be able to predict how the capacity of rivers changes, and hence better understand flood risk. In temperate regions such as the UK, where rivers tend to be vegetated, heavily engineered and relatively stable, delicate changes in channel capacity are hard to detect and unlikely to be life threatening. However, in river systems that carry high volumes of sediment, or in parts of the world where rainfall varies considerably during the year, sudden reductions in river capacity may dramatically increase flood risk for nearby settlements. For example, the Ganges-Brahmaputra river in India and Bangladesh falls under this category. Its capacity is already changing, and its floodplains are some of most densely populated in the world. Unfortunately, we still have very poor understanding of the nature and causes of channel capacity changes in most regions – and it is the most at-risk places that tend to have the least data. To better understand what’s happening, we need to use satellite imagery to monitor how fast rivers are responding to changes in the climate. What we can’t yet do though is monitor river adjustment in real time. Developing technologies that do this would greatly improve our understanding of how changes in river shape and capacity affect flood risk across the world.  Until this information becomes apparent, flood models and defence structures should build this uncertain risk into their designs. Doing so could make all the difference for those living in vulnerable areas. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."
"TORONTO  —   François Deschamps stepped out of his apartment building in the Limoilou neighborhood of Quebec City recently and stopped when he saw a sticker wrapped around a light pole. “Burn Your Local Mosque,” it read, around a silhouette of a   mosque against an orange flame. He snapped a cellphone photo and added it to his collection of   propaganda popping up around the city. Canada is a remarkably open society, a legacy of liberal politicians who set the thinly populated country on the path of aggressive multiculturalism decades ago. Last week, Statistics Canada reported that by 2036, nearly half of all Canadians would be immigrants or the children of immigrants  —   most of them what the country calls “visible minorities,” which means nonwhite. That rapid transformation is stirring the most conservative elements of the white Canadian population, who see the country as their own, despite the fact that Europeans took the land from a patchwork of indigenous peoples who had long existed there. Few people believe that this stirring, which is moderate by United States standards, contributed directly the shooting Sunday inside Quebec City’s largest mosque, in which six worshipers were killed and eight injured. And no evidence yet has emerged that the accused assailant, a Québécois university student, had ties to specific groups. But the attack has put many on guard that Canada’s embrace of Muslim immigration is raising tensions. Even the most radical groups seem to sense that expressing extreme views can be dangerous. There are at least 100   extremist groups in Canada, according to two Canadian studies published last year, with most of them active in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia. While their targets include gays and lesbians, Jews and other minorities, Muslims have faced a sizable amount of the hostility. In 2014, the last year for which statistics are available, Canadian police forces recorded 99 religiously motivated hate crimes against Muslims  —   up from 45 in 2012, according to Statistics Canada. Some critics have blamed Donald J. Trump’s nationalistic language, but   extremism has long thrived in Canada among skinheads, white supremacists and others, said Barbara Perry, a global hate crime expert at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology in Oshawa, Ontario, and the lead author of a report published last year in the journal Studies in Conflict  Terrorism. “A lot of that sentiment has been there,” said Ms. Perry, who said the internet has helped spread the ideology. Canada has witnessed a flurry of nationalist groups proliferating in recent years, including the Soldiers of Odin, a white nationalist group that began in Finland. While the Canadian group has denied racist beliefs and members have participated in community foot patrols in cities like Edmonton and Vancouver, its main Canada Facebook page has   screeds and derogatory references to immigrants. The Canadian authorities have recorded thousands of   crimes in recent years, but Ms. Perry said Canadian law enforcement officials have played down the threat of   extremists, preferring instead to focus on Islamic terrorism. “That’s where all the money and attention goes,” she said. “Law enforcement officers in communities with a fairly well known   presence, they either denied they were there or that it was an issue. ” The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service declined to comment on actions they have taken to monitor and stop the spread of white nationalist groups, though the intelligence service has in the past minimized the movement’s influence, telling the Canadian news media that “  extremist circles appear to be fragmented and primarily pose a threat to public order and not to national security. ”   activists and others opposed to such views say the government has not done enough to protect vulnerable groups. In 2013, Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s government repealed hate speech provisions in the Canadian Human Rights Act, which supporters said hindered free speech. A federal court ruled that the provisions did not violate freedom of expression, but they have not been reinstated. Daniel Gallant, a former white supremacist from Vancouver who changed his views 15 years ago and is now a social worker and a law student, said widespread Canadian denial about the prevalence of   extremism was a major problem. “It’s everywhere,” he said. A 2016 telephone survey by the Canadian polling firm Forum Research found that in a random sampling of 1, 304 Canadians, Muslims were the focus of the most animosity in Quebec, where 48 percent of respondents expressed dislike of the religion. “It is clear from these findings that respondents in Quebec are the most likely to hold unfavorable feelings towards Jewish and Muslim people,” said the firm’s president, Lorne Bozinoff. Nowhere have those elements been as vocal as Quebec City. Handbills, posters and occasional demonstrations by such groups as the Fédération des Québécois de Souche (which translates roughly as “people of original Québécois stock”) have proliferated in the city. Québécois de Souche’s slogan is “I exist, so I act,” but as with fringe movements everywhere, it and other groups are most active behind the anonymity of the internet. “It’s very hard to know their numbers,” said Stéphane   a sociology professor at Laval University who studies Quebec’s far right, adding that there is a small core to each group and that the followers are less active. He said the movement has fragmented and   and groups have changed names for the past 20 years, although the recent surge in immigration has strengthened their cause. “It’s not a new thing,” he said. La Meute, a group that includes many Afghanistan war veterans, has gathered about 43, 000 followers since it started a closed Facebook page last year. The name means “wolf pack” in French, and its members are not politically virulent by United States standards but focus on concerns about Muslim immigration. At the other end of the scale are followers of Légitime Violence, a proudly fascist heavy metal band that announces its concerts to a vetted list of fans and performs songs like “Final Solution,” which is as subtle as it sounds. Other extremist groups in Quebec include Atalante Québec Pegida Québec, which is an offshoot of a German group and Soldiers of Odin. Calling these groups “far right” may be a misnomer. The Fédération des Québécois de Souche says its members include people with different political beliefs, including socialists and libertarians. The common denominator is an opposition to immigration, particularly by Muslims. “Our objective is not to shrink to a minority,” said Rémi Tremblay, spokesman for the Fédération des Québécois de Souche. He says groups like his have helped to start a debate about immigration and multiculturalism that was “unthinkable” when the group formed 10 years ago. “We want to free the tongues of the people so they start thinking about this without the constraints of political correctness,” he said. That conversation among largely anonymous   extremists exists in the broader context of a   talk radio culture in Quebec that has been critical of Muslim immigration and what it sees as a failure by Muslims to assimilate into Canadian culture. Talk radio of this stripe is rare elsewhere in Canada and is reminiscent, albeit far more mild, of the raucous   shows in the United States. The radio stations Radio X and FM93 are among those cited as giving voice to   activists. While their own commentary may be muted, they give a platform to   voices from sites like Point de Bascule, which means Tipping Point, and Poste de Veille, which translates roughly as “Watchtower” and whose website shows a pirate ship with a jihadist flag as its sail approaching Quebec City. One popular conspiracy theory links Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the Muslim Brotherhood, a   group that supports the application of Islamic law in Muslim communities. Even Quebec City’s mayor, Régis Labeaume, who was visibly moved at a news conference on Monday while showing support for the Muslim community, has expressed frustration with some orthodox Muslim customs. In 2014, during interviews about the appearance of the “burkini” at community pools, he recalled one extremely hot summer day seeing a man dressed in shorts and sandals while his wife was wearing a full niqab  —      covering including black gloves. Mayor Labeaume said his own wife had to hold him back from insulting the man and “ripping his head off. ” Many people have called for toning down the talk in the wake of Sunday’s mosque shooting in a suburb of Quebec City by a professed immigration opponent. “The tone should definitely be more respectful on all sides,” said Dominic Maurais, who hosts a show on Radio X and is a leading voice of Quebec’s conservative talk shows.

"For more than 400 employees recently laid off by Wells Fargo, the aftermath of the bank’s scandal over sham accounts has had an unexpected consequence: The bank is prohibited from paying the severance it owes them. In   Wells Fargo’s federal regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, imposed additional restrictions on the troubled bank. The rules, part of which are intended to curb golden parachute packages, limit what payments Wells Fargo is permitted to make to terminated employees without explicit regulatory approval. Routine severance pay is sometimes exempted from such restrictions, but the federal rules for golden parachute pay are complex, and Wells Fargo’s severance plan is not eligible for the exemption, according to Diana Rodriguez, a bank spokeswoman. Former employees at all levels of the company, from    branch workers to corporate executives, are affected by the hold. Wells Fargo’s severance packages typically run from six weeks of pay to as long as 16 months, depending on the employee’s length of service. The people affected are those whose jobs have been cut as part of Wells Fargo’s regular business adjustments. They are not accused of wrongdoing. Workers who are fired for cause, such as those involved in the scandal, are not eligible for severance. In recent years, the bank has terminated 5, 300 employees in connection with its misconduct. The bank has asked the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for approval to make severance payments but has not yet received it, Ms. Rodriguez said. The payments add up to several million dollars. Wells Fargo has temporarily stopped all layoffs until it can resolve the issue. The freeze began on Nov. 21, three days after the bank was notified of the additional restrictions. But about 400 workers who were terminated right before the additional restrictions were imposed are caught in limbo. Wells Fargo has told them that their severance payments are indefinitely delayed. “We are deeply sorry for the hardship this creates for affected team members, and we are doing everything in our power to resolve the situation as quickly as possible,” Ms. Rodriguez said. Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the O. C. C. declined to elaborate beyond the highly technical   statement the agency released in November describing the additional restrictions being placed on Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo has been in turmoil since September, when it admitted that thousands of its employees, under pressure to meet aggressive sales goals, had created as many as two million fraudulent accounts in the names of real customers. Some customers did not learn of the sham accounts until they began incurring fees on them. The O. C. C.  —   which participated in a $185 million settlement deal with Wells Fargo that resolved several government lawsuits  —   initially let the bank off fairly lightly, exempting it from some of the restrictions normally imposed on banks that break the law. Two months later, it reversed course and tightened its grip. What kind of oversight banks will face in the future is an open question. President Trump said this week that he intended to “dramatically reduce federal regulations” and do “a big number” on the   Act, the   law that increased Wall Street restrictions. Republicans have already begun floating proposals to strip funding and powers from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the regulatory agency that, with the O. C. C. investigated Wells Fargo and drew national attention to its illegal acts. Investigators, including some hired by Wells Fargo, are still figuring out the full extent of the bank’s misdeeds. In a meeting this month with Wells Fargo employees, Timothy J. Sloan  —   who took over in October, after the bank’s longtime leader, John G. Stumpf, was felled by the scandal  —   acknowledged what a number of employees had previously said: that the bank may have retaliated against some workers who had tried to blow the whistle internally on its actions. Wells Fargo hired an outside investigator to review all calls made in the last five years to the bank’s ethics hotline in which the employee gave a name. About 40 percent of those who called identified themselves, the bank said. In reviewing the records of employees who were fired within 12 months of making a call, the bank’s investigator found a few cases that “raised questions,” Mr. Sloan said. “Even though it’s a very small number, anything more than zero is too large. ” The bank is still researching those cases. Wells Fargo will “work with each individual” on potential remedies, Richele J. Messick, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said. “We are continuing to investigate, and whatever we find, we will make right,” Ms. Messick said. Separately, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked the Department of Labor to provide an update this week on the status of its investigation of Wells Fargo. In September, Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary at the time, promised a “   review” of complaints filed against Wells Fargo. But a Labor Department web page on which Wells Fargo employees could report violations has abruptly disappeared, Ms. Warren noted in a letter sent on Friday. “Taking down this website enables Wells Fargo to escape full responsibility for its fraudulent actions and the department to shirk its outstanding obligations to American workers,” Ms. Warren wrote. That page was taken down in early January, nearly two weeks before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, according to Stephen Barr, a Labor Department spokesman. He declined to comment on why the page had been removed. “The investigation is ongoing,” Mr. Barr said. “We’re going to respond to the senator, but there’s no change here in the status of the review. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA reader recently left a comment saying he had been having difficulty getting a copy of “The Neglected Sun“, the best-selling non-alarmist climate science book showing how man-made climate change is nowhere near as serious as the IPCC wants us to believe it is.
Order here now.
Good news! The Die kalte Sonne site here reports that The Neglected Sun, the English version, which sold out a few months ago, will once again be printed and available from the Chicago-based powerhouse think-tank The Heartland Institute, who have purchased the rights to the book.
It is now available at Amazon here, or at the Heartland Institute online shop for US$ 19.99. The Kindle version is available at Amazon for US$ 11.11. Shipping begins July 1, 2015.
The book was also translated in Polish and has been available since October 2014.
IPCC’s “grossly incorrect radiative forcing values”
According to authors Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, the book is up-to-date, cites hundreds of peer-reviewed literature and explains in easy terms why the CO2 climate sensitivity has been totally overblown and how the sun and oceans are the primary climate drivers.
They commented in an e-mail:

Detailed comparison with the palaeoclimatological development demonstrates that the climate change observed over the past 100 years is nothing new, neither qualitatively nor quantitatively. Natural climate variability is much more important than previously thought and solar activity changes and ocean cycles are some of the key drivers. It turns out that the IPCC has made major mistakes in the attribution of the 20th century warming which leads to grossly incorrect radiative forcing values in the IPCC reports.”
The two authors also point to the latest UK Met Office report which shows we may be heading into a new cold phase due to low solar activity.
NASA data are “suspicious”
The two prominent German skeptics are also distrustful of NASA GISS temperature data, claiming the temperature “corrections” are “suspicious” because “they always result in amplification of the warming trend, never the opposite. Artificial cooling of the past and artificial warming of the present-day.”
What to expect from Paris
On what we can expect from Paris later this year, the two co-authors write that there will be some sort of treaty “but likely without a lot of substance and with lots of vagueness and loopholes.”

Who knew the reason for drought could be so simple? Forget complex modeling, Palmer indices, and rainfall projections, the reason for drought (at least in Australia) is dirt simple. Time is of the essence!

"Ben Weatherill’s audio play is set in the year 2025 when a flood has left Britain in a state of emergency. There is social inequality, government inaction and political protest. A few months ago, this might have been considered a straight-up dystopia. Now it feels far closer to home. The play is part of Shifting Tides, the Almeida’s digital festival exploring the intersections between art and the climate crisis, performed by and for young people. Conceived last autumn, it was due to be performed on stage. “It’s mad how quickly the world can change, right?” says one character who might be speaking of the panic and confusion at the start of lockdown.  Directed by Alex Brown, actors aged between 14 and 18 from the Almeida Young Company recorded their parts in isolation. The play is in three parts, connected more by theme than characters. Each episode begins with a babble of voices, from newscasters reporting growing homelessness to protesters who speak of political irresponsibility: “People knew this would happen. They just didn’t care.” The voices create a soundboard of social unrest alongside growing state control and contested civic freedoms. The three parts seem to be asking the central question of how young people might mobilise for political activism and change in the midst of this. The first episode finds an answer in an anarchic redistribution of wealth and Robin Hood criminality. The flood lays social division bare among a group of friends: Zack (Muhammad Abdraheman) finds his family destitute while Alyssa (Vigs Otite) remains fortified by privilege – and flood defences around her home. The group hatches a plan to steal from the rich to give to the poor and action comes with heist-movie humour as well as teen-drama dynamics. The second part is by far the sparkiest, taking the government’s controversial anti-terrorist Prevent programme and giving it a satirical twist. The characters being “de-radicalised” here are climate activists who have erred under Draconian new laws: Hannah (Olivia Ferrari) has simply worn a T-shirt with the slogan “Destroy the Government” while Lou (Angel Studman) and Georgie (Angelica Gayle) have rescued paintings from Whitechapel Gallery that might have perished in the flood. The group convenes as a “counselling circle” and it is a clever format that explores how best to make a political stand but also includes interpersonal stories. It is full of subtle arguments about how a generation “demands a future” for themselves and it has a passing reference to Covid-19 too: “This generation has learned that NHS nurses can’t feed families on claps,” says a character. The last episode is set around a hiking trip and focuses on group action, combining plotlines from the first two episodes, albeit somewhat tenuously. It is enlightening to hear young voices speak about the climate crisis, activism and how to clean up the planetary mess that the older generation has left so that they are not denied a future. The stories are engrossing, though the three parts lack a strong enough climax to their plots. Still, the dialogue makes up for it, capturing the personal and political drama of being a teenager and combining this deftly with its big themes. • As Waters Rise is available online."

This is a letter from John Rofe, a self-declared “Concerned Citizen” to Professor Gerrard, the NZ Prime Minister’s Science Advisor.   
  
As it is quite long we have ‘serialised’ it over a few days. 



This year even suppliers of seed will be unable to meet their contracts, which means serious carry-over problems into 2020 for cropping farmers. Herds are being culled and yet beef prices are higher during the time of a massive cull, due to the desperate Chinese buying….



In 2008 the earth was entering the regular 11-year solar minimum between solar cycles numbered sc23 and sc24, which also caused cold climate crop losses. The eleven-year cycles almost always deliver problems at the two years of minimum solar activity, but what is now happening is extraordinary. The data supporting NASA and NOAA’s change of heart can easily be found on their own web sites, or if you take the time to look at the main public web site that watches the causative climate factors arriving via the longer-range solar cycles… [www.spaceweather.com](http://www.spaceweather.com/) . (For this site to be of much use you will need to monitor it for a year or two to see how the data is trending.) 



2019 is at the same point of the following 11-year solar minimum as in 2008, just that it will likely be a deeper minimum than that of 2008 ( **again, as already forecast by NOAA and NASA** ). We are in a descent into what is already being called by some, the “Eddy Minimum” (after the name of the eminent astronomer John Eddy). We are today plumb between numbered cycles sc24 and sc25 and descending into a sort of hell as sc26 is expected to be the worst solar cycle of the unfolding series (or so the experts expect – while some others expect much longer and deeper cooling). 



The fact that the [Orwellian news media doesn’t tell us what is happening ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/stuff-disgracefully-implies-that-disagreement-equals-mental-illness/)is neither here nor there. We fraud investigators know where to look and how to discriminate between the pattern and the noise of chaos. Between informal news stories from the public and the official lies supported by supposedly “orthodox crooks” (conspiring to launder an image they both profit from and favour), the actual stats don’t lie, even if they are promptly hidden. 



Empirically, a Grand Solar Minimum is past due from analysis of the timing of past cycles and arriving NOW…(you can follow this by regularly watching the stats unfold on [spaceweather.com](http://spaceweather.com/)) 



And right now we are approaching the biggest lows of sun spot numbers and the biggest highs of cosmic ray influx in 100 years. The biggest lows of Total Solar Irradiance don’t matter too much because the variation isn’t huge, even if it is orders of magnitude more significant than the “bought and paid for” UN IPCC computer models allow. The changed magnetosphere and cosmic ray influx is, however, a big deal. We Kiwis are OK because we are on the Pacific ring of fire. Sub-oceanic volcanoes seem to be obligingly doing what the land-based volcanoes are also doing and popping their corks. With four times as many sub-sea volcanoes as land-based, this could perhaps account for why the Pacific is anomalously warming, even though the bulk of warming inevitably comes from the sun’s rays. It ain’t just the sun that heats it – and certainly not at depths below the thermo cline where the solar rays don’t have a direct warming effect. So we Kiwis may not experience the cold of a Grand Solar Minimum until the tectonic plates settle down a bit. If you think I am wrong, then perhaps you would like to offer a credible alternative to what else was happening down below when huge rafts of pumice appeared on the surface of the ocean this year? 



If I was sitting in your academic castle I would be reading what folk like Dr Habibullo Abdussamatov and Dr Valentina Zharkova have to say about the troubles to come. Because that is more likely where the causation for significant climate change lies than the feeble efforts of mankind to burn the earth’s endowment of fossil fuels. Will it be a three times eleven-year solar cycle minimum, like the Dalton Minimum, or will it be a six times eleven-year cycle like the Maunder Minimum? Obviously no-one really knows for sure. Both were extremely cold and then there were far fewer humans to feed. But this brute is on its way and web sites like “Adapt2030” have been monitoring it for a few years…following on from the Russians.

Today is International Workers’ Day, a holiday with socialist origins. Its name hearkens back to a time when the political Left was ostensibly devoted to the cause of human welfare. These days, however, some on the far Left care less about the wellbeing of people than they do about making sure that people are never born at all. How did these radicals come to support a massive reduction in human population, if not humanity’s demise? Whether it’s Alexandria Ocasio‐​Cortez questioning the morality of childbearing, a birth‐​strike movement that encourages people to forego parenthood despite the “grief that [they say they] feel as a result,” or political commentator Bill Maher blithely claiming, “I can’t think of a better gift to our planet than pumping out fewer humans to destroy it,” a misanthropic philosophy known as “anti‐​natalism” is going increasingly mainstream.



The logical conclusion of this anti‐​humanist ideology is, depressingly, the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (Vhemt). According to its founder, activist Les Knight, Vhemt (pronounced “vehement”) is gaining steam. “In the last year,” Knight told the _Daily Mail_, “I’ve seen more and more articles about people choosing to remain child‐​free or to not add more to their existing family than ever. I’ve been collecting these stories and last year was just a groundswell of articles, and, in addition, there have been articles about human extinction.”





These days, some on the far Left care less about the wellbeing of people than they do about making sure that people are never born at all.



Over 2000 new people have “liked” the movement’s Facebook page since January and, more importantly, the number of people fulfilling the movement’s goals (regardless of any affiliation with the movement itself) is growing. The U.S. birth rate is at an all‐​time low. According to the latest figures from the Center for Disease Control, the total U.S. fertility rate for 2017 was at an all‐​time low of 1.77 babies per woman (i.e., below the replacement rate of 2.1 babies per woman needed to maintain the current population).



Recent examples of writings that are warming to the idea of human extinction include the _New Yorker_ ’s “The Case for Not Being Born,” NBC News’ “Science proves kids are bad for Earth. Morality suggests we stop having them,” and the _New York Times_ ’ “Would Human Extinction Be a Tragedy?” which muses that, “It may well be, then, that the extinction of humanity would make the world better off.” Last month, the progressive magazine _FastCompany_ released a disturbing video entitled, “Why Having Kids Is the Worst Thing You Can Do for the Planet.”



Some anti‐​natalists are not content with promoting the voluntary reduction of birth rates, and would prefer to hurry the process along with government intervention. Various prominent environmentalists, from Johns Hopkins University bioethicist Travis Rieder to science popularizer and entertainer Bill Nye, support the introduction of special taxes or other state‐​imposed penalties for having “too many” children. In 2015, Bowdoin College’s Sarah Conly published a bookadvocating a “one‐​child” policy, like the one China abandoned following disastrous consequences including female infanticide and a destabilizing gender ratio of 120 boys per 100 girls, which left around 17 percent of China’s young men unable to find a Chinese wife. Even after that barbaric policy’s collapse, she maintains it was “a good thing.”



Modern‐​day anti‐​humanism emerged in the 1970s, midwifed by a doomy strain of environmental pessimism led by Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich (but with intellectual antecedents dating back to Thomas Malthus in the eighteenth century). Ehrlich published his widely read polemic _The Population Bomb_ in 1968, which originally opened with the lines, “The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.”



Thanks to human ingenuity in the form of the Green Revolution, that didn’t happen. The challenge of feeding a growing population led instead to technological innovation and that produced a solution: higher agricultural productivity and falling food prices. Far from leading to starvation, more humans exchanging ideas and innovating have ensured that the supply of food rose to meet growing demand. Ehrlich quietly removed his failed prognostication from subsequent editions of his book, but his ideas caught on among some strands of the environmentalist movement.



Undeterred, Ehrlich and many likeminded doomsayers are still claiming that disaster is imminent, despite their previous predictions repeatedly failing to materialize. Just last year, Ehrlich compared human population growth to the spread of cancer, informing the _Guardian_, “It is a near certainty in the next few decades, and the risk is increasing continually as long as perpetual growth of the human enterprise remains the goal of economic and political systems … As I’ve said many times, ‘perpetual growth is the creed of the cancer cell.’”



Once anti‐​humanism had infected the environmental movement, it soon spread through the political Left. Robert Zubrin’s book _Merchants of Despair_ gives an overview of the Left’s reversal of its traditional commitment to advancing the human condition, in favor of a project that viewed humanity as a plague upon the Earth:



Instead of The Grapes of Wrath, they carried copies of The Population Bomb … Instead of “Stop the War,” their buttons read “Stop at two” [children]; instead of “Power to the people,” their slogan was “People pollute.”



These environmentally‐​concerned anti‐​natalists believe that a world without humans, or with significantly fewer of them, would eventually revert to a pollution‐​free paradise with abundant natural resources. As one human extinction proponent put it just last month in a letter to his local paper, “In approximately 20,000 years after human extinction, this magnificent resistant biosphere will return to its perfection.” If humanity fails to reduce its numbers, extinction proponents fear resource shortages and environmental catastrophe. “How could anybody,” an official Vhemt member, Gwynn Mackellen, wondered aloud to the _Guardian_, “produce a new human when the effects of humans are very obvious, I feel, and the situation is getting worse.”



These extinction advocates, however, have misunderstood the evidence about population growth’s impact on the planet and its resources. The late University of Maryland economist Julian Simon rejected the idea of overpopulation as a problem. He believed that, on the contrary, more people in the world means more people to solve problems, and less resource scarcity. “There is no physical or economic reason,” he wrote, “why human resourcefulness and enterprise cannot forever continue to respond to impending shortages and existing problems with new expedients that, after an adjustment period, leave us better off than before the problem arose.”



In his 1981 book _The Ultimate Resource_, Simon argued that humans are intelligent beings, capable of innovating their way out of shortages through greater efficiency, increased supply, or development of substitutes. Humans, with their inventive potential, are themselves, in Simon’s phrase, “The Ultimate Resource.” A growing population produces more ideas. More ideas lead to more innovations and more innovations can improve productivity. That higher productivity then translates into more resources to go around and better standards of living.



In 1980, Simon made a bet with Ehrlich. Ehrlich would choose a “basket” of raw materials that he expected to become more scarce in the coming years. At the end of a specified time period, if the inflation‐​adjusted price of the basket was higher than at the beginning of the period, that would indicate the materials had indeed become scarcer and Ehrlich would win the wager; if the price was lower, that would mean the resources had instead become more abundant, and Simon would win. The stakes would be the ultimate price difference of the basket at the beginning and end of the time period. Simon ultimately won, and Ehrlich duly sent him a check for the price difference.



New research, inspired by the Ehrlich‐​Simon wager, has further confirmed that, contrary to the anti‐​humanists’ claims, population growth goes hand‐​in‐​hand with more abundant resources. Consider the amount of time it takes an average worker to earn enough to buy a basket of common commodities—the “time‐​price” of those items. The Simon Abundance Index found that between 1980 and 2017, “the time‐​price of our basket of 50 basic commodities declined by 0.934 percent for every one percent increase in population. That means that every additional human being born on our planet seems to be making resources proportionately more plentiful for the rest of us.”



There are some notable environmentalists who recognize the fact that humans are capable of creating abundance instead of scarcity. Environmentalists who take the rational and techno‐​optimistic view, sometimes called “enlightenment environmentalists” or “ecomodernists,” still believe in humanity’s ability to tackle environmental problems with innovation and ingenuity. Examples include Harvard University’s Steven Pinker and the Breakthrough Institute’s Michael Shellenberger, who both hold that technologies such as nuclear power can reduce emissions. And the research of Rockefeller University environmental science professor Jesse H. Ausubel, who was integral to setting up the world’s first climate change conference in Geneva in 1979, has shown how technological progress can allow nature to rebound, even while food and other resources have become more plentiful.



Unfortunately, ecomodernists are still a minority within the environmental movement. Too many people, mostly on the political Left, still agree with Ehrlich that humans are analogous to cancer cells and long for the reduction or even extinction of our species. One third of Americans in the millennial generation say they are deeply concerned about the environmental impact of having children. Not that long ago, well within the living memory of a millennial such as myself, a 2002 episode of Aaron Sorkin’s popular political drama _The West Wing_ could still quip that “Death is bad” remained a left‐​wing position. The scriptwriter took it for granted that, on the political Left, everyone is in favor of human flourishing. If only that were still the case.

"**No, there is no link between the coronavirus and 5G - nor is there any truth in the claim that Bill Gates is involved in a devilish plot to put a chip in everyone.**
A tidal wave of conspiracy theories and misinformation is swamping social media and on Tech Tent this week we look at the impact of what has been called an infodemic, and what can be done about it.
YouTube has long been seen as a place where people get drawn into conspiracy theories - watch one flat earth video and you end up gorging on dozens.
In fact, YouTube's engineers have made strenuous efforts recently to break this chain of addiction, tweaking its algorithms so they don't recommend ever more extreme videos.
But, according to researchers from the Oxford Internet Institute, that work may have been in vain, because the videos end up getting shared on other social media platforms.
""We found around 8,000 videos that YouTube had removed because they believe that they contained false information such as unscientific claims about coronavirus treatments,"" Aleksi Knuutila from the Institute tells the programme.
""We also found that these videos had gathered a fairly large audience - they have been shared around 20 million times on social media. We found evidence that it was specifically Facebook that was responsible for the distribution of these videos.""
Facebook does have processes for checking misinformation, and labelling it as such, but Aleksi Knuutila says they don't appear to be working very well - just 1% of the YouTube videos had warning labels on them.
When we asked Facebook to respond to the Oxford study, the social media firm gave us this statement: ""Facebook does not allow harmful misinformation on our platforms and we have removed seven million pieces of Covid-19 related misinformation between April and June.
""During the same period, we put warning labels on about 98 million pieces of COVID-19-related misinformation globally, which prevented people viewing the original content 95% of the time.""
What is the evidence that conspiracy theories and misinformation are changing what people think?
Well, it seems that the huge volume of false claims about the threat to human health from 5G mobile networks is having an impact. Paul Lee from Deloitte tells us about a survey the consultancy has done about public attitudes to 5G across Europe.
This shows that the UK has fewer concerns about 5G and health than many countries - just 14% said they were worried, compared to around a third of Austrians. But interestingly, the figure was 18% for 25-to-34 year olds - people who are presumably both tech-savvy, and likely to spend a lot of time on social media.
New technology always causes anxiety, but Paul Lee says this is on a different level: ""With 5G, there are degrees of discomfort that I've never seen before. And I think partly what's happened is there is far more ability to share misinformation.""
A huge test of their ability to tackle misinformation is looming for social media platforms - and in particular Facebook - in the form of the US election. And now we know that Facebook's long-awaited supreme court, its Oversight Board, will be up and running in October - just in time.
But the co-chair of the board, the former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, tells us not to expect instant results.
She says quality, rather than speed, will guide the body's decision-making: ""We are not here to have snap opinions about things. We are here to take principled decisions that Facebook has to follow.""
And she stresses that if the rulings of this supreme court are ignored, its members won't stick around.
""If Facebook doesn't follow our decisions, it won't last very long because we have signed on to this task only because of the transparency and independence and the obligation from Facebook - including of course Mark Zuckerberg - to follow our decisions. So that is the red line for us,"" she says.
And even before the Oversight Board gets started, there are questions over its legitimacy.
A group which includes academics, civil rights campaigners and a former Facebook investor have launched a rival board to scrutinise the company's role in the election, warning that it poses an urgent threat to democracy."

This is a letter from John Rofe, a self-declared “Concerned Citizen” to Professor Gerrard, the NZ Prime Minister’s Science Advisor.   
  
As it is quite long we have ‘serialised’ it over a few days. 





You needn’t concern yourself about the legal bun fight to come, because the PM and her Minister of Climate Change will have to counter-punch on that during election year if it transpires that I feel obliged to litigate, and am permitted to do so. In the courts, there are only three points for me to make and reinforce with the aid of empirical data and expert evidence… 



Fraud investigators do get to have a sense of humour and the most amusing part of the Great Global Warming Fraud for me is **the amazing similarities between King Canute and James Shaw.** As a child I never believed that someone could be as stupid as King Canute was reputed to be, in trying to turn back the tide. Minister James Shaw, by refusing to check the fake science supporting the Anthropogenic Global Warming theory, has proven that anything is possible if your ego is big enough and you are misled into believing you can control reality. My repeated warnings simply did not register with him. 



Now we will either get bloody cold and bloody hungry, or we will hopefully get to fight this fraud out in court. I hate courtrooms but it is the option I prefer because there will otherwise be extreme levels of famine stalking the world as we go forward. 



Earth’s atmosphere has yet to start significant cooling, but I am a patient man. The indicative evidence is in already. The jet streams are already out of flow, the anomalous weather typified during the Maunder and Dalton Minimums is appearing with the shorter growing seasons and worst of all, with the cold climate crop losses. 



And to put this stuff together in the words of someone who thinks it is all a grotesque anti-humanist conspiracy, it is simply stated as follows:



I don’t buy into the conspiracy stuff, but there is a point. The Limits to Growth teams were focused on delivery of global solutions to resource depletion, over-population etc. Hence there has been a stampede to implement climate change as if it were the “final solution” for the earth’s limitations versus human greed. The only result will be a huge waste of public money. This video presenter did what all the warming alarmists do, they cherry-pick the time scale for presenting the data. I don’t approve when a sceptic does it, any more than when a warming alarmist does it because it doesn’t inform the debate or clarify fact from fiction. It made my task much more difficult. But it is my job to work out which is which, just as it is the job of the impartial scientist or peer-reviewer. Given that the impact of the 2016 el Nino event is excluded from one temperature graph the picture presented is skewed to the presenter’s favour. He probably thinks, “So what the climate has since cooled”. Yet it isn’t the entire picture. But worse is available from almost every graph I have seen from the UN IPCC supporters. Public agencies and their deliberate fraud to curry favour with political masters is seemingly common (often in the guise of confirmation bias). Being now taken to extremes, the Great Anthropogenic Global Warming Fraud will destroy our civilisation if not reined in.

Nixon, talked crime as if he were recapping a ’70s cop drama. He repeatedly  —   and falsely  —   claimed that United States murder rates were the highest in 45 years. Cities, to him, were lawless hellscapes: “You walk down the street, you get shot. ” That’s essentially the outlook of two new police shows  —   “Training Day” and Fox’s “A. P. B. ”  —   each of which depicts American cities as   zones that need a tough,   boor to break rules, crack skulls and restore order. In the 2001 film “Training Day,” Denzel Washington played a corrupt narcotics detective with a knack for busting drug gangs and a weakness for skimming the take. CBS’s “Training Day,” beginning on Thursday and set in the present, has a tenuous connection to the original. Antoine Fuqua, the film’s director, is among the producers (who also include Jerry Bruckheimer, of “C. S. I. ”). But it perverts the dynamic of the film by making its central cop into a charming, roguish maverick. Here, Frank is partnered with Kyle Craig (Justin Cornwell) an idealistic “trainee” who is actually working undercover to investigate whether Frank has been crossing ethical lines. He has, and he’s damn proud of it. On their first outing, Frank lays out his philosophy: “Police work’s like sex, Kyle. It’s a lot more effective if it isn’t pretty. ” (I would not recommend this as a pickup line.) They cruise the squalid streets as Frank cites some statistics of Trumpian dubiousness: Crime is “up 300 percent,” which does not seem to square with recent Los Angeles police data. “It’s like ‘The Purge’ every night,” he says. Ugly times call for ugly tactics, he feels. If a few lies get told, a few suspects get tortured, a few confiscated dollars go missing  —   hey, freedom ain’t free. “Training Day” starts off building tension between idealism and security, but it ends up in the tank for Frank. Mr. Cornwell plays Kyle as an upstanding stiff, and the authorities investigating Frank are vindictive bureaucrats. Mr. Paxton gets to deliver the best lines and blow the most stuff up. Wry and swaggering, he’s the only one having any fun here, which pushes the audience to Frank’s side. In this formulaic “cop who won’t play by the book” setup, the book doesn’t stand a chance. Kyle decides to work with Frank rather than turn him in, and “Training Day” loses its nerve in the process, turning Frank into a raffish renegade who just says what everybody’s thinking. (His name is “Frank,” after all.) This “Training Day” is a   version of the movie, which paired Mr. Washington with Ethan Hawke as the   rookie. The racial dynamic is glaring as nostalgic white guy Frank fights to Make L. A. Great Again against largely minority criminals. An episode that pits him against Japanese mobsters is almost parodic. “How is a yakuza like a cue ball?” he says, while beating information out of one. “The harder you hit ’em, the better their English gets!” He ends up using an aluminum baseball bat to duel with a    mob boss, a Yankee Doodle metaphor that’s as subtle as an aluminum baseball bat. If “Training Day” comes from the “Dirty Harry” school of pop authoritarianism, Fox’s “A. P. B. ,” beginning on Monday, is a Silicon Valley “Batman. ” Its origin story: on a business trip to Chicago, the billionaire engineer Gideon Reeves (Justin Kirk) watches his best friend die in an armed robbery. Outraged by the sluggish 911 response, he bullies the city government into giving him control of an overwhelmed police precinct. He promptly equips officers with drones,   tasers and a smartphone app for instantaneous police response. RoboCop, meet UberCop. Chicago has become a flash point, to the right for its murder rate (Mr. Trump recently threatened to “send in the Feds! ”) and to the left for police brutality. But in “A. P. B. ,” all the city needs is  —   sound familiar?  —   a cocky, rude,    billionaire to disrupt the establishment. “A. P. B. ,” inspired by a New York Times Magazine article about a   police force in New Orleans, stumbled into its relevance. At heart, it doesn’t aim to be more than a disposable,    action show. Mr. Kirk is disarmingly snide as the arrogant Gideon. There’s a little melodrama and a lot of   and the crime stories are as mechanical as Gideon’s gadgets. The closest the show gets to big ideas about policing come when the     detective Theresa Murphy (Natalie Martinez) reminds her new boss that computers can’t replace the human element. Like “Training Day,” “A. P. B. ” was in the works well before Election Day (though not before Black Lives Matter and the reaction to it). The shows’ content is mainly driven by the eternal needs of broadcast drama: heroes (or, increasingly, antiheroes) villains and   stakes. You can’t make much of a crime procedural out of people not committing crimes. Occasionally, a serial like HBO’s “The Wire” or FX’s “The Shield” will question the tactics and premises of an objective like the war on drugs. In March, Fox will air “Shots Fired,” a provocative series about the complicated aftermath of a racially charged shooting in North Carolina. Most network police series don’t have that kind of ambition. But intentionally or not, “Training Day” and “A. P. B. ” have a message, anyway: that it’s a sick, sad world, and if you want to live, you’d best give a free hand to the kind of abrasive jerks you see on TV. They alone can fix it."
"Extinction Rebellion is making people angry. After weeks of disrupting drivers in central London, protesters from the climate change activist group have enraged commuters by stopping Underground trains. Critics have come out in force. Stopping hard-working people from getting home by shutting down one of the lowest carbon forms of transport available will only lose you support, runs the argument. Which completely misses the point.  Those who criticise protesters for causing “disruption” are likely to be the same people who, a few years from now when serious climatic disruption is unsettling their daily lives, will complain that “nobody did anything”. Certainly protestors need to disrupt carefully (tube trains are surely not a good target), but without disruption of some kind, how else will urgently needed system change happen? I’m reminded of the words of abolitionist Frederick Douglass: If there is no struggle there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground; they want rain without thunder and lightning. Extinction Rebellion should be used to criticism by now. They have also been told they are too middle class. That their targets are unrealistic. That they are misuing science to exaggerate the catastrophic nature of climate change. And that they are too reliant on fear to try to motivate people. Some of this criticism deserves consideration and some a defence. But there is another, overlooked problem that I think is a more serious threat to the movement’s goals. The movement’s co-founder, Roger Hallam, is among those who has been criticised for saying climate change will kill billions and threatens the very existence of the human race, positions that scientists have said are not supported by the evidence. The question for activists is whether the science is not already alarming enough to win support for sufficiently radical climate action. First, it’s not clear how many people supporting Extinction Rebellion, or whose attention has been grabbed by the movement, actually share these fears of an existential crisis. As Alex Randall of the charitable Climate and Migration Coalition notes: I don’t think that it’s Hallam’s inaccurate doom mongering that has brought people out onto the streets for XR. Rather, XR provided an organisation and a platform for people who were already worried enough to take to the streets. Hallam’s apocalyptic ramblings are not the driving force force behind their civil disobedience. Meanwhile, “the science” – endlessly attacked and muddied –  is not clear on the exact level of risk we face, and doesn’t say anything about how we should respond to it. Perhaps the most often quoted source of evidence on climate change is the output of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It was designed as an inherently conservative organisation because the US didn’t want to be forced into international action by scientists, as it felt it had been over the issue of the ozone layer. As a result, the IPCC may well be underestimating the risks of climate change by erring on the side of least drama. In fact, some scientists at the coalface of climate study are super scared of what’s going to happen. There’s also anecdotal evidence that some scientists are self-censoring, particularly with regards to how much warming the Earth is likely to experience. This may be because they are worried being bad news messengers may not be good for their careers, or a belief that only hope in preserving our current climate will encourage people to act. This chimes with the criticism of Extinction Rebellion that inspiring fear will only demotivate people from acting, paralysing them by spreading the view that the situation is so hopeless that nothing can be done. This may or may not be the case (it depends). Fear certainly seems to make processing difficult information harder. But writing as someone who has studied corporate resistance to the Australian carbon pricing system, I can tell you that a lot of the fear-mongering around climate change comes from those with a vested interest in the status quo. Even though a carbon price would have had very mild economic effects, coal companies and their allies repeatedly hired economists whose models “proved” such a price would provoke imminent economic armageddon, in well-publicised “sky will fall” reports, every time a carbon price was proposed. Once such a scheme was finally adopted, it lasted just two years before it was scrapped. Fear can indeed be a powerful tool. Ultimately, regardless of how many degrees of warming are likely, what we need is urgent action. And this is where we come to the bigger problem with Extinction Rebellion. Action doesn’t happen because of one-off mobilisations, but rather constant, specific pressure at all levels – local, national, international – by informed, engaged citizens who are in it for the long haul. This is regardless of what I call the “emotacycle”, a social movement’s predictable course of action inspired by emotion, taken whether or not it achieves the movement’s stated goals.  While protesters stop traffic in central London, local authorities around the rest of the country are largely getting away with declaring climate emergencies and then doing nothing. When the protests end, we have to hope that those who have braved the cold nights on thin cardboard will join with others for the excruciating boredom of town hall scrutiny committees. If we are talking about the behaviour of activists having a bad impact on the possibility of radical climate action, it’s not the anger of commuters or the fear of children we should worry about. But rather it’s the feelings of disconnection that so many people feel after attending a badly designed and badly run activist meeting.

By Christopher Monckton of Brenchley
The Prince of Wales, in aiming to be the end of democracy, may yet be the end of the monarchy. Notwithstanding that Europe’s most climate-skeptical party had just come top in the recent UK elections for the European Parliament, he intervened tendentiously in politics – as he now all too frequently does – to demand no less than an end to capitalism as we know it in the name of Saving The Planet from global warming that has not happened for a decade and a half.

The Prince told a meeting of the overpaid and overfed in London that a “fundamental transformation of global capitalism” was necessary in order to halt “dangerously accelerating climate change” that would “bring us to our own destruction”.
That won’t do. Even if “climate change” were “dangerously accelerating” (which it is not, for nearly all the key global indicators – temperature, sea ice, droughts, floods, hurricanes, rainfall, sunshine – show no exceptional trend), an essential duty of a future constitutional monarch is that on all matters of politics he should, as the ancient Greeks used to put it, keep absolute and holy silence.
All parties represented in the UK Parliament are already squandering tens of billions on addressing a non-problem with expensive non-solutions, such as windmills that cause greater CO2 emissions than they abate, and subsidies to all manner of unnecessary, diamond-encrusted boondoggles to make non-existent global warming go away, and madcap proposals such as the multi-billion-dollar deployment of 1500 Flettner-rigged trimarans with Thom fences on the rotating sail cylinders and power from the twin propellers driving atomizers to turn seawater into cloud condensation nuclei and fling them half a mile into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight back into space.

Beam me up, Scotty.
It is not the place of the monarchy to take sides in political debates. A monarchy that allows itself to shuffle, mumbling and whining, down into the political arena and to indulge in advocacy for global totalitarianism on the basis of a flimsy and discredited pseudo-scientific pretext is a monarchy that has forfeited its right to rule.
Charles must go. His future, along with that of the thousand-year monarchy, is in the past. It used to be said there would soon be only five kings in the world: spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds, and England. Scrub that last one.
    
Charles’ latest speech, whether he knew it or not, was part of a concerted campaign on the part of the international classe politique to persuade the world, with the active assistance of the sycophantic Marxstream media, to agree to a binding treaty by which sovereign nations would abandon their right to set their own environmental policy and allow a vast, entirely unelected international bureaucracy to rule them all.
To all who love democracy, this prospect is terrifying. The increasing brazenness and frequency of the lies being told about the climate, from Prince Charles’ more than usually ridiculous speech to the daftly hysterical climate assessments recently issued by Mr Obama and by Britain’s oldest taxpayer-funded pressure-group, the Royal Society, shows how desperate the totalitarians are to persuade the world to let them establish for the first time a global regime of absolute power wielded by supranational institutions entirely beyond the reach of any electorate.
The Founding Fathers of the United States foresaw many things when, in that long, hot Philadelphia summer, they drew up the Constitution. But they did not foresee that the United States, like many other nations, would come to be governed by people whose personal ambitions lay far beyond her shores, for they are global ambitions.
These global ambitions are not to extend nobly in the international sphere the athletic democracy that is their nation’s great gift to itself and to humanity, but instead to use the motive power of speciously-generated fear and the artifice of international treaty-making with like-minded totalitarians in other nations to bind their successors, and to bind the elected Congress in perpetuity without regard to the changing science or to the changing will of any future electorate.
The draft global climate treaty that failed in Copenhagen in 2009 failed in no small part because details of the draft had become public scant weeks before the conference began. There was a justifiable public outcry against it.
At the Durban climate conference in 2011 a further attempt at introducing a ruthless, intrusive and pernickety regime of global control was made, but again it was exposed publicly, exclusively, and in detail here at WattsUpWithThat. That posting became the most widely-read of some 500,000 on WordPress worldwide on the day of publication.
The junta that furtively directs the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change saw from these examples that conducting its affairs in public, as it is mandated to do, would prevent it from establishing its intended regime of absolute control. For if the mere people knew what it was up to they would not endure it.
At the 2012 climate conference in Doha, when I tried to obtain a draft of the Chairman’s conclusions – an always revealing document previously available at every conference but never reported on by journalists – a smirking clerk told me that no such document existed. The UNFCCC, twice before humiliated when its plans for world domination had been exposed, had scuttled, cockroach-like, underground.

Monckton of Arabia, Doha, 2012. The camel is the one on the right.
So now it is a race between the slow, inexorable emergence of the truth that the weather does not and will not change at the predicted rate or to the predicted degree and the vast army of princes, potentates, plutocrats, paper-pushers and pusillanimous panty-waists who have long wearied of democracy and have been quietly misusing the treaty-making power and abusing the scientific method with the undeclared but undeniable aim of eradicating all but the appearance of democracy, worldwide.
The day before yesterday, one nation might adopt Fascism, another Socialism, another Communism, another theocracy, another democracy. The systems competed, and democracy prevailed. The day after tomorrow, if the unholy alliance prevails, there will be one system, and no competition.
While competition existed, the totalitarians were seen off. Like it or not, the Berlin Wall came down. Yet they did not accept their defeat. They took over Greenpeace and other environmental groups and turned them into what have become, in all but name, totalitarian front groups whose real aim is not environmental but political.
That aim is the worldwide annihilation of the democratic and capitalist system that, for all its faults, has delivered more happiness and more benefit – in economic terms, more utility – to more people than any other political or economic disposition the world has known.
The Prince of Wales has morphed into just one more dirigiste, etatiste contre-capitaliste. His speech was framed as a warning – and it is just that: a warning that he and his ilk are intending over the next 18 months to bully or badger or bribe the world into ceding all political power by treaty to them and to those whom they approve. Ballot-box? What’s that? Never heard of it.
Consider the following sentence:
“Over the next 18 months, and bearing in mind the urgency of the situation confronting us, the world faces what is probably the last effective window of opportunity to vacate the insidious lure of the ‘last chance saloon’ in order to agree an ambitious, equitable and far-sighted multilateral settlement in the context of the post-2015 sustainable development goals and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.”
Sometimes, mixed metaphors are entertaining. This one is merely leaden. We face (but do not pass through) a window of opportunity, then we vacate a lure (this is entirely without meaning), then we do not call in at the last-chance saloon (surely the Prince’s intention was to visit the last-chance saloon rather than missing the bus and failing to catch the tide?).
His is the bloodless, alien tongue of those who have conceived so total a contempt for democracy that they cannot wait to stifle it under a mountain of treaties and carbon controls and reporting requirements and quotas and taxes and subsidies and regulations and restrictions and Thou-Shalt-Nots.
And the Press will not come to the aid of the people. Before the Second World War, they near-unanimously fawned upon Hitler. After it, they near-unanimously fawned upon Stalin.
Now, they near-unanimously fawn upon the UN, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Framework Convention on Climate Change, the European Union, and a Lernaean Hydra of pampered, me-too, supranational bureaucracies whose defining characteristic is that not one of them is answerable either via the ballot-box to any electorate or via the courts to any jurisdiction.

Patrick Henry
This is a dangerous moment. All that the Founding Fathers of the United States had sought to achieve may very soon be set at naught. The irony is that in the plot to repudiate and repeal freedom and democracy and the cheerful chaos of the market-place the current leadership in the United States has enthusiastically made common cause with the very monarchy that the American Revolution so vigorously sought to supplant.
The year before that great Revolution, in St. John’s Church, Virginia, Patrick Henry cried, “Give me liberty or give me death!” In the coming months, unless we are very careful and very vigilant, it will not be the former.

The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is angry with the U.S. again, citing all manner of crimes and misdemeanors. To emphasize its point the DPRK is prosecuting two Americans for “hostile” behavior.



Why is North Korea worried about Washington? Because the U.S. military remains deployed in the South 61 years after the end of the Korean War. Washington has turned the otherwise successful Republic of Korea into an international welfare queen, apparently forever stuck on the U.S. defense dole.



It’s time for the ROK to graduate and America to leave the Koreans solve their own problems.



Last week North Korea’s deputy UN ambassador, Ri Tong‐​il, gave a press conference denouncing Washington in florid terms. U.S. behavior “is reminding us of the historical lasting symptoms of a mentally retarded patient,” said Amb. Ri.



His list of grievances was long. It included Ulchi‐​Freedom Guardian, the latest annual military exercise between America and South Korea. Amb. Ri also complained that Washington was sabotaging improved inter‐​Korean relations and ignoring Pyongyang’s proposals for reducing tensions on the peninsula.



He requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the threat allegedly posed by Ulchi‐​Freedom to peace and security. Unfortunately for the DPRK, the U.S. is the leading permanent member and Seoul is a rotating member this year, so no action is expected. Which merely exposes how the UN “has lost its principles, impartiality and responsibility,” complained Amb. Ri. Actually, the international body never has manifested those principles.



At greatest risk are three Americans currently held in the North. Kenneth Bae is serving a prison term, apparently for promoting Christianity while visiting. Two other tourists have been arrested in recent months and face trial. Pyongyang has been using them as bargaining chips in an attempt to get America’s attention.



Although it’s tempting to dismiss Amb. Ri’s dyspeptic remarks, he made a legitimate point when justifying his nation’s nuclear program: “No country in the world has been living like the DPRK, under serious threats to its existence, sovereignty, survival.” There is much not to like about North Korea, but even paranoids have enemies.



In any war the North would face South Korea, which has vastly outstripped Pyongyang on virtually every measure of national power, and the U.S., the globe’s superpower. East Asia is filled with additional American allies, while the North’s Cold War partners, Moscow and Beijing, have drifted away and almost certainly wouldn’t help in a conflict. Impoverished, bankrupt, and alone in a world in which Washington bombs and invades small countries at will, the DPRK would be foolish to entrust its survival to U.S. self‐​restraint.



Which raises the question: just what is America doing with troops on the Korean peninsula?



The Korean peninsula never has been a vital interest for the U.S. Early American attempts to open up the “Hermit Kingdom” did not end well. After Japan won control of the peninsula and eventually turned Korea into a colony, Washington left the land to missionaries.



At the end of World War II the U.S. and Soviet Union divided the peninsula, with their occupation zones turning into contending countries, both claiming to represent all of Korea. The North’s invasion of the ROK in June 1950 drew America back in militarily. After the war ended inconclusively in 1953, Washington initiated a “Mutual” Defense Treaty with the South and retained a sizable military garrison, since whittled down to 28,500.





Washington has turned the otherwise successful Republic of Korea into an international welfare queen.



South Korea was economically depressed and politically unstable, leaving it vulnerable to renewed attack by the DPRK, backed by the U.S.S.R. and China, then led by Mao Zedong. However, the ROK began its economic take off in the 1960s and soon sped by the North, with a debilitating collectivist system.



Yet Seoul remains seemingly helpless and hopeless, dependent on an American security guarantee and military garrison. Indeed, the ROK wouldn’t even exercise operational control over its own forces in wartime, but instead leaves that with America, a relic of the Korean War when the South’s military capabilities were modest, to say the least. South Korea took back peacetime control only two decades ago. It finally planned to reclaim wartime “OPCON” in 2012, but then put it off until 2015, and now wants another delay, until around 2020.



Some South Koreans claim that the ROK military isn’t ready—which raises questions about what the South’s armed forces has been doing over the last six decades when not suppressing democracy. Indeed, how has far less technologically sophisticated North Korea managed its military all these years? Other officials in both the South and America worry that turning OPCON of South Korea’s military over to South Korea’s military would encourage the withdrawal _of U.S. forces_. That is, some in Seoul are committed to remaining helpless and hopeless _in order to keep Americans at risk_ to ensure ROK security.



But why should Washington defend the South in 2014, 61 years after the Korean War ended?



The ROK is well able to construct whatever military forces are necessary for its own protection. The idea that Seoul cannot match a bankrupt, starving, and isolated nation with a fraction of South Korea’s resources is nonsense. There is no special geographical feature that keeps the nation to the south inferior militarily. The problem is political decisions in the South.



The DPRK possesses the ability to pour SCUD missiles and artillery fire into Seoul, the ROK’s capital, but that ensures deterrence, not the ability win an aggressive war. North Korea’s nuclear capabilities are unclear, but American conventional forces on the peninsula play no role in preventing a DPRK nuclear strike, assuming Pyongyang possesses deliverable weapons. To the contrary, U.S. conventional deployments unnecessarily put Americans in harm’s way, creating nuclear hostages.



Thomas M. Nichols of the Navy War College worried about maintaining deterrence on the peninsula, but that is South Korea’s job. It is not America’s purpose to bankrupt itself and risk its citizens’ lives demonstrating “resolve” all over the world on everyone else’s behalf. Prosperous and populous allies have a responsibility to do what the U.S. long has done—make the sacrifices necessary to defend themselves. The ROK should bulk up its army and spend more for defense at home, rather than create a “blue water” navy, for instance, for use in distant seas.



Some Americans envision U.S. bases in South Korea—and in a united Korea, should that happen—as “dual use,” part of a regional network to contain China. However, with South Korean President Park Geun‐​hye and Chinese President Xi Jinping exchanging state visits, it would be foolish to expect the ROK to become a permanent enemy of its big neighbor to advance U.S. foreign policy designs. Seoul isn’t going to commit national suicide by, say, joining an American war against China over Japan’s claims to the Senkaku Islands.



Even stranger are ideas for expanding military ties into other areas. For instance, Army Lt. Col. James Minnich urged a “comprehensive, strategic alliance” reaching climate change, human trafficking, and peacekeeping. None of these have anything to do with America promising to protect wealthy South Korea from threats it can handle itself. Unrelated cooperation should be pursued without expecting Americans to die in Seoul’s defense.



The U.S. receives no benefits commensurate with the costs of inserting itself in the endlessly frustrating and threatening Korean imbroglio. The peninsula is an area of great power competition, but not one of vital interest to America. The U.S. largely ignored the peninsula until it fell into America’s lap with the surrender of Imperial Japan. The unique value ascribed to preserving South Korea then disappeared with the end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Union.



The ROK’s disadvantage compared to the North, which originally led to U.S. military intervention, ended as South Korea raced past its northern antagonist. No wonder the DPRK complains about threats to its survival. Absent the possession of nuclear weapons, it would find it ever more difficult to deter military attack by the South, especially if backed by America.



The defense commitment is expensive for Washington. The U.S. must not only pay the extra costs inherent to foreign deployments, but it must create a larger military to back such commitments. America maintains a sizable army for offense, not defense, since the threat of ground invasion of the U.S. is about as great as that of a Martian attack. Allow America’s manpower‐​rich allies to fend off foreign attack and Washington could dramatically shrink its outsize ground forces.



Moreover, the U.S. defense guarantee and military garrison inevitably make America the focal point of North Korea’s antagonisms and frustrations. Pyongyang’s bizarre threats—the latest to nuke the White House—reflect Washington’s central involvement in Korean affairs. Leave Korea to the Koreans and the North would spew its venom elsewhere. Then American tourists might not find themselves arrested for such “offenses” as leaving a Bible behind, apparently the charge against Jeffrey Edward Fowle.



South Korea has achieved much, overcoming colonialism, war, and dictatorship to create a country at the front rank internationally. But that only sets Seoul’s military dependence in starker relief. A serious nation in every other regard, the ROK is an international welfare queen when it comes to defense, abusing the generosity of the American people. Like parents stuck with an adult child who doesn’t want to leave home, Washington must take the initiative and kick its overage dependent out on his own.



OPCON should shift, America’s troops should return home, and the U.S. security guarantee should end. South Korea could then take its place among the world’s nations as truly independent, freed of its embarrassing reliance on Washington for defense, perhaps the most basic attribute of nationhood.

Despite the Trump administration’s economic turn inward, the U.S. continues to dominate the globe. America’s economy remains freer, larger, wealthier, and more productive than ever. But China has an increasing opportunity to share global leadership.



 _The Economist_ recently posited a competition between the two great powers. The British publication prophesized a Chinese victory: the U.S. was the speedy hare, jumping from one challenge to the next, while the People’s Republic of China was the tortoise, slow but steady—and the ultimate victor.



Yet the vision of a bilateral race misleads more than it enlightens. President Donald Trump appears to suffer from a similar bout of myopia. What he misses in waging his protectionist campaign is that commerce and trade are positive‐​sum activities. That is, they are mutually beneficial: both nations can win. So, too, when the PRC does more diplomatically.



China has gained ground economically in Asia, an inevitable outcome given its rising wealth and location. But that has not excluded America. Most of Asia is growing economically, providing opportunities for all.





China is demonstrating greater willingness to cooperate. For that, Americans and others should be thankful.



Moreover, the U.S. economy is sophisticated, advanced, and transparent, offering unique benefits. Despite America’s economic difficulties, China’s potential challenges loom even larger. Inefficient state enterprises, bad banks, distorted demography, and politicized development all threaten to undermine the PRC’s economic progress.



Indeed, America remains far wealthier than China. As of last year, American private wealth outdistanced that of China $84.8 trillion to $23.4 trillion. And the U.S. advantage is growing. It doesn’t mean the PRC can’t catch up. But that day seems ever further away.



Geopolitics also provides a positive backdrop: Most East Asian states are nervous about Beijing’s ultimate ambitions. Although Asian consumers may not purchase more products as a result, their governments have greater incentive to ensure that the U.S. remains involved in the region.



Indeed, if there is a risk to America, it is primarily self‐​inflicted. The Obama administration negotiated the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership to expand U.S. economic opportunities, as well as limit China’s political reach. A dozen other nations made sacrifices—contrary to the president’s claim, they opened their markets more than did America—to expand their ties with Washington. As a result, the TPP was seen as a diplomatic defeat for Beijing, which was not invited to join.



But the Trump administration tossed away its advantage. And even America’s closest regional allies, such as Australia, have indicated that they now will turn to China to forge free trade agreements. Beijing will be only too happy to oblige. 



The U.S. also has been reluctant to participate in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), intended to expand transportation infrastructure involving Asia, Africa, and Europe. The Obama administration offered a tepid endorsement, while the Trump administration so far has been more critical.



There’s good reason for other nations to be skeptical of the plan, announced in 2013 by Chinese President Xi Jinping. It is intended to enhance the PRC’s international influence. As a political imperative, it is likely to encourage projects of dubious economic merit. Many of the target nations suffer from poor governance and economic failure.



Nevertheless, the U.S. should press China on its commitments. The PRC has won praise for its handling of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. If Beijing is serious about opening the BRI process, then it should address the concerns of Western nations. For instance, China could focus the program on economics, establish mechanisms to deal with technical standards, reform discriminatory domestic practices against Western firms, and open its economy to poorer BRI nations.



In other areas, Washington should seek to accommodate rather than restrict Chinese activities. For instance, Beijing has been increasingly involved economically in Asia and Africa. Unfortunately, the so‐​called “China model” or “Beijing Consensus” essentially rewards authoritarian regimes, offering involvement without judgment or conditions.



But just as the U.S. found decades ago with the rise of the “Ugly American,” China has faced blowback from its increasing role. In countries such as Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Zambia, China has been the target of public protests and political campaigns.



Moreover, Beijing has found that aid and investment are at best imperfect vehicles for winning the geopolitical loyalty of other nations. Last year the Philippines’ mercurial Rodrigo Duterte famously announced a shift toward the PRC after receiving promises of assistance. But after Donald Trump’s election, Manila appeared less likely to switch sides, a move that was always unlikely given America’s deep ties to that nation.



China also has taken on a greater role at the United Nations. The third largest contributor after the U.S. and Japan, Beijing is entitled to increased influence. Its role has expanded in the G-20—made up of countries with the world’s 20 largest economies—as well as the International Monetary Fund, which added the yuan as a reserve currency. The U.S. should encourage the PRC to pay off its remaining debts to both the IMF and World Bank, formalizing Beijing’s shift to the developed world.



China is playing a greater role in other areas, such as the environment. There are good reasons to question the efficacy of the Paris accord on climate change, as well as the PRC’s limited obligations under the pact. Nevertheless, Beijing’s willingness to take on more international obligations is good news. China is demonstrating greater willingness to cooperate. For that, Americans and others should be thankful.



There has been much discussion of late regarding the Thucydides trap, the difficulty of reconciling an incumbent power with an ambitious rising state. The challenge is real and serious: Is Washington willing to back away from its determination to dominate China along its own border? America would never have accepted similar behavior by Great Britain or any other nation.



The U.S. and PRC shouldn’t exacerbate the potential for conflict by turning economic and diplomatic relations into areas of confrontation as well. There are many opportunities for beneficial cooperation. Both Washington and Beijing should look toward the future while addressing today’s problems.

The volcano Mount Sangeang Api in the Lesser Sunda Islands has just erupted, sending a huge ash cloud 12 miles into the air.
Wikipedia describes Sangeang Api as a volcano complex with 2 active cones, Doro Api 1,949 metres (6,394 ft) and Doro Mantoi. 1,795 m (5,889 ft). Indonesia has a number of very active volcanoes, including volcanoes which threaten major cities, such as the infamous Mount Merapi.

Merapi, which has erupted several times in the last decade, is located just 17 miles from the city of Yogyakarta, home of 2.5 million people.
Near equatorial volcanoes like Sangeang Api are useful to global warming modellers, as the ash cloud can usually be detected in both hemispheres. They provide a convenient excuse for the short term cooling of the entire Earth.

"The UK government could face a legal battle after offering more than $1bn in financial support to help build a gas project in Mozambique despite its commitment to tackling the climate crisis. Under the deal, UK taxpayer funds will be used to help develop and export Mozambique’s gas reserves, in one of the largest single financing packages ever offered by a UK credit agency to a foreign fossil fuel project.  The government’s foreign credit agency, UK Export Finance (UKEF), will offer loans worth $300m to British companies working on the gas project, and will also guarantee loans from commercial banks worth up to $850m. The decision taken by UKEF, which has been accused of “rank hypocrisy” over its record on fossil fuel financing, has emerged just over a year after MPs on the environmental audit committee called for an end to government support for polluting projects overseas, saying it “undermines the UK’s climate commitments”. Graham Stuart, the parliamentary under-secretary for the Department for International Trade, confirmed the financing package on Monday after the oil company spearheading Mozambique LNG named UKEF as one of its backers last week. The French oil major Total, which will operate Mozambique LNG, said late on Friday that the project’s total financing was “the biggest ever in Africa” and included support from export credit agencies in the UK, US, Japan, Italy, Thailand, South Africa and the Netherlands. In response to a parliamentary question, Stuart said Total’s $20bn gas project could be “transformational” for the east African country’s economic and social development, and could help create 2,000 jobs in the UK too. But campaigners at Friends of the Earth have accused the government of failing to take into account the project’s impact on efforts to tackle the climate crisis, and warned that they may call for a judicial review of the decision. Tony Bosworth, a campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said the government had shown “gross hypocrisy” by claiming to be a global leader on tackling the climate crisis while using taxpayers’ money to fund a project that would “have massive climate impacts”. He said: “As hosts of the next global climate summit, the UK must focus on ambitious action leading to real emissions cuts both at home and abroad, not funding climate-wrecking projects in a country already struggling with the impacts of climate breakdown.” Mozambique LNG is classed as a category-A project under OECD guidelines, which means it risks significant adverse environmental or social impacts that are irreversible or unprecedented, and requires prospective backers to undertake an impact assessment review. UKEF declined to share the results of its assessment, or comment on its decision to offer more than $1bn in loans and loan guarantees to companies working on the project. In a statement, UKEF repeated the claims made by Stuart and added that the project would generate significant revenue for Mozambique. UKEF says it undertook an environmental, social and human rights (ESHR) review and considered climate factors in its consideration of the project. A spokeswoman for the credit agency declined to share the ESHR report. • This article was amended on 21 July 2020 to add details of a statement provided by UKEF after publication."
"The world’s river deltas take up less than 0.5% of the global land area, but they are home to hundreds of millions of people. Many live in major fast-growing cities such as Kolkata in the Ganges delta, Bangkok in the Chao Phraya delta, or Shanghai, one of dozens of large cities in the Yangtze delta region. With fertile soils and easy access to the coast, deltas are critical hotspots of food production. Vietnam’s Mekong delta alone supplies almost 20% of the world’s rice. They also host unique ecosystems such as the Sundarbans in Bangladesh and India, the largest mangrove forest in the world. But many of the world’s deltas are now facing an existential crisis. Sea levels are rising as a result of climate change, while deltas are themselves sinking, and together this means the relative sea level is rising extra fast.  Deltas are built from sediments that are carried downstream by rivers and eventually deposited where the river meets the sea. As these sediments compact under their own weight, deltas naturally sink. Where left undisturbed, the supply of new river sediment can compensate for the subsidence and help to maintain the delta surface above sea level.  But deltas are now subsiding much faster than they would do naturally. That’s thanks to groundwater being pumped (or “mined”) from aquifers underneath them and used to irrigate crops and provide water for rapidly growing cities.  In these circumstances, only the continued deposition of sediment on deltas can keep them from “drowning”. We therefore wanted to find out whether supplies of river sediments would be affected by future environmental changes. To address this question, we used a computer model to project changes in the flows of sediment to almost 50 major deltas worldwide. We used the model to explore the impact of various environmental changes, including climate change, population growth, increases in wealth and the construction of dams. Our results are published in the journal Environmental Research Letters.  We found that most of the world’s major deltas will receive less river sediment by the end of the century, regardless of the environmental change scenario. On average, we projected a 38% decrease. Our results suggest that many deltas – already significantly stressed – will become sediment starved, further compounding the risks of rising relative sea levels. Some of the most severe reductions will be found in major Asian deltas such as the Ganges (81% less sediment) and the Mekong (77%). This is particularly concerning because these deltas are among the largest and most densely populated in the world.  We found that climate change will generally drive a small increase in the flows of sediments as, among other factors, warmer temperatures lead to increased precipitation and more soil is washed into rivers. But in many deltas this modest uptick will be more than offset by dams (which trap river sediments) and improved soil conservation practices as societies become wealthier. The Aswan Dam on the River Nile in Egypt or the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River in the US are among the dams that have already starved their downstream deltas of sediment. Better management of river sediment is vital to improve the outlook for the world’s deltas. International cooperation will be essential in deltas such as the Mekong and Ganges which are supplied by large rivers that drain many countries. For dams specifically, comprehensive environmental risk assessments that fully cost the consequences for downstream regions are required so that plans can be changed or scrapped. For those dams that are to be built in the coming decades, their design must accommodate transport of sediment downstream. For authorities within deltas, faced with managing a dwindling supply of river sediment, new approaches are needed to better manage this precious declining resource. Flood embankments prevent sediment reaching delta plains and may need to be breached, as is being explored in the Ganges delta. Additionally, the removal of sand from rivers for construction materials, which is pervasive in many deltas around the world, must be better managed. Ultimately, difficult decisions need to be made about development priorities between countries upstream of deltas and those including the deltas themselves, and there will be trade-offs to be made between hydropower, agricultural practices and delta sustainability."

"It’s tempting to think that our forests would be fine if we could simply stop trees being felled or burnt. But forests – particularly tropical ones – are more than just trees. They’re also the animals that skulk and swoop among them. Worryingly, these furry and feathered companions are rapidly disappearing – and our new research indicates that this will have grave repercussions for the role forests play in combating climate breakdown.  Healthy tropical forests swarm with life. Beyond myriad invertebrates there are seed-eating rodents, a range of leaf eaters, birds of all kinds, and often primates. However, many forests have already lost most of their largest animals, mainly as a result of hunting to supply a growing bushmeat trade. Hunting isn’t the only reason. Thanks to deforestation for farmland and logging, many forests today are highly fragmented. The small, unconnected patches that remain aren’t big enough to support populations of the largest species, which tend to need more space. The disappearance of animals from otherwise intact habitats is known as defaunation, and it is leading to a growing number of empty forests not just in tropical countries, but around the world. The UK has already lost most of its largest species (think lynx, wolf, and wisent), while woodland bird numbers have declined by a quarter since 1970.

      Top five threats to UK's wildlife (and what to do about them) – new report


 The impacts of this defaunation have attracted the attention of the world’s conservation scientists, but studies to date have usually been carried out at single locations. Consequently, we lack a worldwide picture that takes into account different types of forest and the diversity of animals that are disappearing. To fill this gap, we worked with William Baldwin-Cantello, chief adviser on forests at the World Wide Fund for Nature UK, to gather together all the existing research and perform a meta-analysis – an analysis of analyses – on the available data. Our findings reveal a worrying trend. The loss of animals compromises the ability of forests to reproduce. This effect is particularly severe when primates and birds disappear, because of the key role they play in seed dispersal. Trees make fruit to entice animals to transport their seeds, because they are more likely to germinate and grow successfully if they fall further from their parent tree. So when fruit-eating animals disappear, fewer seeds are dispersed and the trees struggle to reproduce. This animal absence will slowly change how forests look. Most tropical forests today are dominated by trees whose seeds are dispersed by animals. Over time, they are likely to be gradually replaced by trees that use the wind to reproduce. Naturally, these usually have small seeds, and therefore produce smaller trees that store less carbon for the same area of forest. As a result, forests will store less and less carbon, even if we completely halt deforestation. This is particularly concerning because roughly 20% of the carbon dioxide we emit is absorbed by the world’s vegetation and soils, and half of this is due to tropical forests alone. Conserving forests is essential for the fight against climate breakdown – and, we do have a global tool at our disposal to help. Known as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, or REDD+ for short, it allows wealthy countries with large carbon footprints to pay poorer, tropical countries to protect their forests. Of course, REDD+ is only an effective tool if the forests countries pay to protect continue to store the same amount of carbon. We usually monitor this by taking satellite images of the quantity of forest canopy remaining. But what satellite imagery can’t do is measure aspects of forest quality beneath the canopy. Our research strongly suggests that one aspect of forest quality – defaunation – is a vital early warning sign of future losses in the carbon storing capacity of forests. In light of this, policies for managing forest carbon around the world may need a rethink. We need to pay more attention to what’s going on beneath global forest canopies through research on the ground, though this will be difficult in remote areas. More importantly, we must make sure we’re doing all we can to conserve the full complement of animal species that live in our forests. For example, we need to heavily invest in conservation actions that help communities accustomed to hunting bushmeat to meet their dietary protein needs without harming wildlife. We must also enforce existing rules better, such as those that outlaw hunting within parks and reserves. Preventing defaunation in forests won’t be easy. But given what we know about the critical role forest animals play, doing so will be essential if we hope to retain diverse and carbon-rich forests in the tropics and around the world. If the beauty and wonder of the forest’s animals wasn’t enough reason to protect them, we now have another: by conserving wildlife, we will be helping to save ourselves from the catastrophic effects of climate breakdown.

My name is Andrew Grossman. I am an Adjunct Scholar at the Cato Institute and a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of Baker & Hostetler LLP. The views I express in this testimony are my own and should not be construed as representing those of the Cato Institute, my law firm, or its clients.



My testimony today focuses on two related issues concerning the use of settlements in government litigation that have previously been of interest to this Subcommittee and that, I believe, warrant further consideration and oversight. 



The first is the use and abuse of “sue and settle” tactics in litigation against the government. “Sue and settle” refers to collusion in litigation between government regulators and outside groups bringing suit against those regulators to compel them to take official actions that the regulators themselves support. It raises serious concerns about the conduct and resolution of litigation that seeks to set agency regulatory priorities and (in some instances) actually influences the content of those regulations. Since the House Judiciary Committee first directed its attention to the problem of collusive settlements in 2012,1 there have been a myriad of hearings and reports focusing on this problem, as well as the introduction of legislation to constructively address it. There are three questions for the Subcommittee today: what is the Trump Administration doing to avoid the errors of the Obama Administration regarding collusive settlements? What should it be doing? And is there still a need for legislation in this area? 



The second issue I will address in this testimony is the use of settlements to circumvent the appropriation of funds by Congress. As the Subcommittee is well aware, the Obama Administration, on several occasions, entered into settlements with third parties that directed them to make payments to activist organizations and other groups favored by officials. A recent settlement approved by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, over the dissent of Judge Janice Rogers Brown, employs the same technique to distribute hundreds of millions of dollars to various nonprofit groups directly from the United States Treasury in the absence of any appropriation.



Again, the Subcommittee should seek to understand what the Trump Administration is doing to prevent this kind of bootleg appropriations and whether legislation is required. 



**I. Ending the “Sue and Settle” Phenomenon**



 **A. Understanding the Phenomenon**



Typically, the federal government vigorously defends itself against lawsuits challenging its actions. But not always. Sometimes regulators are only too happy to face collusive lawsuits by friendly “foes” aimed at compelling government action that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to achieve. In a number of cases brought by activist groups, the Obama Administration chose instead to enter into settlements that committed it to taking action, often promulgating new regulations, on a set schedule. While the “sue and settle” phenomenon is not new, dating back to the broad “public interest” legislation of the 1960s and 1970s, what is new is the frequency with which generally applicable regulations, particularly in the environmental sphere, are being promulgated according to judicially enforceable consent decrees struck in settlement. The EPA alone entered into more than sixty such settlements between 2009 and 2012, committing it to publish more than one hundred new regulations, at a cost to the economy of tens of billions of dollars.2 We are still tallying the costs of the “sue and settle” binge through the end of President Obama’s second term, including such regulations as the Clean Power Plan. 



In the abstract, settlements serve a useful, beneficial purpose by allowing parties to settle claims without the expense and burden of litigation. But litigation seeking to compel the government to undertake future action is not the usual case, and the federal government is not the usual litigant. Consent decrees and settlements that bind the federal government present special challenges that do not arise in private litigation. This happens in all manner of litigation, and is not confined to a particular subject matter. Settlements binding federal actors have been considered in cases concerning environmental policy, civil rights, federal mortgage subsidies, national security, and many others. Basically, settlements may become an issue in any area of the law where federal policymaking is routinely driven by litigation. 



But they are especially prevalent in environmental law, due to the breadth of the governing statutes, their provisions authorizing citizen suits, and the great number of duties those statutes arguably impose on the relevant agencies.



 **B. The Trump Administration**



To date, I have not identified any abusive settlements during the Trump Administration. Of course, the day is still young, and not all of the ingredients for collusion, including appointed officials, are yet in place. One encouraging sign is EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s decision to bar collusive settlements involving the EPA. He explained the action in a radio interview:



In fact, one of the things we’ve done internally…is send a memo out to our regions and also to headquarters to say that the days of sue and settle, the days of consent decrees governing this agency where the EPA gets sued by an NGO, a third party, and that third party sets the agenda, sets the timelines on how we do rulemaking, and bypassing rulemaking entirely have ended. And we’ve sent that out across the agency…. 



When you use the courts, you know, when someone sues, a third party, and NGO, Sierra Club or otherwise, sues the EPA and then the EPA outside of the regulatory process enters into something called a judgment consent decree and then changes statute, changes timelines, changes obligations under a statute. That’s regulation through litigation. That’s an abuse of the process. And whether it’s for conservative causes or liberal causes, that’s still a breach of the process and should not be done.3



Administrator Pruitt could not have been more clear than when he told the _Wall Street Journal_ , “Regulation through litigation is simply wrong” and stated that agencies should not “use the judicial process to bypass accountability.”4 And I have no doubt that Administrator Pruitt will keep his word.



But the EPA is just one agency of the many that have employed “sue and settle” tactics to advance their agendas, and no other agency heads are as outspoken on this issue as Administrator Pruitt. The Trump Administration has not issued any kind of comprehensive policy statement regarding the use of settlements, and so there is still the risk of abuse—even if not so acute, for a variety of reasons, as under the Obama Administration.



 **C. The Department of Justice Should Readopt the Meese Policy**



So there is still a need for reform on this issue, including actions by the Executive Branch and by Congress. Collusive settlements can be used to evade accountability within the Executive Branch. They can be used to advance one agency’s agenda at the expense of another’s, to undermine centralized oversight of the regulatory system by the Office of Management and Budget and its Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and to undermine presidential control. These are serious things, especially for an administration led by a President who ran on a deregulatory agenda and now is seeking to carry it out through the instruments of the federal government.



In these circumstances, the interests of Congress and the President overlap, and both should favor reintroduction of the “Meese Policy.”5 Attorney General Edwin Meese III, serving under President Ronald Reagan, saw that consent decrees have been abused to hinder the Executive Branch and circumvent the Legislative Branch. Turning to constitutional principles, he propounded policy guidelines prohibiting the Department of Justice, whether on its own behalf or on behalf of client agencies and departments, from entering into consent decrees that limited discretionary authority in any of three respects:



1\. The department or agency should not enter into a consent decree that converts to a mandatory duty the otherwise discretionary authority of the Secretary or agency administrator to revise, amend, or promulgate regulations.   
  
2\. The department or agency should not enter into a consent decree that either commits the department or agency to expend funds that Congress has not appropriated and that have not been budgeted for the action in question or commits a department or agency to seek a particular appropriation or budget authorization.   
  
3\. The department or agency should not enter into a consent decree that divests the Secretary or agency administrator, or his successors, of discretion committed to him by Congress or the Constitution where such discretionary power was granted to respond to changing circumstances, to make policy or managerial choices, or to protect the rights of third parties.



With respect to settlement agreements unsupported by consent decree, the Meese Policy imposed similar limitations buttressed by the following requirement: that the sole remedy for the government’s failure to comply with the terms of an agreement requiring it to exercise its discretion in a particular manner would be revival of the suit against it. In all instances, the Attorney General retained the authority to authorize consent decrees and agreements that exceeded these limitations but did not “tend to undermine their force and [were] consistent with the constitutional prerogatives of the executive or the legislative branches.”



The Meese Policy addresses the fundamental problem of sue and settle: It blocks agencies from relinquishing their discretionary authority to outside groups, thereby reinforcing traditional norms of administrative rulemaking. An administration that embraces the Meese Policy will benefit from greater flexibility, improved transparency, and, ultimately, better policy results. 



In short, if the Trump Administration is serious about promoting accountability and pursuing its policy goals, it should formally adopt the Meese Policy. The fact that it has not done so yet is cause for concern and for oversight by this Subcommittee.



 **D. Congress Should Enact Reform Legislation**



There is also a need for action by Congress. As we have seen, the use of collusive settlements is a recurring problem. Addressing it therefore requires actions that endure beyond the tenure of a single administration. That means legislation. Congress can and should adopt certain common‐​sense policies that provide for transparency and accountability in settlements and consent decrees that compel future government action.



My previous written testimonies and articles on this issue have detailed at length the consequences and costs of collusive settlements, as well as principles for reform.6 Those principles are reflected in the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act, H.R. 469 and S. 119. That bill represents a leap forward in transparency, requiring agencies to publish proposed settlements before they are filed with a court and to accept and respond to comments on proposed settlements. It also requires agencies to submit annual reports to Congress identifying any settlements that they have entered into. The bill loosens the standard for intervention, so that parties opposed to a “failure to act” lawsuit may intervene in the litigation and participate in any settlement negotiations. Most substantially, it requires the court, before approving a pro‐​posed consent decree or settlement, to find that any deadlines contained in it allow for the agency to carry out standard rulemaking procedures. In this way, the federal government could continue to benefit from the appropriate use of settlements and consent decrees to avoid unnecessary litigation, while ensuring that the public interest in transparency and sound rulemaking is not compromised.



 **E. Congress Should Consider More Comprehensive Reform To Bolster the Constitutional Separation of Powers**



Finally, Congress may wish to consider a more comprehensive approach that limits the ability of third parties to compel Executive Branch action. Suing to compel an agency to act on a permit application or the like is different in kind from seeking to compel it to issue generally applicable regulations or take action against third parties. As Justice Anthony Kennedy has observed, “Difficult and fundamental questions are raised” by citizen‐​suit provisions that give private litigants control over actions and decisions (including the setting of agency priorities) “committed to the Executive by Article II of the Constitution of the United States.”7 Constitutional concerns aside, at the very least, the ability to compel agency action through litigation and settlements gives rise to the policy concerns identified above, subordinating the public interest to special interests and sacrificing accountability.



The sue‐​and‐​settle phenomenon is facilitated by the combination of broad citizen‐​suit provisions with unrealistic statutory deadlines that private parties may seek enforced through citizen suits. According to William Yeatman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, “98 percent of EPA regulations (196 out of 200) pursuant to [Clean Air Act] programs were promulgated late, by an average of 2,072 days after their respective statutorily defined deadlines.”8 Furthermore, “65 percent of the EPA’s statutorily defined responsibilities (212 of 322 possible) are past due by an average of 2,147 days.”9 With so many agency responsibilities past due, citizen‐​suit authority allows specialinterest groups (whether or not in collusion or philosophical agreement with the agency) to use the courts to set agency priorities. Not everything can be a priority, and by assigning so many actions unrealistic and unachievable non‐​discretionary deadlines, Congress has inserted the courts into the process of setting agency priorities, but without providing them any standard or guidance on how to do so. It should be little surprise, then, that the most active repeat players in the regulatory process—the agency and environmentalist groups—have learned how to manipulate this situation to advance their own agendas and to avoid, as much as possible, accountability for the consequences of so doing.



Two potential solutions suggest themselves. First, a deadline that Congress does not expect an agency to meet is one that ought not to be on the books. If Congress wants to set priorities, it should do so credibly and hold agencies to those duties through oversight, appropriations, and its other powers. In areas where Congress has no clear preference as to timing, it should leave the matter to the agencies and then hold them accountable for their decisions and performance. What Congress should not do is empower private parties and agencies to manipulate the litigation process to set priorities that may not reflect the public interest while avoiding the political consequences of those actions. To that end, Congress should seriously consider abolishing all mandatory deadlines that are obsolete and all recurring deadlines that agencies regularly fail to observe.10



Second, Congress should consider narrowing citizen‐​suit provisions to exclude “failure to act” claims that seek to compel the agency to consider generally applicable regulations or to take actions against third parties. As a matter of principle, these kinds of decisions regarding agency priorities should be set by government actors who are accountable for their actions, not by litigants and not through abusive litigation.



 **II. Time To Act on “Slush Fund” Settlements and Judgment Fund Abuse**



The Subcommittee and Committee are well aware of the phenomenon of “slush fund” settlements, having conducted an extensive investigation finding that the Obama Administration’s Department of Justice “subverted Congress’ spending power by requiring settling defendants to donate money to non‐​victim third‐​parties.”11 A related phenomenon is the use of settlements that direct funds from the federal government’s Judgment Fund to third parties who have not been injured by the government for non‐​compensatory and non‐​restitution purposes. I do not intend, in this testimony, to recapitulate the factual background of this problem or the constitutional issues it raises—on the legal issues, I would direct you to the testimony and publications of the Heritage Foundation’s Paul Larkin.12 But I do wish to discuss a recent decision by the D.C. Circuit addressing this phenomenon and to reiterate the need for reform.



The decision comes in a case known as _Keepseagle_ and involves a settlement of a class action brought by Native American farmers and ranchers who alleged the Department of Agriculture had discriminated against them in farm credit and benefit programs.13 In 2001, the district court certified the class for equitable relief only, declining to address monetary relief. In 2010, the class counsel and government announced a settlement including monetary relief: fully $680 million from the Judgment Fund would be placed in a compensation fund for claimants. This was, as Prof. Paul Figley has described, “remarkably generous,” given that it represented about 98 percent of what the plaintiff class could possibly have won at trial had everything gone its way.14 Reporting by the _New York Times_ indicated that, as is almost always the case, the proceeds of actual litigation would likely have been far less than the class’s projections, due to weaknesses in many class members’ cases and the fact that Native American farmers had, in general, fared well economically.15 Indeed, through the Clinton and George W. Bush Administrations, the Executive Branch had contested the very existence of money damages, reversing course only after the Obama Administration took power.16



Contemplating that claims on the compensation fund would not exhaust it, the settlement provided that remaining funds would be directed to socalled “cy pres” beneficiaries. “[A]ny non‐​profit organization, other than a law firm, legal services entity, or educational institution” that served Native American farmers was eligible for funding. With no one challenging the _cy pres_ provision, the district court approved the settlement.



Ultimately, despite a low bar to seeking compensation under the settlement, only about 3,600 farmers made eligible claims—far fewer than the 19,000 or more predicted by the complaint. Less than half of the compensation fund was distributed to class members, leaving $380 million for payment to third‐​party organizations to advance various programmatic activities.17 Ultimately, the settlement was modified, at the request of class counsel, the government, and an objector to provide claimants with an additional $18,500 (plus taxes) each, irrespective of their individual circumstances; to promptly distribute $38 million to _cy pres_ organizations proposed by class counsel; and to place the remainder—fully $265 million—in a trust to distribute to _cy pres_ organizations over the next 20 years. Unsurprisingly, again no one challenged the _cy pres_ provision—after all, it wasn’t anybody’s money.



On appeal to the D.C. Circuit, an objector argued that the settlement’s _cy pres_ provision violates the Appropriations Clause, because it proposes to expend Treasury funds without a specific appropriation by Congress, and violates the Judgment Fund Act, because _cy pres_ beneficiaries have no right to recover against the United States.18 These arguments, the majority held, were forfeited.



Judge Janice Rogers Brown disagreed, and her dissent merits serious consideration, beginning with her pithy analysis of the political economy of settlements that draw on the Judgment Fund for purposes other than compensation:



 _Cy Pres_ gives the Executive Branch a win‐​win: By agreeing to a settlement amount that vastly overstated the claimants’ monetary damages, the Executive can use a large dollar amount to reap the political benefits of photo‐​op compassion towards a discriminated minority group. At the same time, the Executive’s agreement to an overstated damages sum ensures enough money is left in the fund to pay favored third parties after the claimants are compensated. Class counsel gets a piece of the action too: By agreeing to _cy pres_ distributions, the size of the settlement fund is inflated. The larger the settlement’s size, the larger class counsel’s fee award—regardless of how much of the settlement actually pays injured parties (better known as class counsel’s clients). Even Appellant’s protest of the _cy pres_ scheme is not entirely altruistic. He wants the remaining money distributed to already‐​compensated class members, not returned to the U.S. Treasury. In short, everyone apparently presumed a bloodied‐​shirt party could be thrown at the taxpayer’s expense. Why risk Congress being a killjoy?19



The answer, Judge Brown explained, is the constitutional separation of powers: “If the Government wishes to achieve certain purposes by expending taxpayer money to people with no monetary claims against the United States, a legislative appropriation is required.”20



But, she asked, who is to enforce that requirement? Certainly not the Executive Branch, which was driven by “political calculations” concerning favored constituencies and could take credit for its beneficence in paying compensation to class members and throwing financial support to favored organizations.21 Class counsel, meanwhile, sought a fee award larger than the actual monetary claims of the class could possibly support, making _cy pres_ a convenient means to drive up the total dollar‐​value of the settlement and thereby the fee award.22 And, as for class members, they had no particular claim on funds in excess of those they had already been awarded under the settlement.



Despite these circumstances, Judge Brown continued, the district court and the majority “treat[ed] the parties’ consent as a means to circumvent constitutional limitations on judicial power.”23 She would not, it being clear that the settlement relies on the Executive Branch’s arrogation of Congress’s appropriation power and exceeds the Judgment Fund Act’s narrow authority to settle claims, pay for an agency’s programs.24 The money that remains in the compensation fund, she concluded, should revert to the U.S. Treasury.25



Unfortunately, Judge Brown’s analysis comes to us in dissent. But we may still profit from her wise counsel. Congress, she suggests, “should consider amending the Judgment Fund Act to explicitly bar _cy pres_ distribution schemes in class action settlements with the United States.”26 And it “should also consider authorizing the Comptroller General to review and report to Congress on any class action settlement in excess of $100 million.”27 Absent reforms such as these, it is all too easy to imagine how the Executive Branch could use the Judgment Fund and sham settlements to circumvent just about any congressional restriction on programmatic activities or fund recipients. Judge Brown’s proposals would make fitting additions to the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017, H.R. 732 and S. 333, which addresses the closely related problem of settlements of government claims that require defendants, as opposed to the government itself, to make payments other than compensation or restitution to third parties.



So far as this Subcommittee’s oversight duties are concerned, you deserve an answer to the question of why the Trump Administration is allowing this settlement to proceed. It need not, as Judge Brown correctly explained:



Before the _cy pres_ process begins, the Justice Department should consider a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) to strike the _cy pres_ provisions within the settlement agreement as void. No party has raised a Rule 60(b)(4) challenge in this case, and it is not subject to the finite time constraints restricting other Rule 60(b) motions. _See_ FED. R. CIV. P. 60(c)(1). This course could remove the _cy pres_ provisions before recipients are approved and distributions begin.28



More generally, the Subcommittee should ask whether the Department of Justice believes that settlements directing Judgment Fund monies to cy pres organizations comport with the Appropriations Clause and the Judgment Fund Act and, if so, why. If the Department does not believe it is barred from undertaking such settlements, it should explain to Congress when they are appropriate, how it evaluates such settlements, and why such settlements are in the interest of the federal government and taxpayers. The Subcommittee should also obtain a commitment from the Department that the Department will notify it at least a month in advance of proposing to a court a settlement involving _cy pres_ relief.



 **III. Conclusion**



Collusive settlements that govern the federal government’s future actions or contain cy pres awards raise serious constitutional and policy questions and are too easily abused to circumvent normal political process and evade democratic accountability. Congress can and should address these problems to ensure that settlements are employed only in circumstances where they advance the public interest, as determined by our public institutions, under the requirements of the Constitution.



I thank the Subcommittee for the opportunity to testify on these important issues.

I spent a lot of my childhood camping and hiking around the Otway ranges in the Australian state of Victoria’s south-west. This was one of the main regions devastated by the horrifying Ash Wednesday fires. I well recall the dense pile-up of fuel loads in the years before. The Otways were dotted with bush retreats (baches) surrounded by dense forest practically up to their doorsteps. It was paradisal – and deadly dangerous. All that fuel was bound to go up one day, and it did, in a shocking conflagration that is still one of Australia’s worst fires on record.



Was a similar build-up of fuel loads the cause of the current devastating bushfires in Queensland and NSW? Greens angrily deny it – preferring to blame their favourite bogey, climate change – while many others are convinced that it is. Who’s right and who’s wrong will out, eventually. Meanwhile, **even the pro-environment hippies of Australia’s hippy capital, Nimbin, are lining up against the Greens**.



The greenies have a lot to answer for over the incendiary state of the Australian bush. This is the view of Michael Balderstone, hemp candidate, deep environmentalist and leading figure in the Nimbin community, which is now beset by fire. “They (greenies) own it,” Mr Balderstone said. “The Greens have to cop it on the head, they have been obsessed with no fires and no burning.”



Mr Balderstone says the lessons from indigenous land managers have been forgotten.



Other Nimbin locals are also blaming poor forest management.



Des Layer has for 30 years ridden his horses through hills now being ravaged by fire. For decades he has watched the structure of the bush change from what he says is poor logging and lax management.



Before the area became ­national park, Mr Layer said, he would get permits to collect firewood from the state forests. Since the national park was declared there had been no permits issued.



“It has just been building up,” he said.



It’s a grim irony that the area has long been an epicentre of environmental activism.



A generation of locals, raised on forest protest, are being forced to confront some tough truths about forest fuel loads and management. Communities that have been on the frontline to stop logging and expand national parks are seeking refuge as fire threatens to consume their homes.



Protesters Falls near Terania Creek, the site of Australia’s first environmental blockade in ­August 1979, is surrounded by an out-of-control blaze in the Nightcap National Park. Tuntable Creek community, a free-spirited community that grew from Nimbin’s counter-culture movement of the 1970s, was one of the first settlements to be evacuated.



Michael Crichton argues in _State of Fear_ that “wilderness” often needs to be managed – but when it is, it is usually managed badly. Australian historian Bill Gammage, in his _The Biggest Estate on Earth_ , argues that the Australian landscape was the product of tens of thousands of years of indigenous management – overwhelmingly by fire.



Certainly, the dense bushland which many now regard as “natural” appears to be very far from what greeted the first Europeans to explore Australia. Time and again, explorer’s journals describe the landscape of Australia’s eastern seaboard as “park-like”: open grasslands dotted with widely-spaced trees.



The problem is that modern Australians are still learning how to manage the “natural” landscape. First, indiscriminate logging and later, the opposite extreme of forest protection.



Even among hippies bigger questions are being asked about park management and the extraordinary fuel loads that have been allowed to build up for more than a decade.



Poor logging practices have changed the forest’s ability to cope with fire. First the fire-retardant edges were lost and then the high-value canopy trees. With the big trees gone, the ­humidity of the forest was reduced, the canopy was opened to allow palms to grow and then drop dead fronds into the undergrowth. Extended dry conditions have resulted in a tinderbox of lantana and weeds in an area that has not seen a significant fire for half a century.



Mr Layer believes the solution should have been selective logging but “you can’t trust these people to go in with chainsaws to do it ­sustainably” […] Mr Layer has been taking action for his own property. He has spent winter slashing and cleaning up the property, which has 20 dams. He hopes he’s done enough.



Prior to the disastrous Canberra bushfires of 2003, local green outrage was stoked by an enormous break bulldozed through the surrounding hills. When large swathes of the “bush capital” were ravaged by fire, that break was one of the few places where the fire front was arrested.

Pointman writes: I think we’ve all had that pleasant surprise when something totally unexpected just drops out of the sky and into your lap. That happened to me last weekend when a creature called William Connolley attempted to comment on a piece I’d written about the Bengtsson scandal. If you’re unfamiliar with him, he’s infamous for editing thousands of Wikipedia articles on climate and anyone significant in the area. You can find several articles on his activities over at WUWT. 
His idea of truth is somewhat idiosyncratic to say the least, but let’s just say if you were any way sceptical, you weren’t going to get a glowing entry. When the skeptics tried to correct the foul calumnies for their entry, they were promptly changed back, a loop they went around until he banned them from being able to edit anything.
I’m actually quite knowledgeable about him, since I’ve been a fawning admirer and stroker of his ego for as far back as his days co-founding the joke site called Real Climate with Gavin Schmidt and others of a similar ilk. Needless to say, it’s under one of my dark side Eco-Annie personas. The site is pretty much moribund these days but it did get a sniffy mention in the climategate emails by Phil “hide the decline” Jones, as being there just to disseminate propaganda.
He was never particularly significant in the self-declared pantheon of climate demigods, more like their technical gopher despatched as required to cobble together various bits of HTML for them. In his Wikipedia heyday, he built up a small but dedicated following of fanboys but since Wiki banned him and nobody sane reads his blogging attempts, he’s of late been at a loose end, cruising around the skeptic blogosphere, trolling for all he’s worth and generally leaving a terrible stench behind him.
As it happens, I’ve a personal score to settle with him, and one I never thought I’d get the chance to do but this looked to be a heaven-sent opportunity, if I could just play it right. Picking an appropriate way would undoubtedly come down to making use on his own rather inflated idea of his importance in the general scheme of things climatic, but in just the right way. He’s used to swimming around in a little pond of mutual fishy admirers and as far as I’m aware has never had a good kicking, so I laced up my steel-toed boots and thought about an appropriate bait to fix on the hook.

"**Facebook's Oversight Board is ""opening its doors to business"" in mid-October.**
Users will be able to file appeals against posts the firm has removed from its platforms, and the board can overrule decisions made by Facebook's moderators and executives, including chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.
The timing means that some rulings could relate to the US Presidential election, which is on 3 November.
But one member of the board told the BBC it expected to act slowly at first.
""In principle, we will be able to look at issues arising connected to the election and also after the election,"" Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the former Prime Minister of Denmark, explained.
""But if Facebook takes something down or leaves something up the day after the election, there won't be a ruling the day after.
""That's not why we're here. We're here to take principled decisions and deliberate properly.""
Earlier this week, Facebook's global affairs chief Nick Clegg told the Financial Times that if there was an ""extremely chaotic and, worse still, violent set of circumstances"" following a contested election result, it would act aggressively to ""significantly restrict the circulation of content on our platform"".
In theory, the 20-person panel - which has been likened to the US Supreme Court - could force the firm to reverse some of its judgements.
Ms Thorning-Schmidt said that the board had the capacity to examine ""expedited cases"" but preferred not to do so in its early days.
Facebook first announced its plans to set up the Oversight Board a year ago, and it has taken until now to select its members and arrange how it will work in practice.
The members will be paid an undisclosed sum, but are intended to serve as an independent body, and will decide which cases to look into.
Their work will cover Facebook's main platform as well as the photo-centric app Instagram, which the company owns.
In addition to user complaints, the board can also examine issues that the company has raised itself.
Facebook has said it expects cases to be resolved within 90 days, including any action it is told to take.
The panel's decisions are supposed to be binding and set a precedent for subsequent moderation decisions.
Critics of the scheme have suggested it is a ""fig leaf"" designed to help Facebook avoid being regulated by others.
But Ms Thorning-Schmidt said it was too early to write it off.
""It would be much better if the global community in the UN [United Nations] could come up with a content moderation system that could look into all social media platforms, but that is not going to happen,"" she said.
""So this is the second best.
""Give us two years to try to prove that it is better to have this board than not to have this board.""
The following interview with Ms Thorning-Schmidt has been edited for brevity and clarity:
**Has Facebook already consulted the board about its plans to deal with election-related posts?**
It's very important to keep a distance between the Oversight Board and Facebook. So we don't have much to do with Facebook right now. And they don't consult us on what they should be doing. And we don't think they should consult us.
**And just to be clear - in the days after the election, you might ask for a removed post to be put back up on Facebook or Instagram?**
Yes, it is it is an option. But we are focused on quality rather than speed. Facebook has been criticised for moving fast and breaking things. We want to move slowly and try to create something which is sustainable in the long run. So if Facebook takes down something right after the election, or leaves something up, there won't be a ruling the day after from the Oversight Board.
**In theory, the Oversight Board has the right to overrule Mark Zuckerberg himself. But since he still controls the majority of Facebook's voting shares, isn't there a risk he in turn overrules whatever you decided?**
It was very, very clear to us when we were appointed that we will work with transparency and independence. If Facebook doesn't follow our decisions, it won't last very long. The obligation from Facebook, including, of course Mark Zuckerberg, is to follow our decisions. So that is the red line for us and not up for discussion.
**Presumably that means you'd resign?**
I don't think we should talk about these issues. We want to give this a serious go. I'm urging everyone to look at the Oversight Board and not make the perfect the enemy of the good. This is the best we have these days to try to regulate content on social media. I have not seen any other ways of doing this. And we are all committed to given this giving this a real chance.
**Facebook's not been short of controversies over recent years. There's been Cambridge Analytica, hate speech directed at the Rohingyas in Myanmar, a decision not to take down posts from Holocaust deniers, and a decision to take a less interventionist stance on some of President Trump's posts than Twitter has done. Which of these or other cases do you think might have turned out differently had the Oversight Board already existed?**
I understand that you want to discuss current examples. And I do find that fascinating as well. But I also think it would be wrong for a board member to go into concrete issues because it would pre-empt our decisions later on. There's been some quite horrific examples in the past, and there will probably be more horrific examples in the future. I have no doubt that the board will look into fact-checking and whether there was real harm caused by content that was left up for too long, which they should have taken down.
**Some critics are concerned that this is still a form of self-regulation, and what is needed is external intervention by politicians and official watchdogs.**
I think these big tech firms, social media platforms, need regulation in many areas. There is a need for regulation in terms of tax issues. And there's probably also a need for regulation in terms of data protection and how long you keep data. I've argued very adamantly for a duty of care for Facebook and other social media providers. But the board is not taking the place of regulation. Perhaps rather the opposite. The more rulings and decisions we make, the more it will become clear that we need a better conversation about content, and perhaps also more regulation around content."

"What shapes a river? People typically imagine large-scale processes such as storms and floods or human modifications like dams or fortified banks. But the shape of our rivers today is also a result of the cumulative impact of millions of tiny invertebrates, often small enough that most people don’t even notice them. “Zoogeomorphology” is the study of how animals effect their physical environment, such as by moving sediment or modifying the habitat. The zoogeomorphic effects of larger organisms are easily seen. For example, when a beaver builds a dam it retains water, creating diverse wetlands upstream and sometimes helping to reduce flooding downstream. Fish also alter the river, turning over gravels while feeding and spawning.  The individual impacts of invertebrates are much smaller but, collectively, they can make a big difference. Charles Darwin recognised this as early as 1881 in his snappy-titled “The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits”, and the same is true in rivers. This army of small engineers is changing river environments, and we are part of a research group that is working out exactly how.  Here are three small creatures we already know are having a big impact: Signal crayfish are freshwater crustaceans, similar in shape to lobsters but only about the size of an iPhone. Signal crayfish were introduced to the UK in the 1970s to be farmed for food. But after a series of escapes, the species is now widespread, with no known methods for eradication. Signal crayfish are having detrimental impacts on the ecology of rivers. They feed largely on aquatic plants and native invertebrates, consequently modifying the species of native fauna and flora present. Furthermore, via competition and spreading crayfish plague, signal crayfish are destroying populations of native white-clawed crayfish.  Signal crayfish are also dramatically changing the river environment. In the UK, they burrow into clay banks, causing bank failure, bringing down buildings and infrastructure. For example, the burrowing into earth dams at Prior Park Landscape Gardens in Bath has necessitated repairs costing millions of pounds. Crayfish burrowing also adds vast quantities of clay into the river which clogs gravel-beds and is bad news for fish who like to spawn in gravel. Mussels filter the water they live in, removing sediment and organic detritus. Native freshwater mussels are keystone species, facilitating higher populations of other invertebrates. However, invasive mussels are causing problems.  Zebra mussels, originally from Russia and the Ukraine, are prolific breeders and have now spread across Europe and into the Great Lakes of the US and Canada, where they are blocking pipes and costing American water and electric companies an estimated $17.8m each year.  The zebra mussel was first found in the UK in 1825 but has seen a recent rapid expansion, and lately its larger cousin, the quagga mussel has arrived. These mussels attach themselves to river gravels, native mussels, and each other, creating a dense mesh of mussels. This effectively solidifies the river bed, reducing the quality of the habitat for other animals. Caddisflies are an incredibly diverse group of aquatic insects, with nearly 200 species in the UK alone. Their larvae produce silk, similar to spiders, except it is sticky underwater, and many species use it to construct silk nets much like spider webs. Caddisflies string these nets between stones in order to catch particles of food moving down the river.  These nets also act to tie river gravels together. This results in more stable patches of gravel, reducing erosion and possibly providing a safe refuge for other invertebrates in floods. Caddisfly larvae are smaller than a thumbnail, however they are often found in extremely high numbers with many thousands of individuals per square metre of river bed. This abundance, coupled with their extraordinary use of silk, means they can affect the geomorphology of rivers. In addition to building nets, many species of caddisfly larvae construct “cases” to protect them from predator fish, both as larvae and when pupating (transforming into flies). To build these cases, larvae use silk to stick together everything from gravel to very fine sand and bits of plants. By transporting this sand around the river bed, tiny caddisflies may impact much larger physical processes, such as the transport of sand downstream. Aquatic invertebrates, such as the three considered above, may be small but they can shape the landscape around them. We need to better understand these zoogeomorphic effects because without them we cannot predict how rivers will change over time, including in response to climate change.  In the case of invasive creatures such as signal crayfish and zebra mussels, it is important to prevent their spread not only to protect native species, but to prevent the invaders changing their habitat for the worse. However, native species may be key to the restoration of rivers."

“I have the absolute right to PARDON myself,” President Donald Trump announced via Twitter in June 2018. With that, he pitched a can of Sterno into the ongoing media firestorm over the special counsel’s Russia investigation.



The last time a president contemplated a self‐​pardon was during the “final days” of Watergate. Nixon wasn’t entirely in his right mind during this period: frequently drunk, possibly suicidal, incoherent, pacing the halls at night “talking to pictures of former presidents,” according to his son‐​in‐​law. Still, even at his worst moment, Nixon had enough wits about him to know that trying to pardon himself would be crazy.



Trump seems to have arrived at a similar conclusion. His claims about his right to undermine the rule of law are frequent and contemptible. Yet as far as we can tell, they have mostly been rhetorical.



In the run‐​up to the 2018 midterms, for instance, the president threatened to issue an executive order revoking birthright citizenship—a move that would have flouted the plain language and legislative history of the 14th Amendment while putting more than 4 million Americans at risk of deportation. But this too seems to have been a pump fake designed to thrill the base and rile the media; it was abandoned after Election Day.



It’s become a familiar pattern. Trump hits “send tweet” on some crank theory of absolute executive power. Law professors and pundits cancel their weekend plans, scrambling to figure out “Can he do that?”—only to realize, weeks later, that they needn’t have taken him literally _or_ seriously.



No president in living memory has been nearly as vocal about his contempt for the legal limits on his power; none has threatened half as often to throw them off. But again and again, Trump stares across the Rubicon, shrugs, and then heads back inside to live‐​tweet Fox News.





Donald Trump’s rhetoric is breathtakingly authoritarian, but so far he’s done less than his predecessors to expand executive power.



In the first hour of this presidency, just after Trump delivered his “American Carnage” inaugural address, George W. Bush supposedly remarked, “That was some weird shit.” At this point, we can quibble only with W’s use of the past tense: The current president’s behavior has been so weird and unsettling that it’s hard to get perspective on how bad we’ve got it. Trump’s tweets, his insult‐​comic pep rallies, his general inability to act like a grown‐​up in a grown-up’s job—everything about the 45th president distracts us from a clear‐​eyed evaluation of what he’s actually _done_ with the enormous powers he inherited.



Case in point: In January, _The Atlantic_ marked the midpoint of Trump’s tenure with “50 Moments That Define an Improbable Presidency,” ranked “according to both their outlandishness and their importance.” The former dominate the latter. By my count, 28 of the entries relate to Trump’s freakish and often repugnant public conduct: using social media to share the wisdom of Benito Mussolini, referring to “shithole countries,” firing his secretary of state via Twitter, and the like. Perhaps 10 of the 50 episodes feature the president misusing the powers of the office. “Trump threatens to press his ‘nuclear button’ ” clocks in at number 17 on the parade of horribles—eight places behind his May 2017 tweet‐​burp, “covfefe.”



But unsettling and repellent as Trump’s behavior is, how he wields power has to matter more than what he rants about. It’s entirely possible that Donald J. Trump is a terrible human being without a redeeming liberal impulse _and_ not nearly as imperial a president as his two immediate predecessors. (Or at least not yet.)



In fact, a close examination of Trump’s policies suggests that what we’ve got so far is the Xtreme Energy Drink version of what’s been on tap for a long time. Like Four Loko, it clouds your vision, sours your stomach, and wrecks your head, but it may not be as lethal as the alarmists claim. In his first two years, Trump has aggressively exploited the powers he inherited, but—with very few exceptions—he hasn’t really forged new frontiers in the expansion of executive power.



 **Bloody Business as Usual**



Abroad, the executive’s powers are at their apex. During President Barack Obama’s final year in office, U.S. forces dropped more than 26,000 bombs on seven different countries. Nine months into his tenure, Trump had already blown past that tally. In 2017, he tripled the number of drone strikes Obama had ordered on Yemen the year before. In Somalia, he launched more than Obama had managed over two terms. In his first year, the self‐​styled “America First” president deepened entanglements on every foreign battlefield his predecessor left him, ramping up deployments, kill‐​or‐​capture missions, and civilian casualties.



But none of that required new claims of presidential power. Well before Trump took office, permanent war had become America’s default setting, thanks in large part to the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) that Congress passed three days after September 11.



Initially aimed at the perpetrators of the attacks and those who “harbored” or “aided” them, the AUMF by 2016 had been stretched by creative lawyering far enough to cover everything from boots on the ground in Tongo Tongo to drones over Timbuktu. Trump took that expanded authority and used it as legal justification for “bomb[ing] the shit out of” ISIS and other jihadist groups. But the real inflection point, quantitatively and qualitatively, happened under his predecessor. Trump’s escalation of the war on terror may rest on shaky legal ground, but it’s not territory the 45th president seized.



There’s one area where Trump has ventured further than Obama: his annual spring bombing of the Bashar al‐​Assad regime in Syria. In April 2017 and again in April 2018, Trump ordered airstrikes on Syrian government assets in response to chemical weapons attacks attributed to the Assad regime.



The Trump administration couldn’t credibly rely on the 2001 AUMF as legal justification for its drive‐​by missile strikes. Having already been used, tenuously, to cover ISIS, a group excommunicated by and at war with Al Qaeda, the AUMF couldn’t also serve to underwrite military action against Assad, who’s at war with both.



Instead, the president invoked his Article II powers as commander in chief and chief executive. A May 2018 memorandum from the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC)—“the president’s law firm” and an ever‐​reliable font of constitutional rationalizations—lays out the theory: “the President could lawfully direct [the airstrikes] because he had reasonably determined that the use of force would be in the national interest and that the anticipated hostilities would not rise to the level of a war in the constitutional sense.”



In other words, if the president thinks it’s a good idea—and assures himself we won’t get bogged down in a wider conflict—he can order up a light dusting of cruise missiles. “Not every military operation,” OLC insists, “rises to the level of a war.” Bombing raids are a _microaggression_ , constitutionally speaking.



That is, of course, an extraordinarily broad interpretation of the president’s war powers, which the Framers understood to cover repelling sudden attacks, not launching them. But it’s nothing new. The Trump OLC opinion relies heavily on two Obama‐​era opinions, one written to support the war in Libya and another drafted when his administration was contemplating “humanitarian” intervention in Syria. And broad as the Trump/​Obama theory is, it falls well short of the absolutist notions that prevailed in the George W. Bush OLC, which held categorically that decisions about the use of military force “are for the President alone to make.”



 **Powers There for the Taking**



Indeed, very few of Trump’s most controversial initiatives have smashed the Overton window on executive discretion. His administration’s cruelest policies—separating children from their parents at the border, aiding Saudi Arabia’s murderous war in Yemen—didn’t require a novel gloss on presidential authority. The powers were already in the White House’s arsenal. “Zero tolerance” at the border was a (brutal) exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and it was Obama who first ordered aerial refueling and other assistance to a Saudi bombing campaign that has hit weddings, school buses, and hospitals, causing massive civilian casualties.



The administration’s various attempts to impose a travel ban ran into stiff judicial resistance, thanks in large part to Trump’s repeatedly calling it a “Muslim ban” and practically daring the courts to strike it down. (As was said of gangster matriarch Livia Soprano, “Between brain and mouth, there is no interlocutor.”) Even so, the Supreme Court upheld a revised version of the order last summer, with Chief Justice John Roberts noting that the relevant statute “exudes deference to the President in every clause.”



There’s ample ground for disputing the Court’s decision, but the case law supporting that deference long predated the Trump presidency. As the Cato Institute immigration scholar David Bier puts it, “It’s difficult to do a genuine executive power grab in an area where SCOTUS and Congress have ceded this much power to the president.”



When it comes to _trade_ wars, Trump is demonstrably more bellicose than his immediate predecessors: Such face‐​offs are “good and easy to win,” he tweeted last spring. Three days after his inauguration, he announced his decision to withdraw from the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade agreement with 11 Asia‐​Pacific nations that hadn’t yet been submitted to Congress. In March 2018, he invoked his statutory powers under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to hike tariffs on a host of Chinese products, sparking a series of tit‐​for‐​tat countermeasures that now affects some $360 billion in U.S.-China trade.



Trump’s authority to make these moves was hardly disputed. The modern U.S. trade regime delegates enormous power to the chief executive on the theory that, as the representative of a national constituency, he’s more insulated from parochial interests than members of Congress and therefore a better steward of open markets. That theory met the ultimate test starting in January 2017.



The president didn’t need to push the envelope on executive authority to penalize China or cancel the TPP. There is one front of the trade war, however, where Trump managed a significant executive power grab: his March 2018 imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs on national security grounds.



Trump is far from the first chief executive to jack up tariffs for naked political purposes. In 2002, George W. Bush imposed duties of up to 30 percent on imported steel, a move that his trade representative admitted was made to “manage political support for free trade at home.” But the legal authority Bush invoked wasn’t novel: The “safeguard” provision of the ’74 Trade Act had been used some 28 times before to protect domestic producers from import surges—of motorcycles and steel under Ronald Reagan, for example, and of wheat gluten and lamb meat under Bill Clinton.



Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs mined a different, and potentially much vaster, delegation of congressional power. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the president to “adjust imports” upon a finding by the commerce secretary that current levels threaten “national security.”



Prior uses of the national security clause—embargoes on crude oil from Iran in 1979 and Libya in 1982—had at least some plausible relationship to defense policy. In Trump’s case, the national security rationale was a transparent pretext. A memo then–Secretary of Defense James Mattis released after Trump’s announcement notes that military demand for the two metals represents just 3 percent of U.S. production and that foreign competition would not “impact the ability of [Defense Department] programs to acquire the steel or aluminum necessary to meet national defense requirements.”



In a challenge to the law brought by steel importers, a Justice Department attorney wouldn’t give a clear “no” to the question of whether, under the statute, a president “worried about jobs in the peanut butter industry” could “make a national security connection” and order an embargo on imports of the sandwich ingredient. That may sound absurd, but it’s probably a mistake to give this president any new ideas. He was apoplectic when Nabisco moved Oreo production to Mexico in 2015. Could Double Stuf imports be the next national security threat?



 **A Bogus National Emergency**



Trump’s use of the national security clause to impose steel and aluminum tariffs was the first time he added a new weapon to the executive arsenal. The second time involved his single‐​minded desire to build a wall along the border with Mexico.



In late 2018, the president forced a partial government shutdown by refusing to sign any spending bill that didn’t include $5.7 billion for the barrier. At the same time, he began threatening to use emergency powers to fund it anyway. On February 15, he made good on that threat with a formal proclamation “Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States.”



The first paragraph of that proclamation concedes that “the problem of large‐​scale unlawful migration through the southern border is long‐​standing.” Just before he signed the paperwork, Trump further undercut the “crisis” claim by admitting, “I didn’t need to do this. But I’d rather do it much faster.”



A president triggering emergency authorities isn’t unusual, unfortunately. There are more than 30 national emergency declarations in effect right now, dating as far back as the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. What’s new here is the bogus invocation of an “emergency” to fund a pet project Congress had repeatedly refused to support. It’s a militarized version of the “trillion‐​dollar coin” gimmick that Obama apparently contemplated, but never used, when the GOP in 2011 resisted raising the federal debt limit—an extralegal tactic better suited to a banana republic than a government of laws.



And it could set a damaging precedent. In 1952, Justice Robert Jackson wrote that the Framers feared that “emergency powers would tend to kindle emergencies,” which was why they rejected any general grant of such power to the executive. But what the Framers withheld Congress has fecklessly ceded, via myriad laws passed over decades. A Brennan Center report released last December identifies 123 statutory powers the president can invoke in a self‐​declared national emergency, including the power to test chemical or biological weapons on human subjects or to take over “any facility or station for wire communications” if he proclaims that a threat of war exists.



Shortly after Trump’s emergency announcement, Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) weighed in on Twitter: “Gun violence is an emergency. Climate change is an emergency.…Donald Trump’s ridiculous wall is not an emergency.” She’s right about the last bit, but it sure sounds as if Trump’s gambit has inspired her to start envisioning emergency proclamations yet to come.



 **What About _Whataboutism_?**



Trump’s exploitation of national security and national emergency authorities in trade and immigration is cynical, lawless, and potentially dangerous. But the current president is standing on the shoulders of tyrants. Next to the executive power grabs of his two immediate predecessors, those innovations look like pretty small beer.



Declaring a national emergency might let Trump get away with shifting several billion dollars toward a Potemkin barrier on the southern border. But in 2011, Barack Obama managed to find enough loose change in the Pentagon budget to bomb Libya for seven months without any specific appropriations, let alone authorization, from Congress. As dubious as Trump’s legal claim is, it doesn’t require torturing the relevant statute nearly as much as Obama tortured the 2001 AUMF to wage war against ISIS—or as much as George W. Bush tortured U.S. law to justify _actual torture_.



Among other enormities, Bush implemented a host of secret dragnet surveillance programs and, in his last month in office, unilaterally ordered a multibillion‐​dollar auto bailout just days after Congress voted the move down.



Obama, who had pledged to “turn the page on the imperial presidency,” launched two undeclared wars—in Libya and against ISIS—and defied the limits imposed by the 1973 War Powers Resolution on the novel theory that you’re not engaged in “hostilities” if the foreigners you’re bombing can’t hit you back. At home, he used the powers of “the pen and the phone” to unilaterally rewrite federal immigration law and his own Affordable Care Act.



It’s true: Trump talks like a caricature of a homicidal despot. At various times he’s threatened to order the military to commit war crimes, bring back torture, “take out” terrorists’ families, and “take the oil” from countries where we’re at war. President Bush actually seized an American citizen on American soil and claimed the power to hold him as an “enemy combatant” in a military prison for the duration of the war on terror. And President Obama claimed, and exercised, the power to order drone strikes on Americans abroad. But because you could take Bush and Obama out in polite company and they’d sound the right notes about democracy and human rights, they were able to get away with far greater abuses than Trump has yet attempted.



It’s at this point that such comparisons usually draw a charge of “whataboutism,” a scurrilous debater’s dodge that’s become increasingly common in the Trump era. The _Oxford English Dictionary_ , which added the word to the lexicon in 2018 on the strength of “a spike in use in relation to US politics in the past year,” defines _whataboutism_ as the “practice of responding to an accusation or difficult question by making a counter‐​accusation or raising a different issue.” That’s a tactic Trump himself has perfected, as when he rails against the special counsel investigation by demanding to know why no one’s “looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?”



Still, whether a given comparison constitutes _whataboutism_ depends on what you’re on about. If the aim is to defend your side by pointing to the other team’s sins, it’s a logical fallacy. But what’s at issue here is how much Trump has pushed the envelope on executive power, a question that cannot be answered without reference to those who pushed before. Lately, all too often, the “whataboutism” charge has itself become a diversionary tactic—an excuse for pretending that the history of presidential transgressions began on January 20, 2017.



 **The Abuses That Haven’t Happened (Yet)**



“So far, Trump has used his powers less aggressively than most modern presidents,” University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner observed last year in _The Washington Post_. Indeed, what’s striking is how many of Trump’s truly awful, imperial notions turn out to be crazy‐​uncle‐​shouting‐​at‐​the‐​TV bluster that never gets a tangible follow‐​through.



Granted, some of those outbursts are genuinely terrifying. During his first year in office, Trump seemed determined to confirm the worst fears about his presidency, casually threatening to rain thermonuclear “fire and fury” on North Korea and tweeting playground insults at the hermit kingdom’s paranoid dictator. But by mid‐​2018, the mercurial Trump and “Little Rocket Man” had embarked on a bizarre bromance as odd as—if less frightening than—their first‐​year Twitter war. Lately, Trump’s hawkish would‐​be handlers mainly worry the president “will be overly enthusiastic about engagement with wily adversaries,” as _The New York Times_ put it. Last December, when Trump announced a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, anonymous Defense Department officials and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D–Calif.) accused him of playing “wag the dog” by trying to _wind down_ a war. Apparently, the major risk with an unstable president is that we might pratfall into peace.



Trump’s attitude toward federal law enforcement is nearly as unsettling as his sporadic saber rattling. The president has made it all too clear that he’d like to run the Department of Justice like a closely held business. He thinks his attorney general should have his back the way Bobby had JFK’s, and he insists he has “an absolute right to do what I want with the Justice Department.”



Unlike past presidents who seized new substantive powers in the midst of economic or foreign policy crises, _The_ _Atlantic_ ’s David Graham argues, “Trump seems to be pushing against the limits of his presidential power almost entirely to protect himself.” Yet the material attempts the president has made toward that end have mainly been within his constitutional authority.



They’ve also tended to be comically self‐​defeating. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon rightly called the May 2017 firing of FBI director James Comey one of the biggest mistakes in modern political history. That own goal may have weighed on Trump’s mind in June 2017, when he very nearly removed Special Counsel Robert Mueller but then backed off when his White House counsel threatened to quit.



What’s stopping Trump from going further to blow up executive constraints? Posner’s _Post_ piece offers three hypotheses. First, that the president is “a blowhard” who talks tough but shrinks from fights he might not win. Second, that it’s all part of a sinister plan in which he steadily undermines the legitimacy of the courts and the media until he’s ready to strike. Or third, that he has concluded his base is credulous enough to back him so long as he _looks_ like he’s fighting, whether or not he actually gets anything done.



Of these, the second explanation, which has Trump laying the “groundwork for an attack on our institutions at a politically opportune moment,” is the least plausible. Such a scheme would require a healthy attention span and a modicum of self‐​restraint, neither of which this president has demonstrated so far. Being an effective autocrat is hard work.



The national emergency declaration that generated so much outcry fits perfectly into the staged‐​drama, reality‐​TV theory of the Trump presidency. It may be years, if ever, before a single “artistically designed steel slat” is implanted under its authority. But the president may not care. The “emergency” gambit gave him a way out of the corner he’d painted himself into. And when the courts get in his way, he can rant about “so‐​called judges” making us less safe.



Trump’s lack of impulse control and self-discipline—his tendency to say the quiet parts out loud—have helped generate significant pushback, even #Resistance, within the courts and the federal bureaucracy. Our political system remains surprisingly resistant to one‐​man rule. There’s a lot of ruin in a republic, it seems.



 **Past Performance and Future Results**



Most presidents strive to leave the presidency stronger than they found it. Most of them succeed. A year ago, I thought it was a safe bet Trump would continue that trend. Yet so far, he looks poised to be the first commander in chief since Jimmy Carter who won’t.



It would be foolish to conclude that we needn’t worry about Trump’s authoritarian temperament. He already holds the most powerful office in the world, and he regularly fantasizes about abusing that power to an audience of 58 million followers on a Twitter feed that sounds like a live broadcast of the Watergate Tapes. In government, as in investing, past performance is no guarantee of future results. The chances that Trump will be able to successfully act on one of his lawless impulses are far higher than the prospect that he’ll suddenly turn “so presidential” we’ll be bored, as he promised on _The Today Show_ before his election. And nothing in the law or history of constitutional impeachment requires Congress to wait until after the damage has already been done before it opens an inquiry.



When we consider how many of this president’s abuses, attempted or accomplished, were based on powers his predecessors had already seized, we should consider ourselves lucky things haven’t gone worse. And we should set about reimposing limits on the office’s powers before a _competent_ authoritarian comes along.

In February 2012, General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, explained, “I can’t impress upon you that in my personal military judgment, formed over 38 years, we are living in the most dangerous time in my lifetime, right now.” He was born in 1952. In 2013, he upped the ante: “I will personally attest to the fact that [the world is] more dangerous than it has ever been.”

For much of its history, the United States has not faced serious security threats from nation‐​states. Its expansive ocean moats and weak neighbors simplified its security problem even before it became a great power; geographic distance and European distraction often protected what power alone could not. After the end of the Civil War, America added to those assets political unity and economic might. With few exceptions, the United States has been free from the worst sorts of external dangers. It took a freak accident of world historical scale—the military collapse of French armies in May 1940—to create a serious geopolitical threat to the United States. The efforts to meet Hitler’s threat set the stage for Stalin’s, because five years of war destroyed the industrial world and put the Red Army in the heart of Europe. In short, for a few decades following 1940, the United States arguably did face a legitimate external threat: the possibility that the resources of the industrial world could be politically united and turned against the Western Hemisphere. Those conditions have long since disappeared; yet their intellectual influence lives on in contemporary American grand strategy.

If both the United States and the scholars and policy analysts within it have been turning more of their attention lately to substate threats, it is not because of an increase in the threats themselves. It is because of other influences on American sensibilities about challenges the United States faces outside its borders. The notion of substate threats constituting a new challenge is rooted in a broader proclivity of Americans—denizens of a new world of their own making—to focus on what is new and to be quicker than other people to perceive newness.1 The idea that substate disorder overseas threatens U.S. interests is rooted in the tendency of Americans—at least for the past century, and notwithstanding the earlier contrary assertion by John Quincy Adams—to go abroad in search of monsters to destroy. Or at least, if not actually going abroad to destroy monsters, the tendency is to perceive monsters worthy of destruction and to conceive of America’s place in the world largely as one of confrontation against them.

Among the many types of threats that Americans worry about today, cyberattacks rank near the top. In March 2013, James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, named cyberattacks — with the potential for states or nonstate actors to manipulate U.S. computer systems and thereby corrupt, disrupt, or destroy critical infrastructure — as the greatest short‐​term threat to U.S. national security. Earlier in the year, the head of Homeland Security announced that she believes a “cyber 9/11” could happen “imminently.“ The year before, Robert Mueller, then director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, mused that the cyberthreat might replace the terrorist threat as the nation’s top security priority. A year before that, Admiral Michael Mullen, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was quoted as saying, “I really believe cyber is one of two existential threats that are out there, the other being nuclear weapons.“ The fear was extant outside the Beltway as well; a survey of security professionals (admittedly, a self‐​interested source) found that “79 percent believe that there will be [in 2013] some sort of large‐​scale attack on the information technology powering some element of the United States’s infrastructure — and utilities and financial institutions were the most likely targets.“

One might think that American society would welcome the news that this is, by all reasonable historical standards, a golden age of peace and security. The great powers seem to have given up fighting one another, the lesser powers rarely go to war either, and levels of internal conflict (civil wars, ethnic conflicts, coups, and major violations of human rights) are at all‐​time lows. Terrorism may be the largest security challenge faced by the industrialized world, but it is not on the increase, and it poses less danger for the average American than does a bath. The pace of nuclear proliferation has slowed to a crawl, if not yet a complete stop. Perhaps most of all, states — no matter how mismanaged, corrupt, or weak — never disappear, because conquest appears to be dead. Despite what they may hear from their leaders, and no matter what the various underinformed pundits say, the actual empirical evidence suggests that the American people are safe, at least when compared with any who have come before.

If climate projections are correct, a changing climate has the potential to cause sea levels to rise, floods, more intense storms and hurricanes, droughts, and other climate extremes. Such climate change would affect every nation, and populations in developing countries would be hit hardest. In the worst case, it would lead to energy and food scarcity, increase the spread of disease, cause mass migration of “climate refugees,” and weaken fragile governments.

In Elizabethan theater, “alarums and excursions” was a stage direction calling for actors to rush about the stage in a chaotic clamor suggestive of battle.1 In American politics, threat inflation has a similarly theatrical role: it tries to confuse and excite an audience to win its support for some policy, often military excursions of some sort. This chapter explains why U.S. defense politics is especially prone to such behavior—why, that is, U.S. leaders serially exaggerate the nation’s vulnerability to national security threats.

Alarmism about nuclear weapons is common coin in the foreign policy establishment. During the course of the Cold War, for example, the chief concern was that the weapons would somehow go off, by accident or by intention, devastating the planet in the process.

A growing literature defines security in relation to the individual. Instead of focusing on a state’s external threats, scholars of “human security” focus on a broader set of threats. This approach includes threats — such as poverty and pollution — to individuals within states. Scholars of human security began to take that approach at the end of the Cold War as state‐​to‐​state warfare seemed less relevant. Those scholars do not dismiss the importance of a state’s ability to defend itself. Rather, they tend to argue that without human security, there can be little traditional state security and vice versa, and some conclude that threats to U.S. human security are increasing. This chapter concludes otherwise: the United States is secure in both the traditional sense and with respect to human security.

Nuclear weapons have been used twice, both times by the United States within the same week nearly 70 years ago. Since August 1945, even more destructive weapons—thermonuclear bombs and warheads— have been developed, and all manner of new delivery systems have been devised. Eight additional states have built the bomb, and many others have the capacity to do so. All the while, the world has witnessed innumerable geopolitical crises, international turmoil, and even war involving nuclear‐​armed states.

"**Facebook has deleted a large group dedicated to sharing and discussing QAnon conspiracy theories.**
QAnon is a wide-ranging, unfounded conspiracy theory that a ""deep state"" network of powerful government, business and media figures are waging a secret war against Donald Trump.
A Facebook spokeswoman said the group was removed for ""repeatedly posting content that violated our policies"".
Last month both Twitter and TikTok also cracked down on QAnon content.
Twitter banned thousands of accounts and said it would block QAnon urls, while TikTok deleted hashtags that signposted QAnon videos.
The deleted Facebook group, called Official Q/Qanon, had nearly 200,000 members.
There are, however, many other QAnon groups that are currently still active on the platform.
QAnon followers are mainly supporters of the US president.
Reuters reports that Official Q/QAnon ""crossed the line"" on bullying, harassment, hate speech and the sharing of potentially harmful misinformation.
The FBI last year issued a warning about ""conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists"" and designated QAnon a potential domestic extremist threat.
**By Shayan Sardarizadeh and Jack Goodman** **,** **BBC anti-disinformation team**
QAnon is a wide-ranging, unfounded conspiracy theory that President Trump is having to fight against a clandestine ""deep state"" network of political, business, media and entertainment elites, often involving satanic plots and child trafficking.
QAnon began in October 2017 on the anonymous message board 4chan. A user claimed to have top-security clearance within the US government and signed off their posts anonymously as ""Q"" - hence the name QAnon. Q communicates in cryptic posts and claims to be involved directly in a secret Trump-led investigation of a global network of child abusers.
QAnon followed on from the ""pizzagate"" saga in 2016 - a fake theory about Democratic Party politicians running a paedophile ring out of a Washington pizza restaurant.
QAnon influencers have big audiences on social media. They urge followers to ""do their own research"" - in other words, watch YouTube videos and talk to other supporters - to solve Q's puzzles. In its nearly three years of existence, the conspiracy has drawn huge traffic on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Reddit, attracting hundreds of thousands of dedicated followers. This includes celebrities and dozens of candidates running for Congress this year.
During the coronavirus pandemic, Q influencers have spread unfounded theories about coronavirus, calling it a ""deep state"" hoax and have promoted misinformation about face masks and vaccines."
"**The Trump campaign on Monday ran a series of attack ads against Joe Biden.**
One accused the Democrats of ""blatant corruption"".
Another said: ""Sleepy Joe allowed his campaign to be taken over by the EXTREME RADICAL LEFT"".
Biden's team has been removing attack ads since Mr Trump went into hospital.
The Democrats don't want to be seen running personal attacks on a sick President.
But this is not a ceasefire. Trump's team has continued to run attack ads.
One Facebook advert released on Monday said that Biden would ""stand by"" and let mobs ""cause absolute mayhem"".
Another which ran on Sunday accused Joe Biden of making it ""difficult for black people"".
Another appeared to mock technical difficulties during a Biden live streaming event.
This is despite the Trump campaign on Saturday criticising the Biden campaign for not taking down the attack ads quicker.
""Despite pledging to stop his negative advertising, nearly 100 negative Biden ads slandering the president and lying about his record have aired today while the president is at Walter Reed,"" a Trump spokesman told Fox News on Saturday.
Biden's team responded by saying it was difficult to remove some of the ads immediately.
Almost all of Biden's Facebook ads live right now are related to getting out the vote.
Some of the attack ads were paid for by the ""Trump Make America Great Again Committee"" which is run by both the Republican National Committee and his campaign.
Others were paid for by ""Donald J Trump for President, Inc"".
The refusal to stop running attack ads puts the Democrats in a difficult position.
The Biden campaign national press secretary has already said it is ""inappropriate to use the president's illness to score political points"".
But Trump may well have symptoms of the illness for days - potentially even weeks - to come.
And with the election just four weeks away, that could tie Biden's hands - forcing him to subdue his attacks on Facebook.
Republican analysts believe Trump's use of targeted negative ads on Facebook helped the campaign in 2016."

"The homes of wealthy Americans are major engines of the climate crisis, research has found, with the United States’ most affluent suburbs generating as much as 15 times the greenhouse gas emissions as nearby, poorer districts. An analysis of 93m homes in the contiguous US found that the most energy intensive dwellings, per square foot, are found in Maine, Vermont and Wisconsin, while the least energy intensive are located in Florida, Arizona and California.  Mainly due to the larger size of homes owned by the wealthy, richer Americans are generating roughly 25% more greenhouse gasses through lighting, heating and cooling their residences than poorer people. This disparity has significant implications for the climate crisis: about a fifth of US emissions comes from residential power use. Americans are particularly voracious users of energy, with the typical person in the US using more than 30 times the amount of electricity at home than the average person in India. “Although houses are becoming more energy efficient, US household energy use and related greenhouse gas emissions are not shrinking, and this lack of progress undermines the substantial emissions reductions needed to mitigate climate change,” said Benjamin Goldstein, a University of Michigan researcher who led the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.While emissions generated in homes would plummet if the power grid switched entirely away from fossil fuels towards renewables such as solar and wind, the researchers point out that more far-reaching changes would need to occur to help avoid disastrous impacts from the climate crisis. This includes energy efficient retrofits and a shift towards smaller, more densely packed homes. A climate plan released last week by Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, includes a proposal to upgrade 4m buildings and weatherize 2m homes to increase energy efficiency, although it’s not clear, even if elected, whether Biden would get congressional support for the overall $2tn climate package. Wealth is not the only demographic divider in the causes of climate change in the US – previous research has shown white people disproportionally affect the environment by eating more foods that are produced with large amounts of water and planet-warming gases, such as milk and beef. Despite this impact, white people are, on average, less likely than people of color to be subjected to the consequences of burning fuels for energy. A study last year found that Black and Latino people are far more likely to breathe in more air pollution, such as airborne soot, than they produce through their own activities."
"It’s official – in 100 days the United States will formally withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. The impact of Donald Trump’s decision, taken three years ago, is already being felt by environmental justice communities. Racism is the driving force behind why certain people and places face disproportionate environmental exposure to toxic substances, adverse climate change effects, Covid-19 infections and deaths. This raises the question: was withdrawing from the Paris agreement also a racist decision? How will this morally incomprehensible policy change affect Black, Latinx, Indigenous and other communities of color? The United States will join a tiny proportion of the world’s countries that reject, or have failed to ratify, the Paris agreement. Its overarching purpose is to reduce global warming emissions and thus keep the global average temperature rise to well below 2C and as close to 1.5Cs as possible – levels that aim to avoid some of the worst climate change impacts. After the US withdrawal was announced, I participated on a group call to identify spokespeople knowledgable on the economic consequences of the US withdrawal. No one mentioned the impact on people, particularly people of color. I pointed out this oversight again on the call with the reporter but quickly realized they weren’t interested. But I am. The ramifications of the Paris agreement withdrawal on vulnerable populations is at the heart of the matter. Nobody in the Trump administration asked communities what withdrawing from the Paris agreement would mean for their futures. For one thing, US withdrawal could mean premature death for millions of people living in environmental justice communities. The Environmental Protection Agency found that transportation, energy use and industry contribute most significantly to production of heat-trapping emissions. And it’s people of color and Indigenous communities that are disproportionately affected by this environmental pollution. According to a 2018 Quartz article by Bartees Cox, communications director at Groundswell, black people are more likely than white people to live near landfills and industrial plants. Additionally, more than half of the 9 million people currently living near hazardous waste sites are people of color. A New England Journal of Medicine study found that black people are three times more likely to die from exposure to air pollutants than white people. And yet, the Trump administration moved forward with their decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement. The good news is that, despite this administration’s refusal to join worldwide efforts to reduce global warming emissions, there is still climate action occurring in the United States. According to the United Nations Foundation, at least 24 states and Puerto Rico have joined the US Climate Alliance, an organization focused on supporting and realizing the Paris agreement mission. Currently, US Climate Alliance membership represents 55% of the US population, 40% of US heat-trapping emissions, and an $11.7tn economy – enough to make it the third-largest economy in the world if it were a country. In addition, according to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, some states, local governments and private-sector businesses have voluntarily pledged to reduce emissions in line with the goals outlined in the agreement. The bad news is that current pledges aren’t enough to reduce emissions in line with the goals of the Paris agreement. There is also not enough being done to create communities that are resilient in the face of unavoidable climate change impacts. Currently, because of the climate crisis, we continue to see growing global warming emissions, rising sea levels, chronic flooding, extreme heat, intense drought, worsening wildfires and hurricanes, devastating food shortages and other negative impacts that affect environmental justice communities around the world first and worst. If we fail to stay within the parameters set in the Paris agreement, severe climatic events like these will only get worse. People are losing their homes, their jobs and most importantly their lives. Not everyone can afford to pay higher electric bills when temperatures soar. The novel coronavirus pandemic has also made access to cooling centers during a heatwave or evacuation centers during a hurricane even more challenging. Not everyone has equal access to quality healthcare, something the pandemic has laid bare in the way Covid-19 patients are treated (or not). In addition, studies have recently emerged about the possible connection between particulate matter and Covid-19. So, ask yourself: if the first group of people in the US to truly benefit from efforts to decrease global warming emissions by participating in the Paris agreement are people of color, what else can we call this but environmental racism and willful neglect?"

 _Has the spread of capitalism been a net positive or a net negative for women around the world? To examine this important and increasingly contested question, Cato hosted a debate in September between Veronique de Rugy, senior fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, and Nicole Aschoff, author and editorial board member at the socialist magazine_ Jacobin _._



 **Nicole Aschoff** : The question of whether capitalism is good for women is one that both feminists and nonfeminists have debated for a long time, but each upsurge of interest in the question is embedded in a particular context. So what are the conditions of the present moment that encourage an exercise such as this? For one thing, capitalism is in crisis, albeit not necessarily an economic crisis in the sense of a full‐​blown recession. But we have seen more than a decade of stimulus that includes a multi‐​trillion‐​dollar bailout by central banks, years of quantitative easing, and a new normal of government‐​engineered low interest rates to keep investors from collectively hurling themselves off a cliff.



Despite these inducements, wages and economic growth are stagnant and companies seem more interested in rolling the dice on the stock market than brick‐​and‐​mortar investment. Moreover, neoliberal capitalism — the norms, ideas, and policies that undergird the status quo of the past four decades — is experiencing a deep crisis of legitimacy. There is a widespread loss of trust in government, a waning faith in capitalism, and a resurgence of populism on both the left and the right.



A second point of reference for our discussion here tonight is the resurgence of feminism in the past decade, both in the United States and globally. This resurgence has taken a variety of forms and has encompassed a range of perspectives on how best to pursue a feminist program, but it is a persistent feature of public discourse. Most recently we have seen this in the #MeToo movement.



The idea that feminist goals can be best achieved by each woman striving to reach a position of power and success within capitalism is increasingly in doubt. As we see more and more, women, particularly younger women, are calling for a different kind of feminism that often has strong anti‐​capitalist themes. Now is the time to both assess hard‐​won victories and strategize about how to make it possible for all women to actually enjoy them, and to push forward with new concrete demands that fulfill the broad aims of feminism.



So, the first question: Has the spread of capitalism been a net positive or a net negative for women? This is a great question, but it’s also a very difficult question to answer, not least because I find it somewhat odd to formulate an equation of human costs that spans centuries of capitalism. Do more recent improvements in life expectancy, literacy, and women’s autonomy outweigh the mass slaughter of indigenous women and children, the desperate lives of women trapped and tortured in chattel slavery, the disfigurement and early deaths of women who spent their life toiling in sweatshops, their bodies destroyed by factory work? A difficult calculation to be sure. But if we were to attempt it, we would certainly have to temper the sunny claims of global capitalism’s recent successes with the stark reality that more than two billion people suffer globally from malnutrition. At the bottom, 60 percent of people worldwide miss out on 95 percent of new income from global growth, and the absolute number of people living in poverty has risen by a billion people over the past few decades.



I’m willing to say, in agreement with Karl Marx, that capitalism is better than feudalism. We can also point to data that suggest aggregate progress. For example, progress has been made toward the fulfillment of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals on life expectancy, mortality, and education. Middle‐ and upper‐​class women in much of the world enjoy access and rights that would have been the envy of their sisters a century and a half ago. But in celebrating these gains, we should be cautious about the causal arrows we draw. Some of these gains can be attributed to development and rationalization, both of which are correlated with capitalism. Many of these gains are the result of political struggle, not capitalism. Laws and norms against discrimination, the right to not be the property of our husbands, the right to vote, to be able to protect ourselves and our children from domestic violence, and so many other rights were not handed down from on high by the chamber of commerce.



These rights were won by social movements, many of which were led by socialists and feminists who fought tooth and nail and suffered many defeats on the way to getting them. In this moment, however, I think it’s important to look forward, as I said earlier. Even if we were to concede that capitalism has been a net gain for women — which I don’t — it is much more important to ask whether capitalism will lead to gains in the future. Feminism is not just about eliminating gender‐​based discrimination. It’s about fighting for and creating equality and a good life for everyone regardless of their sex, gender, race, ethnicity, education, income, religion and where they live. This is what’s great about feminism. It’s why I’m a feminist. Simply put, we can’t achieve these goals in capitalism. This week is the climate strike, so let’s consider the example of climate change. Nothing demonstrates the failure of the so‐​called free market better than the looming climate catastrophe.



While capitalism may be rational for individuals, on a systemic level it is highly irrational. The reckless pursuit of profit by individual capitalists who have been empowered by elites and governments has created the massive collective‐​action problem of global warming. Not to mention resource depletion and habitat destruction. But instead of addressing this problem head on, a problem we understood the rough contours of decades ago, for the past 40 years elites and business owners have insisted on the healing power of free markets.



Historically, sexism and racism have been a core part of strategies of accumulation in capitalism. Sexism makes women’s unpaid labor in the home, which is essential to society and to our economy, appear to be natural. A labor of love. Sexism and racism also continue to be extremely handy tools in the business owner’s toolkit to divide and oppress workers to discourage demands for better pay and benefits and efforts to form unions.



Has capitalism helped to empower women enhancing their material well‐​being and fostering gender parity? Rather than posing our questions and answers as either/​or, we should opt for a more nuanced discussion. As I said earlier, women have been empowered in capitalism. But we should be cautious not to confuse correlation with causation. Keep in mind those lurking variables such as the women’s movement, the civil rights movement, the labor movement, and the environmental movement, but even with those it is still the case that markets can empower women. Money equals power under capitalism, and some women have clearly obtained some of that. Women are lucky enough today to ride on the success of past social movements. So if women are lucky enough to be born to rich parents or be gifted with fantastic abilities or intelligence or any number of other serendipitous happenings that land them in a well‐​remunerated, fulfilling job, their ability to earn well will empower them. More than that, it will help them empower others in their networks, such as their own children.



But observing that some women are quite empowered in capitalism does not imply that the path has been laid and that if we just follow it, the goals of feminism will be reached. The fabulous wealth of the relative few at the top is not an accident, or a harmless peak over a healthy floor of people living a good life. The “market‐​friendly” reforms over the past few decades have made a handful of people, mostly men, unimaginably wealthy, while the vast majority of people have seen their livelihoods stagnate, and their opportunities narrow. The incredible technological and scientific advances of the past 40 years could have been channeled toward dramatically reducing poverty and improving healthcare outcomes and the ecological sustainability of our production processes. It could have been channeled toward ensuring security and the supply and distribution of clean water, nutritious food, and adequate housing. These are things that all people value. These are also things that would greatly empower women who suffered disproportionately from the lack of these things. We have the tools to vastly improve the lives of the world’s women, and all people, for that matter.



We haven’t directed our resources, knowledge, or energy toward achieving this goal. Why? Because the goal of capitalism is not a better world. It’s to make a profit.



 **Veronique de Rugy:** Does capitalism help or hurt women? I have to admit that it took me a while to be able to take this question seriously. But then I did a Google search and I saw the amount of writing about how capitalism is oppressive to women, and so I guess this really is a serious issue. It was hard for me, because every aspect of my life I owe to the privilege of living in the closest thing to a capitalist regime. I’m educated, I work, I’m a mom, I was able to choose the country where I live. I can choose my religion, I can choose my political affiliation, I can even choose to be a libertarian, and I can make all these life choices without having to depend permanently on a man and without the judgment of others. I’m just one data point, obviously. One of my life choices is that I’m an economist, so I know that one data point is not going to refute the widespread belief that capitalism hurts women.



Let’s look at this question and let’s define: What is capitalism? There are many different ways to define capitalism, and I will tell you what it means to me. First, capitalism is an economic system. So if you want to actually judge it, you need to look at its economic performance. In its ideal form, capitalism requires a small government. Capitalism rests on individual freedom and voluntary consent. That means that you can’t force people to do what they don’t want to do, the same way they can’t force you to do their bidding. But also, in an ideal capitalist system, you can decide who you want to marry, how you want to raise your children, and how to manage your reproductive choices without having to ask the government for permission.



Capitalism requires cooperation, not just competition. This is something that F. A. Hayek highlights a lot in his work. Capitalism is good precisely because it lets individuals express themselves creatively and productively through their work and voluntary community. Now, we must ask ourselves whether this is just an ideal, because maybe in practice capitalism is really awful and oppressive. So, let’s look at the countries that are the most capitalist, as I just defined them, the countries where the government interferes the least in economic affairs. By most rankings, the two most capitalist countries are Hong Kong and Singapore. But among the large group of most‐​capitalist countries, you find countries like the United States and Canada. By historic standards, and even by current world standards, these countries are nice, and they’re rich, and they have relatively low poverty. And this is the reason why so many poor people around the world want to move here, even if it means hard work and low‐​paid jobs.



But maybe capitalism is good for our country as a whole, but not so good for women. So let’s look at that question. Historically, we can show that capitalism has helped women a fair amount. That’s because free markets have done much more than any other institution to empower individuals and produce an abundance of new and amazing goods and incredible technological innovation for the benefit of all. I cannot overstate the fact that we are all the beneficiaries of the gift of innovation. Nobel Prize laureate William Nordhaus’s work shows that when you take the top innovators in the United States in the second half of the 20th century, they only captured 2 percent of the social value that they created with their innovations. They were forced to share 98 percent of the gains through competition and lower prices with us consumers. That’s a big deal, and it has been a big deal historically for women. Innovations such as urban sanitation, clean running water, and modern medicines have actually increased the quality of women’s lives immensely. But then the next question is: Women may live longer and in better health, but what has capitalism done to emancipate them? Three key things in my opinion.



First, innovation doesn’t just save lives, it reduces the time burden on women, and that has historically allowed more of them to enter the labor force. Just to give you an example, in 1910 the amount of time women spent daily preparing food was six hours, on average, and today it is an average of just one hour. And that holds true across income levels. What this has done is bring to low‐​income people a lot of goods and opportunities that used to be only accessible to rich people.



The second thing innovation does is create income, and increases in income have always preceded higher levels of education for women. When resources are scarce, families historically tended to invest in their sons because it seemed like a better investment. When income rose, then they could invest in both. They didn’t have to choose. That was extremely empowering for women.



The third thing that capitalism has done for women is increase not only income, but also the demand for labor. When you think about the fact that innovations have reduced the necessity of physical strength to do remunerative work, that means lot of new work options became more available to women. The increase for them was, in fact, many times the increase that we’ve seen for men. And as soon as women started to be able to secure independent incomes and support themselves, it meant that not being married was not an utter catastrophe like it used to be. And it is still the case for a lot of women today. All these factors explain why, as historian Stephen Davies has noted, the early pioneers of feminism were ardent classical liberals and supporters of capitalist industry. Feminists were not always anti‐​capitalist, and those women were right to put their faith in freedom and capitalism.



We have plenty to do, of course. I do not just defend the status quo on these issues. Occupational licensing laws, criminal justice reform, and many other topics that the scholars here at Cato work on every day are an important part of the work still to be done. But all in all, capitalism realistically beats all existing alternatives. Unfortunately, it seems to me people take for granted the bounty created by capitalism. This is why our challenge, for all of us, is to constantly make capitalism and freedom an exciting undertaking for the next generation. Women have much to gain from building a freer society.

This is the sort of stuff that just makes you want to scream.
From Oil Sands Fact Check, comes this interview with Bill McKibben: http://oilsandsfactcheck.org/2014/09/25/video-the-truth-about-the-anti-keystone-xl-rockefeller-brothers-fund/
Excerpt:
Timed to coincide with the anti-fossil fuel march in New York City over the weekend, the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation (RBF) led a press conference of groups announcing a pledge to divest from fossil fuels. Given that board members of RBF are heirs to the Rockefeller oil fortune, the media was led to believe that divestment from fossil fuels was a drastic change in practice for the foundation. Yet anyone who knows the least bit about RBF is well aware that foundation has given millions to groups that oppose fossil fuels for years.
In fact, RBF is credited for providing the financial support to launch 350.org. How do we know that? Because Bill McKibben himself reluctantly gave away those details in a little-watched YouTube video (full version of interview here) from three years ago with a news outlet called Climate Challenge.
 From the transcript: 
Climate Challenge: So you don’t get money from Pew or Rockefeller or any of those big foundations?
McKibben: No we did. Rockefellers Brothers fund gave us some money right when we were starting out that’s been useful too.
Climate Challenge: But they no longer fund you?
McKibben: Uhh I don’t know. I don’t have that sort of… funders sitting in front of me.
Climate Challenge: Really? That’s usually something that people know.
McKibben: Rockefellers is one of our… is a great ally in this fight.
So now the question becomes just how much money has RBF pumped into 350.org over the years? Vivian Krause, writing in the Financial Post looked into that early last year and found the number to be in the millions. In a piece out just today, Ron Arnold digs into the actual investments.  No wonder McKibben was reluctant to divulge the information.
====================================================================================================
And here, in plain public view, with an easy to find simple search, is the answer to Bill McKibben’s “Uhh I don’t know.” moment.

Two years ago during the scorching summer of 2012, July 1936 lost its place on the leaderboard and July 2012 became the hottest month on record in the United States. Now, as if by magic, and according to NOAA’s own data, July 1936 is now the hottest month on record again. The past, present, and future all seems to be “adjustable” in NOAA’s world. See the examples below.
Josh has been busy again and writes at Bishop Hill with a new cartoon:
The temperature adjustments story has been brewing for weeks principally due to the many posts at ‘RealScience’ but taken up by others, for example, Paul Homewood, see here and here. Judith Curry has a great post about it here, as does Anthony here.


H/t to Real Science/Steven Goddard for suggesting including Toto. Cartoons by Josh
Bruce at Sunshine Hours has been doing some unthreading, er plotting, and at my request, prepared some USHCN maps of Kansas, first May’s high temperatures.

I’ve annotated the plot, to include “zombie” weather station that have been closed for years, but still show “estimated” data from NOAA. Those marked NRF are “no report found”…typically meaning NOAA hasn’t gotten the data from the observer yet, which is often mailed in on paper B91 forms.  It is interesting to note how NOAA has been changing the data, in most cases adjusting it higher, though in a couple of cases, lower.
Bruce also plotted some other maps of Kansas, for July 1936, and for July 2012. Note how in July 1936 the Tmax temperature are almost all adjusted cooler, and in 2012, most all Tmax temperatures are adjusted warmer. Click images for larger versions.


Whatever happened to just using actual measured data? There is no justification for this.
And, NOAA can’t even keep their story straight about July 1936 temperatures. From a report I did in 2013:
NCDC’s SOTC July 2012:
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/2012/07
Screencap of the claim for CONUS Tavg temperature for July 2012 in the SOTC:

Note the 77.4°F value for July 1936. It is actually still in their SOTC for July 2012 today.
Now let’s look at some plots from NOAA’s Climate at a Glance. I just happened to have one from two years ago. It also says 77.4°F on the plot. The numbers match with the SOTC report. The annotations are mine.

Today, I ran the same plot again, and here is the NEW number for July 1936. The annotations are mine.

NOAA helpfully provided the data which I have saved as an Excel file, it has both 1936 and 2012 July data: NOAA_Tavg_Data_July_1895-2013 (.xlsx)
You can’t get any clearer proof of NOAA adjusting past temperatures.
This isn’t just some issue with gridding, or anomalies, or method, it is about NOAA not being able to present historical climate information of the United States accurately. In one report they give one number, and in another they give a different one with no explanation to the public as to why.
This is not acceptable. It is not being honest with the public. It is not scientific. It violates the Data Quality Act.
But wait, there’s more. In January 2013, I ran this story based on an article in the Wall Street Journal: July (2012) Was Hottest Month on Record
My story was:  Does NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) keep two separate sets of climate books for the USA?
In that essay, I revised the WSJ graphic. At that time, it looked like this based on new numbers for July 2012 that I found from NOAA:

Now, with the new numbers in the Excel File above, output from NOAA, I had to revise it again. It looks like this now:

Now, once again, July 1936 is the hottest month in the US, even if by the slimmest of margins, all thanks to post-facto adjustments of temperature data by NOAA/NCDC.
I suggest that NOAA/NCDC have another one of those meetings like where they decided to keep long dead weather stations reporting as “zombies”, like I showed with Marysville, yesterday, and work on getting their story straight.
This constant change from year to year of what is or is not the hottest month on record for the USA is not only unprofessional and embarrassing for NOAA, it’s bullshit of the highest order. It can easily be solved by NOAA stopping the unsupportable practice of adjusting temperatures of the past so that the present looks different in context with the adjusted past and stop making data for weather stations that have long since closed.
NOAA has been accused by others of “fabricating” data, and while that is a strong word that I don’t like to use, it looks to be more and more accurate.
That said, I don’t believe this is case where somebody purposely has their hand on a control knob for temperature data, I think all of this is nothing more than artifacts of a convoluted methodology and typical bureaucratic blundering. As I’ve always said, never attribute malice to what can be explained by simple incompetence.
We already showed yesterday that NOAA can’t get their output data files correct, and we are waiting on a statement and a possible correction for that. But I think the problem is even larger than that, and will require an investigation from an unbiased outside source to get to the root of the problem.

"The UK government has announced an immediate moratorium on fracking. The decision came after new scientific analysis concluded it was not possible to “rule out future unacceptable impacts”. Opponents of the controversial process of shale gas extraction have long argued that it is inherently risky. Since exploratory drilling began in the UK in 2011, campaigners have highlighted the risk of seismic instability, harm to the environment and human health, and the implications of opening up new fossil fuel reserves in the face of a global climate emergency. The strength of opposition has meant significant conflict in recent years. Drilling operations have been the target of major protests around England since the first community blockade in Balcombe, West Sussex in the summer of 2013. The scale and impact of these protests meant that they were the focus of large and costly policing operations, resulting in hundreds of arrests and complaints about the police response. And now new research by myself and colleagues suggests that protests which seek to move beyond a purely symbolic show of opposition are being policed as though they are dangerous.  I have been examining the development of both police policy and practice in relation to fracking since 2013, as part of a team of researchers who study the policing of protest. Our first studyof protests at Barton Moss in  Salford, Greater Manchester, identified serious issues with the nature of the police operation, highlighting protesters’ routine experience of police violence. We have since visited protest sites across England – in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Sussex and Surrey. At these sites, we observed the protests and their policing, and conducted in-depth interviews with protesters. We have just published a national study based on this research. Our work echoes many of the concerns we raised in relation to Barton Moss and questions the extent to which lessons were learned by police from earlier operations. Protesters alleged they experienced violence, intimidation and aggression from police officers at multiple fracking sites across the country.  This was most prevalent during intense and extended protest situations where protesters used forms of direct action to try to disrupt fracking. These included slow marches or blocking roads to delay deliveries, “lock-ons” where protesters lock themselves together to block an entrance to a drilling site, and “truck-surfing” where protesters jump on top of trucks making deliveries so that they can’t be moved. In response, police operations focused on preventing or limiting disruption. In many cases this involved very physical interventions to remove protesters or block them from sites. We spoke to people who reported being pushed, shoved and knocked to the ground on numerous occasions in ways that were understood by protesters to be unnecessary acts of aggression rather than responses to a threat.  This type of response has also been highlighted by other observers and has led to calls for a review of policing at anti-fracking protests by Keith Taylor MEP. We also heard from women who accused police of groping and manhandling them in ways that left them feeling violated and frightened.  Protesters said the large number of police and their physical response was excessive, and many told us it felt like an attack on the right to protest. This in turn has exacerbated a breakdown in trust between protesters and police.    Our report concludes that the police response since 2016 to peaceful – albeit disruptive – forms of non-violent direct action has been disproportionate. We agree with the protesters that it has had the effect of undermining the right to protest.  Our report details police definitions of “protester”, “activist” and “extremist” that have been developed to guide its responses to protest. We suggest that these definitions, which include the construction of activism as synonymous with criminality, are inaccurate but appear to be informing police responses on the ground. It would appear that in police policy and practice there is an increasingly clear view that only non-disruptive protest is considered legitimate.  We also document the chilling effect of protest injunctions, sought by fracking companies from the High Court to prohibit various protest and campaigning activities. Taking these two issues together, our findings echo comments by other observers about the criminalisation of non-violent protestin the UK. We also interviewed a diverse cross section of protesters to understand who is involved in anti-fracking protests. In part we wanted to critically examine the routine labelling, by police, of those involved as “domestic extremists”. This label, in our view, misrepresents who is involved and what motivates them (the UN Special Rapporteur also raised concerns about this labelling).  In fact, many we spoke to were new to protest and saw it as a last resort – the only option available to them when other forms of opposition had been closed down. We did also speak to many experienced campaigners who travelled to protests, but again the label of “domestic extremist” misrepresents their motivations and creates a false divide between local residents and a wider anti-fracking movement. We found that participants of different ages, levels of experience and political backgrounds were united by a concern with both the local impacts of fracking and with the global climate emergency.   The National Police Chiefs Council has recently conducted a public consultation on how protests should be policed. Organisations such as the Network for Police Monitoring are right to call for a review, and our findings suggest that the voices of the full range of protesters must be taken seriously. As the climate change movement grows in this country we have to give serious thought to the available means by which communities are able to protest.

Jean S writes at Climate Audit:

As most readers are aware, and stated in my post few hours after (ClimateGate) CG broke out, Mike’s Nature trick was first uncovered by UC here.
He was able to replicate (visually perfectly) the smooths of MBH9x thereby showing that the smooths involved padding with the instrumental data. The filter used by UC was the zero-phase Butterworth filter (an IIR filter), which has been Mann’s favourite since at least 2003. However, there was something else that I felt was odd: UC’s emulation required a very long (100 samples or so) additional zero padding. So about two years ago, I decided to take an additional look at the topic with UC.
Indeed, after digitalizing Mann’s smooths we discovered that UC’s emulation was very, very good but not perfect. After a long research, and countless hours of experimenting (I won’t bore you with the details), we managed to figure out the “filter” used by Mann before Mann (2004)-era. Mann had made his own version of the Hamming filter (windowing method, an FIR filter)! Instead of using any kind of usual estimate for the filter order, which is usually estimated from the transition bandwidth (see, e.g., Mitra: Digital Signal Processing) and has typically the length of a few dozen coefficients at maximum, he used the filter length equal to the length of the signal to be filtered! As Mann’s PCA was apparently just a “modern” convention, this must be a “modern” filter design. Anyhow, no digital signal processing expert I consulted about the matter had ever seen anything like that.
JeanS adds in a comment:
the main issue here is not which filters/smoothers are “appropriate”, but the fact Mann was using a method unknown to anyone else. This made it practically impossible to replicate his smoothings, and later, to definitely show beyond the reasonable doubt that he indeed used the trick (i.e., padded with the instrumental data).

 
Bold mine. Read more here: http://climateaudit.org/2014/08/29/mannomatic-smoothing-technical-details/
I suppose a man who designates himself as a Nobel Laureate in court proceedings, even after being chastised by the IPCC, only to have to retract the court claims later, would have no moral issues at all with making a special version of an established filter to suit his own special purposes.

The ABC’s [Australia Talks](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-06/australia-talks-explained/11570332) project aims to stimulate a conversation on a broad sweep of topics — from job security and sexual habits to national pride and personal finances.



The project is based on the results of a representative survey of more than 50,000 Australians.



One question the ABC’s promotional material focused on was “Are you lonely?” And when ABC chair Ita Buttrose [was asked](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-08/annabel-crabb-australia-talks-what-australians-worry-about/11579644) what she thought was the most surprising and disturbing feature of the whole exercise, she singled out the data on loneliness.



So, does loneliness deserve this billing? Is it really as important an issue as climate change, the economy, or education? We believe it is, and importantly, results from the Australia Talks survey help explain why.



First, loneliness is a killer. [An influential meta-analysis](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316), which collated and analysed the results of nearly 150 studies, underlines the impact on health of loneliness, or more specifically, lack of social integration and social support.



It found loneliness increases the risk of death more than such things as poor diet, obesity, alcohol consumption, and lack of exercise, and that it is as harmful as heavy smoking.



Second, most people generally don’t know loneliness kills. Indeed, some of [our own research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953617307505?via%3Dihub) found when people in the United Kingdom and United States were asked to rank how important they thought various factors were for health, social integration and social support were at the bottom of their lists. 



Yet, in a forthcoming paper, we found the quality of social connections is around four times more important as a predictor of retirees’ physical and mental health than the state of their finances.



But when was the last time you saw an advert on TV telling you to get your social life in order (rather than your pension plan) before you stop working? When was the last time a health campaign or your family doctor warned you of the dangers of loneliness?



Our ignorance about the health consequences of loneliness is a reflection of the fact that loneliness is not part of our everyday conversations around health. 



Hopefully, the Australia Talks project will change that. In the process, its findings also give us plenty of things to talk about.



The most striking finding from the Australia Talks national survey is simply how pervasive loneliness is in Australia today. Indeed, only half (54%) of participants reported “rarely” or “never” feeling lonely.



The survey also finds loneliness is a particular challenge for certain sections of the community. Of these, four stand out.



 **1\. Young people**



Among people aged 18-24, only a third (32%) “rarely” or “never” feel lonely. More than a quarter (30%) said they felt lonely “frequently” or “always”.



This compares sharply with the situation for older people, over two-thirds of whom (71%) “rarely” or “never” feel lonely. The fact that our [image of a lonely person](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/22876368.pdf) is typically someone of advanced years suggests we need to update our data (and our thinking).



 **2\. Inner-city dwellers**



The second group for whom loneliness emerges as a particular problem are people living in inner cities. 



Compared to people who live in rural areas, those in inner metropolitan areas are less likely to say that they “never” feel lonely (15% vs 20%), but much more likely to say that they “occasionally”, “frequently”, or “always” do (50% vs 42%).



Again, this runs counter to much of the discourse around loneliness, which often focuses on the plight of those who are physical remote from others. 



But this speaks to the psychological reality of loneliness. As we note in our recent book [The New Psychology of Health](https://www.routledge.com/The-New-Psychology-of-Health-Unlocking-the-Social-Cure/Haslam-Jetten-Cruwys-Dingle-Haslam/p/book/9781138123885), people’s health and well-being is very much linked to the strength of their connection to, and [identification with, groups and communities](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1088868314523839) of various forms.



 **3\. One Nation voters**



Interestingly, a third group that reports disproportionately high levels of loneliness is One Nation voters. Nearly one in ten (9%) of Pauline Hanson’s followers report being lonely “always” compared to around 2% for followers of each of the other parties. 



We believe feeling disconnected from the world and its institutions often drives people to find solace in marginal political movements. This indeed, is the [developmental trajectory of multiple forms of extremism](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1348/014466605X48998). 



**4\. People on low incomes**



Perhaps the most stark finding concerns the fourth predictor of loneliness: poverty. While 21% of people who earn less than A$600 a week feel lonely “frequently” or “always”, the comparable figure for people who earn more than A$3,000 a week is less than half that (10%). 



This speaks to the more general (but often neglected) fact that [around the world](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2920957/) poverty is one of the biggest predictors of [poor health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(15\)00150-6/fulltext), especially depression and other mental illnesses. 



It also speaks to our observation that if you are fortunate enough to have a lot of money [when you retire](https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sipr.12049), then one of the key things this allows you to do is to maintain and build social connections.



So, there is a lot here for us to talk about when it comes to loneliness. This discussion also needs to ask what we are going to do to address a social cancer every bit as alarming as cancer itself. 



For us, a large part of the answer lies in [efforts to rebuild group-based social connections](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-47128-002.html) that are eroded by the tyrannies of modern life.



This is a world where all types of community — families, neighbourhoods, churches, political parties, trade unions and even stable work groups — are constantly under threat. So let’s get talking.

The executive and legislative branches of government oversee the modern administrative state. Presidents have a duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” But Congress is entitled to regulate the regulators no less than the president; after all, Congress exercises its enumerated powers to create and fund domestic regulatory agencies. Thus, equipped with overlapping authorities, the elected branches of government historically have competed for the reins of administrative policymaking. Such competition represents a constitutionally healthy manifestation of dueling institutional “ambitions.”



At present, however, the contest between the polit­ical branches is dangerously out of balance. Since Richard Nixon, presidents have increased control over the administrative state through a process known as “White House regulatory review.” Presidents developed this powerful management tool unilaterally, and today, these functions are performed out of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Congress, however, hasn’t kept pace. Not only has the legislature failed to create an equivalent of White House regulatory review, but the overall quality of oversight in Congress has declined as power has centralized in leadership and away from committees in both the House and Senate. The result is that the president calls the shots on the administrative state while Congress sits on the bench. Through its ever‐​tightening grip over the administrative state, the presidency has accumulated a constitutionally worrisome concentration of power.



To remedy this alarming imbalance, this paper proposes the creation of a congressional capacity to evaluate administrative action. Because regulatory review is values driven, the only feasible institutional design is to give each party caucus in Congress its own ability to vet administrative action.



Government entities that go by acronyms such as EPA, FDA, and OSHA did not spring from the earth or magically appear.1 Rather, an alphabet soup’s worth of federal bureaucracies flows from legislation passed by Congress. Lawmakers create and sustain domestic regulatory agencies with enabling statutes and appropriations. In the words of renowned polit­ical scientist W. F. Willoughby, the legislative branch is “the source of all admin­istrative authority.”2



Yet the administrative state cannot be solely a function of congressional intent. The president must, after all, “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” To this end, the Constitution establishes a hierarchical management system meant to promote account­ability, whereby “officers” and “inferior officers” are responsive to the president to ensure the “faithful” execution of the law.



The executive and legislative branches, therefore, can stake a rightful constitutional claim as the proper superintendent of the admin­istrative apparatus. If the president is the CEO of the regulatory corporation, then Congress represents an active board of directors. Both answer to voters, who play the role of shareholders in this metaphor.



These vying claims operate as a constitutional check on overbearing government. The Founding Fathers designed a system of separate and competing powers to prevent the concentration of power in any one branch, which they thought to be “the very definition of tyranny.”3 Although “the Framers could hardly have envisioned today’s vast and varied federal bureaucracy,”4 they could take solace in the protections afforded by the constitutional framework they put in place. To the extent that Congress and the president compete for management primacy over the administrative state, these institutions check one another and thereby better protect liberty.



For decades after the New Deal era, Congresses and presidents struggled to control the reins of regulatory policy. During the past 40 years, however, a once‐​close race has become a rout in the executive branch’s favor. When it comes to “setting the direction and influencing the outcome of administrative process”—which, again, is the dominant source of contemporary federal policymaking—we live in “an era of presidential administration,” as then professor Elena Kagan argued in a celebrated article.5



To be sure, undisputed presidential supervision of the administrative state engenders efficiencies for governing. All else being equal, domestic regulatory agencies have an easier time churning out rules when the chain of command is simpler. Yet this managerial virtue is a constitutional sin. As a general matter, more efficient government more readily infringes on individual rights, which is precisely the threat that the Framers sought to mitigate with the system of separated powers.6 By dividing government but giving each component the means to check one another, the Framers expected human nature to take over, such that “ambition [could] counteract ambition.”7



In the competition among institutions for control of the administrative state, presidents unerringly have demonstrated all the “ambition” the Founders’ envisioned. Congress, alas, has not. This paper explains the current (and constitutionally worrisome) imbalance of power between the elected branches of government and proposes a remedy in the form of a new congressional capacity to evaluate admin­istrative action.



The first section of this policy analysis describes how the post–World War II Congress designed itself to oversee regulatory agencies and how, since the 1980s, Congress has strayed from this blueprint. The second section traces the rise of White House regulatory review through the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), which has become the president’s primary tool for managing admin­istrative policy and which serves as the foundation of “presidential administration.” The paper’s third section points to the obvious need for an OIRA‐​like capability in Congress. Finally, the fourth section proposes a politically palatable version of legislative regulatory review. Because cost‐​benefit analyses are values driven, the only feasible institutional design is to give each party caucus in Congress its own capacity to vet administrative action.



For much of the 20th century, congressional committees ably competed with the president to manage domestic regulatory agencies. Over the past four decades, however, power in Congress shifted from committees to party leadership, and the results have been disastrous for legislative oversight. Post–New Deal Congresses organized themselves to supervise regulatory policy, but the centralization of power within Congress since the 1980s has under­mined congressional capacity to supervise administrative action.



At the close of the 19th century, a rapidly growing American economy precipitated social disruption, and the public called on Congress to respond. These Progressive Era pressures intensified with the onset of the Great Depression. Citizens sought relief; businesses wanted protection. In the face of surging constituent sentiment, Congress established administrative agencies and empowered them to regulate markets and distribute benefits.8



Yet the onset of administrative governance triggered another societal reaction. Popular objections centered on the combination of the legislative, executive, and judicial functions in regulatory agencies.9 For progressive theorists and administrators, the separation‐​of‐​powers principle was a quaint restraint on efficiency.10 For others, but especially the legal community of that time, the Constitution’s tripartite structure retained its vitality, and the young administrative state appeared alien to the Framers’ design.



Political elites of the day echoed concerns about the potential for unaccountable and arbitrary administration. In a 1937 government study commissioned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and described by him as “a document of permanent importance,”11 a blue‐​ribbon panel proclaimed that “safeguarding of the citizen from narrow‐​minded and dictatorial bureaucratic interference and control is one of the primary obligations of democratic government.” In terms of a remedy, the report recommended “centralization” of admin­istrative control—under the president—as the appro­priate response to the danger posed by the “isolated and arrogant bureaucrat.”12



The panel’s call to enhance executive power is unsurprising given that the president himself commissioned the report. For their part, members of Congress held different ideas about which institutions should “safeguard” the public from the vagaries of the administrative state. After debating reform proposals for more than a decade, Congress in 1946 passed three complementary statutes whose collective purpose was to tame bureaucratic governance.



The first was the Administrative Procedure Act,13 known as the “constitution of the admin­istrative state,”14 through which lawmakers sought to regulate the regulators. The act estab­lished judicial review for admin­istrative action,15 required public input in the formation of regulations,16 and ensured that governmental functions (such as prosecution and adjudication) are sufficiently distinct within agencies.17 The second law, the Federal Tort Claims Act, waived sovereign immunity for torts committed by agents of the government.18 Citizens thus became empowered to vindicate their rights against the regulatory apparatus.19 Third, the Legislative Reorganization Act provided lawmakers with a sorely needed framework to superintend the administrative state.20 In the course of creating domestic regulatory agencies during the previous half‐​century, Congress never had bothered to update itself, and by 1946, a consensus emerged that the legislature was far behind the times.



Rep. A. S. “Mike” Monroney (D-OK), a sponsor of the Legislative Reorganization Act, warned that the failure to refresh Congress’s “archaic organization” could “be tragic for our repre­sentative form of Government.” Monroney’s cosponsor, Sen. Robert La Follette Jr. (R-WI), spoke of a “grave constitutional crisis.”21 The media, too, took note of Congress’s inability to keep pace with the rise of the administrative state. A 1942 _Reader’s Digest_ article bemoaned that legislators were “corner store wiseacres in an age of calculating‐​machine‐​trained researchers.”22 Three years later, _Life_ magazine ran a cover story titled “U.S. Congress: It Faces Great New Tasks with Outworn Tools.”23



To mitigate Congress’s dire inadequacies, the Legislative Reorganization Act empowered congressional committees to serve as members’ primary agents for managing domestic regulatory agencies. According to George Galloway, a professor and one of the statute’s architects, “modernization of the standing committee system was the first objective of the act and the keystone in the arch of congressional reform.”24 The act streamlined the number of committees to end redundancies, clarified committee jurisdictions, and regularized their procedures.25 Membership on committees was capped for each lawmaker in the House and Senate to prevent members from diluting their attention.26 In addition, the act authorized committees to develop a professional staff virtually from scratch.27 Finally, the act tasked committees with exercising “continuous watchfulness” over the admin­istration of laws.28 Although “continuous watchfulness” is plainly a nebulous mandate, La Follette offered the following explanation:



If the standing committee is given this responsibility and mandate, and is given a staff of experts, it will be in touch with the various activities of the departments of agencies of the government over which it has jurisdiction, and it will endeavor by cooperation by meetings and exchange of views and gathering of information, to make certain, insofar as possible, that the agency or department, in exercising the broad delegation of legislative power which is contained in almost every act, is exercising it as was intended by Congress.… [The committees] will become familiar, as the process goes along from month to month and year to year, with the manner in which the department or agency is admin­istering the power bestowed upon it. It will then be very likely, I believe, if the committee finds that the agency or depart­ment is going beyond the intent of Congress, to introduce legislation to correct the situation.29



Committee staff wasn’t the only investment that Congress made in improving its capacity. The Legislative Reorganization Act also reorganized and strengthened lawmakers’ primary analytical support agency, the Legislative Reference Service (now known as the Congressional Research Service).30



Thus began an era, lasting roughly from 1946 to the late 1970s, that scholars define as the period of “committee government,” meaning that committee structures were a formidable force, if not the paramount power, in domestic policy.31



During committee government, Congress refined certain norms to complement the effec­tiveness of committees as agency managers. Under the “property right” custom, for example, lawmakers held their committee assignments from one Congress to the next, rather than cycling through different committees.32 As a result, members dealt with the same subject matter for continuous and extended periods, which led to familiarity with policymaking details. To further cultivate expertise within their ranks, committees institutionalized the “appren­ticeship” norm, whereby incoming members were expected to choose a narrow issue area within their committee’s jurisdiction and then gain specialization in that area through years of mundane legislative work.33 Taken together, these norms encouraged members to master the agencies they oversaw.



At the same time, Congress cultivated procedural mechanisms to facilitate legislative supervision of administrative action. For example, Congress expanded use of “reauthorization,” whereby legislators put a time limit on laws that create regulatory agencies, and when the deadline approaches, lawmakers decide whether to continue, or “reauthorize,” the program.34 Standing committees perform the process and are expected to bring their agency expertise to bear. Through reauthorization, Congress can modify regulatory programs that aren’t working or, alter­natively, boost successful programs. After World War II, Congress expanded its use of reauthorization to manage agencies.35



In the post‐​war period, Congress also expanded use of the legislative veto, which allows lawmakers to directly check administrative action by unicameral, bicameral, or even committee vote. From 1932 to 1950, Congress enacted 25 legislative veto provisions; over the following quarter‐​century, Congress enacted 267 such provisions.36 As with reauthorization, standing committees played a crucial analytical role in the process. Sometimes committees exercised the veto. More often, in advance of action by one or two Houses on legislative vetoes, committees convened hearings and wrote committee reports to inform their peers. Due to the committees’ work, members were not reliant on executive branch agencies or lobbyists when they voted whether to strike down administrative action.37 Perhaps even more important than the legislative veto _per se_ , agencies respected its potential use. Because they feared the legislative veto, agencies would maintain direct lines of communication with committees and honor requests and objections that members registered as a rulemaking progressed.38 In this fashion, the legislative veto became “a central means by which Congress secures the accountability of executive and independent agencies,” according to Supreme Court Justice Byron White.39



In the early 1970s, as anxiety grew over growing executive power during the excesses of the Nixon administration, Congress doubled down on the committee structure. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 revised and rephrased in more explicit language the oversight function of House and Senate standing committees.40 The act further expanded committee staff, and it also strengthened the policy analysis role of the Congressional Research Service. Four years later, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act rationalized Congress’s role in the budget by creating budget committees in both chambers and establishing an annual procedure.41 In addition, the act created a new Article I agency, the Congressional Budget Office, to provide analytical support.42 The act also strengthened the Government Accountability Office by enhancing its authority to acquire information from regulatory agencies.43 In the face of Nixon’s excesses, Congress practiced self‐​help.



Scholars identify the mid‐​1970s as the high‐​water mark of committee authority in Congress. Equipped with subject‐​matter expertise, supporting resources, and procedural tools, lawmakers of this time played a major role in managing agency policymaking.



Today, apathy (or worse) is the defining characteristic of legislative oversight. Early in the 116th Congress, for example, the _minority_ party on the House Committee on Natural Resources adjourned a hearing on climate change before it could begin because so few members of the majority bothered to attend.44 In a majoritarian institution like the House of Representatives, this sort of procedural happenstance is absurd. And when the rare high-profile hearing attracts member participation, lawmaker performances typically fail to inspire confidence in congressional competence.45



There are other conspicuous signs of a sidelined Congress. Committee reauthorizations, once a powerful oversight tool, have fallen into disuse.46 Agencies routinely submit nonsensical budget justifications meant to obfuscate administrative policymaking priorities, and lawmakers don’t bat an eye.47 Where once agencies rushed to meet informational requests by committee leaders, agencies today dissemble in the face of questions from Congress, and lawmakers do nothing.48



What happened? Multiple factors conspired to diminish Congress. While some reasons for Congress’s decline, such as the Supreme Court’s invalidation of the legislative veto in 1983,49 occurred independently of the legislature, the chief cause came from within. Specifically, the centralization of power in Congress undermined the committee-centric structure that had served as the body’s intended mechanism for managing the administrative state. Over the past 40 years, a Congress “once dominated by fairly autonomous committees and relatively weak parties became a system of increasingly dependent committees and relatively strong parties.”50



Changing demographics played a big part in the concentration of power in Congress. Starting in the 1970s, a gradual extinction of Southern Democrats and Rockefeller Republicans led to greater uniformity within and, consequently, polarization between the two political parties.51



Increasing partisanship, in turn, set the stage for opportunistic leadership.52 Two successive House speakers, Tip O’Neill and Jim Wright, instituted rule changes that took power away from committees and consolidated it in the hands of party leaders.53 But it was Speaker Newt Gingrich whose tenure marked the inflection point away from committee government. With his so-called Contract with America, Gingrich pioneered the modern strategic focus on national politics and depen­dence on party support.54 As speaker, he instituted sweeping rule changes that further entrenched leadership’s authority.55 No matter which party has held the gavel, subsequent speakers have maintained these powers, for obvious reasons of self-interest.56



By its constitutional nature, the Senate always will be less susceptible to the concentration of authority. Nevertheless, the “world’s greatest deliberative body” has trended in the same direction as the House. In the early 1990s, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell Jr. began to structure committee bills and floor debate in a manner meant to emphasize the policy differences between the two parties.57 By the end of the decade, both party conferences in the Senate practiced “message politics,” or an effort by “each party [to] tr[y] to frame every policy and major vote as a partisan campaign issue.”58 Today, the Senate routinely abandons individual- and minority-based privileges—something that can be achieved only in an environment where party unity trumps institutional pride.59



Another significant contribution to the centralization of power in Congress is the “fiscalization” of politics. By “fiscalization,” scholars mean that “questions of paying for services and programs have become the focusing lens of much legislative action.”60 Simply put, Congress’s business is dominated by periodic high-profile and high-stakes negotiations over crises pertaining to budget deficits, debt ceilings, and government shutdowns. Fiscalization goes hand in hand with consolidated party control, because congressional leaders are best positioned to negotiate these interparty and interbranch disputes in periodic summits with the president.61



Although committee government evolved with the administrative state as a management tool for lawmakers, the shift toward a party-centric Congress didn’t have to harm the legislature’s oversight capacity. In a perfect world, a centralized Congress would compete more efficiently with the president. In this imperfect world, however, lawmakers give priority to party affiliation over Congress as an institution.



As a result, the legislative branch is less inclined to compete with the executive. In the current Congress, for example, Republicans overwhelmingly sided with President Trump when he exercised emergency powers to secure funding otherwise blocked by Congress’s power of the purse.62 On the other hand, Democratic members applauded during the 2013 State of the Union when President Obama declared he would bypass Congress on climate change.63



In addition to deflating institutional pride, centralization disrupted an incentive structure that had encouraged a capable Congress. When lawmakers could leverage their participation in the committee process to influence regulatory policy, they had an impetus to learn administrative law and policy.64 For today’s lawmakers, by contrast, time spent learning how government works is better spent building a following on social media. What’s the point of mastering the details of administrative policymaking when a core group of leadership calls all the shots? Members today enter as generalists, and they’re content to remain generalists.



During committee government, Congress grew committee staffs comprised of “top policy specialists in their fields” to help lawmakers “compete with the expertise of the executive branch and scrutinize the claims of special interests.”65 But strong committees are a threat to centralization, which is why Speaker Gingrich and Republican leadership slashed committee staff by one-third on the first day of the 104th Congress in 1994; the Senate soon followed suit.66 Staffing levels never recovered: there were 2,115 professional personnel in House and Senate standing committees in 2015, or less than two-thirds the total in 1991 (3,528).67 In fact, the current level of committee staffing is commensurate with levels from the early 1970s, even though government has grown much larger and more complex in the ensuing five decades.



Nor have legislative support agencies been spared. In addition to cutting committee staff, one of Speaker Gingrich’s first-day actions in 1995 was to kick Article I agencies out of congressional office space, slash their budgets, and in the case of the Office of Technology Assessment, shutter it altogether.68 Subsequent leadership in both chambers of Congress, regardless of party affiliation, has continued to starve these agencies. In 1991, Article I agencies employed 6,354 professionals; in 2015, the number stood at 3,833. The Government Accountability Office and Congressional Research Service today operate with about 75 percent and 60 percent of their 1975 professional personnel capacity, respectively, despite the increasing size and complexity of the federal government.69 To be fair, congressional leadership has invested in some parts of Congress. From 1995 to 2011, for example, House and Senate leadership staff increased 35 percent and 38 percent, respectively.70



Though perhaps counterintuitive, investment in congressional oversight capacity is essential to any strategy for reining in the admin­istrative state. Without such investment, Congress simply doesn’t have the means to compete with the presidency for managerial primacy over the administrative state. And without this competition, we lose a structural check on government overreach.



It’s a false narrative claim that investment in congressional staff reflects an “expansion of government.” Gingrich advanced the same argument when he dropped the ax on committee staff in 1995, and his real motivation was to consolidate power. President Reagan was the epitome of small-government conservatism, but do you imagine he was concerned about the budget implications of Executive Order 12,291, which created the executive regulatory-review mandate? He ordered White House review into existence with neither congressional authorization nor appropriation.



If Congress must lead by example on fiscal prudence, then lawmakers can “offset” investments in oversight by reallocating the near-billion dollars Congress spends every year on press offices within regulatory agencies, whose underlying value is doubtful.71



During the period of committee government, the legislative and executive branches for the most part were evenly matched. On the one hand, Congress exercised “continuous watchfulness” through standing committees; on the other, presidents employed their constitutional and statutory authorities over officers and the budget, respectively, to influence the domestic regulatory agenda.72 Yet since the peak of committee government, the executive has assumed supremacy over administrative policy. According to congressional scholar Curtis Copeland, “the reality [today] is that on a day‐​to‐​day basis the president exerts a great deal more influence on rulemaking than either the courts or Congress.”73 The president has become the undisputed policymaker in chief.



As the legislature waned, the executive waxed. Since the peak of committee government, the president has cultivated a potent new management tool, one that is “foundational” to this present era of “presidential administration.”74 This means of supervision is known as “White House regulatory review.”



Its roots extend to 1971, when President Nixon’s Office of Management and Budget insti­tuted a process, known as “Quality of Life Review,” to vet public health rules.75 President Ford modified regulatory review by focusing on regulations’ inflationary impact.76 Next, President Carter required regulatory agencies to assess the “economic consequences” of all rules that cost more than $100 million, which were then sent to a “Regulatory Analysis Review Group.”77



Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter set the stage for Ronald Reagan, who ushered in White House regulatory review as we know it today. Whereas previous efforts at centralized review had been largely informal, President Reagan entrenched a systematic process.



In 1981, with the issuance of famed Executive Order 12,291, the Reagan admin­istration required executive—but not independent—agencies to perform a cost‐​benefit analysis, known as a “Regulatory Impact Analysis,” for each proposed or final rule that had an annual effect on the economy of more than $100 million. These agencies then had to submit their rules and associated analyses to the White House for review.78 In 1985, Reagan issued Executive Order 12,498, which added a mandate that each executive agency (but not independent agencies) submit for review an annual regulatory plan listing proposed actions for the year.79



President Reagan located a home for regulatory review by unilaterally expanding the respon­sibilities of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget.80 Notably, the president lacked a statutory basis to do so. Congress had created OIRA in 1980 to manage government paperwork, and lawmakers never intended to empower the president to establish White House regulatory review.81 Although Congress later authorized OIRA and made its administrator’s appointment subject to Senate confirmation,82 President Reagan created the agency on his own.83 OIRA, therefore, is a function of the executive’s “ambition.”



While subsequent administrations have modified this benchmark for weighing costs and benefits,84 they only added to Reagan’s basic framework. President Clinton, for example, created a process by which the president could referee disputes between OIRA and agencies.85 Clinton further expanded the scope of the required annual regulatory plan to include independent agencies.86 President George W. Bush’s administration empowered OIRA to send “prompt letters” to agencies to start the rulemaking process,87 in addition to expanding “informal” review of draft rules before their submission.88 During the Obama administration, OIRA requested, but did not require, independent agencies to submit to White House regulatory review.89 For its part, the Trump administration has signaled that it might require such participation by independent agencies, though it hasn’t yet done so.90



With the establishment of White House regulatory review, presidents seized a powerful tool for managing administrative policy. Through OIRA, the White House can both prompt administrative action and, when action is delivered, compel agency reexamination and even revisions. After President Reagan established OIRA’s review function, administrative law professor Kenneth Culp Davis commented that “the President has thus assumed full power to control the content of rules issued by executive departments and agencies.”91 In the years since, the president’s grip over administrative policy has only tightened as OIRA’s powers have been expanded and refined.



OIRA is among the most misunderstood agencies in the federal government.92 In part, this confusion is due to OIRA’s keeping a low profile, sometimes to the point of opacity.93



OIRA has a staff of about 45, led by a Senate‐​confirmed administrator. Its annual budget is about $50 million.94 In terms of organ­izational structure, OIRA is divided into “branches” that correspond to different policy areas. Within these branches, “desk officers” focus on a small number of agencies. Desk officers are supervised by seasoned policy experts known as “branch chiefs,” who in turn answer to the administrator. When disagreements occur between “desk officers” and the agencies that are subject to White House regulatory review, issues are “elevated” up the respective political chains (at the regulatory agency and the Office of Management and Budget), all the way to the president.95



White House regulatory review doesn’t cover all rules but instead is limited to “significant regulatory action” by executive branch agencies. A rule is “significant” if its “annual effect on the economy” exceeds $100 million or if the rule “raise[s] novel legal or policy issues.”96 Within the executive branch, OIRA has the final say on which administrative policies are “significant regulatory actions.”



With respect to regulatory review, former OIRA administrator Cass Sunstein has described OIRA’s primary role as being an “information aggregator” of interagency comments and input from outside experts.97 Another key OIRA function is the vetting of an agency’s regulatory impact analysis, a cost‐​benefit analysis required by executive order for all significant rules.98 Importantly, OIRA doesn’t conduct independent cost‐​benefit analyses; rather, the office shapes how the agency conducts its analysis in accordance with the president’s policy priorities.



Relative to other agencies, OIRA is modest in size, but it punches far above its weight. Sunstein quantified OIRA’s aggregate effect on regulatory policymaking as follows:



OIRA reviewed 2,304 regulatory actions between January 11, 2009 and August 10, 2012. In that period, 320 actions, or about 14%, were approved without change; 161 actions, or about 7% were withdrawn; and 1,758 actions, or about 76%, were approved “consistent with change.” In assessing the importance of review, it is important to note that the words “consistent with change” reveal that the published rule is different from the submitted rule, but do not specify the magnitude of the change. In some cases, the changes are minor … in others, they are substantial.99



In sum, presidents have adopted White House regulatory review to manage administrative policymaking. The process dates to the Nixon administration’s “Quality of Life Review” vetting of public health rules, and it became institutionalized when President Reagan located this function in the newly created OIRA. Congress never authorized White House regulatory review; instead, presidents unilaterally took the initiative. Due to the executive branch’s self‐​empowerment, scholars refer to the present era of American governance as being one of “presidential administration.”



After the Second World War, standing committees competed with the president to manage domestic regulatory agencies. Over the past 40 years, however, committees receded, crucial customs disappeared, and oversight capacity generally diminished. While Congress faded, presidents filled the power vacuum by establishing and refining White House regulatory review—all without a legislative mandate. In this context, the need for some sort of Article I response to OIRA practically jumps off the page.



Historically, Congress has parried the president’s institutional thrusts in the fight for supremacy over the administrative state. In 1921, for example, when Congress ceded budget formulation duties to the president, lawmakers concomitantly created the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) to “investigate all matters relating to the receipt, disbursement, and application of public funds.”100 Another example is the competition between the two political branches for management primacy over domestic regulatory agencies in the wake of the Progressive and New Deal eras. As previously noted, President Roosevelt recommended the concentration of power in the presidency to best protect liberty from the possibility of arbitrary bureaucratic governance. Congress, however, declined FDR’s advice and instead invested in congressional committees and legislative support agencies.



Perhaps the most relevant historical touchstone is the creation of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). In the 1960s and 1970s, Congress became increasingly concerned that the presidency possessed an unfair advantage in formulating the budget, by virtue of the office’s exclusive access to macroeconomic data within the White House bureaucracy. To address this informational asymmetry, lawmakers in 1974 created a new Article I agency, the CBO, to provide economic analysis independent of the White House. The parallel to the present is obvious: just as Congress created the CBO to rectify its reliance on the president’s budget data, so the legislature needs an Article I OIRA to end the president’s advantage conferred by White House regulatory review.



In addition to the historical example, there is a pragmatic impetus for creating congressional regulatory review. In 1983, the Supreme Court invalidated the legislative veto, which for decades had been Congress’s most powerful tool for supervising administrative action.101 Thirteen years later, lawmakers adopted a constitutionally permissible legislative veto by passing the Congressional Review Act.102 The act, however, deprives lawmakers of an informed choice. At present, members deliberating on a legislative veto are limited to information from biased sources—either the president behind the rule or special interests aligned on one side or the other of a given regulatory policy.



During the 115th Congress, for example, lawmakers enacted 15 disapproval resolutions, a major increase over historical practice.103 While Congress’s increased willingness to check administrative action is a welcome devel­opment, this flurry of legislative vetoes demonstrates the inadequacy of the current process. No committee held a hearing, much less a vote, on any of the measures, nor did any committee issue any reports. For each of the legislative vetoes, Congress failed to perform any investigation or analysis. An Article I version of OIRA would redress this analytical imperative.



Congress has recognized its oversight shortcomings in the past. Two decades ago, during the 106th Congress, a bipartisan coa­lition passed the Truth in Regulating Act of 2000, which authorized a pilot program for congressional regulatory review modeled on OIRA.104 Speaking in support of the bill on the House floor, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) explained, “The most basic reason for supporting this bill is constitutional, as Congress needs a Congressional Budget Office to check and balance the executive branch in the budget office, so too does it need an analytic capa­bility to check and balance the executive branch in the regulatory process.” The act, Ryan added, would render Congress “better equipped to review final agency rules under the [Congressional Review Act].”105



Regulatory review, alas, never got off the ground in Congress. The Truth in Regulating Act of 2000 authorized a three‐​year pilot program for a legislative response to OIRA, but lawmakers refused to fund the experiment, and the program expired in 2004 without ever vetting a rule.106



There’s a glaring need for a legislative counter to White House regulatory review, but how do we get there? Any attempt to address this imbalance of power must survive a polarized Congress, where partisanship runs especially hot on regulatory policy.107



First, there’s the problem of picking the leader of the new legislative support agency, a question that bedeviled prior reform efforts. In 1998, during the 105th Congress, committees in both the House and Senate passed bills that would create a new Article I agency called the Congressional Office of Regulatory Affairs, with responsibilities such as those advanced in this paper.108 Support for the bill within the Republican‐​controlled Congress broke down largely along partisan lines, and a leading Democratic criticism was that the new agency would do the majority’s bidding.109 During the next Congress, lawmakers passed the Truth in Regulating Act of 2000, which, again, authorized Article I regulatory review. So why did the 106th Congress pass reform where the Congressional Office of Regulatory Affairs had failed in the 105th Congress? A major reason is that the later bill elided the difficult question of agency leadership by housing a pilot program in the existing Government Accountability Office,110 whose director (the comptroller general) the president appoints and the Senate confirms.111



Similarly, any new proposal for a legislative regulatory review could place the process in the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and thereby duck the divisive question of how to choose the new agency’s leadership. Much can be said against this approach, however. Program audits, the sine qua non of the GAO, are fundamentally different from regulatory review; that is, the two agencies reflect distinct missions. More importantly, the GAO has already demonstrated a reluctance, if not hostility, to taking on regulatory review. From the outset, the agency never sought to exercise its Truth in Regulating Act authorities, nor did it mourn these authorities’ demise. And the Congressional Review Act required the office to “assess” rules under consideration, but the GAO interprets this mandate narrowly to avoid any analytical responsibilities.112 The GAO’s repeated rejection of opportunities to press for regulatory review speaks volumes.



In the current (116th) Congress, the House and Senate are each under a different party’s control. Accordingly, there is no danger that one party could shut out the other from selecting someone to lead the new legislative version of OIRA. But could the parties ever compromise on regulatory review? That seems very unlikely.



At a fundamental level, there is no room for agreement because assumptions are essential to cost‐​benefit analyses, a crucial cog in the machinery of regulatory review. Assumptions, in turn, are values based, which means they’re inextricably political. Due to their distinct values (read: politics), Democrats and Republicans in the modern Congress would almost certainly fail to achieve an understanding on the assessment of costs and benefits. Thus, they would be unable to agree on how to conduct regulatory review. Division is baked into the process and likely explains why the GAO wanted no part of OIRA’s authorities.



In this political environment, the traditional model for Article I agencies—a single organization headed by a nonpartisan director—won’t work. It’s not simply a matter of agreeing on leadership. One office cannot serve two masters with mutually exclusive conceptions of regulatory review. The only way to cut the Gordian knot of partisan disagreement is to arm each side with its own sword. Instead of adopting the historical model of a single “nonpartisan” organization, Congress should create two versions of OIRA—one for the majority and the other for the minority. Under this proposal, each side would gain its own mechanism to compete with the president for management primacy over the administrative state, in accordance with each side’s values.



The new agencies would combine political direction with a nonpartisan staff whose primary loyalty is to Congress as an institution. In terms of contemporary analogs, the idea is to pair the bifurcated (majority/​minority) leadership structure of a generic standing committee with the highly capable and nonpartisan staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.113



In sum, past congressional efforts to create an OIRA‐​like office foundered because lawmakers designed a traditional Article I agency with a single director. To work, any such office must reflect the political realities of a polarized Congress by serving both parties independently.



A bifurcated congressional office of regulatory affairs would perform a role that is similar to White House regulatory review.



In the executive branch, OIRA provides the president’s team with regulatory analysis that is independent of the agencies that wrote the regulations. In the legislative branch, a regulatory office would provide the two parties with regulatory analysis that is independent of the president. In both cases, the purpose is to allow the principals—the president and Congress—to better manage the administrative state.



Just as OIRA solicits input from regulatory agencies and outside parties, so too could each party’s respective legislative equivalent in Congress. And just as OIRA requires agencies to re‐​run their cost‐​benefits analysis, so too could the congressional counterparts to White House regulatory review.



In one important manner, legislative review would have a far greater scope. To date, the president has respected the “inde­pendence” of agencies whose leadership enjoys employment protections from at‐​will removal by the president.114 As the creator of all agencies—executive or independent—Congress’s reach would extend to the administrative state’s entire domain.



Although its scope would be wider than OIRA’s, legislative regulatory review would entail far fewer regulations than its White House counterpart. OIRA reviews about 500 “significant” administrative actions every year; the Article I OIRAs could focus their energies on the most important policies—regulatory or deregulatory.



To facilitate the flow of information, Congress must overhaul its current approach to “legislative affairs” offices within domestic regulatory agencies. First, lawmakers should take these liaisons out of the executive branch and relocate them in the legislative branch. Legislative affairs offices were created to inform Congress, but they’ve been co‐​opted by the executive branch and now function primarily to stall congressional inquiries. By assuming direct leadership, Congress would ensure the integrity of these functions. Second, Congress should increase spending on these reconstituted Article I adjuncts within regulatory agencies so that they can shepherd the information requests that would drive legislative regulatory review.



The new‐​and‐​improved agency liaisons would work hand in hand with the congressional office of regulatory affairs. With time, legislative regulatory review could develop a distinct operational culture as it evolves in response to the respective needs of the party caucuses in Congress.



To what ends would Congress use this infor­mation? Ideally, this knowledge would complement broader reforms that give lawmakers a bigger hand in regulating the regulators. Under the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, for example, Congress would have to affirm major rules before they took effect.115 If the REINS Act passed, then some sort of independent regulatory office would become glaring—without it, lawmakers would be woefully underinformed for the duties they reserved for themselves.



But even absent such sweeping (and necessary) reforms, there remains an acute need for independent analysis during the window of time that lawmakers are afforded to veto a regulation under the Congressional Review Act. When deliberating over the fate of a major regulation, Congress currently relies on information from special interests or the administration (the biggest special interest). It’s an analytical problem that lawmakers recognized soon after passing the Congressional Review Act. As previously explained, later Congresses sought to fix the legislative veto by establishing a regulatory office akin to the proposal in this paper.



More broadly, legislative regulatory review would strengthen Congress’s atrophied capacity for oversight. Appropriators would be afforded better understanding of agencies within their jurisdiction. Standing committees would have an independent baseline against which to audit agency performance.



At present, there is a gross asymmetry between the two political branches when it comes to information about the administrative state. This imbalance undermines lawmakers’ express statutory responsibility—and implicit constitutional duty—to oversee agencies that are, after all, created and funded by Congress. Regarding the competition among political branches, self‐​help is a feature, not a bug of the constitutional system. By investing in an OIRA‐​like function for Congress, legislators similarly would demonstrate fidelity to the Framers’ design.



As the saying goes, “you can bring a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.” In proposing a legislative response to OIRA, this paper assumes that the contemporary Congress—as an institution (instead of as constituent polit­ical parties)—cares to compete with the president in managing domestic regulatory agencies. But is this assumption correct? On this question, there is reason for doubt.



Driving such skepticism is the relative ease of administrative action compared with passing laws. President Obama, for example, resorted to “pen and phone” to implement a suite of policies that had failed to survive the legislative process.116 Notwithstanding President Trump’s deregulatory agenda,117 for every law Congress passed in 2018, regulatory agencies promulgated 12 rules that are effectively indistinguishable from legislation.118 Presidents can simply order subordinates to conduct rulemaking with the force of law; it’s much more difficult for Congress to pass a bill in two chambers and then get the president’s signature.



The comparative efficiency of “presidential administration” undercuts institutional ambition within a polarized Congress. When the president serves as the modern fount of law‐​like action by the federal government, and party leaders run a centralized Congress, there is a corresponding danger that the legislature becomes a means to executive ends. In more concrete terms, the risk is that one side would mindlessly cover for the president and that the other side—equally mindlessly—would seek to undermine the president so that “their guy” can assume the Oval Office and start getting things done. In this zero‐​sum game, no one would be pressing the interests of Congress as an institution.



It’s an alarming possibility, one that offends the Constitution twice over. To begin with, the administrative state is composed of regulatory agencies that exercise lawmaking, law‐​prosecuting, and law‐​judging functions in considerable tension with separation‐​of‐​powers principles. Congress’s abandonment of competition with the president would reflect a distinct constitutional breach—namely, a failure of the “ambition” on which the Framers’ relied.



The “declared purpose” behind the Framers’ constitutional structure is “to diffus[e] power the better to secure liberty.”119 Within this design, presidents have acted precisely as the Framers intended; Congress, however, has struggled to keep pace. If lawmakers still have the will to compete, then here is a proposed institutional design for legislative regulatory review. Because this function is inherently polit­ical, lawmakers would have to bifurcate legislative regulatory review for it to survive in a polarized Congress. In this manner, each side would gain the capacity to compete with the president over management of the administrative state.

The government of Ukraine reaffirmed its desire to join NATO. The alliance said the door is open for Kiev. It’s an idea that only grows worse with age.



Earlier this week Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko met NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in Kiev, proclaiming that “Ukraine has clearly defined its political future and its future in the sphere of security,” as part of the transatlantic alliance. Discussions are to begin on a Membership Action Plan and, Petroshenko added, his government would pursue reforms in order to “have a clear schedule of what must be done by 2020 to meet the NATO membership criteria.”



Stoltenberg was noncommittal but positive: “NATO will continue to support Ukraine on the path towards a close relationship with NATO, to implementing reforms and to meeting NATO standards.” A membership decision would be up to “the allies and Ukraine to decide, no one else has a right to veto such a process.” Moreover, he added, “NATO will continue to provide Ukraine with practical support.”



It’s easy to understand why a majority of Ukrainians want NATO’s protection. They really want America’s protection. And who wouldn’t like the global superpower to take over one’s defense? Their country established its first contact with the alliance in 1991 when Ukraine joined the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. Since then Kiev has received aid and support while contributing troops to some allied operations.



NATO worked great for the Western Europeans during the Cold War. Since then Central and Eastern European nations have clambered on board. The Baltic States too. Even Montenegro got on the gravy train earlier this year, despite doing nothing to make America more secure. With European countries continuing to lag well behind the U.S. in military outlays as well as spending as a percentage of GDP, Kiev recognized the sweet deal to be had.



Western officials insist that no third party, i.e., Russia, has any say on who joins the alliance. That’s fine as far as it goes. But that isn’t very far. Neither should the nation seeking to enter have a say. NATO should add nations only if they increase the security of the whole.





NATO should add nations only if they increase the security of the whole.



And given the fact that the U.S. would do most of the heavy lifting in any conflict with nuclear‐​armed Russia, the critical question for Washington is whether adding a new member would increase _Americans’_ security. Montenegro, a bit like the Duchy of Grand Fenwick of the novel _The Mouse that Roared_ , is largely a nullity, a microstate with 2000 men under arms threatened by no one. Podgorica’s membership didn’t help America, but it probably didn’t hurt much either.



Ukraine is a dramatically worse candidate on both political and security grounds. NATO theoretically insists that its members meet minimal democratic standards. Admittedly, there’s no hard‐​and‐​fast rule. Montenegro was a bit dubious. The political systems of Bulgaria and Romania leave something to be desired. Prospective members such as Kosovo and Macedonia have serious problems. If democracy really mattered, Turkey’s descent into autocracy would put it outside the alliance.



Kiev, too, has far to go. Nominally democratic, the current president came to power after a street revolution against the previously elected, though notoriously corrupt, president. Wealthy oligarchs hold disproportionate power (including the presidency today), while extreme nationalists exercise worrisome influence. Even European leaders couldn’t ignore the obvious. At the recent EU‐​Ukraine summit following Europe’s approval of an Association Agreement, European Commission President Jean‐​Claude Juncker said: “What we are asking … is to increase the fight against corruption, because corruption is undermining all the efforts this great nation is undertaking.”



The human rights group Freedom House gave Ukraine a poor score, three of seven for both political rights and civil liberties, and an overall rating of “partly free.” Freedom House warned that the failure to prosecute “extensive high‐​level corruption has undermined the popularity of the government and affected reform efforts in a wide range of sectors,” while “political pressure and attacks on journalists have threatened freedom of the press.”



The State Department’s latest human rights report on Ukraine ran 60 pages. State noted conflict‐​related abuses in the Donbas (though more by the separatists), “impunity from corruption and deficiencies in the administration of justice,” harsh treatment of prisoners, attacks on journalists, sexual trafficking and forced labor, failure to prosecute officials for human rights abuses, and a “climate of impunity.”



Russia’s support for separatists in the east obviously has contributed to Ukraine’s political instability and true reformers could eventually come to the fore. However, the country suffered through a succession of authoritarian, corrupt, and incompetent leaders since the Soviet break‐​up. Even without Moscow’s interference Ukraine’s politicians have consistently fallen short of providing the responsible leadership their people need. Odds are poor on Kiev turning around in the next three years.



While Kiev’s political problems could be remedied, its security deficiencies cannot be so easily resolved. Ukraine would be a huge security black hole for NATO and especially America. So long as the alliance purports to have even a vague relationship to U.S. security interests, Ukraine has no place in NATO.



Historically Washington had little concern about a territory which spent most of the last two centuries as part of either the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union. Ukraine was viewed as a “captive nation” whose liberation in 1991 was warmly welcomed. But its independence, though seen as a moral good, didn’t matter much militarily. True, the more pieces into which the Soviet Union broke, the better for a dominant America. But the U.S. would vastly outrange whatever Russia emerged, irrespective of Kiev’s status.



Nothing has changed over the last quarter century. Russia’s relationship with Ukraine won’t materially change Washington’s dominant position, with a substantially stronger military, vastly larger economy, and far greater array of allies. Europe enjoys similar advantages. Indeed, Moscow’s entanglement in the Donbas actually weakens Russia, draining military resources, intensifying Ukrainian hostility, and justifying economic sanctions. An attempt to conquer Ukraine, which was hard enough for the Soviet Union to digest, would be a disaster for the Russian state.



But adding Kiev to NATO would also bring in Ukraine’s conflict with Moscow. Of course, the Putin government is primarily in the wrong. Grabbing Crimea was a crime of opportunity after the collapse of the Yanukovych government—albeit supported by many of the nominal “victims,” since Crimea once was part of Russia. Encouraging ethnic‐​Russian separatists in the east has worked out less well for Moscow. President Vladimir Putin may have overestimated support for secession or simply intended to weaken Kiev and keep the latter embroiled in conflict. However, moral blame doesn’t change the fact that it’s a conflict in which Washington has no place.



America simply has no interest at stake worth confronting a nuclear‐​armed power. Especially when Russia’s security interests are immediate, serious, and obvious. The best way to understand Moscow today is as a pre‐​1914 great power, concerned about international respect and secure borders. The U.S. and NATO ignored both when expanding the transatlantic alliance up to Russia’s borders, almost in sight of St. Petersburg. Dismantling Moscow’s long‐​time friend Serbia was another affront. Promising Georgia and Ukraine NATO membership compounded Russia’s anger. Then came the allies’ support in 2014 for a street putsch against the elected Viktor Yanukovych, who leaned toward Moscow. While this litany may not justify Russian policy, it certainly helps explain Putin’s actions. And, truth be told, Washington would not react well if Russia helped oust a pro‐​American government in Mexico City.



Despite NATO’s official welcome to Kiev’s membership efforts, a number of European states remain deeply skeptical of its candidacy. Moreover, all applicants are supposed to resolve any territorial disputes before they are eligible for inclusion. That seemingly rules out Ukraine, but is true only so long as conflict rages in the Donbas. So if Kiev is seeking NATO membership and the alliance is receptive, Russia has an incentive to keep the geopolitical pot boiling. Ironically, peace risks triggering what Moscow most fears: further NATO expansion and encirclement.



The U.S. and Russian governments, in consultation with the other NATO members, should go deep to forge a lasting peace. The foundation of any agreement should be an American and alliance pledge that Kiev will not be inducted into NATO. Moscow would not be exercising a veto. Rather, America and Europe would be exercising good judgment about their own security. Adding Ukraine to the alliance would make them less secure.



As part of such an agreement Ukrainians would be free to trade either east or west and Kiev would be free to join the European Union if it met the membership criteria. Russia would stay out of Kiev’s already fractious politics. Ukraine would allow greater regional decentralization, especially in the Donbas. Moscow would end its support for ethnic Russian separatists. The U.S. and EU would lift economic sanctions on Russia.



Crimea poses the toughest challenge. Moscow should agree to hold an internationally monitored referendum and respect the result. However, no Russian government is likely to yield Crimea under any circumstance, short of losing a general war. After the annexation, Putin announced: “NATO remains a military alliance. I do not want to be welcomed in Sevastopol by NATO sailors.” In which case the second best result might be official non‐​recognition but informal acceptance.



Of course, Kiev should be free to set its own policy. However, the U.S. and Europe should indicate their intention to settle their dispute with Moscow, if at all possible. Moreover, under no circumstance should the allies extend security guarantees to Ukraine. The latter’s desire for NATO membership is understandable, but inimical to the interests of current members.



Instead of creating uncertainty, raising Kiev’s hopes while intensifying Moscow’s paranoia, the U.S. and its NATO allies should finally and firmly tell Ukraine no on joining the transatlantic alliance. Then all parties could move on in search of a practical resolution to the conflict in Ukraine.

"More than 1.7 billion people worldwide still don’t have a reliable electricity connection. For many of them, solar power is their potential energy saviour – at least when the sun is shining. Technology to store excess solar power during the dark hours is improving. But what if we could generate electricity from the cold night sky? Researchers at Stanford and UCLA have just done exactly that. Don’t expect it to become solar’s dark twin just yet, but it could play an important role in the energy demands of the future. The technology itself is nothing new – in fact, the principles behind it were discovered almost 200 years ago. The device, called a thermoelectric generator, uses temperature differences between two metal plates to generate electricity through something called the Seebeck effect. The greater the temperature difference, the greater the power generated. We already use this technology to convert waste heat from sources such as industrial machinery and car engines. The new research applies the same technique to harness the temperature difference between the outside air and a surface which faces the sky. The device’s two plates sit on top of one another. The top plate faces the cold air of the open night sky, while the bottom plate is kept enclosed in warmer air, facing the ground. Heat always radiates to cooler environments, and the cooler the environment, the faster heat is radiated. Because the open night sky is cooler than the enclosed air surrounding the bottom plate, the top plate loses heat faster than the bottom plate. This generates a temperature difference between the two plates – in this study, between four and five degrees celsius. Now at different temperatures, heat also starts to travel from the hotter bottom plate to the cooler top plate. The device harnesses this flow of heat to generate electricity. At this small temperature difference, power is limited. The researchers’ device produced just 25 milliwatts per meter squared (mW/m²) – enough to power a small LED reading light. By contrast, a solar panel of the same size would be enough to sustain three 32"" LED TVs – that’s 4,000 times more power. In dryer climates, the device could perform better. This is because in wetter climates, any moisture in the air condenses on the downward-facing bottom plate, cooling it and reducing the temperature difference between the plates. In the dry Mediterranean, for example, the device could produce 20 times more power than it did in the US. The device itself could also be refined. For example, manufacturers could apply a coating that allows the device’s surface to reach a temperature lower than the surrounding environment during the day, so that it is even cooler at night. They could also use corrugated instead of flat plates, which are more efficient at capturing and emitting radiation. These and other feasible tech upgrades could raise the power output by as much as ten times.  With the efficiency of everyday technologies continually improving, thermolectric devices could play an important role in powering society before long. Colleagues of mine are developing technology that connects household devices to the internet and each other – the so called Internet of Things – at power levels of just 1.5 megawatts per meter squared (MW/m²), a level of energy firmly within the reach of an enhanced device in dry climates. By connecting a series of thermoelectric generators mounted on the walls of homes, the technology could noticeably lighten the energy load of houses. It’s feasible, too – the technology could easily be mass produced, and sold cheaply enough to provide a viable energy source in locations where it is too expensive or impractical to connect with mains electricity. Of course, it’s unlikely that thermoelectric devices will ever replace battery storage as the nighttime saviour of solar energy. Batteries now cost a quarter of what they did a decade ago, and solar systems with battery storage are already becoming affordable ways to meet small-scale domestic and industrial energy needs. But the technology could be a useful complement to solar power and battery storage – and a vital back-up energy source for those living off-grid when batteries fail or panels break. When everything goes wrong on the chilliest of nights, those with thermoelectric devices to power a heater would at least have one thing to thank the freezing night air for."
"**FarmVille, once the most popular game on Facebook, is to close down in December, more than 11 years after its launch.**
At its peak, FarmVille had more than 80 million players tending to crops and raising animals - and asking Facebook friends for help.
But the social network will stop supporting Flash-based games in December, rendering it unplayable.
Maker Zynga encouraged players to spend any remaining credits before then.
In-app purchases will be available until 17 November, after which the game's payment system will be turned off.
Zynga is planning a number of in-game activities to allow fans to give the game a send-off.
Its other farming games, including FarmVille 2 and Tropic Escape, are available on mobile and will not be affected.
FarmVille 3 is also due for release on mobile soon.
Zynga thanked its fans for ""an incredible 11 years"" - and explained the demise of Adobe Flash Player was behind the decision.
""As previously stated, Adobe will stop distributing and updating Flash Player for all web browsers and Facebook will stop supporting Flash games on the platform completely after December 31 2020,"" it said.
""FarmVille will therefore be directly affected as a result of this.
""We are aware that many of you have been with us since the very beginning, helping to build an incredible global community of players over the years who've enjoyed this game just as much as we have.
""For that, we say thank you.""
Ampere Analysis games research director Piers Harding-Rolls said: ""The game was synonymous with the explosion in social-network gaming in the late 2000s, primarily on Facebook.
""But that market was heavily disrupted by the mass adoption of smartphones and related app stores.
""And the social-network gaming market on PC shrunk significantly.
""The broader internet industry's decision to turn a corner on Flash by the end of 2020 and the closure of FarmVille will not have a significant impact on Zynga's bottom line.""
Adobe Systems announced in 2017 it planned to phase out its Flash Player plug-in this year.
The technology was once one of the most widely used ways to watch video clips and play games.
But flaws in its code meant it became a popular way for hackers to infect computers.
And much of its functionality has been replaced by HTML5 technology."
"One way to regard the refugees in the news these frenzied past few days is as potential Americans, individuals and families escaping bad situations who imagine themselves building new lives here. What these particular refugees could become in this country, and how they could contribute to our society and culture, is a question stuck in suspended animation. But we do have the power to look to the past. And in the literary realm it’s unquestionable that refugees, once here, often make major contributions. Through the 20th century and into this one, those fleeing political persecution or war have produced important works that we think of now as at least partly American, from fiction about the harrowing experiences of exile and dislocation to political treatises by thinkers who want to understand why their homelands fell apart. This is a sampling of 25 of those works. Bertolt Brecht, “The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui” (1941) Country of origin: GermanyReason for leaving: Fled Nazi Germany for Denmark in 1933, and then came to the United States in 1941 when war broke out. Brecht always intended his satire about the ruthless ascension of a Chicago mobster to be performed on an American stage. He is mocking Adolf Hitler, each dopey and villainous character having a Nazi counterpart in real life. The character of the populist bully, who has a penchant for both public speaking and private   was central in Brecht’s mind during his wartime exile. Hans Augusto Rey and Margret Rey, “Curious George” (1941) Country of origin: GermanyReason for Leaving: German Jews who escaped from their native Hamburg to Brazil and then France, only to leave again for the United States in 1940 just as the Nazis invaded. The mischievous monkey who had a canny way of getting in and out of trouble originated in the minds of Hans Augusto and Margret Rey. They conceived of the character while themselves trying to outrun the Nazis, finally escaping from France on homemade bicycles and carrying the manuscript with the first mention of George (then called “Zozo”) along with them. Karl Polanyi, “The Great Transformation” (1944) Country of origin: AustriaReason for Leaving: With Hitler’s rise, prominent socialists like Polanyi were imperiled, so he left for England in 1933 and then arrived in Vermont in 1940. After settling down to teach at Bennington College, Polanyi published his major work, which looked at how the Industrial Revolution was so disruptive that it created the conditions for both Communism and fascism. But capitalism, he argued, did not happen spontaneously. It required an enormous amount of government planning in order to function. “  was planned,” was his counterintuitive summation. Thomas Mann, “Doctor Faustus” (1947) Country of origin: GermanyReason for leaving: An opponent of Hitler’s rise, Mann left for Switzerland in 1933 and eventually emigrated to the United States in 1939. Mann, in his California exile, took the Faust legend and placed it in the context of the rise and fall of Nazi Germany. His main character, a composer, strikes a deal with a Mephistophelean figure to give him creative glory. But madness is the   which becomes an allegory for where Germany is headed. Theodor Adorno, “The Authoritarian Personality” (1950) Country of origin: GermanyReasons for leaving: After being dismissed from his teaching position in 1932 by the Nazis, Adorno left to study at Oxford and then moved to the United States in 1938. Adorno wanted to understand what kind of personality type was susceptible to fascism. He found his answer, via Freud, in a harsh parenting style that led to the kind of person who would crave the approval and guidance of an authoritarian. Hannah Arendt, “The Origins of Totalitarianism” (1951) Country of origin: GermanyReasons for leaving: In 1933, Arendt, a German Jew, left her country and eventually settled in Paris, where she helped Jewish refugees. Once the Vichy regime took over, she herself was interned as an “enemy alien,” but managed to emigrate and settle in New York in 1941. Like Adorno and the other German Jewish emigrants of her generation, Arendt was fixated on the question of why democratic institutions collapse and authoritarianism rises. In her major political work, she dissected both Nazism and Stalinism as instantiations of a new type of politics, one that utilized terror and fear to subjugate populations and gain their acquiescence. Leo Strauss, “Natural Right and History” (1953) Country of origin: GermanyReasons for leaving: Already teaching in England when the Nazis came to power, Strauss was prevented from returning and moved to the United States in 1937. In six lectures given from his perch at the University of Chicago, Strauss laid out his argument about what he saw as modernity’s nihilistic rejection of classical philosophy. The immutable truths of Plato and Aristotle needed to be appreciated again. Once we follow the thought of these ancient philosophers we will see more clearly what should distinguish right and wrong in ethics and politics. Vladimir Nabokov, “Lolita” (1955) Country of origin: RussiaReasons for leaving: Born to Russian nobility, Nabokov and his family fled the Bolshevik Revolution, living in a succession of European countries. He eventually moved to America in 1940, where he took up work as an entomologist at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, among other jobs. In his most famous and controversial novel, Nabokov took up the story of Humbert Humbert, a man obsessed with a young girl, his nymphet, Lolita. In what is essentially the tale of a sordid road trip, Nabokov has Humbert traveling the country in possession of his illicit love interest. The book is filled with Nabokov’s own observations about an America that still felt foreign and exciting to him. Isabel Allende, “The House of the Spirits” (1982) Country of origin: ChileReasons for leaving: Allende fled to Venezuela in 1973 after the coup that brought down Salvador Allende, the socialist leader and her father’s cousin. She moved to California in the late 1980s. Drawing on the circumstances of her own exile, Allende used her debut novel to tell a multigenerational saga that takes place in an unnamed country very much like Chile. We see the destruction of democracy and the rise of a cruel dictator who tries to eliminate all opposition. “I wanted to show that life goes in a circle, events are intertwined, and that history repeats itself, there is no beginning and no end,” Allende said about her sprawling,   narrative. Czeslaw Milosz, “Bells in Winter” (1985) Country of origin: PolandReason for leaving: After surviving World War II in Poland and initially joining the postwar Communist government, Milosz defected in 1951, eventually emigrating to the United States in 1960. The Polish poet and Nobel Prize winner produced a quietly meditative work in 1985 that pointed toward the mysterious quality of existence, the inability to fully understand our own natures. “Life was impossible, but was endured,” he writes in “Recess,” capturing the exile’s lament, the alienation of deracination, of living an arm’s length away from oneself. Joseph Brodsky, “Less Than One” (1986) Country of origin: Soviet UnionReason for leaving: Put on trial and into psychiatric institutions for his dissident beliefs, Brodsky was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1972. Brodsky was interested in the poet’s role in society, and these essays, which deal with politics, literature and his own personal experience of exile, all get at this question. For him, poetry was “the most democratic art,” as he says in an essay about the West Indian poet Derek Walcott. It’s the poet’s embrace of individuality that makes him a necessary counterpoint  —   an important thorn  —   to the state. Nuruddin Farah, “Maps” (1986) Country of origin: SomaliaReasons for leaving: Exiled from Somalia in the   for writing about life under the harsh rule of the dictator Mohammed Siad Barre. In the first novel of his trilogy, “Blood in the Sun,” Farrah writes about a young man, an orphan, obsessed with his own origins. Growing up dislocated in the big city of Mogadishu and tormented by the need to avenge his father’s death, the boy reflects all the struggles of national identity in a country torn from the traditional past and thrust into a violent future. Ariel Dorfman, “Death and the Maiden” (1990) Country of origin: ChileReasons for leaving: A cultural adviser to the deposed socialist leader Salvador Allende, Dorfman was forced to flee the country in 1973. In his revenge fantasy of a play, Dorfman dramatized the confrontation between a woman who was tortured by a Latin American regime and the   thug who supposedly did the torturing. She puts him on trial through a long night. Is this really the man who tortured her with electricity to the strains of Schubert, or is she making a paranoid mistake? In this confusion lies Dorfman’s own feelings about the evasive quality of redemption. Reinaldo Arenas, “Before Night Falls” (1992) Country of origin: CubaReasons for leaving: Imprisoned for his writing, he was able to emigrate to America as part of the Mariel Boatlift in 1980. Published after his suicide in 1990, Arenas’s memoir tell his whole life story, from his impoverished youth all the way to his decision to kill himself. It’s also a tale of political disillusion and the pain of exile. Arenas was a true believer in Castro, but after being locked up for being gay he begins a process of losing more of himself, until he is left without a homeland. Cristina Garcia, “Dreaming in Cuban” (1992) Country of origin: CubaReasons for leaving: Her family was among the first wave of people to escape from Cuba in 1961 shortly after Fidel Castro took power. Garcia’s first novel looked at three generations of women exiled from Cuba, all with complex feelings about the country, from love and nostalgia to revulsion. For the daughter of a revolutionary, now living in New York, her memories are of being raped by one of Castro’s young followers. “She wants no part of Cuba,” Garcia writes of this young woman, “no part of its wretched carnival floats creaking with lies, no part of Cuba at all. ” Henry Kissinger, “Diplomacy” (1994) Country of origin: GermanyReasons for leaving: A German Jew, he fled with his family in 1938. The former secretary of state tried to sum up in this book his realist foreign policy approach, taking a historical tour from Europe in the 17th century all the way up to his years working for Presidents Nixon and Ford. Realpolitik here is the attempt to achieve stability through a careful balancing of world powers. Scarred by his own experience growing up in Nazi Germany, Kissinger has always been alive to the fragility of democracy, a feeling that has guided his approach, one that abhors idealism. Loung Ung, “First They Killed My Father” (2001) Country of origin: CambodiaReasons for leaving: Escaped from Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge regime in 1979, ending up in Vermont. Ung’s memoir of life near the edge of the “killing fields” is a harrowing attempt at a collective document. “If you had been living in Cambodia during this period, this would be your story too,” she writes. Her father was killed, and she was starved and near death by the time she managed to enter a Vietnamese refugee camp. It’s a story that is told straightforwardly. When Ung asks her father why the Khmer Rouge are acting so violently, he answers simply, “Because they are destroyers of things. ” Madeleine Albright, “Madam Secretary” (2003) Country of origin: CzechoslovakiaReasons for leaving: Hitler’s takeover of parts of Czechoslovakia forced her family, supporters of the early Czech democrat Edvard Benes, to go into exile and finally emigrate to the United States in 1948. Albright recounts her years as secretary of state during the Clinton presidency and the unlikely path she took as a Czech refugee, whose family fled both Hitler and later Communism. She also grapples with an unexpected twist in her family story. Late in life, Albright discovered that her parents were Jewish. They had converted to Catholicism and never revealed this secret to her, or that her grandparents had perished as Jews in a Nazi concentration camp. Dinaw Mengestu, “The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears” (2007) Country of origin: EthiopiaReasons for leaving: His family fled Ethiopia’s Communist revolution in 1980, when he was 2, and they found their way to Peoria, Ill. In his first novel, Mengestu captured the world of immigrants and refugees in Washington, D. C. as they gather at a Logan Circle grocery store and reminisce about homes they can’t go back to. “How was I supposed to live in America,” says Sepha Stephanos, the book’s protagonist and the store’s owner, “when I had never really left Ethiopia?” Ishmael Beah, “A Long Way Gone” (2007) Country of origin: Sierra LeoneReasons for leaving: Forced to become a child soldier at the age of 12, Beah eventually escaped Freetown in 1997 with the help of Unicef and ended up in New York City. Beah’s memoir offers a rare chance to see war from the eyes of a child soldier, brainwashed and kept obedient with drugs and guns. But the bleakness of this account is also tempered with the redemption that comes at the end. He gets out. And the very act of reading as he tells the story of his past is indication that a nightmare like this can end. Masha Gessen, “The Man Without a Face” (2012) Country of origin: Soviet UnionReasons for leaving: Gessen’s family was Jewish and denied religious freedom in the Soviet Union (or the right to freely emigrate). In 1981 her family was granted permission to leave. Gessen, a child of the Soviet Union, offers up a portrait of Vladimir Putin as a man formed by his many years in the K. G. B. She finds the roots of his illiberalism, his secrecy, his disregard for democratic norms. It’s an authoritarianism she fears others have been blind to, projecting onto him the leader they hope he will be. Vaddey Ratner, “In the Shadow of the Banyan” (2012) Country of origin: CambodiaReasons for leaving: Ratner and her mother escaped the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979 after enduring four years of forced labor, starvation and near execution. They immigrated to rural Missouri. Ratner’s first novel hews closely to her own traumatic biography. A child of only 5 when Pol Pot’s army began terrorizing the country, she tells the story from that perspective, focusing on both the beauty and the horror as it appears to innocent eyes hardly able to comprehend beyond the everyday sensations of panic and wonder. Gary Shteyngart, “Little Failure” (2014) Country of origin: Soviet UnionReasons for leaving: Like other Soviet Jews, Shteyngart and his family felt discriminated against in the Soviet Union and were allowed to emigrate in 1979. Shteyngart’s mother must have meant it in an endearing way when she called her son “Little Failure. ” He certainly embraced the moniker. Here the hilarious writer turns to memoir to tell his own story of arriving in America as an awkward young boy. Through the trials and tribulations of Hebrew school and the thick pot smoke of Oberlin, Shteyngart survived and has become our chronicler of   absurdity as only an immigrant with a funny name can see it. Viet Thanh Nguyen, “The Sympathizer” (2015) Country of origin: VietnamReasons for leaving: Nguyen’s family escaped Vietnam in 1975 and lived in a Pennsylvania refugee camp before settling in Harrisburg. The great contribution of Nguyen’s Pulitzer   first novel is that it introduces a Vietnamese voice into a conversation that has been  . As the narrator, annoyed that American soldiers and politicians have monopolized the story of the Vietnam War, explains, “this was the first war where the losers would write history instead of the victors. ” This novel, applying fresh eyes to a war now known only through clichés, offers that corrective. Vu Tran, “Dragonfish” (2015) Country of origin: VietnamReasons for leaving: Born in Saigon in 1975, five months after the city fell to the North Vietnamese, Tran left by boat in 1980 with his mother and sister, spending five days at sea. Tran’s novel, his first, does not engage in any nostalgia about the lost home. That place carries only memories of trauma and war. He forces his characters, including a Vietnamese woman in California who mysteriously disappears, to grapple with that past. It’s the only way to get anywhere near embracing their new American realities."
"If you made a New Year’s resolution, there’s an 80 percent chance you’ve already given it up or you’re just about to. But that’s O. K.! We want to help you stick with it  —   or revamp it into something you really want to achieve. So for February, Smarter Living will offer tips, advice and motivation. Every Monday in The Times’s Morning Briefing, we’ll pose a new question or idea to you, and on Thursday, we’ll highlight a few top answers. If you’d like to participate, email us at smarterliving@nytimes. com with the subject line “My resolution” and your name, resolution and  . We kicked things off this past Monday, and we’ve already received more than 600 responses. Here are some resolutions we’ve received so far: Susan I read your offer (and not for the first time!) in this morning’s Times briefing, and decided that I was among the masses whose resolutions were about to die  —   and decided I’d try to give mine some CPR. My resolution and why I chose it: To find meaningful freelance work so that I can shed the unpalatable drudgery of being cooped up in the same place all day, every day, doing unsatisfying work in the name of money. Two specific  : I will check new job boards each week, extending my reach to N. Y. C. (from just Philly, where I live) and apply to at least two jobs per week and I will contact everyone I’ve worked with in the past 10 years to see if they could use any help. Sam Feigenbaum My resolution and why I chose it: I’ve always wanted to be an artist but was afraid to really try. I’ve resolved to fill one   sketchbook back and front per month. I hope to exceed 1, 500 pages this year. I finished my first yesterday.  : Starting on Feb. 1, I will set my alarm half an hour earlier to add 30 minutes of drawing exercises in the morning. I will also keep everything that does not pertain to sketching off of my art table. That’s for art, not Chinese food. Antara Dasgupta My resolution and why I chose it: My resolution is to rid myself of the disease known as procrastination  —   this is so I can actually revise my lectures   futile all nighters, thereby ensuring that I actually have a chance for a   future (incredibly sorry for all the extra negativity during an already bleak period)!  : From Feb. 1, I will go to the library to actually study instead of spending hours finding the 10 NYT articles I can read for the month (I’m a college student, £3 is exorbitant). I will also stop binge watching episodes of “Jane the Virgin. ” Sara Dempsey My resolution and why I chose it: My resolution is threefold: to track my financial life more carefully be more aware of how I’m spending my money and learn how I can make better choices with it.  : In January, I’ve brought my lunch to work every day and used both Mint and Personal Capital to track my spending. I also (finally!) enrolled in my company’s 401( k) at 7 percent. I’m testing to see if that percentage is the right one. I am reading up on index funds and looking to be a more educated investor. Emma Gelsinger My resolution and why I chose it: To put my laundry away as soon as it is done in the washer and dryer. I chose this because although it may seem trivial, like many others that I know, I regularly found myself sifting through baskets (or piles) of clean laundry. And let’s never underestimate the procrastination tactic of moving the clean laundry from the bed to the floor and back again . .. needless to say, it causes some really unnecessary daily stress and frustration. Sub goals: 1. Buy a new (pretty) laundry basket and put the laundry in the washer as soon as it is full (one month in and so far so good! ). 2. Make sure that everything going into the laundry basket actually needs to be washed to reduce unnecessary laundry. Erik Heger My resolution and why I chose it: My No. 1 resolution is to play my harp again. I have been playing harp my entire life, for fun and professionally. I was diagnosed with a nerve condition a few years ago: cubital tunnel syndrome. There are ways back to health, but it will take a lot of small steps and commitment.  : Sleep with my elbow braces on every night for February and March. Work on physical therapy, neck, back, arms, jaw. Make that part of daily activity for February and March. Aumarie Benipayo My resolution and why I chose it: I want a strong and fit body that will carry me through retirement. I want to enjoy the older years and not be hindered by health issues. Two specific  : My biggest challenge is how much I love food and drink. I am also a binge snacker. I eat when I’m bored. I eat when I’m stressed. At times, I turn into a living garbage disposal.  : Finally lose the last five pounds that I’ve tried to lose for years. I can do this by being mindful of the food I eat every day. Before I grab that snack or second helping, ask myself if I’m hungry or really need it. Second sub goal: Build a leaner body by incorporating physical activity at least one to two times per week. My plan is to do a combination of weight training and cardio (Orangetheory) along with my current yoga routine. I’ll start here for the first three months then   my progress. Scott Peterson My resolution and why I chose it: My resolution for this year is to quit smoking cigarettes. I’ve been a    smoker for five years now, at one point three packs a day. I’m only just about to turn 21 and I can hardly walk the mile from my apartment to campus without feeling out of breath and still craving a smoke. I work for an outdoor program at my school, leading other students on trips backpacking, kayaking, caving (my favorite) etc. and I don’t want to be held back by nicotine any longer while I try to experience the beauties of Earth. I want to be healthier.  : By spring break (March 11) I would like to desire only one cigarette, with my coffee while I read The New York Times. By the end of this semester (May 9) I want to no longer crave a cigarette at any point. Wendl Kornfeld My resolution and why I chose it: Live with more deliberation and completion. Living with a constant sense of urgency didn’t do much except to make me feel anxious having so many unfinished projects made me feel ineffective and frivolous.  : I will be more aware of when I am moving too fast and observing too little, increasing awareness and decreasing chance of injury. I will take on fewer projects and either finish them by a set date or discard them lest they become frustrating and  . I will literally move a little more slowly throughout the day, observing more what is happening around me (increasing awareness, decreasing chance of injury) I will put things back where they belong. Lindsey Challis My resolution and why I chose it: I want to be a better   friend. I have amazing friends I care about deeply all over the country, but because my community here in Atlanta has changed so much, I often spend evenings alone feeling isolated.  : Starting now, each week I will make time to send a handwritten letter or have a phone call with one   friend or family member. When I’m exhausted or stressed after work, instead of turning my brain off with TV, I will reach out to a friend  —   even if it’s just a text message. Tim Herrera (your Smarter Living editor) My resolution and why I chose it: To be better with money and save more for retirement so that someday I might be able to (gasp) retire.  : This month I’ll order delivery for dinner one fewer night per week, and I’ll cut down at least one of my daily afternoon coffees (which I buy solely out of habit, but which cost me around $500 over the course of a year)."

Alarmism about nuclear weapons is common coin in the foreign policy establishment.1 During the course of the Cold War, for example, the chief concern was that the weapons would somehow go off, by accident or by intention, devastating the planet in the process.





In 1960, a top nuclear strategist declared it “most unlikely” that the world could live with an uncontrolled arms race for decades. And in 1979, political scientist Hans J. Morgenthau declared: “The world is moving ineluctably towards a third world war — a strategic nuclear war. I do not believe that anything can be done to prevent it. The international system is simply too unstable to survive for long.” In the 1980s, variously between 20 and 37 percent of the American population told pollsters that they held the potential for nuclear war to be the most important problem facing the country, even as creative activists at Brown University demanded that their health service should stockpile suicide pills for immediate dispensation in the event of a nuclear attack to those unfortunates who still remained unvaporized.2





In a 1982 _New Yorker_ essay and a best‐​selling book, both entitled _The Fate of the Earth_ , Jonathan Schell passionately, if repetitively, argued the not entirely novel proposition that nuclear war would be terrible, and he concluded ominously: “One day — and it is hard to believe that it will not be soon — we will make our choice. Either we will sink into the final coma and end it all or, as I trust and believe, we will awaken to the truth of our peril … and rise up to cleanse the earth of nuclear weapons.“3 As it happened, both options were avoided: neither final coma nor nuclear cleansing ever took place.





After the United States and the Soviet Union called off their Cold War in 1989, nuclear concerns dwindled, even though thousands of the weapons continued to be retained. Ever resourceful, however, nuclear alarmists quickly shifted their focus. If big countries with large nuclear arsenals were now unlikely to bring about the end of the world, small ones with small arsenals could do the job. Or even tiny groups of diabolical terrorists. After all, it was essentially argued, since a group of them, armed with box cutters and a clever plan, took down two skyscrapers, they might soon advance to nuclear weapons and then use them to topple American society, the ascendency of the modern state, or civilization as we know it, either all at once or seriatim.4





This chapter is devoted to alarmism about the supposed dangers to American national security inherent in the proliferation of nuclear weapons to states and to terrorists.





In an influential book, Graham Allison argues that “no new nuclear weapons states” should be a prime foreign policy principle, and analyst Joseph Cirincione very much agrees, insisting that nonproliferation should be “our number one national‐​security priority.“5





There are good reasons to avoid alarmism in this area, however. First, the pace of nuclear proliferation has been far slower than has been commonly predicted primarily because the weapons convey little advantage to their possessor. Second, the consequences of such proliferation that has taken place have been substantially benign: those who have acquired the weapons have “used” them simply to stoke their egos or to deter real or imagined threats.6





And thirdly, the costs of anti‐​proliferation policy have been very substantial: the number of people who have died as a consequence of dedicated efforts to contain nuclear proliferation runs well into six figures.





Alarmists have been wrong for decades about the pace of nuclear proliferation. Dozens of technologically capable countries have considered obtaining nuclear arsenals, but very few have done so. Indeed, as Jacques Hymans has pointed out, even supposedly optimistic forecasts about nuclear dispersion have proved to be too pessimistic.7 Thus, in 1958, the National Planning Association predicted “a rapid rise in the number of atomic powers … by the mid‐​1960s.“8 A few years later, C. P. Snow sagely predicted, “Within, at the most, six years, China and several other states [will] have a stock of nuclear bombs,” and John Kennedy observed that there might be “ten, fifteen, twenty” countries with a nuclear capacity by 1964.9





As part of that forecasting, it has generally been assumed that nuclear weapons would be important status — or virility — symbols; therefore, all advanced countries would want to have them in order to show how “powerful” they were. Thus, France’s de Gaulle opined in the 1960s, “No country without an atom bomb could properly consider itself independent,” and Robert Gilpin concluded that “the possession of nuclear weapons largely determines a nation’s rank in the hierarchy of international prestige.“10 In Gilpinian tradition, some analysts who describe themselves as “realists” have insisted for years that Germany and Japan must soon come to their senses and quest after nuclear weapons.11 Such punditry has gone astray in part because the pundits insist on extrapolating from the wrong cases. A more pertinent prototype would have been Canada, a country that could easily have had nuclear weapons by the 1960s but declined to make the effort.12 In fact, over the decades, a huge number of countries capable of developing nuclear weapons have neglected even to consider the opportunity — for example, Canada, Italy, and Norway — even as Argentina, Brazil, Libya, South Korea, and Taiwan have backed away from or reversed nuclear weapons programs, and Belarus, Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Ukraine have actually surrendered or dismantled an existing nuclear arsenal.13 Some of that reduction is no doubt due to the hostility of the nuclear nations, but even without that, the Canadian case seems to have proved to have rather general relevance.





To begin with, as Stephen Meyer has shown, there is no “technological imperative” for countries to obtain nuclear weapons once they have achieved the technical capacity to do so.14 Moreover, like military prowess in general, the weapons have not proved to be crucial status symbols. As Robert Jervis has observed, “India, China, and Israel may have decreased the chance of direct attack by developing nuclear weapons, but it is hard to argue that they have increased their general prestige or influence.“15 How much more status would Japan have if it possessed nuclear weapons? Would anybody pay a great deal more attention to Britain or France if their arsenals held 5,000 nuclear weapons, or would anybody pay much less if they had none? Did China need nuclear weapons to impress the world with its economic growth? Or with its Olympics? As Jennifer Mackby and Walter Slocombe observe, “Germany, like its erstwhile Axis ally, Japan, has become powerful because of its economic might rather than its military might, and its renunciation of nuclear weapons may even have reinforced its prestige.“16





Decades of alarmist predictions about proliferation chains, cascades, dominoes, waves, avalanches, epidemics, and points of no return have proved to be faulty. The proliferation of nuclear weapons has been far slower than routinely expected because, insofar as most leaders of most countries (even rogue ones) have considered acquiring the weapons, they have come to appreciate several defects: the weapons are dangerous, distasteful, costly, and likely to rile the neighbors. Moreover, as Jacques Hymans has demonstrated, the weapons have also been exceedingly difficult to obtain for administratively dysfunctional countries like Iran.17





Although we have now suffered through two‐​thirds of a century during which there has been great hysteria about the disasters inherent in nuclear proliferation, the consequences of the proliferation that has occurred have been substantially benign. The few countries to which the weapons have proliferated have quietly kept them in storage and haven’t even found much benefit in rattling them from time to time. And even the deterrence value of the weapons has been questionable — the major Cold War participants, for example, scarcely needed visions of mushroom clouds to conclude that any replication of World War II, with or without nuclear weapons, was a decidedly bad idea.18





Moreover, there has never been a militarily compelling — or even minimally sensible — reason to use the weapons, particularly because of an inability to identify suitable targets or ones that could not be attacked about as effectively by conventional munitions. And it is difficult to see how nuclear weapons benefited their possessors in specific military ventures. Israel’s presumed nuclear weapons did not restrain the Arabs from attacking in 1973, nor did Britain’s prevent Argentina’s seizure of the Falklands in 1982. Similarly, the tens of thousands of nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the enveloping allied forces did not cause Saddam Hussein to order his occupying forces out of Kuwait in 1990. Nor did possession of the bomb benefit America in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan; France in Algeria; or the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.





Proliferation alarmists may occasionally grant that countries principally obtain a nuclear arsenal to counter real or perceived threats. But many go on to argue that the newly nuclear country will then use its nuclear weapons to dominate the area. That argument was repeatedly used with dramatic urgency for the dangers supposedly posed by Saddam Hussein, and it is now being applied to Iran.





Exactly how that domination business is to be carried out is never made clear.19 But the notion apparently is that should an atomic Iraq (in earlier fantasies) or North Korea or Iran (in present ones) rattle the occasional rocket, other countries in the area, suitably intimidated, would supinely bow to its demands. Far more likely, any threatened states will make common cause with each other and with other concerned countries against the threatening neighbor. It thus seems overwhelmingly likely that if a nuclear Iran brandishes its weapons to intimidate others or to get its way, it will find that those threatened, rather than capitulating to its blandishments or rushing off to build a compensating arsenal of their own, will ally with others (including conceivably Israel) to stand up to the intimidation — rather in the way they coalesced into an alliance of convenience to oppose Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.





It is sometimes said, or implied, that proliferation has had little consequence because the only countries to possess nuclear weapons have had rational leaders. But the weapons have proliferated to large, important countries run by unchallenged monsters who, at the time they acquired the bombs, were certifiably deranged: Josef Stalin, who in 1949 was planning to change the climate of the Soviet Union by planting a lot of trees, and Mao Zedong, who in 1964 had just carried out a bizarre social experiment that resulted in an artificial famine in which tens of millions of Chinese perished.20 It is incumbent on those who strongly oppose an Iranian bomb to demonstrate that the regime there is daffier than these.





The few countries to have acquired nuclear weapons programs seem to have done so sometimes as an ego trip for current leaders and, more urgently (or perhaps merely in addition), as an effort to deter a potential attack on themselves: China to deter the United States and the Soviet Union, Israel to deter various enemy nations in the neighborhood, India to deter China, Pakistan to deter India, and now North Korea to deter the United States and maybe others.21 Insofar as nuclear proliferation is a response to perceived threat, it follows that one way to reduce the likelihood of such countries’ going nuclear is a simple one: stop threatening them.





Although the consequences of nuclear proliferation have proved to be substantially benign, the same cannot be said for the consequences of the nuclear nonproliferation quest.





Candidate Barack Obama announced during the campaign of 2008 that he would “do everything in [his] power to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon — everything,” and John McCain insisted that Iran must be kept from obtaining a nuclear weapon “at all costs.“22 Neither bothered to tally what “everything” might entail and what the costs might be, and both continue to make the same kinds of pronouncements.





Such a mentality was a chief motivator of the 2003 Iraq War, which was essentially a militarized antiproliferation effort. It was sold almost entirely as a venture required to keep Saddam Hussein’s pathetic and fully containable and deterrable rogue state from developing nuclear and other presumably threatening weapons and to prevent him from palming off some of them to eager and congenial terrorists.23 Thus, in an influential 2002 book, Kenneth Pollack strenuously advocated a war whose “whole point” would be to “prevent Saddam from acquiring nuclear weapons,” which Western intelligence agencies, he reported, were predicting would occur by 2004 (pessimistic) or 2008 (optimistic).24 As the Defense Department’s Paul Wolfowitz pointed out, nuclear weapons, or at any rate weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), were the “core reason” for the war.25 For their part, Democrats have derided the war as “unnecessary,” but the bulk of them came to that conclusion only after the United States was unable to find either weapons or weapons programs in Iraq. Many of them have made it clear that they would support putatively preemptive (actually, preventive) military action — and presumably its extensive bloodshed if the intelligence about Saddam’s programs had been accurate.26 Well over 100,000 people have died in this antiproliferation war; the number who perished at Hiroshima and Nagasaki is often put at around the same magnitude.27 An alarmist mentality was shown by decisionmakers in the Clinton administration in 1994. They were apparently prepared to go to war with the miserable North Korean regime to prevent or to halt its nuclear development.28 A full‐​scale war on the peninsula, estimated the Pentagon, could kill 1 million people, including 80,000 to 100,000 Americans; could cost more than $100 billion; and could do economic destruction on the order of $1 trillion.29 That is a considerable price, one might think, to prevent a pathetic regime from developing weapons with the potential for killing a few tens of thousands — if they were actually exploded, an act that would be suicidal for the regime.30





Alarm about the possibility that small groups could set off nuclear weapons has been repeatedly raised at least since 1946, when atomic bomb maker J. Robert Oppenheimer contended that if three or four men could smuggle in units for an atomic bomb, they could “destroy New York.” Thirty years later, nuclear physicist Theodore Taylor explained “how comparatively easy it would be to steal nuclear material and step by step make it into a bomb.” At the time, he thought it variously already too late to “prevent the making of a few bombs, here and there, now and then,” or “in another ten or fifteen years, it will be too late.“31 Four decades after Taylor, we continue to wait for terrorists to carry out their “easy” task.





In the wake of 9/11, concern about the atomic terrorist surged even though the attacks of that day used no special weapons. By 2003, United Nations Ambassador John Negroponte judged there to be “a high probability” that within two years al Qaeda would attempt an attack using a nuclear or other weapon of mass destruction. And it was in that spirit that in 2004, Graham Allison published a book relaying his “considered judgment” that “on the current path, a nuclear terrorist attack on America in the decade ahead is more likely than not.” He had presumably relied on the same inspirational mechanism in 1995 to predict that “in the absence of a determined program of action, we have every reason to anticipate acts of nuclear terrorism against American targets before this decade is out.“32





Allison has quite a bit of company in his perpetually alarming conclusions. According to Robert Gates, former secretary of defense, _every_ senior government leader is kept awake at night by “the thought of a terrorist ending up with a weapon of mass destruction, especially nuclear.” And on April 11, 2010, President Barack Obama held the atomic terrorist to be “the single biggest threat to U.S. security.“33





However, thus far, terrorist groups seem to have exhibited only limited desire and even less progress in going atomic. That lack of action may be because, after a brief exploration of the possible routes, they — unlike generations of alarmists — have discovered that the tremendous effort required is scarcely likely to be successful.34





One route a would‐​be atomic terrorist might take would be to receive or buy a bomb from a generous like‐​minded nuclear state for delivery abroad. That route is highly improbable, however, because there would be too much risk — even for a country led by extremists — that the ultimate source of the weapon would be discovered. As one prominent analyst, Matthew Bunn, puts it, “A dictator or oligarch bent on maintaining power is highly unlikely to take the immense risk of transferring such a devastating capability to terrorists they cannot control, given the ever‐​present possibility that the material would be traced back to its origin.” Important in this last consideration are deterrent safeguards afforded by “nuclear forensics,” which is the rapidly developing science (and art) of connecting nuclear materials to their sources even after a bomb has been exploded.35





Moreover, there is a very considerable danger to the donor that the bomb (and its source) would be discovered before delivery or that it would be exploded in a manner and on a target the donor would not approve of — including on the donor itself. Another concern would be that the terrorist group might be infiltrated by foreign intelligence.36





In addition, almost no one would trust al Qaeda. As one observer has pointed out, the terrorist group’s explicit enemies list includes not only Christians and Jews but also all Middle Eastern regimes; Muslims who don’t share its views; most Western countries; the governments of Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Russia; most news organizations; the United Nations; and international nongovernmental organizations.37 Most of the time, it didn’t get along all that well even with its host in Afghanistan, the Taliban government.38





There has also been great worry about “loose nukes,” especially in postcommunist Russia — weapons, “suitcase bombs” in particular, that can be stolen or bought illicitly. A careful assessment conducted by the Center for Nonproliferation Studies has concluded that it is unlikely that any of those devices have been lost and that, regardless, their effectiveness would be very low or even nonexistent because they (like all nuclear weapons) require continual maintenance.39 Even some of those people most alarmed by the prospect of atomic terrorism have concluded, “It is probably true that there are no ‘loose nukes,’ transportable nuclear weapons missing from their proper storage locations and available for purchase in some way.“40





It might be added that Russia has an intense interest in controlling any weapons on its territory because it is likely to be a prime target of any illicit use by terrorist groups, particularly Chechen ones of course, with whom it has been waging a vicious on‐​and‐​off war for two decades. The government of Pakistan, which has been repeatedly threatened by terrorists, has a similar interest in controlling its nuclear weapons and material — and scientists. As noted by Stephen Younger, former head of nuclear weapons research and development at Los Alamos National Laboratory, “Regardless of what is reported in the news, all nuclear nations take the security of their weapons very seriously.“41 Even if a finished bomb were somehow lifted somewhere, the loss would soon be noted and a worldwide pursuit launched.





Moreover, finished bombs are outfitted with devices designed to trigger a nonnuclear explosion that would destroy the bomb if it were tampered with. And there are other security techniques: bombs can be kept disassembled with the components stored in separate high‐​security vaults, and security can be organized so that two people and multiple codes are required not only to use the bomb but also to store, maintain, and deploy it. If the terrorists seek to enlist (or force) the services of someone who already knows how to set off the bomb, they would find, as Younger stresses, that “only few people in the world have the knowledge to cause an unauthorized detonation of a nuclear weapon.” Weapons designers know _how_ a weapon works, he explains, but not the multiple types of signals necessary to set it off, and maintenance personnel are trained in only a limited set of functions.42





There could be dangers in the chaos that would emerge if a nuclear state were to fail, collapsing in full disarray — Pakistan is frequently brought up in this context and sometimes North Korea as well. However, even under those conditions, nuclear weapons would likely remain under heavy guard by people who know that a purloined bomb would most likely end up going off in their own territory; would still have locks (and in the case of Pakistan would be disassembled); and could probably be followed, located, and hunted down by an alarmed international community. The worst‐​case scenario in that instance requires not only a failed state but also a considerable series of additional permissive conditions, including consistent (and perfect) insider complicity and a sequence of hasty, opportunistic decisions or developments that click flawlessly in a manner far more familiar to Hollywood scriptwriters than to people experienced with reality.43





Because they are unlikely to be able to buy or steal a usable bomb and because they are further unlikely to have one handed off to them by an established nuclear state, the most plausible route for terrorists would be to manufacture the device themselves from purloined materials. That is the course identified by a majority of leading experts as the one most likely to lead to nuclear terrorism.44





The simplest design is a “gun” type of device in which masses of highly enriched uranium are hurled at each other within a tube. Such a device would be, as Allison acknowledges, “large, cumbersome, unsafe, unreliable, unpredictable, and inefficient.“45





The process of making such a weapon is daunting even in this minimal case. In particular, the task requires that a considerable series of difficult hurdles be conquered and in sequence.





To begin with, now and likely for the foreseeable future, stateless groups are incapable of manufacturing the requisite weapons‐​grade uranium themselves because the process requires an effort on an industrial scale. Moreover, they are unlikely to be supplied with the material by a state for the same reasons a state is unlikely to give them a workable bomb.46 Thus, they would need to steal or illicitly purchase the crucial material.





A successful armed theft is exceedingly unlikely, not only because of the resistance of guards but also because chase would be immediate. A more plausible route would be to corrupt insiders to smuggle out the necessary fissile material. However, that approach requires the terrorists to pay off a host of greedy confederates, including brokers and money transmitters, any one of whom could turn on them or — either out of guile or incompetence — furnish them with stuff that is useless.47 Moreover, because of improved safeguards and accounting practices, it is decreasingly likely that the theft would remain undetected.48 That development is important because if any missing uranium is noticed, the authorities would investigate the few people who might have been able to assist the thieves, and one who seems suddenly to have become prosperous is likely to arrest their attention right from the start. Even one initially tempted by, seduced by, or sympathetic to, the blandishments of the smooth‐​talking foreign terrorists might soon develop sobering second thoughts and go to the authorities. Insiders tempted to assist terrorists might also come to ruminate over the fact that, once the heist was accomplished, the terrorists would, as analyst Brian Jenkins puts it none too delicately, “have every incentive to cover their trail, beginning with eliminating their confederates.“49





It is also relevant to note that over the years, known thefts of highly enriched uranium have totaled fewer than 16 pounds. That amount is far less than that required for an atomic explosion: for a crude bomb, more than 100 pounds are necessary to produce a likely yield of one kiloton. Moreover, none of those thieves was connected to al Qaeda, and, most arrestingly, none had buyers lined up — nearly all were caught while trying to peddle their wares. Indeed, concludes analyst Robin Frost, “There appears to be no true demand, except where the buyers were government agents running a sting.” Because there appears to be no commercial market for fissile material, each sale would be a one‐​time affair, not a continuing source of profit such as drugs, and there is no evidence of established underworld commercial trade in this illicit commodity.50





If terrorists were somehow successful in obtaining a sufficient mass of relevant material, they would then have to transport it out of the country over unfamiliar terrain, probably while being pursued by security forces. Then, they would need to set up a large and well‐​equipped machine shop to manufacture a bomb and populate it with a select team of highly skilled scientists, technicians, and machinists. The process would also require good managers and organizers. The group would have to be assembled and retained for the monumental task without generating consequential suspicions among friends, family, and police about their curious and sudden absence from normal pursuits back home. Pakistan, for example, maintains a strict watch on many of its nuclear scientists even after retirement.51





Some observers have insisted that it would be “easy” for terrorists to assemble a crude bomb if they could get enough fissile material.52 However, Christoph Wirz and Emmanuel Egger, two senior physicists in charge of nuclear issues at Switzerland’s Spiez Laboratory, conclude that the task “could hardly be accomplished by a subnational group.” They point out that precise blueprints are required, not just sketches and general ideas, and that even with a good blueprint, the terrorist group “would most certainly be forced to redesign.” They also stress that the work, far from being “easy,” is difficult, dangerous, and extremely exacting and that the technical requirements “in several fields verge on the unfeasible.“53





Los Alamos research director Younger makes a similar argument, expressing his amazement at “self‐​declared ‘nuclear weapons experts,’ many of whom have never seen a real nuclear weapon,” who “hold forth on how easy it is to make a functioning nuclear explosive.” Information is available for getting the general idea behind a rudimentary nuclear explosive, but none is detailed enough for “the confident assembly of a real nuclear explosive.” Younger concludes, “To think that a terrorist group, working in isolation with an unreliable supply of electricity and little access to tools and supplies” could fabricate a bomb “is far‐​fetched at best.“54





Under the best of circumstances, the process could take months or even a year or more, and it would all, of course, have to be carried out in utter secret even while local and international security police are likely to be on the intense prowl. In addition, people, or criminal gangs, in the area may observe with increasing curiosity and puzzlement the constant comings and goings of technicians unlikely to be locals.





The process of fabricating a nuclear device requires, then, the effective recruitment of people who at once have great technical skills and will remain completely devoted to the cause. In addition, a host of corrupted coconspirators, many of them foreign, must remain utterly reliable; international and local security services must be kept perpetually in the dark; and no curious outsider must get wind of the project over the months, or even years, it takes to pull off.





The finished product could weigh a ton or more. Encased in lead shielding to mask radioactive emissions, it would then have to be transported to, as well as smuggled into, the relevant target country. Then, the enormous package would have to be received within the target country by a group of collaborators who are at once totally dedicated and technically proficient at handling, maintaining, and perhaps assembling the weapon. Then, they would have to detonate it somewhere under the fervent hope that the machine shop work has been proficient, that no significant shakeups occurred in the treacherous process of transportation, and that the thing — after all that effort — doesn’t prove to be a dud.





The financial costs of the extended operation in its cumulating entirety could become monumental. There would be expensive equipment to buy, smuggle, and set up, as well as people to pay — or pay off. Some operatives might work for free out of dedication, but the vast conspiracy also requires the subversion of an array of criminals and opportunists, each of whom has every incentive to push the price for cooperation as high as possible. Any criminals who are competent and capable enough to be an effective ally in the project are likely to be both smart enough to see opportunities for extortion and psychologically equipped by their profession to be willing to exploit them.





In addition, the evidence about the degree to which al Qaeda has pursued, or even has much interest in, a nuclear weapons program is limited and often ambiguous. For example, in 2004, the 9/11 Commission insisted that “al Qaeda has tried to acquire or make nuclear weapons for at least ten years.” The only substantial evidence it supplies for that assertion comes from an episode that supposedly took place around 1993 in Sudan, when Osama bin Laden’s aides were scammed when they tried to buy some uranium.55 Information about that caper apparently comes from a man who defected from al Qaeda in 1996 after he had been caught stealing $110,000 from the organization. He tried selling his story around the Middle East, but only the Americans were buying. In his prize‐​winning _The Looming Tower_ , Lawrence Wright relays the testimony of the man who allegedly purchased the substance for bin Laden, as well as that of a Sudanese intelligence agent. Both assert that, although there were various other scams going around at the time, the uranium episode never happened.56





Various sources suggest that radical elements in bin Laden’s entourage were interested in pursuing atomic weapons or other WMDs when the group was in Afghanistan in the 1990s. However, the same sources indicate that bin Laden had little interest in that pursuit and essentially sabotaged the idea by refusing to fund it, or even to initiate planning for it.57 Analyst Anne Stenersen notes that evidence from a recovered al Qaeda computer indicates that only some $2,000–$4,000 was earmarked for WMD research, all of it apparently for (very crude) chemical work with some potentially for biological weapons. For comparison, she points out that the millennial terrorist group Aum Shinrikyo appears to have invested $30 million in its sarin gas manufacturing program alone.58 There are also reports that bin Laden had some “academic” discussions in 2001 about WMDs with some Pakistani nuclear scientists who did not, actually, know how to build a bomb.





Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the apparent mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, reportedly says that al Qaeda’s atom bomb efforts never went beyond searching the Internet.59 After the fall of the Taliban in 2001, technical experts from the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Energy examined information uncovered in Afghanistan and arrived at conclusions generally supportive of that assertion. They found no credible information that al Qaeda had obtained fissile material or a nuclear weapon, and no evidence of “any radioactive material suitable for weapons.” They did uncover, however, a “nuclear‐​related” document discussing “openly available concepts about the nuclear fuel cycle and some weapons related issues.“60 Physicist and weapons expert David Albright is more impressed with the evidence, but he concludes that any al Qaeda atomic efforts were “seriously disrupted” — indeed, “nipped in the bud” — by the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, and that after the invasion, the “chance of al Qaeda detonating a nuclear explosive appears on reflection to be low.“61





Rumors and reports that al Qaeda managed to purchase an atomic bomb, or several, have been around now for well over a decade, beginning around 1998. One alleges, for example, that bin Laden gave a group of Chechens $30 million in cash and two tons of opium in exchange for 20 nuclear warheads. If any of those reports were true, one might think the terrorist group (or its supposed Chechen suppliers) would have tried to set one off by now or that al Qaeda would have left some trace of the weapons behind in Afghanistan after it made its very hasty exit in 2001.





Bin Laden pronounced on the nuclear weapons issue a few times, talking about an Islamic “duty” or “right” to obtain the weapons for defense. Some of those oft‐​quoted assertions can be viewed as threatening, but they are rather coy and indirect, indicating perhaps something of an interest, but not acknowledging any sort of capability. And as Louise Richardson concludes, “Statements claiming a right to possess nuclear weapons have been misinterpreted as expressing a determination to use them,” feeding “the exaggeration of the threat we face.“62





When examined, the evidence of al Qaeda’s desire to go atomic and about its progress in accomplishing that exceedingly difficult task, even in the comparative safety of its Afghan haven of the 1990s, is remarkably skimpy, if not completely negligible. The scariest stuff — a decade’s worth of loose nuke rumor, chatter, and hype — seems to have no substance whatever.





After an exhaustive study of available materials, Stenersen concludes that, although al Qaeda central may have considered nuclear and other nonconventional weapons, there “is little evidence that such ideas ever developed into actual plans, or that they were given any kind of priority at the expense of more traditional types of terrorist attacks.“63 And there is no reason to believe things got better for them after they were forcefully expelled from their comparatively unembattled base in Afghanistan.





In 1996, one of terrorism studies’ top gurus, Walter Laqueur, insisted that some terrorist groups “almost certainly” will use WMDs “in the foreseeable future.“64 Presumably any future foreseeable in 1996 is now history, but in contrast, terrorists in effect seem to be heeding the advice found in a memo on an al Qaeda laptop seized in Pakistan in 2004: “Make use of that which is available … rather than waste valuable time becoming despondent over that which is not within your reach.“65 That is, keep it simple, stupid. Although there have been plenty of terrorist attacks in the world since 2001, all (thus far, at least) have relied on conventional destructive methods. There hasn’t even been much in the way of the occasional gas bomb, not even in Iraq where the technology is hardly much of a secret.





Concerns about the dangers inherent in nuclear proliferation and in nuclear terrorism certainly seem overwrought.





It would be desirable that a number of variously designated regimes (and quite a few others) never obtain nuclear weapons. Accordingly, there is nothing wrong in making nonproliferation a high priority. Indeed, if the efforts successfully dissuade Iran from foolishly launching a nuclear weapons program, they would be doing it a favor — though, quite possibly, the Iranians wouldn’t notice.





However, if new nations acquire the costly weapons, they are most likely to put them to use — if that is the term — the same way other nuclear countries have: to stoke their collective egos and to deter real or perceived threats. Even countries that once seemed to be hugely threatening such as Communist China in the 1960s have been content to use their weapons for those purposes. Accordingly, history suggests that the proliferation of nuclear weapons scarcely presents a major danger to the word.





Moreover, any anti‐​proliferation priority should be topped with a somewhat higher one: avoiding militarily aggressive actions under the obsessive sway of worst‐​case‐​scenario fantasies, actions that might lead to the deaths of tens — or hundreds — of thousands of people.





If the potential for atomic terrorism is indeed the single most serious threat to the national security of the United States as many maintain, that potential could actually be viewed as a comparatively cheering conclusion. Sensible cost‐​effective policies designed to make that probability even lower may be justified, given the damage that can be inflicted by an atomic explosion. But any notion that terrorist groups will come up with nuclear weapons, even if they wanted to and tried hard, looks extremely unlikely. There may be reason for concern, or at least for interest and watchfulness. But alarm and hysteria (not to mention sleeplessness) are hardly called for.

18 The people who have been in charge of world affairs since World War II have been the same people or the intellectual heirs of the people who tried assiduously, frantically, desperately, and—as it turned out—pathetically to prevent World War II. And when, despite their best efforts, world war was forced on them, they found the experience to be incredibly horrible, just as they had anticipated. On the face of it, to expect those countries somehow to allow themselves to tumble into anything resembling a repetition of that experience—whether embellished with nuclear weapons or not—seems almost bizarre. That is, although the people who have been running world politics since 1945 have had plenty of disagreements, they have not been so obtuse, depraved, flaky, or desperate as to need visions of mushroom clouds to conclude that another catastrophic world war, nuclear or nonnuclear, win or lose, could be decidedly unpleasant. John Mueller, _Quiet Cataclysm: Reflections on the Recent Transformation of World Politics_ (New York: HarperCollins, 1995), chap. 5; Mueller, _Atomic Obsession_ , chap. 3. Moreover, Soviet ideology never envisioned direct Hitler‐​style warfare, whether nuclear or not, as a sensible method for pursuing the process of world revolution, and, insofar as it embraced violence, focused instead on class warfare, revolutionary upheaval, and subversion. As Robert Jervis notes, “The Soviet archives have yet to reveal any serious plans for unprovoked aggression against Western Europe, not to mention a first strike against the United States.” Jervis, “Was the Cold War a Security Dilemma?” _Journal of Cold War Studies_ 3, no. 1 (Winter 2001): 59.

21 Hymans puts prime emphasis on ego—with the added proviso that only when the ego in charge has a conception of a national identity that can be considered to be what he calls “of the oppositional nationalist” variety will the country really try to get nuclear weapons.

Extract from an[ article](https://buchanan.org/blog/whats-behind-our-world-on-fire-137777) written by Patrick Buchanan



When the wildfires of California broke out across the Golden State, many were the causes given.



Negligence by campers. Falling power lines. Arson. A dried-out land. Climate change. Failure to manage forests, prune trees and clear debris, leaving fuel for blazes ignited. Abnormally high winds spreading the flames. Too many fires for first responders to handle.



So, too, there appears to be a multiplicity of causes igniting and fueling the protests and riots sweeping capital cities across our world.



The **year-long[yellow vest protests](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/france-yellow-vests-march-through-paris-as-first-protest-anniversary-nears/) in Paris**, set off by fuel price hikes that were swiftly rescinded, seemed to grind down this weekend to several thousand anarchic and violent die-hards.



The riots in **Chile** were started to oppose a small hike in train and subway fares in a country with the highest per capita income and least inequality in all of Latin America. Yet the protesters have succeeded in forcing the elected government to capitulate and write a new constitution.



 **Bolivia’s** uprising was over an election stolen by longtime president Evo Morales, who fled to Mexico to be welcomed by the foreign minister.



Among the issues dividing Bolivians are economic inequality and tribalism — indigenous peoples living alongside a European-descended elite. _(Sound familiar?)_



In **Hong Kong** , where[ protesters ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/hong-kongs-brave-fight-for-basic-human-rights/)appear to be making a last stand in the city’s universities, the cause that first united them was a proposal to allow the city’s citizens to be extradited to China for trial. […]



If Hong Kong can resist mighty China for half a year, imagine what Taiwan, with three times Hong Kong’s population, significant military forces, and 100 miles of water between the island and mainland, could do to resist the rule of the Party of Xi Jinping.



In **Baghdad** , the protests went violent early, and hundreds are now dead.



A primary cause of the rioters’ rage — Iranian influence in Iraqi politics that arose among the Shiite majority after George W. Bush overthrew the Sunni regime of Saddam Hussein.[…]



The triggering event for the riots in Iran was a rise in the price of gas, which is still only a fraction of what Americans pay per gallon, but is deeply painful for working and middle-class Iranians who are stretched to the limit.



 **The issues pulling continents, countries and capitals apart thus appear to be growing, enduring, and, indeed, perhaps insoluble.**



Consider. The economic issues propelling workers into the streets to protest inequalities of wealth and income are occurring at a time when our world has never been more prosperous.



The ethnic and racial clashes within and between nations seem increasingly beyond the capacity of democratic regimes to resolve peacefully.



As for matters of fundamental belief — political, ideological, religious — the divides here, too, seem to be deepening and widening.



 **India’s** Hindu majority of 1 billion seeks suppression of its Muslim minority. Secular **Chinese** put Muslim Uighurs and Kazakhs in concentration camps by the thousands to root out their birth loyalties and convert them into Marxist nationalists. Han Chinese are moved into Tibet and Xinjiang to swamp indigenous populations.[…]



In Hong Kong, the struggle is ideological and political, between believers in democracy and advocates of authoritarianism.



 **Europe** resists with growing alarm a decades-long invasion of the Old Continent by desperate people fleeing the failed states of Africa and the Mideast.



In **Spain** , a nationalist party, Vox, vaults to third place to resist a leftist regime in Madrid that is seen as too accommodating to Catalan secessionists and refugees from across the Mediterranean.[…]

Guest essay by Eric Worrall-
Sydney, NSW seawater desalination plant- Image source: desalination.edu.auBack in the early 2000s, much of Australia was in the grip of a severe drought – so severe, that the climate community was making well publicised claims that the drought would never end. As a result of these scaremongering predictions, from people who claimed to have predictive skill, and the devastating prospect of millions of voters going thirsty, Australia’s state and federal governments panicked, and commissioned the urgent construction of a series of desalination plants.
http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/it-pays-to-check-out-flannerys-predictions-about-climate-change-says-andrew-bolt/story-e6frfhqf-1226004644818
Here is the story of what happened to those plants.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_desalination_plants_in_Australia
The Gold Coast desalination plant: $1.2 billion / unknown
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_Desalination_Plant
The Perth desalination plant: $387 million / 180GWh / year
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Seawater_Desalination_Plant
The Sydney desalination plant: $1.8 billion / 257 GWh / year
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Desalination_Plant
The Victorian desalination plant: $5.7 billion / unknown
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Desalination_Plant
The Southern seawater plant: $955 million / unknown
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Seawater_Desalination_Plant
The Adelaide desalination plant: $1.8 billion / unknown
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Desalination_Plant
Naturally, like any government programme, especially *hasty* government programmes, the result has been a public financial disaster. The Gold Coast plant was mothballed a year after construction, and has never worked properly – the initial opening was delayed because fittings rusted up, before the plant was even switched on. The Perth plant is still operating, though in 2008 it was shut down twice because it was causing ocean die off – deoxygenation of Cockburn Sound. The Sydney plant has been criticised over water quality concerns, regarding the proximity of the seawater inlet to the desalination plant to the nearby sewage ocean outfall. Although it is still operating at low capacity, economists have described the project as a billion dollar bungle.
The Victorian plant, the most expensive at $5.7 billion, has been an unmitigated disaster – it finally went fully operational in 2012, and was immediately shut down, because it wasn’t needed. Due to the deal struck with the private operator of the plant, Victorian residential water bills have risen by 64%.
The Southern Seawater plant according to Wikipedia is operational – details on it appear to be a bit sparse, which who knows, might be good news.
The Adelaide desalination plant – OK, maybe that one was a good idea. There is an old saying in Australia, that there are 2 places in the world that ships won’t take on water, Adelaide and Azerbaijan. Before the desalination plant, Adelaide’s only source of potable water was 1500 miles of farm irrigation runoff extracted from the Murray River (I accidentally tried to drink a glass of Adelaide water once – horrible).
So what should California do, if the current drought turns into a megadrought? Frankly I would consider building a pipeline, and importing the water. I doubt you would get enough water to keep current farming practices going, but that applies to desalination as well, at least with current technology. At least pipes are well known technology, they work, and they are already used on a large scale to shift petroleum. Shifting a bit of water should surely be a lot cheaper than trying to desalinate it.
If the pipeline isn’t enough, then you could look at dusting off the old plans for using icebergs as a source of fresh water – we’ve got plenty of Antarctic sea ice to spare. http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/science-warms-to-iceberg-harvesting-idea/story-e6frg6so-1226110420439
If you really want to avoid seeing your water bills go up by 64%, while the dams fill with rain, as the poor Victorians in Australia did, or see the plant fittings go rusty before it is even switched on, as the Queenslanders did, at least make sure there is some proper oversight and accountability. And try to avoid building the seawater inlet pipe next to a sewage outlet, as they did in Sydney.

We on the middle and the right side of politics have been so busy being [upset at the National Party ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/letter-to-the-editor-the-zero-carbon-bill/)for focussing on compromise instead of standing strong against the Zero Carbon Bill, that we have totally missed the **delicious silver lining** in it all.



All is not well in Green Party circles as their gaining cross-party consensus on their bill has been criticised as a bad thing by those who believe that the Green Party have wasted their power. Apparently, the Green Party should have pulled on their Jack Boots and trampled over all dissent while claiming that it was their way or the highway!



While some commentators like David Cormack have praised the Zero Carbon Bill as being good for business because it gives business owners “certainty,” Greenpeace, on the other hand, have been scathing saying that the legislation had no substance and “ **Nothing but vague promises** to maybe do something about dairy pollution in two to five years’ time.” They suggested that the Green Party has “joined the consensus on inaction.”   
  
Hilariously Greenpeace is unhappy about the Zero Carbon Bill **because it hasn’t upset industry. In their extremist worldview,** the Zero Carbon Bill should hurt industry otherwise it is “meaningless” one of their spokespersons said, “One of the tell-tales of the hollowness of the Zero Carbon Act is that the polluting industries are not crying foul. The reason is, the law barely touches them.”  
  
Matthew Hooton also sees the bill as a negative for the Green Party saying that because they achieved multi-party consensus, “those who worry about climate change now have no more reason to vote for the Greens.” 



“Come election time, Shaw and Ardern may wax lyrical about the new legislation and the Climate Change Commission it sets up, but Simon Bridges and Winston Peters will both be able to say, ‘yep, that’s my policy too’ and move on to immigration, infrastructure, housing or the economy.” Meanwhile, the Greens are likely to bleed more activists. 



The other silver lining from my point of view is that by alienating the rural sector by supporting this Bill, [Simon Bridges has made it crystal clear](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/a-national-mp-on-national-voting-for-the-zero-carbon-bill/) that under his leadership National is headed in new Urban, liberal direction. 



National and the Greens now have something in common. They both chose consensus and compromise rather than taking a strong stance and now both are going to bleed support because of it.

"Men whose prostate cancer comes back after surgery are more likely to survive if, along with the usual radiation, they also take drugs to block male hormones. The finding, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, comes from a   study that experts say will help clarify treatment for many patients. After surgery to remove the prostate, more than 30 percent of men have a recurrence, and until now there has not been clear evidence about the best way to stop the disease from killing them. Most are given radiation, but prescribing drugs to counter the effects of male hormones has been inconsistent. The study, paid for by the National Cancer Institute, showed that among men who received radiation and hormonal treatment, 76. 3 percent were still alive after 12 years, compared to 71. 3 percent who had radiation alone. At 12 years, the men who had both treatments were also much less likely to have died from their prostate cancer  —   5. 8 percent versus 13. 4 percent  —   or to have the cancer spread around their bodies  —   14. 5 percent versus 23 percent. “This is a big deal,” said Dr. Ian M. Thompson Jr. of the Christus Santa Rosa Health System in San Antonio, who was not part of the study but wrote an editorial accompanying it. “There are so many things we do in prostate cancer that we don’t know if they make a big difference in survival. This is one of the things where now we can say for sure. ” He added that he hoped the findings would change medical practice. The medical term for blocking male hormones is chemical castration, and the treatments can cause hot flashes, sexual problems and other side effects. So to put a man through it, said Dr. Anthony L. Zietman, an author of the study, “you’d better have some decent justification. ” Dr. David F. Penson, the chairman of urologic surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the study “gives more credence to the concept that you have to treat the whole patient,” rather than just irradiating the area where the cancer used to be. He said the idea of blocking hormones in men like those in the study was finding its way into medical practice. About 161, 360 new cases of prostate cancer and 26, 730 deaths are expected in the United States in 2017, according to the American Cancer Society. The average age at diagnosis is 66. Globally, there were 1. 1 million cases and 307, 000 deaths in 2012, the most recent data available from the World Health Organization. The study, begun in 1998 and led by Dr. William U. Shipley, a radiation oncologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, had an ambitious goal: to follow the patients long enough to find out whether   treatment would affect their survival. Prostate cancer grows slowly, so it took well over a decade for answers to emerge. Researchers and patients from 150 sites in North America participated. The patients were 760 men who had their prostates removed for cancer that had not spread, but who then had a sign of recurrence  —   a rise in their blood levels of   antigen, or PSA, a protein associated with prostate cancer. The men in the study had PSAs of 0. 2 to 4 nanograms per milliliter. “That’s just like the first wisp of smoke,” said Dr. Zietman, who is a professor of radiation oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “There’ll be fire someday. ” The fire might take five, 10 or 15 years to break out, but Dr. Zietman said, “Many are in their 50s or 60s, and will live long enough to get into trouble. ” The traditional practice for a rising PSA after surgery has been to give radiation, which targets only the pelvis. The idea of the study was to add hormonal treatment, which might stop minute clumps of cancer that had spread to other parts of the body. All the men in the study had radiation for six and a half weeks. For two years, half also received a   drug, bicalutamide, and the other half were given placebos. They were followed, on average, for about 13 years. “This is the first trial that’s shown, if you follow these patients long enough, there is a real difference,” Dr. Zietman said. “More people survive 15 years later. ” Men who had more aggressive cancers  —   reflected by higher PSA readings after surgery and by the pathology and surgical reports on their tumors  —   had the most to gain from the   treatment. The results do not mean that every man with a rising PSA after surgery should have hormone treatment, Dr. Zietman said. Men 75 or older may not need it, because they may die from other causes before the cancer can catch up with them. “But if they’re younger and with a longer life expectancy, treatment is reasonable,” he said. Bicalutamide causes men to develop breasts and potentially other problems, and the high dose given in the study is no longer used in the United States. Other   drugs like Lupron have mostly taken its place, and may be even more effective, Dr. Zietman said. The study proved the concept that hormone blocking increases survival, he added, so other drugs that do the same thing should also help patients live longer. Another study in progress in Canada and Europe uses the newer drugs, and is trying to determine whether taking them for six months, rather than two years, might be enough."
"**A Florida taxi driver, who believed false claims that coronavirus was a hoax, has lost his wife to Covid-19.**
Brian Lee Hitchens and his wife, Erin, had read claims online that the virus was fabricated, linked to 5G or similar to the flu.
The couple didn't follow health guidance or seek help when they fell ill in early May. Brian recovered but his 46-year-old wife became critically ill and died this month from heart problems linked to the virus.
Brian spoke to the BBC in July as part of an investigation into the human cost of coronavirus misinformation. At the time, his wife was on a ventilator in hospital.
Erin, a pastor in Florida, had existing health problems - she suffered from asthma and a sleeping disorder.
Her husband explained that the couple did not follow health guidance at the start of the pandemic because of the false claims they had seen online.
Brian continued to work as a taxi driver and to collect his wife's medicine without observing social distancing rules or wearing a mask.
They had also failed to seek help as soon as possible when they fell ill in May and were both subsequently diagnosed with Covid-19.
Brian told BBC News that he ""wished [he'd] listened from the beginning"" and hoped his wife would forgive him.
""This is a real virus that affects people differently. I can't change the past. I can only live in today and make better choices for the future,"" Brian explained.
""She's no longer suffering, but in peace. I go through times missing her, but I know she's in a better place.""
Brian said he and his wife didn't have one firm belief about Covid-19. Instead, they switched between thinking the virus was a hoax, linked to 5G technology, or a real, but mild ailment. They came across these theories on Facebook.
""We thought the government was using it to distract us,"" Brian explained, ""or it was to do with 5G.""
But after the couple fell ill with the virus in May, Brian took to Facebook in a viral post to explain that he'd been misled by what he'd seen online about the virus.
""If you have to go out please use wisdom and don't be foolish like I was so the same thing won't happen to you like it happened to me and my wife,"" he wrote.
In May, a BBC team tracking coronavirus misinformation found links to assaults, arson and deaths.
Doctors and experts have warned that the potential for indirect harm caused by rumours, conspiracy theories and bad health information online remains huge - especially as anti-vaccination conspiracies are being spread on social media.
While social media companies have made attempts to tackle misinformation about coronavirus on their platforms, critics argue that more needs to be done in the coming months.
A Facebook spokesperson told the BBC: ""We don't allow harmful misinformation on our platforms and between April and June we removed more than seven million pieces of harmful Covid-19 misinformation, including claims relating to false cures or suggestions that social distancing is ineffective."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple of days ago I posted a comment given by Joe Bastardi on the 20 academics who penned a latter to the Department of Justice calling for an investigation of dissident views on climate science and their supporters.
It has since turned out that at least one of these academics is really in the green, which raises eyebrows on issues like objectivity and ethical conduct.
I also have gotten comments from Georgia Tech professor Judith Curry and geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning.
First Prof. Curry’s comment:
I am astonished by the naiveté of these scientists, who are damaging their reputation by their naive meddling in a complex policy debate. They seem not to realize that the tables could easily be turned on them if the political winds change (say with the election of a Republican U.S. President), and the heat would then be turned on green advocacy groups and the scientists that engage with them. The science is sufficiently uncertain to allow several rational narratives for what has caused 20th century warming and how the 21st century climate will evolve. These 20 scientists damage not only their own reputations, but they also damage the public perception of scientists as trustworthy sources of information. Most seriously, the coercion of scientists implied by this letter will discourage objectivity in scientific research and will discourage scientists from entering/staying in the field of climate research.”

“Undemocratic and unprofessional”
Sebastian Lüning also finds the whole affair a bit odd and “unprofessional”. He wrote:
Rather than criminal lawsuits, we urgently need an objective “scientific court” where arguments of both IPCC and skeptic sides are technically and open-mindedly discussed. It is undemocratic and unprofessional to silence scientists by legally threatening them if they do not subscribe to the official interpretation / party line. There are many historic examples where science pioneers such as Galileo Galilee or Alfred Wegener would have ended up in prison.”
Finally Prof. Nicola Scafetta of Duke University also provided a short comment:
Let us hope that this evident politicization of science ends soon.”

"Australian unions are concerned the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission’s focus on gas is too narrow to achieve the energy transformation needed for sustainable manufacturing, Michele O’Neil said.  The president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions made the comments on Monday when launching a policy paper on creating jobs through free childcare, subsidies for training places, and more investment in infrastructure and manufacturing.  And although the union movement has made its pitch for how best to recover 660,000 jobs lost between February and June, O’Neil has ruled out tradeoffs in industrial relations working groups in return for the government meeting its demands. The ACTU paper calls for the government to develop a sustainable manufacturing sector by maximising Australian-made content in infrastructure and public sector procurement, accelerated depreciation for large gas and electricity users to upgrade equipment, and zero-interest loans for renewable energy developments with a direct link to manufacturing. It also calls for a $1bn fund to invest in “manufacturing-tied renewable energy projects, new industrial uses of renewable energy” and carbon-neutral manufacturing projects. O’Neil said the policy would address the “high cost of energy and challenge how we move to more renewable sources that work for energy-intensive industries, particularly heavy manufacturing”. Jim Stanford, the director of the Centre for Future Work, which helped develop the policy, said there was a “growing consensus in the manufacturing sector that [renewable energy] is a huge new competitive advantage” for Australia’s domestic industry. Stanford said the policy was estimated to leverage an additional 30% increase in investment in Australian manufacturing – or $12bn in capital spending over three years – and create 15,000 construction jobs and 100,000 manufacturing jobs. Guardian Australia revealed in May that a leaked draft report by the commission’s manufacturing taskforce called for a massive expansion of the domestic gas industry – including opening fields and building hundreds of kilometres of pipelines – to boost manufacturing. Paul Bastian, national secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union and a member of the taskforce, rejected the overwhelming focus on gas as the path out of recession. In June the commission’s chair, Nev Power, claimed the document was a “very early draft” and “doesn’t reflect the views of the commission”. Asked why the ACTU had not followed the commission’s lead in calling for a gas-lead recovery, O’Neil said it had spoken to its affiliates, which represent manufacturing workers, and concluded “you can’t have a narrow approach” to the economic recovery. “We were concerned that [the commission’s] working party or taskforce was narrower than what was really needed, in terms of our energy needs and the energy transformation needed for a sustainable manufacturing industry.” Stanford said it was “far-fetched” that gas infrastructure could solve the manufacturing sector’s energy problems, arguing it “hasn’t been a lack of gas production that has caused high prices and uncertain supply”.  Despite increasing gas production, increased gas exports have caused domestic price spikes. On the cost of the ACTU’s proposals, O’Neil said there was “no way out” of the Covid-19 recession, already the largest since the Great Depression, without a “significant amount of government expenditure”. She noted near-zero interest rates, explaining it was a “very beneficial time” for governments to make long-term investments – especially as the cost of inaction would be much greater. Voters had rewarded the government when it introduced jobkeeper wage subsidies worth $70bn but initially estimated at $130bn, and there was “enormous public goodwill” and recognition the government does need to spend. O’Neil said five industrial relations working groups between unions and employers have met just twice each and it was “too early” to identify any potential common ground. The ACTU was determined that “no worker was worse off as a result of any proposals” – although the government has reserved the right to push on with a reform package even if no agreement is reached. Asked if unions could make concessions in that process in return for government agreeing to its plans for job-creation, O’Neil replied: “No.” Unions had put forward their “reconstruction plan” because it was good for workers, business and the economy, not as part of a “notion of a tradeoff”. The potential to reform the Fair Work Act was “one very small thing” in comparison, she said."
"**Apple chief executive Tim Cook has moved into the billionaire club as the tech firm's share price continues to soar.**
Apple's market value has been on the rise following strong results and the upbeat outlook for tech giants.
Mr Cook owns 847,969 shares directly and took home more than $125m (Â£96m) last year as part of his pay package.
Last week, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg saw his personal wealth hit $100bn (Â£76bn).
Technology companies including Apple, Facebook and Amazon have seen their profits grow during the coronavirus pandemic as more people went online.
Silicon-Valley based Apple is now closing in on the milestone of being the first company to be valued at $2tn. Two years ago it become the first company to be valued at $1tn.
Mr Cook took over from Apple founder Steve Jobs nine years ago. His billionaire status is based on the shares he owns and the compensation he has been paid at Apple, and calculated by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
In 2015, he said he planned to give most of his fortune away and has already donated million of dollars worth of Apple shares.
Facebook's Zuckerberg has made a similar pledge to give away the majority of his shares.
Mr Zuckerberg, along with Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Tesla's Elon Musk, accrued their wealth from the huge stakes in the companies they founded.
In comparison, Mr Cook's stake in Apple is minuscule at about 0.02%.
Based on US federal and state taxes for California, Mr Cook would face a tax rate of just over 50%, as a top-bracket earner.
While Apple has not revealed any new products as groundbreaking as its iPhone, the company has still thrived since Mr Cook took over the reins.
He has overseen the development of devices such as the iPhone X and Apple Watch, along with new services like Apple Music."
"Bangladesh could be plunged into a humanitarian crisis as it undergoes the most prolonged monsoon flooding in decades while it is still recovering from the effects of super-cyclone Amphan. Despite the UN has lauding its new initiatives for early intervention aimed at preparing communities for crisis, 550 people have been killed and 9.6 million affected by the disaster in Bangladesh, Nepal and north-eastern India, according to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.  Bangladesh’s ministry for natural disasters has estimated that a third of the country is already underwater, with heavy rains set to continue until the end of July. The UN has estimated that this flooding could be the most protracted since 1988. Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, executive director of the Bangladeshi NGO Coast, said the country was far more prepared for flooding than in the past, but that populations in flooded areas might end up in dire need because of a combination of existing localised and national crises. He said incomes had already been hit by the government’s closure of 25 state-owned jute mills, mostly in northern areas that have been flooded, and by the Covid-19 pandemic. “The country has been locked down for four months and that has had a serious impact. Forty per cent of rural income was coming from urban areas and then suddenly labourers and rickshaw pullers weren’t sending money home,” said Chowdhury. “Almost a third of the population has dropped under the poverty line. This will have an impact on food security and purchasing power, this is a critical situation we have to overcome.” He said local organisations had exhausted funds responding to the pandemic so the UN and international organisations would need to step in, especially to support farmers whose crops may be damaged before the August rice harvest. The UN said it had been trying to pre-empt damage to livelihoods by predicting where support needed to be sent ahead of time, using advances in data and forecasting analytics. That had allowed the release of relief worth $5.2m (£4m) from its reserve fund for humanitarian emergencies to counter severe flooding over the past week in the form of cash, hygiene and health kits, and equipment to protect farmers’ materials from water damage. The UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, Mark Lowcock, said the organisation should no longer be taken by surprise when disasters hit. “Doing something before crises hit can save more lives and costs less money. Plus it’s far more dignified for the people we’re helping,” he said. “If we know a flood is about to hit, why wouldn’t we give river communities the means to get themselves, their livestock and their tools out of harm’s way before the deluge comes, instead of waiting until they’ve lost everything, then try and help?” Sheikh Rokon, founder of the campaign group Riverine People, said the monsoon was essential to life in Bangladesh, recharging water levels and giving life to seasonal wetlands, but that environmental changes were making life harder for communities. “River erosion makes the situation worse. They lose everything but hope and have to struggle for days. This year, riverine communities across the Brahmaputra and Teesta river basins are facing severe erosion,” he said. “A very small riverine community, the water Gypsy, live in the rivers, on boats. Floods makes their life and livelihoods harder.” Rokon said communities usually had little time to prepare, which usually involves moving their belongings to areas protected by embankments. The World Food Programme’s executive director, David Beasley, said improving planning to act on forecasts would help families in the long run. “Year after year, floods devastate Bangladesh. The waters not only swallow up homes and lives but with them progress and hope for the Bangladeshi people,” said Beasley. “I cannot stress enough how important it is to equip communities to prepare and protect themselves against such disasters.”"

I have a friend who is a card-carrying Labour supporter. When she went through a divorce, a decade or so ago, she started dating men and had only one rule. She would not date anyone who was not a Labour voter.



I thought it was a bit odd at the time, but knowing her, it really was for the best. The arguments otherwise would probably have been monumental. Nowadays, however, this appears to be normal behaviour. She was, in fact, starting a trend.



Dating site OkCupid has pointed out that since 2016 the number of women who prioritised shared political views over enjoyable sex [had doubled](https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/429593-politics-is-affecting-dating-intimacy-expert-says), a shift the company described as ‘unprecedented’. 



It doesn’t matter if he is hopeless in bed, so long as he is a Democrat?



Already the proportion of Americans marrying people with the same political views has increased in recent years, from 72 per cent to 82 per cent, and [will rise further](https://niskanencenter.org/blog/how-marriage-and-inequality-reinforce-political-polarization/) because large numbers object now to family members ‘marrying out’.



While in 1960 just 5 per cent of Republicans and 4 per cent of Democrats said they’d be ‘upset’ if a child married a member of the other party, that figure is now [49 and 33 per cent respectively](http://pcl.stanford.edu/research/2012/iyengar-poq-affect-not-ideology.pdf).



So things like a sense of humour, compassion, caring about animals or showing respect to others is becoming less important than how someone votes. Really? I am truly surprised.



This attitude is pervading into other aspects of life too.



Perhaps the most specific advert on SpareRoom is for an expensive loft room in a “stunning mews home”. The advertiser said she wanted “an easy going, open minded professional” to rent the place, while demanding the candidate is pro-choice, a requirement that could rule out tenants of certain religious identities.



She continued: “You should appreciate science – so no climate deniers or anti vaxxers. ? Worldly enough to know that there are bigger issues going on than the misery that is Brexit.”



She may want an ‘easy going open minded’ flatmate, but it would be hard to describe her as easy going and open minded herself. If I were her, I would rather have someone who was tidy and considerate and didn’t engage in loud sex all night long as a flatmate, but each to their own, I guess. 



I am coming to the conclusion that these days, people are just stupid. There are much more important things to look for in a partner, or in a flatmate, than how someone votes (or how they view climate change). It shows how polarised we have all become.



The article is a British one, of course, and the polarising issue there is Brexit. It really is time to get this enormously divisive issue over and done with, once and for all. The damage it is doing to civil society in Britain is dreadful. 



Here is a Facebook post from a UK friend whom I have always thought of as quite reasonable in her views. Bear in mind that it is one of the more civil ones that I could find.



But if Labour wins, the Brexit issue will drag on and on, taxes will be increased, and with a thinly disguised Communist in power, Britain will suffer like never before. 



People like this friend would never have considered voting for a communist and an anti-Semite before. Such is the power of Brexit, that people seem to be losing all reason. 



And, of course, the situation in the USA is no better.



This is almost certainly a growing trend; the _Economist_ recently [covered research](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/07/18/trump-supporters-need-not-apply) showing that large and increasing numbers of Americans do not want to live with supporters of the opposing political party.



This “partyism” spreads into every area of life, so that since 2016 there has been a big growth in dating apps matching people [based on political preferences](https://uk.askmen.com/news/dating/how-dating-apps-are-becoming-a-political-tool.html).



Some of you will know that my husband is a socialist. He held hands and sang ‘Kumbaya’ (don’t ask) with SB at last year’s _Whaleoil_ Christmas barbeque. He had a great day. By these standards, he should have been spitting and snarling and being hateful to everyone there. But guess what? He enjoyed himself. He still talks about it.



How do we tolerate living together? We respect each other’s views. We don’t argue about politics, and surprisingly, there are a few areas in politics where we do agree. No two people will ever agree about everything. If they are on the same page politically, they will probably have differing views about other things. It is human nature.



What we seem to be losing in this ‘woke’ world is tolerance. Think about the lady looking for a flatmate. She doesn’t want political arguments, but doesn’t mind if the new flatmate leaves his socks in the middle of the floor? Of course not. She doesn’t want any of that. She wants a mirror image of herself, and she probably will never find it.



But the gaps opened by the Brexit referendum are even worse, and getting worse; in 2016, 18 per cent of Remainers said they would be unhappy with a Leaver in-law, compared to [just 3 per cent](https://twitter.com/sexliesballots/status/780691814495969280) of Brexiteers. By 2019, this figure had risen to [37 per cent of Remainers](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/1muyphj16u/TheTimes_190114_BrexitFriendsandFamily_w.pdf), and 11 per cent of the other side. 





It is interesting how it is the Remainers who are the most intolerant, just as it is mostly Democrats in the US.



For a different kind of intolerance, though, and probably a much worse type, my family in the UK are Liverpudlians. They would be fine if their children married Tories, Corbynites, Brexiteers or Remainers, so long as they all supported the same football team. This was actually an issue for my niece, who got engaged to a lovely young man, who supported the other side. The ructions this caused within the family were monumental. Fortunately, the relationship prevailed, and the worth and value of the young man in question has been recognised by the rest of the family. But nobody talks about football when he is around.



This lack of tolerance for people with different views is worrying. It is all part of the world trend which shows that we are becoming polarised. At a time when we see more interracial relationships than ever, it seems the biggest issue now is politics. It is madness. Voting for Trump does not make you a bad person.



Unless you are a Democrat, of course.

"Up to eight years’ worth of global greenhouse gas emissions could be prevented over the next four decades by setting tougher standards for air conditioning, according to a study. It found that improving the energy efficiency of cooling systems by using climate-friendly refrigerants could remove emissions equivalent to between 210bn and 460bn tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2060.  The peer-reviewed analysis by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that cutting the use of climate-warming refrigerants such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) alone could help avoid up to 0.4C of global warming by the end of the century. Doubling the energy efficiency of air conditioning by 2050 would cut electricity use by 1,300 gigawatts, the equivalent of all the coal-fired power generation capacity in China and India in 2018, saving up to $2.9tn in electricity costs. More efficient air conditioning would have other benefits too, according to the report, such as better access to life-saving cooling equipment for medicines and vaccines, improved air quality and reduced food loss and waste. According to the report, an estimated 3.6bn cooling appliances are in use worldwide, and this could rise to 14bn by 2050 if cooling is provided to everybody who needs it rather than just those who can afford it. Growing demand for cooling is contributing significantly to climate change by producing HFCs and carbon dioxide and often relying on electricity generated by fossil fuels. That demand is expected to grow faster in the years ahead in response to steadily rising global temperatures, creating a vicious circle of global heating. Carbon emissions from the global energy industry in 2018 rose at the fastest rate in almost a decade, after extreme weather and surprise swings in global temperatures stoked the fastest increase in gas demand for 30 years. The Unep/IEA report calls for action from governments to tackle the climate impacts of cooling as they roll out stimulus packages to deal with the economic and social impacts of the Covid-19 crisis. It calls for all countries to adopt an amendment to the Montreal protocol, an international environmental treaty agreed in 2016 that calls for a drastic reduction in HFCs and was agreed in 2016. Inger Andersen, Unep’s executive director, said climate-friendly cooling could help protect the natural environment and even reduce the risk of future pandemics while preventing runaway carbon emissions. Dr Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said the Covid-19 pandemic offered governments “a unique opportunity to accelerate progress in efficient, climate-friendly cooling”, which he said was “one of the most effective tools governments have to meet energy and environmental objectives”. He added: “By improving cooling efficiency, they can reduce the need for new power plants, cut emissions and save consumers money.”"
"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump, after promising a radical break with the foreign policy of Barack Obama, is embracing some key pillars of the former administration’s strategy, including warning Israel to curb settlement construction, demanding that Russia withdraw from Crimea and threatening Iran with sanctions for ballistic missile tests. In the most startling shift, the White House issued an unexpected statement appealing to the Israeli government not to expand the construction of Jewish settlements beyond their current borders in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Such expansion, it said, “may not be helpful in achieving” the goal of peace. At the United Nations, Ambassador Nikki R. Haley declared that the United States would not lift sanctions against Russia until it stopped destabilizing Ukraine and pulled troops out of Crimea. On Iran, the administration is preparing economic sanctions similar to those the Obama administration imposed just over a year ago. The White House has also shown no indication that it plans to rip up Mr. Obama’s landmark nuclear deal, despite Mr. Trump’s withering criticism of it during the presidential campaign. New administrations often fail to change the foreign policies of their predecessors as radically as they promised, in large part because statecraft is so different from campaigning. And of course, today’s positions could shift over time. There is no doubt the Trump administration has staked out new ground on trade and immigration, upending relations with Mexico and large parts of the Muslim world in the process. But the administration’s reversals were particularly stark because they came after days of tempestuous phone calls between Mr. Trump and foreign leaders, in which he gleefully challenged diplomatic orthodoxy and appeared to jeopardize one relationship after another. Mr. Trump made warmer relations with Russia the centerpiece of his foreign policy during the campaign, and European leaders had been steeling for him to lift sanctions they and Mr. Obama imposed on President Vladimir V. Putin after he annexed Crimea. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump’s United Nations ambassador, Ms. Haley, sounded a lot like her predecessor, Samantha Power. “We do want to better our relations with Russia,” she said in her first remarks to an open session of the United Nations Security Council. “However, the dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions. ” Similarly, Mr. Trump presented himself during the campaign as a stalwart supporter of Israel and criticized the Obama administration for allowing the passage of a Security Council resolution in December that condemned Israel for its expansion of settlements. “While we don’t believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace,” his press secretary, Sean Spicer, said in a statement, “the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal. ” The White House noted that the president “has not taken an official position on settlement activity. ” It said he would discuss the issue with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel when they meet Feb. 15, in effect telling Mr. Netanyahu to wait until then. Emboldened by Mr. Trump’s support, Israel has announced more than 5, 000 new homes in the West Bank since his inauguration. Mr. Trump shifted his policy after he met briefly with King Abdullah II of Jordan on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast  —   an encounter that put the king, one of the most respected leaders of the Arab world, ahead of Mr. Netanyahu in seeing the new president. Jordan, with its large Palestinian population, has been steadfastly critical of settlements. The administration’s abrupt turnaround also coincided with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson’s first day at the State Department and the arrival of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in South Korea on his first official trip. Both men are viewed as potentially capable of exerting a moderating influence on the president and his cadre of White House advisers, though it was unclear how much they had to do with the shifts. With Iran, Mr. Trump has indisputably taken a harder line than his predecessor. While the Obama administration often looked for ways to avoid confrontation with Iran in its last year, Mr. Trump seems equally eager to challenge what he has said is an Iranian expansion across the region, especially in Iraq and Yemen. In an early morning Twitter post on Thursday, Mr. Trump was bombastic on Iran. “Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile,” he wrote. “Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U. S. made with them!” In a second post, he said wrongly, “Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U. S. came along and gave it a   in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion. ” Still, the administration has been careful not to specify what the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, meant when he said on Wednesday that Iran had been put “on notice” for its missile test and for its arming and training of the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The new sanctions could be announced as soon as Friday. But most experts have said they will have little practical effect, because the companies that supply missile parts rarely have direct business with the United States, and allies have usually been reluctant to reimpose sanctions after many were lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear accord. Ali Akbar Velayati, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, replied, “This is not the first time that an inexperienced person has threatened Iran,” according to the semiofficial Fars news agency. “The American government will understand that threatening Iran is useless. ” Some analysts said they worried that the administration did not have tools, short of military action, to back up its warning. “Whether the Trump administration intended it or not, they have created their own red line,” said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. “When Iran tests again, the administration will have no choice but to put up or shut up. ” Mr. Netanyahu will cheer Mr. Trump’s tough tone with Iran. But the statement on settlements may force him to change course on a delicate domestic issue. His coalition government seemed to take Mr. Trump’s inauguration as a starting gun in a race to increase construction in occupied territory. After Mr. Trump was sworn in, Israel announced that it would authorize another 2, 500 homes in areas already settled in the West Bank, and then followed that this week by announcing 3, 000 more. On Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu took it a step further, vowing to build the first new settlement in the West Bank in many years. For Mr. Netanyahu, the settlement spree reflects a sense of liberation after years of constraints from Washington, especially under Mr. Obama, who, like other presidents, viewed settlement construction as an impediment to negotiating a final peace settlement. It is also an effort to deflect criticism from Israel’s political right for Mr. Netanyahu’s compliance with a court order to force several dozen families out of an illegal West Bank outpost, Amona. The “beyond their current borders” phrase in the White House statement hinted at a return to a policy President George W. Bush outlined to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2004, which acknowledged that it was unrealistic to expect Israel to give up its major settlements in a final deal, although they would be offset by mutually   land swaps. Mr. Trump had also promised to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But the White House has slowed down the move, in part out of fear of a violent response. The policy shifts came after a turbulent week in which Mr. Trump also clashed with the leaders of Australia and Mexico over one of the most fraught issues of his new presidency: immigration. He defended the tense exchanges as an overdue display of toughness by a United States that has been exploited “by every nation in the world, virtually. ” “They’re tough we have to be tough. It’s time we’re going to be a little tough, folks,” he said at the prayer breakfast Thursday. “It’s not going to happen anymore. ” Yet later in the day, the White House felt obliged to put a more diplomatic gloss on events. Mr. Spicer said Mr. Trump’s call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia had been “very cordial,” even if Mr. Trump bitterly opposed an agreement negotiated by the Obama administration for the United States to accept the transfer of 1, 250 refugees from an Australian detention camp. A senior administration official disputed a report that Mr. Trump had threatened to send troops to Mexico to deal with its “bad hombres. ” The official said that the conversation with President Enrique Peña Nieto had been “actually very friendly,” and that Mr. Trump had been speaking in jest."
"WASHINGTON  —   Rex W. Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, was confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday in a    vote to become the nation’s 69th secretary of state just as serious strains have emerged with important international allies. The votes against Mr. Tillerson’s confirmation were the most in Senate history for a secretary of state, a reflection of Democratic unease with President Trump’s early foreign policy pronouncements that threaten to upend a multilateral approach that has guided United States presidents since World War II. Thirteen senators voted in 2005 against Condoleezza Rice in the midst of a deteriorating Iraq war, and in 1825, Henry Clay was confirmed 27 to 14, the record for votes against until Wednesday, according to a tally provided by the Senate Historical Office. In a brief   ceremony in the Oval Office on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump said Mr. Tillerson understood “the importance of strengthening our alliances and forming new alliances to enhance our strategic interests and the safety of our people. ” Mr. Trump added, “It’s time to bring a   focus on foreign affairs, to take a fresh look at the world around us, and to seek new solutions grounded in very ancient truths. ” Mr. Tillerson thanked him and promised to “represent the interests of all of the American people at all times. ” Mr. Tillerson is expected to appear at the State Department’s Foggy Bottom headquarters on Thursday morning, when he will address department employees. Mr. Trump’s unapologetically nationalistic approach has put into question the value of many alliances and multilateral institutions. How Mr. Tillerson’s translates Mr. Trump’s vow of “America First” into the kind of polite diplomatic parlance that will maintain vital ties will be a significant test. Among his other challenges are dealing with Mr. Trump’s promises to recast relations with China and Russia, move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, and   an international nuclear deal with Iran. In a White House briefing on Wednesday, Michael Flynn, the national security adviser, issued a stern warning to Iran. “The Obama administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran’s malign actions,” he said. Mr. Tillerson, 64, a Texan, earned an engineering degree from the University of Texas at Austin, got a job at Exxon in 1975 and climbed his way to the top, leaving only last year. Neither a diplomat, soldier nor politician, he is an unconventional choice for the job, but has vast international experience. With operations on six continents, Exxon Mobil is in some ways a state within a state. As its chief executive, Mr. Tillerson struck deals with repressive governments  —   in at least one case, against the advice of the State Department. Environmentalists largely opposed his nomination. But his views on international affairs are in many ways more conventional than those of Mr. Trump, which is why even   foreign affairs experts said they welcomed his selection in hopes he would bring ballast to a turbulent administration. “Rex Tillerson will have the most demanding and complex agenda to face a secretary of state in a very long time,” said R. Nicholas Burns, a Harvard professor and career foreign service officer. Another crucial question will be how much influence Mr. Tillerson has on Mr. Trump. All cabinet secretaries must compete for power with White House aides who have long personal relationships with and frequent access to the president. But Mr. Trump’s reliance on a close circle of advisers to write and vet executive orders while keeping departments that must implement them largely in the dark is without precedent. Mr. Trump invited Mr. Tillerson for a private lunch at the White House on Wednesday, the first time Mr. Tillerson has appeared on the president’s official schedule. Mollifying allies infuriated by Mr. Trump’s orders could be a   job. A ban on refugee arrivals and entries from seven Muslim countries, for instance, has enraged Iraqi officials whose cooperation is vital in the fight against the Islamic State  —   a top administration priority. It has also infuriated many European leaders crucial to efforts not only in Syria, but Afghanistan and Libya as well, and it has tarnished what had been viewed as a successful trip by Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who on Monday said she opposed the ban. Relations with Mexico have plunged to their lowest level in decades after Mr. Trump insisted he would build a border wall regardless of Mexican opposition. The relationship with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany threatened to become toxic after Peter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump’s new National Trade Council, denounced the relatively low value of the euro as an unfair currency advantage for Germany. “Tillerson faces the most difficult task of any secretary of state in the postwar era in trying to reconcile President Trump’s intention to make a stark break from decades of bipartisan consensus U. S. foreign policy leadership with the reality that, if he succeeds, such a break could lead to global chaos,” said Ryan C. Crocker, who served as the United States ambassador to five Muslim countries. Mr. Tillerson may also face difficult internal hurdles. Much of his department’s top leadership has departed  —   many because the Trump administration, like others before it, refused to keep political appointees. But the Trump transition team has been so   and the pickings among Republican foreign policy veterans who had not criticized Mr. Trump so slim that dozens of positions are likely to remain empty for some time. More worrisome, morale among the department’s    career officers has plunged, with a dissent memo against the administration’s refugee and entry bans being submitted on Tuesday garnering more than 900 signatures, an extraordinary number. Whether Mr. Tillerson meets these challenges with defiance or moderation will be a telling indication of his leadership. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Monday that foreign service officers “can get with the program or they can go. ”"

"Lammas Day on 1 August is about halfway between the summer solstice and autumn equinox. It was celebrated as Loaf Day in the Christian church when the first harvested wheat was made into fresh bread as an offering. Like many festivities and holidays, once so important to a population tied to the land, this Christian celebration was an adaption of a much older pagan festival connected with the changing seasons. Lammas-tide, as Shakespeare referred to it in Romeo and Juliet, involved feasting, celebrating the beginning of harvest and matchmaking. Lammas is still celebrated in various forms in Ireland and other regions with Celtic traditions, sometimes involving trekking up mountains to make offerings. The way the climate is changing, and with it the dates of the harvest, it would now be easy to find enough newly harvested grain to make a loaf by 1 August. Sixty years ago it would have been much more of a struggle. Farmers felt they were lucky if the weather was warm and dry enough to ripen the wheat by the end of August to allow their combine harvesters to gather it in. Maybe the origin of Loaf Day was in the medieval warm period when there was a reasonable chance of a ripe harvest at such an early date. "
"A global coalition of 11,000 scientists has come up with a plan for dealing with the climate emergency. Most of these are things scientists have been saying for a while: decarbonise the economy, eliminate pollutants, restore ecosystems and reforest, and reduce meat consumption. However, the last action point is somewhat more controversial. It calls for stabilising the global population.   The reason it is controversial is because not everyone in the world is equally to blame for the greenhouse gases that are causing climate change. Much more important than how many people are being born is where – as it is the richest countries that are responsible for the vast majority of emissions. But its in the poorest countries that populations are rising. The global population has more than doubled since 1970. The main reason for this massive increase is something called the demographic transition. In the earlier stages of a country’s development, societies tend to have high child mortality rates that are offset by high fertility rates, leaving the population relatively stable. Couples have as many children as they can to ensure that some – on average two – survive to adulthood. As societies develop a more stable food supply, better sanitation and widely available treatment for common diseases, mortality rates drop rapidly. But in many cases, fertility rates stay high for a while. The number of babies born stays the same, but as nearly all of them make it to adulthood, the population expands rapidly. Depending on how the time lag between mortality and fertility falling, the post-transition population can be between four and ten times higher than pre-transition, and in rare cases even more. Many people assume that universal access to family planning and the availability of contraception are key to reducing fertility rates quickly. But the first demographic transition can be traced to the European Enlightenment, just before the 19th century – when these services were not available. Instead, it seems that women’s education up to and beyond secondary school level is the critical control of fertility. The rapid spread of vaccinations and the expanded food supply created by the green agricultural revolution in the 1960s meant that at its peak, global population was growing at over 2% per year. In 1950, each woman gave birth on average to five live babies. Now that the demographic transition has already happened in many countries around the world, the figure is below 2.5. Of course, while the average birth rate is falling every year, the world’s population is still growing by 200,000 a day. The United Nations predicts that the population will rise to between 9.4 and 10.1 billion people by 2050, and stabilise by 2100. That’s another 1.7 to 2.4 billion people.  This projected rise has been the subject of much emotive debate in the context of the increasingly urgent climate emergency – which has allowed some key myths to spread. The first is that we cannot produce enough food for everyone – according to the World Food Programme there are 821m people on the brink of starvation today. But in fact, we produce enough food to feed 10 billion people – easily enough to cover the predicted increase in population this century. The reason there are so many people starving is because they cannot access this global food surplus – usually through lack of money. When the very poor lose their livelihoods through civil unrest, war or crop failure, they have no resources to fall back on and no money to buy the food they need to survive. The second myth is that stabilising population is a key solution to climate change. This is misleading and unhelpful because it makes a simplistic assumption that everyone’s contribution is equal. A third of the carbon pumped into the atmosphere to date has come from the US, and another third from the EU. Africa has contributed just 3%. So a small percentage of the world population has created the climate crisis. If you divide current emissions by individuals rather than countries, you find that the richest 10% of the world’s population emits 50% of greenhouse gas emissions. The richest 50% emits 90%, meaning the poorest 3.8 billion people in the world emits just a tenth. If it were the richest countries whose populations were rising, population control would be a solution to the climate emergency. But it’s not – it’s the poorest. Over-consumption by the wealthy is causing climate change, not rising population. Put another way, the average American emits nine times more CO₂ than the average Indian – so population reduction in the US would be much more effective in curbing greenhouse emissions than stabilising growing populations elsewhere. Some may argue that new populations will eventually emit more as societies continue to develop. But the climate crisis is now and the world needs to go carbon neutral by 2050. So by the time poorer nations have developed enough to have a large middle-class, we must have developed a fully functioning global green sustainable economy and weaned ourselves off of excessive consumption – otherwise, it will already be too late. While it might not be an immediate solution to the climate emergency, stabilising the world’s population is still important. This is because human impacts go beyond just changing the composition of the atmosphere. Globally, human activities move more soil, rock and sediment each year than is transported by all other natural processes combined. We have cut down 3 trillion trees, roughly half of those on the planet, and made enough concrete to cover the Earth’s surface in a layer 2mm thick. There are now more mobile phones than people.  With the global economy set to double in the next 25 years and a population that could reach 10 billion, the potential increase in our impact is immense. The challenge of this century is to achieve a stable global population supported by a sustainable economy that reduces our burden on the planet.       Having a stable population is also essential at the country level. It allows governments to better ensure food, water and resource security for all their citizens. It also makes it easier to provide improved healthcare services and economic opportunities for a greater proportion of citizens. Imagine the huge challenges that Nigeria faces with a population that has grown by 100m people in less than 20 years.  While women’s education and universal access to family planning around the world would undoubtedly help stabilise population and bring major benefits, they are not a global solution to the problems of climate change. The roles of urbanisation, wealth distribution and consumption patterns are much more important to understand and control greenhouse gas emissions. We cannot use population as a way of blaming the world’s poor for the climate crisis. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

"On 4 November, the day after the presidential election, the US is poised to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. The agreement, which came together after years of diplomacy by the Obama administration and other global leaders, commits 200 countries to chart a new course in efforts to combat climate change. But very soon the United States may not be one of them. The Paris climate agreement sets out a global framework to try to stop dangerous climate change and, for the first time, the world’s major carbon emitters stood side by side and committed to do better. But just months after he took office, Donald Trump announced that the US would withdraw from the agreement and would no longer take collective responsibility for the future of the planet. Since then, Trump has continued to actively work against measures that could tackle the climate crisis. His administration has removed countless environmental protections, boosted the fossil fuel industry, buried the federally mandated National Climate Assessment report, disappeared climate change science from US government websites, and helped foster an anti-science atmosphere throughout his administration. America’s modern commitment to environmentalism took root exactly 50 years ago when Earth Day protests led to the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Clean Air and Water Act. In just four years, the Trump administration has set about dismantling much of the progress that has been made. By withdrawing from the Paris agreement it will now weaken the global resolve to tackle the climate crisis. The stakes could scarcely be higher. With your help we can put this issue at the center of our 2020 election coverage. The election will be a referendum on the future of democracy, racial justice, the supreme court, and so much more. But hovering over all of these is whether the US will play its role in helping take collective responsibility for the future of the planet. The period since the Paris agreement was signed has been the five hottest years on record. If carbon emissions continue, substantial climate change is unavoidable. Over the next 100 days, Guardian US will publish a series of stories about the many impacts of the climate crisis. The series will focus on people of color and vulnerable communities across the globe, who are uniquely exposed to the dangers of a heating planet. We will examine Joe Biden’s proposals to tackle climate change and whether they are up to the task. And we will elevate the young people whose futures will be shaped by the crisis and the world’s response to it. The series is sponsored by We Are Still In and We Mean Business, but the content is editorially independent from the sponsors. On 21 September, during Climate Week, we will join with Covering Climate Now and some of the world’s leading media organizations to highlight first-time voters facing a future of environmental peril. We have invited these voters to apply to be Guardian US guest editors on that day. We would like your help with this project. The Guardian has long led on climate journalism, even when other outlets were hesitant to report on the issue with the urgency it requires. Earlier this year, we renounced fossil fuel advertising. Like other news organizations, the Guardian has been hit hard by the collapse of advertising revenue resulting from the pandemic. As a result, we rely to a greater extent on support from our readers. We have chosen to keep our journalism free, because we believe everyone needs and deserves access to high quality reporting on the climate crisis and the other pressing issues of the day. We hope you’ll consider contributing today to support the Guardian and make our journalism even more impactful."
"For every tonne of rice produced, about a tonne of straw is grown. Given 770m tonnes of rice are produced each year, that’s a lot of straw. Some of this straw is used as livestock bedding and fodder, in building materials, or ploughed back into the soil as fertiliser. But there’s much more straw than can be used and it’s labour and cost-intensive to remove it after harvest.  This makes rice straw a major disposal problem, particularly across Asia where 90% of the world’s rice is grown, and where several million tonnes of straw are burned in rice fields each year. Although governments have made this practice illegal many farmers do it anyway, releasing greenhouse gases, harmful particles and toxic pollutants.  But  colleagues and I are working on a project to transform rice straw from a waste product into a resource of renewable fuel. Our research looks at how to stop the straw burning, while improving energy access and contributing to socioeconomic development in the Philippines. Our work has shown that the straw can be gathered and processed to produce “biogas” for both domestic and commercial uses.  This is particularly important in the rural area of the Philippines where we’re working, as people don’t have easy access to sufficient and sustainable fuel. Wood and charcoal are often used for cooking, but this means deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and the smoke they produce reduces life expectancy and quality of life. Our pilot plant in Laguna province takes the rice straw and turns it into biogas, a renewable energy source, using a method called anaerobic digestion. After collecting the straw from the rice fields, we feed it into two large digesters, trapping it without oxygen but with plenty of microorganisms which occur naturally and already exist in small amounts in the air and on the straw.  The idea is to replicate a process which also happens in nature when for example dead plants decay. We add small amounts of cow manure from nearby farms, to boost the amount of microorganisms and support a favourable environment for them to thrive and decompose the straw and produce biogas. The biogas can be used for fuel. And at the end of the production process the digested straw is composted to provide a nutritious fertiliser, which can be used on fields to improve crop yield and soil quality. But none of this matters unless local rice farmers actually think it is worthwhile. That’s why our work focuses on analysing the project’s benefits for the local community, and how bioenergy can become part of their agricultural and everyday practices.   Colleagues and I have travelled to the Philippines on numerous occasions to discuss the viability of different business models with various local groups. We considered the whole value chain from growing, harvesting and selling the rice, through to how the straw should best be gathered and handled, or how biogas could be best used. This way we can ensure that rice farmers become partners and beneficiaries, actively shaping the project and identifying possible opportunities. For instance, we learned that farmers saw the biogas production more as an additional benefit, while they felt their main gain was solving their straw problem. We also realised the digested straw left behind after the biogas production provides a good substrate for mushroom growing, so before returning the digestate to the field, farmers could grow mushrooms and gain an additional income. That meant for us testing different ways of straw removal as well as working together with farmers to start identifying possible ways to produce mushrooms.  We tested a few different business models together with local farmers, to find out what works best in reality. The biogas plant can provide a technical solution for environmental issues, but to make it work and truly benefit the community you have to consider factors beyond technology and climate change. It also shows that regulation alone, for example on burning rice straw, won’t solve the problem – solutions must be practical and demonstate wider benefits. If we are to enable socioeconomic development and greenhouse gas reductions, the breakthrough comes from looking at the biggest global uses and improving them in a way that people will actually deploy, because it delivers what they need as well as meeting global sustainability objectives."

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo days ago David Dilley wrote about the widespread suppression of alternative scientific views on climate change at the academic level, even though these skeptical views are far more in line with observations than the climate model projections. 
Today he comments on the apparent suppression of science at the American Meteorological Association (AMS).
========================================
The American Meteorological Society (AMS) – Living Up to Their Mission – or Suppressing Vital Climate Information?
By David Dilley (former NOAA meteorologist)
Suppression of science is not only going on at universities and academic institutions, but also at societies and government operated agencies.
The American Meteorological Society (AMS) mission statement claims they are “a prestigious membership scientific society that promotes the development, dissemination and education on the atmospheric, oceanic and hydrologic sciences – and the advancement of their professional applications”. Is there a play on words here – maybe advancement of “their” professional applications? Does this mean they promote only “their” views and not others? Could this mean they are obstructing some advances in science by refusing to consider certain aspects of climate change research, such as natural cycles?

This very well may be the case, especially their statement gives the appearance of a final conclusion: “Warming of the climate system now is unequivocal” and “is beyond what can be explained by the natural variability of the climate”. Further into their mission statement they talk only about warming during the past century, and absolutely nothing about prior climate cycles. Have they taken sides with the aim of promoting only anthropogenic grants and dismiss natural cycle research entirely? Indications that this is so are hard not to notice. How will history judge an institution that excludes the huge factor of solar activity from the climate equation?
AMS Suppression of Science Concerning Natural Climate Change – and Other Views
In my last post we saw that according to Dr. William Gray of the University of Colorado, and other researchers, if you are associated with a university and believe in cyclical climate change rather than anthropogenic induced change, you’ll have to wait until after retirement to publish science that supports alternative views. And then you will still hit major snags, among them cut-off grant money, journals that will you jump through hoops, unreasonably nitpicky editors and reviewers,who often refuse papers simply because they do not like your view.
And the same holds true for private researchers. I submitted a proposed natural cycle paper to the AMS Journal of Climate back in 2007 and promptly received a curt reply by the editor: “not in this journal”. As a result of the obstacles encountered in publishing natural cycle research, I took an alternative route and proceeded online by publishing the EBook “Global Warming-Global Cooling, Natural Cause Found”, which was peer-reviewed by three meteorologists and published online in 2009. It was later updated online in 2012. A video update was published on the NoTricksZone on 12 August 2015: “We Are Now Starting To See A Dramatic Cooling In The Arctic”, Says Former NOAA Meteorologist … “Extremely Cold From 2025 To 2050!”
And finally, a few years after my manuscript was rejected by the AMS in a very curt manner, I submitted a membership request in 2010 for my Global Weather Oscillations Incorporated (GWO) to become a corporate member. GWO fulfilled all of the AMS guidelines for membership, yet the board voted membership down 5-0. Prior to the vote the AMS office looked through the GWO web site, and especially our views on climate change. This heightened my curiosity concerning membership denial, so I wrote to the AMS asking why the corporate membership was denied. Their response came about 3 months later: “do not know why“.  I then found out through an AMS employee that during the past 30 years – only 3 corporations had ever been denied membership. So again I tried to find out why by calling the Executive Director of the AMS. His reply: all 5 board members voted not to grant membership and that there were “no records regarding the decision“.   Really? No records or recollection? Does this seem odd?
What are they trying to hide?

Chart above shows that a major swath of the Arctic, North Atlantic and North America has seen cold temperatures this year.
But there are some fascinating developments in the Arctic region this year: A huge area of North America and the North Atlantic, including Greenland, has been colder than normal so far this year. Remember, this area is supposed to be the canary in the coal mine. The German site writes:

In the 2014/2015 season the daily course and accumulated ice mas development on Greenland measured in gigatons since September 1, 2014 is showing a mass growth (lower chart) of around 200 gigatons, or 200 cubic kilometers.”

"**Facebook has complied with an order by Brazil's Supreme Court to block the accounts of a dozen top allies of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro.**
The group are accused of spreading fake news against judges.
However, the social media giant said the measure was a threat to freedom of speech, and said it would appeal against the order.
Its platform has been used to call for a military coup to shut down Congress and the Supreme Court.
In May a judge ordered Facebook to block 12 accounts and Twitter another 16.
On Friday Brazil's Supreme Court fined Facebook 1.92m reais ($368,000; Â£280,000) for refusing to block worldwide access to the accounts - it had only agreed to block access to accounts that could accessed from Brazil - and a further 100,000 reais for each day it failed to comply.
It was not clear whether Twitter had also been fined.
Facebook said in a statement that the order was extreme, ""conflicting with laws and jurisdictions worldwide"".
""Given the threat of criminal liability to a local employee, at this point we see no other alternative than complying with the decision by blocking the accounts globally, while we appeal to the Supreme Court,"" it said.
Among the accounts blocked are those of Roberto Jefferson, leader of a party loyal to the president, and Luciano Hang, one of Brazil's best known businessmen.
Facebook and Twitter are under growing pressure to tackle hate speech and false information.
In July Facebook blocked dozens of accounts on Facebook and Instagram which it said were involved in creating ""fictitious personas posing as reporters"" and ""masquerading as news outlets"".
It said it had linked the accounts to employees in the offices of Mr Bolsonaro, his sons Eduardo and FlÃ¡vio, and others."
"Efforts to tackle climate change often focus on international agreements and the actions of large countries such as the US and China. But most of the world’s countries or autonomous states have fewer than 10m people. What happens in small states is critical to the world’s transition to low-carbon energy. This isn’t necessarily because of the amount of emissions small states can cut (although that is important). Instead, their policies can help develop the renewable energy infrastructure the whole world needs, and send important signals to other governments, private investors and the general population about how the fight against climate change is developing. The Welsh government recently became the latest small state authority to announce an ambition to become carbon neutral by 2050. Looking at what Wales is already doing and what it still needs to do to reach its carbon targets can provide some useful lessons for other small states hoping to decarbonise.  First, Wales has not just an ambitious target but also a unique legislative framework for climate policy through the Well-being of Futures Generation (Wales) Act 2015. This act emphasises the value of preventing problems from occurring rather than addressing them after they emerge. It aims to merge policy issues, such as public health, climate change and economic prosperity, and mandates that all policy must contribute to sustainability and not undermine long-term goals. And it says people must be seen as part of the solution to climate change, not part of the problem.  This framework is a perfect fit for ambitious climate policy, as it takes a long-term perspective, engages citizens and prioritises sustainability. Climate policies are easier to develop when seen as flowing from such prior commitments. Other states could take a similar approach to provide the basis for more ambitious climate goals and policy. But Wales’s experience also shows that a forward-looking legislative framework doesn’t automatically lead to a bolder climate policy. Similarly, the Welsh government’s grand political commitment of declaring a climate emergency in April 2019 hasn’t been backed up with concrete policy innovation. More specifically, current Welsh climate policy has a lack of urgency, tending to favour waiting for more information rather than acting now. It relies too much on a top-down approach of government inadequately regulating and providing economic incentives to the markets, rather than directly supporting the population to produce and consume clean energy in efficient ways. There is also no strategic plan that will set out how much clean energy Wales needs to fully decarbonise its economy over the next two to three decades, and bewilderment over how to start decarbonising the transport sector.  Instead, Wales and other small countries should opt for a bottom-up energy transition built around citizens taking action. This boils down to encouraging and opening up energy efficiency schemes and small-scale and community energy generation. And it means exploiting the benefits of a decentralised, integrated electricity system, such as using people’s electric car batteries to store renewable electricity overnight. To overhaul the transport sector, Wales needs to install a large number of fast charging points to encourage people to buy electric vehicles. This should be relatively easy in the country’s densely populated south-east, but more challenging in its more sparsely populated and rural regions. All these things need an upgraded electricity grid and an increase in clean energy. As things stand, Wales’s dependence on centralised UK-wide financing remains a significant barrier. For example, a proposed tidal lagoon scheme was recently cancelled by the UK government. Independent states, of course, will have more freedom in this area. But something Wales could do is establish a public energy company to oversee a reduction in energy demand, rolling out smart meters, financing smart, energy efficient appliances, and audit residential energy consumption to where it is most inefficient. This innovative proposal was debated by the National Assembly for Wales but rejected by the Welsh government. Another particular challenge for Wales – and many other small states – is the significance of agriculture to its economy. The UK government’s advisory Committee on Climate Change has argued that Wales should only target a 95% reduction in carbon emissions because its agriculture would make it too difficult to reach net zero emissions. Agriculture emissions can’t be eliminated so, to overcome this challenge, Wales will need more schemes to absorb carbon dioxide, such as forest planting.   Despite the country’s small size and carbon footprint, Wales’s climate policy is critical for supporting the wider climate agenda and the same is true for other small autonomous states and countries. Wales’s experience shows how an innovative legislative framework can lay the ground for policy breakthroughs, but countries still need strategic plans and a sense of urgency to make an impact.

"She had her fun and, it appears, she was ready to come home. After a brief flirtation with freedom, Ollie, a    bobcat living at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington, was found on Wednesday near the zoo’s birdhouse, officials said. Though they could not retrace the   bobcat’s nearly   adventure, officials said she might have left the property but most likely never strayed more than two miles from the zoo. “We’re just    happy,” Craig Saffoe, the zoo’s curator of great cats, said at an evening news conference. Ollie’s disappearance on Monday morning reportedly led some area schools to cancel recess and inspired a slew of jokes, a Twitter parody account and grand metaphors. (She had become “a symbol of freedom and one of its last hopes in a world gone rotten,” The Washingtonian proclaimed on Wednesday night.) But for zoo officials, her capture, thanks to a tip from a visitor who spotted her crossing a walkway, offered relief. After receiving the tip, staff members at the birdhouse notified Mr. Saffoe and his colleagues, who set up live traps in the area of the sighting. “Within 15 minutes, the birdhouse keepers called us back and told us, ‘We have a bobcat in a trap up here,’” he said. Ollie was taken to a veterinary hospital, where she was determined to have suffered no harm from the adventure, save a small cut on her front left paw, said Dr. Brandie Smith, the National Zoo’s associate director for animal care sciences. “There’s no need to treat it,” Dr. Smith said. “We’re just letting her be kind of calm and safe and secure. ” Ollie will receive a full examination on Thursday, and the zoo plans to investigate how she was able to leave her enclosure, Dr. Smith added. Ollie probably never traveled far, apparently sticking close to Rock Creek, which abuts the zoo, Mr. Saffoe said. Reported sightings of her on a nearby road appeared to be credible, too, he added. “I think she wanted to go out, have a little bit of fun, see what it was like on the outside,” he said. Zoo officials said this week that they did not consider Ollie a threat to humans, but that she might pose a threat to cats, dogs and birds. Mr. Saffoe described her on Wednesday as “standoffish. ” “She’s not the cat who’s going to walk right up to you,” he said, adding that he had suspected she was nearby and watching as the zoo staff set up the trap that ultimately ensnared her. “She was just waiting to see what kind of goodies we left for her,” he said. The last animal to vanish at the National Zoo was a male agouti  —   a   rodent  —   named Macadamia, said Pamela   a zoo spokeswoman. He escaped for only a  . The Virginia Zoo in Norfolk has not been as fortunate: It has yet to report any reliable leads in the search for Sunny, a red panda who disappeared early last week."
"When Naya arrived in Belgium in January 2018, she was the first wolf to be tracked in the country for at least 100 years. She’d been followed with a radio collar since she was a cub, so scientists knew when she left her family pack in eastern Germany to start a new life across the border. They also knew when she met another interloper, the male wolf, August, in August 2018.  Their cubs were the first Belgian-born wolves in over a century. A handful of fleeting wolf sightings in Belgium and the Netherlands in recent years led many to believe that the species is back for good in northeast Europe, reoccupying the territories they vacated after centuries of hunting. Instead, Naya is now almost certainly dead.  Naya was a bit special. Wolves will often strike out for new territory, but Naya’s was an adventurous trek west, captured by radio and camera traps. Her journey seemed the culmination of the gray wolf’s recolonisation of western Europe from old strongholds in Poland and Romania.  The wolf’s return to old European haunts is matched by the comeback of brown bear, Eurasian lynx and wolverine in other parts of central and western Europe. These species are increasingly at home outside of nature reserves, sharing the land with humans. Wolves are expanding their range in North America too, increasingly into urban areas. But the last photos of Naya, taken by the Belgium government’s Nature and Forest Research Institute, were in May 2019. Her mate, August, has reverted to lone wolf behaviours and is no longer caching food for cubs. Government and conservation groups agree that Naya and her cubs are dead. A €30,000 reward for information has been raised, petitions launched seeking justice against Naya’s “murderer” and a furious war of words has ignited between conservationists and hunters, who have been fingered as Naya’s killers. From such high hopes only a year before, does Naya’s death endanger the idea of modern societies living alongside large predators like wolves? There is a grim inevitability to Naya’s fate. Wolves, above all predators, seem to provoke intense reactions. We either revere them as an incarnation of essential wildness, spawning hundreds of t-shirt designs – usually with added moon and a bit of howling – or they prove an irresistible target for hunters. In the latter category, wolves are an intruder, an existential affront that must be wiped out, regardless of wider public tolerance or legal protection. The survival of large carnivores sharing our landscapes depends as much on public mood and knowledge as it does practical conservation. A recent study set out to untangle different influences on people’s attitudes to wolves in Germany, where the species returned in 2000. The researchers wanted to know which information sources had the greatest impact in forming opinions about these new neighbours.  The study compared the responses from people living in an area with wolves to those from people living further afield. In the region with wolves, people held more neutral views compared with the positive responses elsewhere. People who lived alongside wolves had more knowledge about them, but were also less positive about the species if they got their information from the press or TV news. Unfortunately, that’s where most people heard about the wolves. If people got more of their information from books or films, they were more likely to have positive attitudes about wolves. Clearly, wolves like Naya need better agents – more film roles or sympathetic novels could swing public opinion in their favour.  There are only a few wolf celebrities to counter the blood-stained cliché, notably the Jungle Book’s wolf pack, a loving family, who adopt and protect Mowgli. There is also the she-wolf who suckled Romulus and Remus, the brothers who founded Rome, although Romulus later murdered his brother, so maybe his upbringing left something to be desired. The benefits and drawbacks of wolves are widely known, or, quite often, widely assumed. Wolves can attack people and livestock, but they also create jobs and generate tourism. They can also reinvigorate landscapes by hunting the herbivores that stop trees and forests from growing. As with most things when it comes to wolves, both the positives and negatives seem to be exaggerated.  The main challenge remains that wolves have a terrible branding problem; wherever wolves and people have lived side by side, their place in our folklore and faiths is malevolent and unusually rapacious. As Naya’s death shows, they may be irretrievably typecast."
"It was a balmy June day in 2017 when Donald Trump took to the lectern in the White House Rose Garden to announce the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, the only comprehensive global pact to tackle the spiraling crisis. Todd Stern, who was the US’s chief negotiator when the deal was sealed in Paris in 2015, forced himself to watch the speech. “I found it sickening, it was mendacious from start to finish,” said Stern. “I was furious … because here we have this really important thing and here’s this joker who doesn’t understand anything he’s talking about. It was a fraud.” The terms of the accord mean no country can leave before November this year, so due to a quirk of timing, the US will officially exit the Paris deal on 4 November – 100 days from now and just one day after the 2020 presidential election. The completion of Stern’s misery, and possibly any realistic hopes of averting disastrous climate change, rests heavily upon the outcome of the election, which will pit Trump against former vice-president Joe Biden, who has vowed to rejoin the climate agreement. The lifetime of the Paris agreement, signed in a wave of optimism in 2015, has seen the five hottest years ever recorded on Earth, unprecedented wildfires torching towns from California to Australia, record heatwaves baking Europe and India and temperatures briefly bursting beyond 100F (38C) in the Arctic. These sorts of impacts could be a mere appetizer, scientists warn, given they have been fueled by levels of global heating that are on track to triple, or worse, by the end of the century without drastic remedial action. The faltering global effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions and head off further calamity hinges, in significant part, on whether the US decides to re-enter the fray. “The choice of Biden or Trump in the White House is huge, not just for the US but for the world generally to deal with climate change,” said Stern. “If Biden wins, November 4 is a blip, like a bad dream is over. If Trump wins, he seals the deal. The US becomes a non-player and the goals of Paris become very, very difficult. Without the US in the long term, they certainly aren’t realistic.” Nearly 200 countries put their name to the Paris accords, pledging to face down the climate emergency and limit the average global temperature rise to “well below” 2C above the era before mass industrialization started pumping huge volumes of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere from cars, trucks, power plants and farms. A more aspirational goal of halting temperatures at a 1.5C rise was also included although, just five years on, the planet is already creeping perilously close to this mark. The Paris deal brought major, growing emitters like China and India on board with the quest to shift towards cleaner sources of energy, in part due to the urgings of Barack Obama, who claimed the agreement showed the US was now a “global leader in the fight against climate change”. If Trump wins, he seals the deal. The US becomes a non-player and the goals of Paris become very, very difficult Trump, who once famously called climate science a “hoax”, has never looked kindly on the deal, which he framed as an international effort to damage the US while letting China off too lightly. In his Rose Garden speech, Trump remarked that he was elected to “represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” In reality, each country is free to choose its own emissions cuts without any sort of enforcement. “Paris is like a vessel, such as a glass – you can pour water or wine into it,” said Sue Biniaz, a former US state department lawyer who drafted parts of the Paris deal. “It’s not the design of Paris that’s the problem, it’s that there’s not the political will to do enough.” The US government in practice abandoned any concern over the climate crisis some time ago, with the Trump administration so far rolling back more than 100 environmental protections, including an Obama-era plan to curb emissions from coal-fired power plants, limits on pollution emitted from cars and trucks and even energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs. In an often chaotic presidency, Trump’s position on climate change has been unusually consistent – American fossil fuel production must be bolstered, restrictive climate regulations must be scrapped. Unswayed by growing alarm among Americans over the climate crisis, Trump is taking this same message to the election. “Biden wants to massively re-regulate the energy economy, rejoin the Paris climate accord, which would kill our energy totally, you would have to close 25% of your businesses and kill oil and gas development,” the president said this month, without citing evidence, as he announced another rollback, this time of environmental assessments of pipelines, highways and other infrastructure. Despite all this, US emissions have continued to fall, due in large part to the downfall of a coal industry that Trump has attempted to prop up. The international ramifications have been telling, however – in the absence of any sort of positive cajoling from the US, global emissions have remained stubbornly high and most countries are lagging behind their own promised actions. According to the Climate Action Tracker, only Morocco is acting consistently with the Paris agreement’s goals, with the global temperature rise set to exceed 3C by the end of the century even if the current pledges are met. Paris was meant to be only the beginning – countries are supposed to continually ratchet up their ambition levels until the more extreme ravages of climate change, such as dire flooding, heatwaves, crop failures and the loss of coral reefs, are avoided. Four more years of Donald Trump could delay global emissions cuts by 10 years “There’s been less political will from other countries to take action to a certain extent because the US isn’t pushing for it,” said Biniaz. “During the first four years of Trump it’s easier to say it’s likely to be an aberration, a short-term deviation, but if it’s eight years it’s harder to keep together the coalition of countries that care about this.” Another four years of a Trump administration uninterested in the climate crisis could set back global emissions cuts by a decade, according to one published analysis, making the chances of meeting the goals of Paris near to impossible. Hakon Saelen, an environmental economist at the University of Oslo who led the study, said the US withdrawal is a “significant major blow” to the mitigation of the climate crisis. “The world cannot afford any delay if the 2C target is to be reached,” he said. “Our model indicates that the chance of reaching it is very low already, but near zero with another Trump term.” But even with an engaged Biden administration that is somehow able to get Congress to agree to a $2tn plan to shift the US on to renewable energy, the challenge is immense. The world has dithered on cutting emissions for so long that only an unprecedented, rapid overhaul of the way we travel, generate energy and eat will keep humanity within the bounds of safety outlined in Paris. The world will have to slash emissions by more than 7% a year this decade to have any hope of meeting the 1.5C target, according to the United Nations. This annual cut will be achievable this year only through the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic, which shuttered much of the global economy. A more sustainable path to decarbonization will need to be immediately identified and implemented. “The warmer it gets the worse it gets and the [Paris] targets are broadly at a level where things will get really bad,” said Zeke Hausfather, director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute. “We don’t want people to give up hope, the human race won’t become extinct at 2C but that’s an unnecessarily high bar. There are still large threats and a lot of good reasons to keep warming below that. Stern said American voters will naturally be “supersonic focused” on coronavirus and the economic fallout. “But climate change can’t be forgotten this election,” he said. “The Covid crisis has shown us countries can do remarkable things in short order when they believe they have to. It shows us we need leaders who also understand what we need to do on climate change, because that is another meteorite heading our way.”"
"**Facebook has banned all accounts linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory movement from its platforms.**
""Starting today, we will remove Facebook Pages, Groups and Instagram accounts,"" the company said on Tuesday.
The move is a significant escalation to Facebook's earlier decision to remove or restrict groups and accounts sharing and promoting QAnon material.
QAnon is a conspiracy theory that says President Trump is waging a war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles.
In a statement released on Tuesday, Facebook said its staff had begun removing content and deleting groups and pages, but that ""this work will take time and will continue in the coming days and weeks"".
""Our Dangerous Organizations Operations team will continue to enforce this policy and proactively detect content for removal instead of relying on user reports,"" the statement added.
Facebook said it was updating measures implemented in August, which aimed to ""disrupt the ability of QAnon"" to organise through - and operate on - its networks.
That policy - introduced to limit the risks to public safety posed by QAnon, ""offline anarchist groups"" and US-based militia organisations - resulted in restrictions on more than 1,950 Facebook groups and over 10,000 Instagram accounts.
This is a big move from Facebook, which has laid out how it plans to proactively remove all evolving QAnon content from its platforms.
It comes after I asked Facebook's vice-president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, why the site still allows QAnon to spread political disinformation to US voters and beyond using hashtags like #SaveOurChildren.
Facebook's first crackdown on this dangerous conspiracy theory focused on violent content plugged by those supporting it, removing a number of groups and pages.
But those supporting QAnon soon adapted, using new palatable hashtags to reach parent groups, local forums and the average Instagram feed. And the movement kept growing.
This latest move will be welcomed - but will also be very hard to enforce, especially since QAnon has become so big and spread under new guises.
I recently spoke to US voters about how QAnon disinformation about candidates and child trafficking rings could already have impacted their friends and neighbours ahead of polling day.
They explained how people they know now believe totally unfounded claims they've seen on Instagram and Facebook about the Democrats running a child-trafficking ring or presidential candidate Joe Biden abusing children.
Could this move - like the last - also be too late?
Facebook is not the only social media giant to look at tackling the QAnon conspiracy movement.
In July, Twitter banned thousands of accounts and said it would stop recommending content linked to QAnon in an attempt to help prevent ""offline harm"". It also said it would block URLs associated with the group from being shared on the platform.
In October 2017, an anonymous user put a series of posts on the message board 4chan. The user signed off as ""Q"" and claimed to have a level of US security approval known as ""Q clearance"".
These messages became known as ""Q drops"" or ""breadcrumbs"", often written in cryptic language peppered with slogans, pledges and pro-Trump themes.
The amount of traffic to mainstream social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and YouTube has exploded since 2017, and indications are that numbers have increased during the coronavirus pandemic.
Judging by social media, there are hundreds of thousands of people who believe in at least some of the bizarre theories offered up by QAnon.
QAnon followed on from the ""pizzagate"" saga in 2016 - a fake theory about Democratic Party politicians running a paedophile ring out of a Washington pizza restaurant."
"**Days after banning ads prematurely declaring victory in the presidential election, Facebook has now banned those questioning the US electoral process.**
Ads seeking to ""delegitimise any lawful method or process of voting"" will be banned, amid concerns some may claim postal voting could encourage fraud.
It has also removed Trump-sponsored ads claiming accepting refugees would increase the risk of Covid-19.
They showed opponent Joe Biden talking about the US border and asylum seekers.
And more than 38 versions were seen by hundreds of thousands of people before they were removed.
""We don't allow claims that people's physical safety, health or survival is threatened by people on the basis of their national origin or immigration status,"" Facebook said.
The pandemic is expected to prompt many more people than usual to vote by post in the election.
Facebook's Rob Leathern said: ""As we get closer to election day, we want to provide further clarity on policies we recently announced.
""Last week, we said we'd prohibit ads that make premature declarations of victory.
""We also won't allow ads with content that seeks to delegitimise the outcome of an election.""
Facebook has also banned ads that praise, support or represent militarised social movements and those about QAnon, a wide-ranging unfounded conspiracy theory that suggests President Donald Trump is waging a secret war against Satan-worshipping paedophiles in government, business and the media.
There is increasing evidence QAnon followers are using the issue of child safety, and hashtags such as #savethechildren, to recruit and organise.
And Facebook said it would intervene by directing people to ""credible child safety resources"" when they searched for certain hashtags.
The company is also closely monitoring the banned organisation Proud Boys, following President Trump's reference to it in the first of three televised election debates.
Facebook's head of counter-terrorism and dangerous organisations, Brian Fishman, said where President Trump's ""stand down, stand by"" comment had been used in support of the Proud Boys, ""we've removed it"".
But Facebook's vice-president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, has rejected calls to ban all political ads in the run-up to the vote.
""We block far more political ads than people appreciate,"" he said.
""In the second quarter of this year, we blocked around 750,000 political ads from running on our platform which didn't meet our requirements.
""It's a long and familiar feature of American democracy that ads are run with great intensity,"" he added, describing it as ""the lifeblood of democracy"".
Facebook's restrictions on political ads include a freeze on new ones from 27 October until election day, 3 November, and a ban on those:
Disinformation looking to undermine the democratic process ahead of the US election is an increasing concern - especially with false claims about postal voting promoted frequently by President Trump online.
What happens on social media the day after the US takes to the polls is also a growing worry.
The changes to Facebook's ad policy will be welcomed.
But whether social-media sites are doing enough to tackle the rise of misleading claims and unfounded conspiracy theories in the weeks before polling day is an entirely different question.
On Wednesday, the Trump campaign ran hundreds of adverts promoting an unfounded conspiracy theory accusing Mr Biden of cheating with an earpiece during the presidential debate.
The adverts - which reached millions - remained on Facebook because it does not fact-check political speech, including in ads.
And it's not just about the official campaigns.
Supporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory have been plugging political disinformation for weeks now, with fears this could affect US voters and be exploited by foreign influence campaigns.
I asked Facebook boss Nick Clegg about this on Tuesday.
And now the site is finally taking further action to tackle this evolution of QAnon.
While this is welcome, many will question if this reactive approach is effective - and whether this is again too late.
Political disinformation plugged by QAnon has already reached local Facebook groups, Instagram feeds and WhatsApp chats."
"The global strike on Friday September 20, 2019 was the largest demonstration for climate action in history. The movement that started with Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg in August 2018 has now mobilised millions, while Extinction Rebellion and other protest groups have escalated their campaigns on streets around the world. From the efforts of activists in different countries, radical “Green New Deals” are emerging as a bold, political response to the climate crisis. “The world is waking up,” Thunberg told world leaders at the recent UN Climate Action Summit. “And change is coming whether you like it or not.” But how long that awakening takes could be decisive for warming this century. A report published ahead of the summit declared that the impacts of climate change are accelerating – growth rates of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere were nearly 20% higher in the 2015-19 period than the previous five years, while the average rate of sea level rise has increased to 5mm per year over roughly the same period. One author warned that limiting global temperature rise to 2°C would require tripling current commitments to reduce emissions. To hold temperatures at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, global ambition would need to increase by a factor of five. The debate over whether climate change is happening is over, and the conversation about what should be done is beginning in earnest. As such, for the past few weeks, we’ve asked experts from around the world to describe how the world should respond to the threat of climate breakdown. We share their insights here. Nowhere are the effects of climate change more visible than in the Arctic – a region that’s estimated to be warming at least twice as fast as the global average. Arctic sea ice reached its second-lowest extent on record in September 2019 – a mere 1.6m square miles. A new report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has revealed the changes that are underway in the oceans and the ice-covered regions of the world, and the message is stark.  “Glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking. Global sea level is rising at more than twice the rate of the 20th century. The ocean is warming, becoming more acidic and losing oxygen. Fifty percent of coastal wetlands have been lost over the past 100 years. Species are shifting, biodiversity is declining and ecosystems are losing their integrity and function.” – Cassandra Brooks, University of Colorado Boulder Earth’s oceans have absorbed more than 90% of the excess heat in the global climate system, but not without repercussions. Marine heatwaves are causing coral reefs to bleach and mass die-offs of fish and other wildlife. Not only does this added ocean heat wreak havoc on marine ecosystems, but it is changing the relationship between coastal communities and the ocean. Wildlife populations are struggling to adapt to the disruption, both in the oceans and on land. As a result, a landmark report from an international team of biodiversity experts earlier in 2019 called for “transformative change” to economies and societies to prevent up to a million species going extinct.  “The UK, Norway, Sweden and France have written a target of net-zero emissions into law, [but] targets are, by definition, a statement of nothing more than intent. In and of themselves, they do not remove a single molecule of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.” – Rebecca Willis, Lancaster University Limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C means the world has to be at net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But it’s cumulative emissions that count – if countries leave decarbonisation until the last minute, it will be too late. Rebecca Willis, a professor of climate and energy policy at Lancaster University in the UK, outlines five measures that can begin to restrain emissions right now: Task all government departments with a climate agenda so that they’re obligated to show how their policies will contribute to emissions cuts. Engage the public in developing climate strategies with citizens’ assemblies and involve workers in designing policy to ensure a “just transition” from carbon-intensive industries like coal mining. Enact “symbolic policies” to set the investment climate and catalyse radical change – ban advertising for petrol cars for instance, or allow people to generate and sell renewable energy at home. Keep all remaining fossil fuels in the ground – ban oil and gas exploration and end the US$5.2 trillion spent on subsidising the fossil fuel industry each year. Set aside negative emission technologies – carbon capture and storage might play a role in absorbing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere in future, but they don’t exist at a meaningful scale yet. Relying on them distracts resources from cutting emissions now. There are technologies that already exist which are very good at capturing CO₂. Plants have perfected the process of turning carbon in the air into solid, living material over billions of years. Natural climate solutions mobilise this potential by restoring forests, wetlands and other habitats. One estimate from the UK suggests each hectare of new forest can absorb the annual carbon emissions of 90 cars.  But it’s not as simple as letting nature do all the hard work, says Sebastian Leuzinger, an associate professor at the Auckland University of Technology. The “right tree should be planted at the right time in the right place”: Tree species that grow fast are able to store carbon more rapidly, but slower, bigger trees will ultimately store more in the long run. Non-native trees may be better at absorbing carbon efficiently than native species, so keep an open mind to their role. When choosing a species to plant, trust local foresters and the community that will have to live alongside and nurture them. Natural climate solutions can also help society adapt to the inevitable changes ahead. Zita Sebesvari, head of environmental vulnerability and ecosystem services at United Nations University, argues that the value of rewilding here is two-fold: removing the CO₂ that exacerbates climate change while mitigating its impacts. Coastal wetlands, marshes and mangrove swamps can retain sediments and can grow vertically at rates equal to or greater than the mean rate of sea level rise. These habitats can also accumulate carbon 40 times quicker per hectare than tropical forests. Leaving room for nature seems radical when humans currently exploit more than 70% of the Earth’s ice-free surface, much of it to grow food. It’s estimated that a third of all greenhouse gas emissions originate with agriculture – from deforesting farmland to raising livestock that belch methane. Farming for meat and dairy can use up to 100 times the land area to produce a single gram of protein compared to beans, nuts and other plant sources. Little wonder that people are encouraged to eat less of it, and Alessandro Demaio, a fellow in global health at the University of Copenhagen, recommends a “planetary health diet” which involves reducing meat intake in Western countries by 50%. He also calls for: Recycling organic waste as fertiliser and investing in agroforestry – where trees are grown around crops to increase biodiversity. Breeding drought-resistant crop strains, making animal feed more nutritious and creating additives that can make livestock emit 30% less methane. Reducing food waste and restoring land and ocean habitats.  Sean Beer, a lecturer in agriculture at Bournemouth University, argues that eating more local and seasonal produce could go some way to decarbonising agriculture. Reviving traditional food supply systems may also be key to guaranteeing sustainable diets for all, says Jagannath Adhikari, a sessional lecturer at the University of New South Wales. More than 820m people suffer from hunger, and about two billion people face moderate food insecurity – meaning they do not always know when their next meal will come. After a decade of slow decline, climate change is driving this number up again, particularly in Africa and Asia, where competition over land for both farming and forest conservation is acute. In parts of the Himalayas, the answer to this problem is “food forests”. Local people plant useful trees and grow crops in the woodland near their homes, and protect what grows there naturally. They harvest what they need – mushrooms, honey, roots and edible plants – and sell any surplus at a market. Since community rights were restored to forest management here, worrying trends in deforestation and poverty have been reversed. Some politicians are now supporting policies that address climate change by transforming national economies under the umbrella of a Green New Deal. Spain’s socialist party was recently reelected on a Green New Deal platform, for example, and, in the UK, the Labour Party has voted in favour of one.  The idea was born in the UK in 2007, but has been gaining ground around the world lately, especially in the US where it has been championed by congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Although the specifics vary, a Green New Deal involves large investments in clean energy sector jobs and infrastructure to decarbonise the economy and correct inequalities through job guarantees and universal basic services such as free public transport and healthcare. Governments would also be expected to slash or eliminate the billions they spend on subsidising the cost of fossil fuels.  Experts also urge for the inclusion of the insurance industry in Green New Deal discussions. A recent report from Cambridge University emphasised the large losses insurers will face under climate change and warns that it could spark a global financial crisis.  >“If governments respond appropriately to the urgent warning issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in October [2018], efforts to phase out fossil fuels will have to ramp up considerably — and quickly.” – Kyla Tienhaara, Queen’s University, Canada Already, there has been a slew of lawsuits against the largest fossil fuel companies in an effort to hold them accountable for misleading the public on the risks of climate change while selling products that have contributed to it. Litigation, thus far, has not been successful, but the tide may be turning. In the US, more than a dozen cities, counties and states are seeking damages from energy companies for the the costs of climate change, from retrofitting storm drains to upgrading sea walls. These lawsuits draw on litigation against tobacco companies and on scientific research that attributes greenhouse gas emissions to energy companies. In the past, “the plaintiffs had difficulties tracing climate harms to specific emissions made by particular corporations … Scientific research has evolved dramatically since then.” says Lisa Benjamin, from Lewis & Clark College of Law, in Portland, Oregon. For example, in Europe, a German court has agreed to hear a Peruvian farmer’s case against the German energy giant RWE for its role in melting the glaciers near his hometown of Huaraz and raising the risks of landslides and flooding. A study found RWE was responsible for 0.47% of historic emissions, so the farmer is seeking 0.47% of the cost for his community to adapt to climate change.  As the impacts of climate change become more clear, Thunberg’s not the only one questioning the “fairy tales of eternal economic growth”. Producing stuff consumes energy, and producing more stuff, whether it’s fast fashion or smartphones, means the ongoing and growing consumption of energy.  “This makes it very hard to decarbonise the economy,” says Simon Mair at the University of Surrey. If we stopped chasing productivity growth, decarbonisation would come easier, we’d have less “crap” and we might start investing time and human energy into good jobs that matter, like teaching and nursing.  Despite the potentially massive implications of a 2°C rise in global temperature, climate change has remained low on the news agenda. Journalists and their news organisations have largely failed to give climate change the attention it deserves and have failed to press political figures on climate issues and policies.  Years ago, climate journalists threw away the notion of putting scientific fact and climate denier opinion on equal ground. Other media are finally catching up and providing analysis and verification, and improving the scientific literacy of their audience. They are connecting climate change to local stories, focusing on solutions (instead of “doom and gloom” coverage) and adjusting their language to describe the “climate crisis”. These shifts in journalism may yield more action on climate change. Young people tend to avoid negative news headlines; they don’t want their climate coverage to present a bleak and certain future. Instead, they want stories about the “system change” necessary to create zero-carbon societies, says Julie Doyle, from the University of Brighton. It’s not that they can’t handle the bad news, but that “they wanted to be involved in rethinking socioeconomic systems, and are inspired and empowered by working together.” That’s why “system change not climate change” has became the rallying cry of the young climate strikers. Thunberg’s journey from a lonely vigil outside the Swedish parliament to a Nobel Peace Prize nominee at the head of a global movement took just over a year. It seems the world really is waking up, but now comes the hard part – changing the systems that fuel the climate crisis before it’s too late. This article was amended on November 12 2019 to clarify an error. The earlier story said global emissions of carbon dioxide grew by 20% between 2015 and 2019. Instead, growth rates of carbon dioxide were nearly 20% higher in the 2015-19 period than the previous five years. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

COP25 – Madrid. After rioting and civil unrest in Chile, the intended location of COP-25, Madrid, Spain agreed to take on the challenge of hosting some 20,000 climate change bureaucrats for the 25th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). [#GretaThunberg](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23GretaThunberg) is taking a yacht there, crossing the Atlantic in stormy wintertime. The climate confab takes place December 2-13, 2019. The ‘climateers’ plan to implement the Paris Agreement “rule book” and there’s a push for a global carbon tax law. We take a look at what Canadians are already paying in carbon tax equivalents on federal and provincial fuel taxes – and what the rest of the world pays in carbon taxes. What would a carbon tax law mean for Canada and other democracies. Please read our rebuttal to the UN Climate Panel’s recent IPCC SR15 report.

"The jet-setting habits of Bill Gates and Paris Hilton mean that they produce an astonishing 10,000 times more carbon emissions from flying than the average person. This was the conclusion of my research mining their social media accounts (tweets, Instagram and Facebook posts) as well as those of a number of other celebrities for clues as to where they were in the world over the course of 2017 and how they got there. As such, this estimate is conservative – they may well have taken more flights and not volunteered the information to their millions of followers. This highlights the insane disparity in carbon emissions between the rich and the poor. In 2018, an average human emitted less than five tonnes of CO₂ overall. But this hides vast differences in individual contributions. In the case of air travel – the most energy-intensive human activity, no other human activity consumes as much energy in such a short time – the global average is 115kg CO₂ per person per year. Yet the vast majority of humanity never fly. This average is created by the staggering emissions of the richest proportion of humanity. I calculated that Bill Gates, for example, causes at least 1,600 tonnes of CO₂ to be emitted into the atmosphere – and this is from flying alone. Of course, it’s not only celebrities who are the problem. Recently published figures reveal that 1% of English residents are responsible for nearly one-fifth of all flights abroad. Nearly half (48%) of the population, meanwhile, did not take a single overseas flight in 2018. Calling out the extent of this disparity is key given that humanity has agreed to stabilise global warming at 2°C. To achieve this goal, emissions of greenhouse gases have to be reduced drastically. The Paris Agreement accepts that the burden should be better shared around: countries that emit a lot per citizen should make greater contributions to decarbonisation. Of course, there will also be disparity within each country: some high emitters as well as some who hardly contribute to global warming at all. I wanted to find out just how central the highest emitters might be to this question – just how much of the burden we should expect them to take on. Celebrities, by definition, are influential and often wealthy. While anecdotal evidence suggests that they are also frequent fliers, it has been difficult to determine their contributions to global warming. Very wealthy people are rarely represented in household surveys. To find out, I tracked the jet-set lifestyles of ten celebrities by analysing their ample social media presence.  I analysed Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts for travel information volunteered. To narrow down the research, only air travel was recorded, though of course celebrities also cover (additional) distances by car. Social media posts were evaluated for journey start and end points, the type of aircraft used and the distances travelled. This information was used to calculate likely fuel use and associated emissions. The vast emissions caused by these individuals suggest that a very small share of humanity has a very significant role in global warming. This likely equally true for a much wider range of economic, cultural and political elites.  We have known for a while that the world’s richest 10% produce half of global carbon emissions. But climate policies have so far tended to omit this issue of carbon inequality.  Worldwide, nations have focused on the decarbonisation of production within states, ignoring wild differences in consumption habits. And it’s increasingly looking like the climate crisis can’t be addressed while a small but growing group of super-emitters continue to increase their energy consumption and portray such lifestyles as desirable through their social media channels. Due to their wealth, these elites also exist outside the market-based frameworks implemented to reduce emissions, such as carbon taxes, air passenger duties or carbon allowances for companies. This is also the main issue highlighted by the growing youth movement demanding personal carbon accountability. As Greta Thunberg affirmed early on, “the bigger your carbon footprint, the bigger your moral duty”. And flying, as a very energy-intensive activity, has been identified as particularly harmful and socially undesirable.  This has resulted in a major clash about the social and moral norms surrounding air travel. For decades, frequent fliers have been seen as living desirable lifestyles. To be a global traveller automatically infers a high social standing. Celebrities in particular have fostered this perspective through their communication of glamorous, globetrotting lifestyles. The ten celebrities studied in this research, for example, collectively reach out to 170m followers on Instagram alone. But more and more people are beginning to question what is desirable, justifiable and indeed “normal” to consume. In the case of flying, this has come to be known as “flight shame”. In some circles, air travel is beginning to be framed as a destructive human activity. This is a major shift from the dominating production-oriented approach to climate change mitigation. The new focus on consumption challenges every individual to live within a sustainable personal carbon budget – and argues that this can be the most powerful way of forcing policy and industry change. The implications of the flying habits of global superemitters are therefore far reaching. It is clear that governments need to follow the public and pay more attention to consumption in order to stem the growing class of very affluent people who contribute very significantly to emissions and encourage everyone else to aspire to such damaging lifestyles.

"The first active leak of methane from the sea floor in Antarctica has been revealed by scientists. The researchers also found microbes that normally consume the potent greenhouse gas before it reaches the atmosphere had only arrived in small numbers after five years, allowing the gas to escape.  Vast quantities of methane are thought to be stored under the sea floor around Antarctica. The gas could start to leak as the climate crisis warms the oceans, a prospect the researchers said was “incredibly concerning”. The reason for the emergence of the new seep remains a mystery, but it is probably not global heating, as the Ross Sea where it was found has yet to warm significantly. The research also has significance for climate models, which currently do not account for a delay in the microbial consumption of escaping methane. The active seep was first spotted by chance by divers in 2011, but it took scientists until 2016 to return to the site and study it in detail, before beginning laboratory work. “The delay [in methane consumption] is the most important finding,” said Andrew Thurber, from Oregon State University in the US, who led the research. “It is not good news. It took more than five years for the microbes to begin to show up and even then there was still methane rapidly escaping from the sea floor.” The release of methane from frozen underwater stores or permafrost regions is one of the key tipping points that scientists are concerned about, which occur when a particular impact of global heating becomes unstoppable. “The methane cycle is absolutely something that we as a society need to be concerned about,” said Thurber. “I find it incredibly concerning.” Very little was known about the Antarctic methane cycle but the good news, he said, was that the new seep provided a natural laboratory for further research. Why the new seep formed is unknown. “That is a mystery that we still do not have an answer to,” Thurber said. “It is on the side of an active volcano but it doesn’t seem like it came from that.” Prof Jemma Wadham, at the University of Bristol, UK, who was not involved in the study, said: “Antarctica and its ice sheet are huge black holes in our understanding of Earth’s methane cycle – they are difficult places to work. “We think that there is likely [to be] significant methane beneath the ice sheet,” she said. “The big question is: how large is the lag [in methane-consuming microbes] compared with the speed at which new leaks of methane might potentially form in the wake of retreating ice?” The research, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, reports the discovery of the methane seep at a 10-metre (30ft) deep site known as Cinder Cones in McMurdo Sound. It is a 70-metre long patch of white microbial mats, and a second seep was found during the 2016 expedition. “We stumbled upon the methane seep at a site that has been dived at since the 1960s and it had just turned on,” said Thurber. There were no bubbles of methane, he said. “Most of the methane in many seeps actually comes out in what we call diffuse flows. So it’s just dissolved in the water.” The source of the methane is probably decaying algae deposits buried under sediments and is likely to be thousands of years old. In most parts of the oceans, methane leaking from the sea bed is consumed by microbes in the sediment or the water column above. But the slow growth of microbes at the Cinder Cones site, and its shallow depth, means methane is almost certain to be leaking into the atmosphere. Thurber said the first microbes to grow at the site were of an unexpected strain. “We’re probably in a successional stage, where it may be five to 10 years before a community becomes fully adapted and starts consuming methane.” Widespread active methane seepage was reported off the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia in 2014, a first for the Southern Ocean. “But that’s really a different oceanographic area than the Antarctic continent,” Thurber said. Wadham said the five years for which the Cinder Cones seep has been studied is a short amount of time. “So it would be good to see what happens to this seep into the future. The discovery also makes you wonder if these features are more common than we might think around Antarctica, but are rarely stumbled upon.” However, the researchers are unlikely to be able to return to Antarctica soon. The continent is currently free of coronavirus but the risk of infection has disrupted expedition plans."
"James Dyson’s decision to cancel his electric car project in Singapore can’t have been easy. His engineering company had devoted four years and millions of pounds to the vehicle’s development but has now decided it isn’t commercially viable. Perhaps there isn’t room for another would-be Tesla to challenge the established automotive industry with a novel electric car and leapfrog the challenges of manufacturing. We feel personal sympathy, as one of us (Harry) was involved in the development of a “from scratch” electric taxi, EVA, in Singapore from 2011 to 2014. Like Dyson’s car, the design also got shelved. The lesson was that new players typically lack the capital and manufacturing expertise needed to start a car production line and compete with existing manufacturers. But there’s another important conclusion to be drawn from looking at the potential market for electric vehicles, specifically focusing on Southeast Asia. It goes to the heart of why successfully developing high-end cars isn’t going to be enough to electrify personal transport when the market gives so many reasons for the incumbent fossil fuel-based system to resist. The vehicle market in Singapore has a big share of rather expensive cars, but its absolute volume is dwarfed by that of almost all larger neighbouring cities. Not only do cities like Jakarta, Manila and Bangkok have many more cars registered than Singapore. They also suffer more serious air pollution from their vehicle fleet. But that wouldn’t improve much even if all cars were electrified.  For example, in Bangkok, only 40% of roadside primary organic aerosol (POA) pollution stems from cars. The other 60% comes from two-stroke engine scooters, even though they use only around 10% of fuel sold. Each two-stroke engine in a scooter or three-wheeled tuk-tuk is as harmful as 30 to 50 modern petrol cars. This is because two-stroke engines mix lubrication oil into the fuel. It is the price paid for their simple construction and affordability.  This means that electrifying scooters and tuk-tuks would produce much higher improvements in air quality per vehicle than doing the same for comparatively clean cars. And given that these vehicles can easily run on today’s batteries, it should technically be an easy job to convert the fleet. China has achieved quite a lot in this sphere. But other countries in Southeast Asia, where scooters have been around for generations and are part of the economy and culture, may require a systemic market change. Owners of scooters, motorbikes and tuk-tuks rely on an important support network of businesses to provide fuel, maintenance and spare parts. Without such a support network in place, no shiny new vehicle can conquer a relevant market share. And if those who benefit from the current petrol-based transport system are left out, they have no incentives to support electrifying transport.  Anecdotally, a similar problem has already been seen in the power generation sector. Much effort has recently been made in communities not connected to a power grid to replace diesel generators with solar panels and batteries. What sounds like a technical no-brainer can be hindered by unexpected circumstances: this technology does not come with many jobs for the local community after installation. The people who currently sell diesel, maintain the generators and sell the electricity would need another source of income. It seems likely those people understandably do little to support such a transition.  A systemic market change that could drive electrification must learn from local entrepreneurs. It would have to address the challenge of higher capital costs for buying batteries and electric motors compared to two-stroke engines. And it would have to replace declining income from selling fuel and lubricant oil with other services such as battery charging or swapping. In China, the transition towards electric two-wheelers was achieved by regulation in combination with local mass-manufacturing. There are lessons here for manufacturers as well. Vehicles in the scooter class don’t need the latest generation of expensive lithium ion batteries. How much energy they can store is less important than the ability to easily exchange or even repair the batteries. Where possible, vehicle spare parts such as wheels or brakes should be identical to what is available in the respective local markets.  Some promising products such as an electric tuk-tuk already exist. In Indonesia, locally designed and built e-scooters have started entering the market. Indonesia’s government has taken important regulatory measures, cutting fuel subsidies while creating incentives for domestic production of electric vehicles. In the Philippines, the large-scale roll-out of “e-trikes” saw some delays, but it taught important lessons: don’t start too big, and make sure that an ecosystem is in place to support the new vehicle beyond the point of sale.  The challenge of electrifying the transport sector requires these kind of economic and sociological insights as much as technical ones. It needs industry to work with governments and banks in a concerted effort to replace billions of noisy and dirty engines. Local product design in combination with local manufacturing means a paradigm shift: the transformation of sheer markets for predominantly Japanese motorcycles into players in clean transport technology."
"BEIJING  —   Zhang Heng barged through an   door, surprising a doctor and a patient. He didn’t have time to knock. In Mr. Zhang’s business, every second counts. “You have to hand it directly to the person,” said Mr. Zhang, one of the legions of package couriers in Beijing who help power China’s online shopping boom. He spoke as he blitzed through a surgical wing, medical storeroom and patient ward delivering parcels small and large, soft and square, to doctors and nurses in an effort to ensure the right person gets the right package. “Otherwise,” Mr. Zhang said, “you may get fined. ” The Chinese   industry has been built on the backs of couriers  —   called kuaidi, or express delivery, in China  —   like Mr. Zhang. They number 1. 2 million, by one survey, and online retailers like Alibaba use them to zip packages to customers by scooter or   electric cart. Across China, the world’s largest market for package delivery, a courier shouting “kuaidi!” through a door or a phone signals your package has arrived. But for the couriers  —   who are largely unskilled workers from China’s interior  —   the work can be   and difficult. It is coming under scrutiny from labor activists and legal experts who say many couriers face punishing hours and harsh working conditions. Nearly   of them work more than 12 hours a day, seven days a week, according to the survey, which covered 40, 000 couriers and was conducted by Beijing Jiaotong University and Alibaba’s research and logistics arms. A majority work more than eight hours a day each day of the week. Labor standards in the industry vary widely, but many couriers work under arrangements that might, for example, provide no overtime pay or no employer contributions to their government health care and pension benefits. Just as in the United States, where Uber drivers and many others work as contractors, those arrangements raise questions about what defines work and employment. Couriers, meanwhile, complain about fines. Some delivery companies penalize them if they do not deliver all the morning’s packages by 2 p. m. Poor penmanship, damage to a package or customer complaints can also result in fines, which can add up to a week’s pay. “I’m here to make money,” said Mr. Zhang, a    former coal miner from Shanxi Province who is saving money to build a home, widely seen in the countryside as indispensable in attracting a wife. “If I’m not diligent now, I’m going to regret it. I’m almost 30 and still single. ” China hopes to move away from manufacturing and seeks to build a more   economy driven by accountants, lawyers and other professionals. Yet for migrant workers at the bottom of the pay scale, service work can mean conditions not unlike those in China’s factories, where lax enforcement has long led to excessive overtime and unsafe conditions. Some couriers work directly for companies such as JD. com, an   retailer, or SF Express, a delivery service. Others drive for a group of delivery companies that dominate the business of ferrying packages on behalf of online retailers like Alibaba. One of those companies, ZTO Express, last year raised $1. 4 billion in a share offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Those companies run nationwide distribution networks but rely on smaller companies for   delivery  —   and there the relationships can become murky. Those smaller companies, which are franchisees of the big delivery companies, sign up drivers as employees or contractors. Some of those drivers subcontract their work to other drivers. Those arrangements often result in couriers who drive under the name of a big delivery company but whose hours and terms are only loosely managed, experts say. For example, many drivers lack workers’ compensation benefits or insurance in case of accidents, said Jin Yingjie, a professor specializing in labor law at the China University of Political Science and Law. Delivery companies “should work to bring the industry into the confines of the labor law,” she said. Meanwhile, tough conditions have led to unrest among couriers, said Keegan Elmer, a researcher for China Labor Bulletin, a workers’ rights group based in Hong Kong. His group has seen disputes in a number of Chinese cities, he said, along with a rise in strikes as economic growth slows. “The delivery companies are pushing drivers to the point of taking collective action,” Mr. Elmer said. In December, a weeklong strike brought deliveries by one package company partly owned by Alibaba, YTO Express, to a halt in Baoji, a city in Shaanxi Province. “Where’s our October pay?” one of the deliverymen told a local TV station. “There needs to be someone in charge handling this. There’s nobody. ” A spokeswoman for YTO Express said the strike was caused by a franchisee who did not promptly calculate fees or properly communicate with couriers. “Alibaba is a leader in big data technology,” an Alibaba spokesman said in a statement. “Taking advantage of that strength, we are committed to helping the logistics industry improve its efficiency and the working conditions for couriers and other industry participants. ” Most couriers make about $300 to $600 a month, according to the Jiaotong study  —   an amount roughly equal to the wages of China’s migrant factory workers. They can deliver 150 packages on a weekday, drivers said, sometimes helped by making mass deliveries to office buildings. Couriers generally make about 15 cents per package delivered, according to drivers and reports in the state news media, though they can make more by picking up outgoing packages from customers or through other tasks. The work initially appealed to many as package volume boomed. But their pay per package has barely budged in recent years as competition intensified and more drivers entered the market. About 40 percent of couriers quit within a year, according to the Jiaotong study. “Most deliverymen are like me,” said Lu Yong, who quit in December. “They work for three months and realize it’s no good. ” Mr. Lu, 29, of Henan Province, spent years assembling electronics in the southern province of Guangdong before going to work for a ZTO Express franchisee in Beijing. “The factories lack the same freedom as delivery, but it’s not cold like here,” he said. “And every month you get four days of rest, too. ” Mr. Lu’s November pay slip showed that he was paid $382 on 4, 291 packages delivered, after fines and other expenses including his uniform. He says he pays for maintenance on his cart, which bears ZTO’s logo, including new tires, replacement batteries and new brakes. He also said he never signed a labor contract. James Guo, the chief financial officer of ZTO Express, said that it required its franchisees to comply with local laws but that “it’s not up to us to manage or control the compensation of our deliverymen. ” Some thrive. Li Pengbo, 21, from Henan Province, drives for Best Express, another large delivery company in which Alibaba owns a stake. He dominates the area he subcontracted from a Best Express franchisee, he said, and earns about $2, 000 a month. “Since the sixth day of the last Chinese New Year until now I haven’t rested, not a single day,” Mr. Li said, describing an   stretch. “I work from 6:30 in the morning until 11 or 12 p. m. at night. ” “My family is poor. This bitterness is nothing compared to what they’ve gone through,” he said. A spokeswoman for Best Express said its franchisees were required to follow labor laws. Franchisees say they have borne the brunt of declining delivery prices. “If we can turn a profit eight months of the year, that’s not bad,” said Wang Lin, a franchisee in Beijing for another delivery company, STO Express. Ms. Wang said her franchise does not pay for driver benefits because the drivers are contractors, not employees. “Frankly it’s not a very good job,” she said. “It’s extremely tiring, the salary is not high, and the responsibility and risks are great. We don’t have a stable work force. ”"

 _Once the bastion of radical free speech and civil libertarianism, left‐​leaning student activism has taken a decidedly illiberal turn in recent years. What caused this shift? That’s what Robby Soave, associate editor at_ Reason _magazine, set out to investigate in his new book_ Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump _. Cato hosted a book forum with Soave in June to discuss his findings. The forum also featured commentary from Jane Coaston, senior politics reporter for_ Vox.



 **ROBBY SOAVE:** The subject of my book, _Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump_ , is the culture of activism at the moment — particularly on college campuses where a number of progressive activists, especially at elite educational institutions, have been engaged in attempts to shut down visiting speakers who they disagree with. This kind of activity also reaches professors who are very much to the left, but further‐​left students object to something they said in a classroom and call for investigations, or sometimes its targeted at other student groups whose activities they don’t agree with. This is a problem that I think is more pervasive at places like Harvard and Yale and liberal arts institutions. That’s where the culture is dominated by a relatively small number of students on the radical fringe who believe that ideas they disagree with must be banished from being heard on campus. They believe ideas that they disagree with represent a threat to their emotional well‐​being, and their health, and thus these ideas should not be heard on college campuses.



This is a problem that national media started paying more attention to beginning in late 2015, when there was a very notable event at Yale. It involved a dean of one of their residential colleges, Nicholas Christakis, and his wife, Erika, who was also a professor. Erika Christakis had written an email to the students rejecting previous guidance the administration had given to students warning them not to wear offensive Halloween costumes. She had said, in essence, “You’re probably all adults, you can maybe decide for yourself what’s appropriate to wear for Halloween.” And a number of students rejected this attempt to not be paternalistic and surrounded Nicholas Christakis in the public square and berated him for a long time. They asserted that it was his role on campus to provide a safe space for them from discomfort, from emotional harm, and that he failed in his obligation to do that. This doesn’t just happen to far‐​right people but even to leftist professors. Bret Weinstein and Laura Kipnis are two notable examples of liberal academics whose students have rejected something they thought or did. And in Kipnis’s case launched harassment complaints; they had her investigated under Title IX, the law that bans gender discrimination in education.



This kind of thing continues today. Just in the news in the last few weeks, there was an incident with a law professor at Harvard University, Ron Sullivan, who is well known for his expertise on criminal justice reform. He was, at one point, an adviser to then senator Obama. He has represented and helped to free many wrongfully incarcerated people. He has represented, as you do as a defense attorney, all sorts of controversial clients — accused murderers, accused terrorists, even. But then he was going to represent Harvey Weinstein, who has been credibly accused of sexual harassment and assault. So the activist students — about 50 of them — had protests, and they said that Sullivan’s representing Weinstein has made the campus unsafe for women and that this should be impermissible. Harvard investigated Sullivan and decided to fire him, not as law professor, but as faculty dean to one of the residential colleges. And he just had a great op‐​ed in the _New York Times_. “Why Harvard Was Wrong to Make Me Step Down,” _New York Times_ , June 24, 2019. He said he is very concerned about the emotions of students at many elite institutions being taken so seriously that they are now dictating policies and overriding values that the left used to believe very strongly in: free expression and due process.



These are areas where libertarians and progressives have historically been in close proximity. I have tremendous respect for the work, for instance, that the ACLU has done over the years to defend the rights of despicable people, to defend their free speech and due process rights. But even the ACLU now is sort of out of step with where activist culture is going. At William and Mary, just two years ago, the executive director of the Virginia ACLU was invited to speak on the First Amendment. A group of activist students associated with the local Black Lives Matter group shut her speech down; they talked over her to prevent it from happening. Eventually the organizer of the event simply gave the microphone to the leader of the student activists to let them have their event instead. They shouted that the ACLU is a white supremacist organization, that liberalism itself is white supremacy, I guess for believing that even bad people like white supremacists should have rights.



This is all so different from where the left was decades ago. Berkeley was, after all, the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement. In research for my book, I learned that in 1963, a far‐​left student group invited a Nazi to Berkeley to make a free‐​speech point, and they dressed in full Nazi regalia to promote the event. And then this guy spoke, and no one heckled him; no one shut him down; they just laughed at him. Again, this was something the progressive students did to demonstrate they were for iron‐​clad freedom of speech. Can you imagine if this happened today? Campuses would be shut down; there would be national days of mourning; there would be talk about how the mental health of everyone on campus was negatively impacted by this to the point where nobody could go to classes and nobody could take their exams.



I spoke to some of these activists for the book, specifically at the University of Michigan, at an event where Charles Murray was supposed to speak, and they were planning to prevent him from speaking. I asked them, “Don’t you think this makes Charles Murray look more sympathetic? And you look very sensitive or very foolish for not letting him be allowed to speak?” But what they told me then — and what activists told me over and over again in the research for my book — was that if you let someone speak who makes people feel uneasy, whom people disagree with on campus, who makes people on campus feel uncomfortable, then you have essentially allowed violence to take place. So they are committed to not having these uncomfortable conversations with people, to not allowing non‐​leftists to speak on campus because the result of that will be a kind of mental trauma for people. In their view, that trauma exists on sort of the same spectrum as physical violence, which obviously the campus is obligated to prevent. Thus these tactics are not only justified but necessary to protect people’s lives and their health. I think that’s a new trend in activist culture that poses a complication for those of us that believe campuses should remain places where difficult conversations can, and must, take place. Places where a range of ideological viewpoints should be aired and discussed. Places where professors should have wide latitude to tackle difficult subjects in their classroom without fear of a student complaining to the administrators and being investigated for saying something that the students disagree with.



There is a climate, I think, of seeking out self‐​victimhood on campuses because there is authority that stems from being the most marginalized or the most victimized person. The philosophy that enhances that way of thinking is something called intersectionality, which is of incredible importance to activists on the left nowadays. The term comes from a sociologist, who coined it in the late 1980s, to describe how different sorts of oppression work against you. If you are a woman you might suffer from sexism; if you’re a person of color, from racism; but if you are a woman of color, you have sexism and racism intertwined against you. There is nothing wrong with that theory; it makes perfect sense. But many of these activists on campus have then added all sorts of other categories. We have gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, abilities, disabilities status, age, size, etc., etc. Many of these things are, indeed, sources of oppression for these people, but if you are asking everyone to be sort of worked up about all of them at the same time, and you are also saying that we want to only work — from an activists perspective — with others that fully agree on all of these categories, then you have narrowed down the range of people who are in good standing with you to a very small, tiny fringe. Indeed, many of the activists I spoke to for this book said that the



Women’s March — you know, where hundreds of thousands of people marched on DC to object to Trumps truly appalling history of statements about and treatment of women — the majority of the activists I spoke with hated that. They hated that whole march; it was all bad. Why? Because it was not run and organized by a coalition of the most oppressed. The people running it only checked off one or two boxes. They were not transwomen of color; they were just women running the event.



That is my criticism of this version of activist intersectionality theory. Again, not that this theory is wrong in its core premise but that this version of it can be self‐​defeating and amount to a kind of cannibalism for the left. That aspect of it, in addition to no longer upholding free speech and due process, is a recipe for disaster. Part of my concern is that while these values have played out primarily on college campuses, they are also permeating social media and maybe mainstream media companies as well. And moving forward, if these are the values of not just elite campuses — where you can say OK, that’s not real life anyway, that doesn’t matter — but now it’s moving to real life. Firms and organizations are going to have to reorient their policies around the demands of a small, tiny subset of politically engaged young people. You are going to have a very hard time having people who disagree or having uncomfortable discussions in the workplace, in broader society, because this is explicitly what these activists want.



 **JANE COASTON:** I write predominantly about conservatism, the right, and the GOP, and something that I think is particularly interesting about this beat, and I think part of the reason I am on this



panel, is because we can have a riotous discussion across ideological barriers. I’ve been working on some pieces about how many of the biggest sources of repression of speech taking place on college campuses are not inherently coming from college students. They are coming from outside entities. They are coming from someone like, say, then Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach who just a couple years ago was so offended at a piece of art featuring an American flag with a tiny sock on it that he demanded the flag be ceremonially destroyed. That was somebody on the right insisting something that offended him had to be removed.



I thought that was a particularly telling incident, because Kobach and a whole host of other Republicans have really championed the idea they are stalwarts of free speech and expression and the alternative is oppressive leftist orthodoxy. It turns out that everyone has a form of speech that they, themselves, find deeply offensive. Everyone.



Right now, my biggest obsession is this conversation over social media companies and whether or not they’re too big and what they allow and what they don’t allow. Sen. Josh Hawley R-MO is proposing to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act so that social media companies would need to submit to the FTC — the unelected commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission — verification that the moderation policies that those companies use are “neutral.” Based on what? No one knows. But it’s another case in point that the push to regulate speech is by no means an exclusive feature of the campus left. You see it everywhere on these issues, including from mainstream Republican politicians.



I think that it is really important to be clear here: though we are talking about college students, we are not talking about _all_ college students. There are millions of people in college and most of them aren’t at Middlebury or Yale or Berkeley. They are attending community colleges. They are attending smaller institutions, bigger institutions. This kind of campus activism is by no means a majority activity among students today.



I think the problem with the rise of a more oppressive attitude toward speech really gets to the growth of the administrative state on college campuses, like the idea that you would hire someone just to be your expert on diversity. Which, you know, I’m kind of surprised that no one has asked me — a noted expert in being diverse! But if you create all these new administrative positions, they’re going to have to find something to do. A lot of that time they end up policing speech in ways that are deeply illiberal.



I think that how we talk about these issues is important too. Just as Robby said, it’s not all students; it’s not even most students. When I was a student at the University of Michigan, I was also working in a dining hall washing dishes for four years. I remember my own experiences of witnessing campus activism, which like so many others I was too busy to join. At the time there was a group on campus, BAMN By Any Means Necessary, which you reference in the book. This group was very upset about efforts to end affirmative action and so had a lot of big, showy protests to that effect. But I also saw it coming from the conservative groups like Young Americans for Freedom. While I was on campus, YAF hosted “catch an illegal immigrant day” and would do things like host “affirmative action bake sales.” It seemed as if they were — do you remember the old



Spy vs. Spy cartoons? Occasionally you had moments where it felt like that — the reciprocal absurdity of it, where it felt like both sides were more copying than really opposing each other. The culture of campus activism has changed, both on what we think of as the left but also on what we think of as the right.



It’s not necessarily that campus activists on the right and the left are doing activism wrong; they are doing activism in the way that colleges have created the atmosphere to do it. It’s difficult when you are on a college campus and you are aware that outside of your college campus you have virtually no power to change minds about anything. Particularly for those on the left, who see Republicans in control of the White House and, currently the Senate, and in many states also the state government. It feels like there’s a disconnect between real‐​world politics and what these fired‐​up young radicals want. At the same time, conservatives feel powerless in the face of overwhelmingly liberal faculties and student culture on campus. So all that frustrated energy gets channeled into the kind of highly performative activism we see today.



When you have no space to make actual change, you do get into this kind of activity. I think some people have called it virtue signaling, but it’s really a kind of activism signaling. Its talking about white people in a certain deliberately outlandish way, for example. Or on the right, stuff like Charlie Kirks Turning Point USA creating a Professor Watch List, where you can report professors for being mean or “leftist.” It is this idea, when you get down to it and what I hear when I talk to kids on college campuses, that this is the only way anyone is going to listen to us. The squeaky wheel gets the grease, so to speak. It’s the person who is saying things like, “we should kick all white people off of this college campus” who gets listened to by national media.



And I have some critical thoughts on how national media covers college issues, because generally it is sending a bunch of reporters over here to talk to the loudest person, while ignoring the person whose story is “I’m working two jobs to pay off my college loan debt, so I can’t really get involved in campus activism.” That person is not getting heard from, even though there are far more of that type of person than there are of the yelling, screaming, acting‐​out type.



I want us to be fair to those students, and I want us to be really fair with the genuine issues they are dealing with. And I think I’d like to close with the biggest point of disagreement I have with the book — sorry Robby! There is an argument toward the end that liberal activism, or “left‐​leaning activism,” could push people toward the open arms of the alt‐​right. And I think that’s an argument that has been made historically, too, when it comes to the rise of fascism in the 1930s.



Robby spoke to Richard Spencer, the noted white supremacist, who spends a lot of time on college campuses for someone who was born in 1978. Normally people try to look down on that kind of thing, but he’s following in a tradition. The founder of the American Nazi Party, George Lincoln Rockwell, went on a college tour in the early 1960s, and you can go look up his speeches at Michigan State University. And his entire point was saying, every effort to protest him was pushing people toward him. Any effort to stop this expression of free speech is just pushing people toward the Nazis. That all he



was asking for was the sharing of ideas in a civil discourse. But then, in an interview with Alex Haley, author of Roots, in Playboy Magazine, George Lincoln Rockwell was a little bit clearer. He said repeatedly, in essence, “I hate n——. I hate them. I hate n—— and the Jews. The Jews are controlling the n— —.” That’s what George Lincoln Rockwell’s message really was.



I think that it is extremely clear that people do not wind up in the alt‐​right because of the illiberalism of the left. That is taking away the personal responsibility of people who choose to become angry bigots. I think we should remember that people do not join political entities because they were pushed to do so. The people who send so many Jewish journalists gas chamber images did not do so because a professor at the University of Missouri was an illiberal leftist. They did so because they decided to do so. They did so because they decided to engage in an illiberalism themselves.



There are a host of people who have received cruelty and illiberalism on social media and college campuses from the left, and they did not decide, “you know who looks good right now? That Nazi Richard Spencer and his stupid suits.” I think we should give college students more credit than that.

"**Facebook has updated its rules to tackle posts containing depictions of ""blackface"" and common anti-Semitic stereotypes.**
Its Community Standards now explicitly state such content should be removed if used to target or mock people.
The company said it had consulted more than 60 outside experts before making the move.
But one campaigner said she still had concerns about its wider anti-racism efforts.
""Blackface is an issue that's been around for decade, which is why it's surprising that it's only being dealt with now,"" said Zubaida Haque, interim director of the Runnymede Trust race-equality think tank.
""It's deeply damaging to black people's lives in terms of the hatred that's targeted towards them and the spread of myths, lies and racial stereotypes.
""We welcome Facebook's decision.
""But I'm not entirely convinced these steps are part of a robust strategy to proactively deal with this hatred as opposed to it being a crisis-led sort of thing.""
Facebook's rules have long included a ban on hate speech related to race, ethnicity and religious affiliation, among other characteristics.
But they have now been revised to specify:
The rules also apply to Instagram.
""This type of content has always gone against the spirit of our hate-speech policies,"" said Monika Bickert, Facebook's content policy chief.
""But it can be really difficult to take concepts... and define them in a way that allows our content reviewers based around the world to consistently and fairly identify violations.""
Facebook said the ban would apply to photos of people portraying Black Pete - a helper to St Nicholas, who traditionally appears in blackface at winter festival events in the Netherlands.
And it might also remove some photos of English morris folk dancers who have painted their faces black.
However, Ms Bickert suggested other examples - including critical posts drawing attention to the fact a politician once wore blackface - might still be allowed once the policy comes into effect.
The announcement coincided with Facebook's latest figures on dealing with problematic posts.
The tech firm said it had deleted 22.5 million items of hate speech in the months of April to June, compared with 9.6 million the previous quarter.
It said the rise was ""largely driven"" by improvements to its auto-detection technologies across several languages including Spanish, Arabic, Indonesian and Burmese. This implied that much content had been missed in the past.
Facebook acknowledged that it was still unable to give a measurement of the ""prevalence of hate speech"" on its platform - in other words whether the problem is in fact worsening.
It already gives such a metric for other topics, including violent and graphic content.
But a spokesman said the company was hoping to start providing a figure later in the year. He also said the social network intended to start using a third-party auditor to check its numbers some time in 2021.
One campaign group said it suspected hate speech was indeed a growing problem.
""We have been warning for some time that a major pandemic event has the potential to inflame xenophobia and racism,"" said the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH)'s chief executive Imran Ahmed.
Facebook's report also revealed that staffing issues caused by the pandemic had meant it took action on fewer suicide and self-harm posts - on both Instagram and Facebook.
And on Instagram, the same problem meant it took action on fewer posts in the category it calls ""child nudity and sexual exploitation"". Actions fell by more than half, from one million posts to 479,400.
""Facebook's inability to act against harmful content on their platforms is inexcusable, especially when they were repeatedly warned how lockdown conditions were creating a perfect storm for online child abuse at the start of this pandemic,"" said Martha Kirby from the NSPCC.
""The crisis has exposed how tech firms are unwilling to prioritise the safety of children and instead respond to harm after it's happened rather than design basic safety features into their sites to prevent it in the first place,"" she said.
However, on Facebook itself, the number of removals of such posts increased."

 **[Sustainable NZ](https://sustainablenz.org.nz/about/)**



 **Sustainability** is based on the principle that everything we need for our survival and well-being depends on our natural environment. It means meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Our focus on sustainability means that we would be able to work with political parties on the **left or right** of politics to ensure that the environment is always a top political priority regardless of who makes up the government.



Our primary focus is on environmental matters such as clean water, sustainable oceans, protection of our native species, **dealing with climate change** ; but these all have economic, social and cultural dimensions. A society with dramatic inequality is not sustainable. We need to move our economy away from polluting and environmentally destructive ways of doing things; by embracing technological and scientific innovation we can become wealthier, creating higher-paying jobs for New Zealanders, all while treading more lightly on the earth.



The Mixed-Member Proportional ([MMP](https://mc.us20.list-manage.com/pages/track/click?u=69fdf50c238b308abb3c2181c&id=94aeecae06)) system means that minor parties can have a major influence on a government as part of a coalition. The coalition arrangements of the current government allocated billions of dollars to political trophies and slush funds – the price of NZ First support for a Labour-led Government. We have also seen the scrapping of important environmental initiatives like the mandatory installation of cameras on fishing boats because the fishing industry are key NZ First donors and supporters. MMP should deliver better outcomes than this.  
  
We believe that the MMP system should be a vehicle to place sustainability at the centre of every government. The coalition negotiations after each election are the best possible opportunity to ensure the sustainability of our environment and the sustainable development of a modern economy.  
  
These changes will only be made with the emergence of a new political force that **will use the levers of the MMP system to much better ends.**



The Green Party has made a deliberate decision not to use the leverage that comes with the number of MPs they have in Parliament. Instead of negotiating with both major parties, they have made a decision to always support the formation of a Labour Government, meaning that Labour can take them for granted. **This is no way to get the best deal for the environment.  
**  
Having given away their negotiating advantage, they are in a weak position to demand funding for cleaner beaches and rivers, for modern sewage infrastructure in major cities, for sustainable management of our fisheries, a major upgrade in predator control, nor for the significant increases in science and research funding that will underwrite a modern, sustainable economy.  
  
 **The Greens also have a historic tendency to be suspicious of scientific innovation** – particularly in biotechnology – and **hostile to business.** New Zealand deserves a political party that will work together with the innovators in business and science who will lead the way through the complex and interconnected sustainability challenges of the coming century.



We are building a new political party based upon the principles of sustainability – one prepared to deal with either the National Party or the Labour Party in coalition negotiations – to leverage policies that will underpin a more Sustainable New Zealand. 



**Policy Outline**



This outline is intended to provide a broad outline of the party’s position on significant issues to guide our policy development process and help supporters to decide if this is a party they want to join.



More detailed policy is currently being developed and will be released in the coming months.



Our vision is a clean, green New Zealand.  
Our mission is to promote sustainable, prosperous communities.



The challenges we face are urgent and the environment can’t wait. We will make a real difference by 2021, one that can be sustained.

"Life has changed almost beyond recognition in the last few decades. Artificial intelligence (AI) has substituted entire job fields – intelligent software can now review legal documents, a job which was previously only carried out by lawyers. Machine learning means technical systems can pull together entire libraries of information in a single handheld device. Virtual spaces now exist where people from all over the world can share, connect and chat instantly.  In 2019, it’s clear that digital innovations will continue to change society and the economy, but it’s uncertain whether these new technologies will benefit the global transformation to sustainability. Will digital technologies allow everyone to live in a world where their development isn’t dependent on exhausting finite resources and increasing emissions? There is certainly reason to be optimistic. Digital technologies can make energy and resource use more efficient. By analysing the optimal amount of water each crop needs and by using a smart irrigation system accordingly, farming can become infinitely more efficient. Digital systems can assess the optimal use of vehicles too. Instead of one person owning one car which is only used for an hour each day and then sits parked for the rest of the day, several people can share one electric car, reducing the number of vehicles needed overall.  For the first time, digital technologies can comprehensively trace, document, and analyse each resource and product as it flows across global supply chains. This could create circular economies, in which resources such as water and rare Earth metals arrive where they’re needed and waste such as plastic rubbish doesn’t escape to pollute the environment. Digital monitoring can help scientists to better understand how ecosystems around the world – such as forests, reefs and glaciers – are changing in real time. This can help conservationists understand how to protect and restore the environment, while ensuring that governments and private companies are held accountable for their public commitments to preserve natural habitats. The Global Forest Watch already does this – it’s an open-source web system that uses satellite data to monitor forests and their destruction.    But so far, this potential hasn’t been harnessed to make the global economy greener. Instead, there’s been an explosion in high energy computing centres, which are needed to sustain the expanding internet, its social media platforms and big data analysis. By 2022, global data flows will have more than tripled since 2017. As long as fossil fuels dominate the global energy mix, expanding these computing centres will accelerate climate change. Solutions to global problems like climate change and the instability of financial markets need the cooperation of all countries. But a knowledge divide between the global north – which could secure access to sophisticated digital infrastructure with its wealth – and the global south would hold worldwide solutions back. The digital revolution is transforming societies just as the printing press and the steam engine triggered new eras of human civilisation. But without using these digital disruptions to make the global economy more sustainable, the powerful tools of the digital revolution will just multiply existing problems.  AI systems can substitute a major part of a well qualified work force, but without policies in place to support workers to retrain or enjoy the benefits of working less, unemployment and poverty could skyrocket. Meanwhile, authoritarian regimes already use digital monitoring to control their citizens and influence their behaviour. World leaders need to ensure public administrations are up to speed to effectively and ethically govern these digital disruptions. Most governments around the world currently lack expertise on AI, machine learning, and virtual reality – many bureaucracies are still paper-based. Governments are struggling to adapt to the new realities, which pose important questions about data privacy laws and the need and desire to increasingly benefit from digital systems.

 Governments need to ramp up investments in digital infrastructure, channelling it towards making everything about the modern world sustainable. They need to ensure that everyone can profit from the new opportunities of the digital age and that no one is left behind. This includes investing in broadband networks and expanding education for the next generation of digital engineers.  Combining AI, big data analysis, genome research and developments in cognitive sciences opens the door to a completely new world. In many ways, the pace of the digital revolution can redefine what it means to be human, enhancing our physical, psychological, and cognitive capabilities. The digital era is the new reality whether people like it or not. The world stands at a crossroads – it’s in all humankind’s interest to take the pathway towards sustainability. Digital technology can take us there – better and faster than ever before – if we steer it in the right direction.  Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"**Instagram has passed thousands of pages of ""pretty dreadful"" material from the account of Molly Russell to her family's legal team, a court heard.**
The 14-year-old killed herself in 2017 after viewing graphic images of self harm and suicide on the platform.
A pre-inquest hearing on Friday was told not all the material had been studied yet as it was too difficult for lawyers and police to look at for long.
A date for the inquest itself is yet to be set.
The inquest will look at how algorithms used by social media giants to keep users on the platform may have contributed to her death.
Oliver Sanders QC told Barnet's Coroner's Court how Instagram's parent company Facebook had recently released a ""significant volume"" of material relating to the case.
He said: ""We haven't been able to review it all yet. Some of it is pretty dreadful and it is not something that can be reviewed in a long sitting and certainly not late at night.""
He added certain parts of the material had been redacted and lawyers and police were trying to find out why.
The court also heard the investigation was seeking the cooperation of Snapchat, WhatsApp, Pinterest, Facebook and Twitter, although until recently only Pinterest had co-operated fully.
But Snapchat could not disclose data without an order from a US court, WhatsApp had deleted Molly's account and Twitter was reluctant to handover material due to European data protection laws, the hearing was told.
Coroner Andrew Walker said ""some or all"" of those social media companies could be named as interested parties in the inquest as they would be ""best placed"" to give technical information for the case.
He also asked for a psychologist with expertise in the potential psychological impacts of viewing extreme material to be appointed to give evidence.
A further pre-inquest review is due to take place on 26 November.

"The power of climate science denial in the UK, thankfully, has been in retreat over the past decade. Nigel Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) may still boast a prime Westminster address, but its influence has waned. In fact, its decline aptly mirrors the fortunes of the coal industry, including US titans such as Peabody Energy, which saw its share price plunge 99% between 2008 and 2016 before filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy. With countries rightly phasing coal out of their energy mix, the GWPF has turned its sights on Africa to peddle its misinformation about the merits of burning fossil fuels. It has published a new report, derisively titled Heart of Darkness: Why Electricity for Africa is a Security Issue, and launched a glossy website for “energy justice”, which uses the language of climate justice campaigners to try to undermine renewable energy.  As an African from a pastoralist community in northern Kenya, I have seen the suffering that coal-fuelled climate breakdown has wrought on my people. The anti-climate policies that the GWPF has pushed for years have contributed to the droughts, storms and surging temperatures that have killed people and destroyed livelihoods. Yet now they pretend to be Africa’s saviours, seeking out new markets for the ever more desperate coal industry. And coal barons are not alone: European-produced petrol, so dirty and polluting that it can’t be sold there, is being dumped on to the Nigerian market. The GWPF report was written by Geoff Hill, a Zimbabwean journalist who spent much of his early career working for Rupert Murdoch’s the Australian, a newspaper known to spread misinformation about the climate crisis. Hill does not seem to have an academic background in climate science or energy policy. The report cites three academics who appear to have a vested interest in the solutions proposed: Dr Rosemary Falcon, Dr Samson Bada and Dr Jacob Masiala are all connected to the Clean Coal Technology Research group at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. African prosperity will not come by it being shackled to the outdated dirty energy infrastructure of the past. Rather than trudging behind in the 50-year-old footsteps of European countries, Africa needs to leapfrog to the clean, cheap and renewable technologies of the future. This is how Africa will catch up with its global neighbours. Africa is blessed with more sun, wind and geothermal energy than anywhere else on the planet, but that fact does not help the GWPF or the coal industry. Not only are wind and solar increasingly becoming the cheapest forms of new electricity across the globe, but they are also inherently more agile and versatile than grid-reliant fossil fuels. Pastoralists in remote parts of Africa in need of electricity will not be served waiting for hulking great power grids to be built, cutting a swathe across Africa’s precious natural landscape. They would be better off with solar mini-grids and wind turbines supplying energy exactly where it is needed most. No continent suffers more from global heating than Africa, yet nowhere has done less to cause it. But despite being victims of a climate crisis they did not create, Africans are smart enough to know that putting more coal on the fire is not the solution. African governments are becoming climate leaders, setting themselves ambitious targets under the Paris climate agreement that put richer, more polluting nations to shame. Africa is home to the world’s largest solar farm, the Noor power complex in Morocco. Africa’s surface area has 40% of the world’s potential solar resources, but it houses just 1% of global solar capacity for generating electricity. With the right investment, Africa can become a renewable energy superpower. What it does not need is discredited thinktanks such as the GWPF trying to hold back this future by making it the last dumping ground for the world’s dirtiest fossil fuel.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs more wildly fluctuating solar and wind energy is fed into the German power grid, the question of how to prevent blackouts has been elevated to urgent.
Germany’s weekly Die Zeit recently published an interview with Franz Untersteller, Environment Minister of the state of Baden Wurttemberg. He claims “electrical power supply will be tight“. The reason is because of the federal government’s latest energy reform plan.
Untersteller believes that Germany is headed on the wrong path and is in the process of repeating California’s 1990s blunders, which led to widespread rolling blackouts and a crippling of the Golden State’s power grid.
Currently Germany’s federal Economics Minister, Sigmar Gabriel is planning a reform of Germany’s electricity market. The aim, Zeit writes, is “to allow growth of the share of fluctuating power generation without the occurrence of blackouts whenever green electricity is lacking due to the weather“.
Untersteller thinks the federal government’s plan will lead to power shortages in some areas, in part as a result of the coming shutdown and/or mothballing of non-fluctuating nuclear and conventional power plants – in combination with the lack of power transmission lines to feed power in from north German offshore windparks. There is now an immediate need for a stable baseload power supply in southern Germany.

However Untersteller sees few investors willing to invest in back-up conventional power plants that can be switched on and off as needed according to fluctuating supply because of their complete lack of profitability: “Why would investors want to build such plants? [..] Talk to the managers of the energy business. Many of them are saying that the investment decisions they made a few years ago would not be made today because of the falling price levels on the spot power exchanges.”
Untersteller calls the federal government’s latest plan for installing reserve capacity using old brown-coal plants “nonsense” because they are unable to switch on and off quickly enough in response to wind and solar power supply fluctuations. Untersteller tells Die Zeit: “Old brown coal plants viewed technically are the crass opposite of flexible power plants.”
Moreover Untersteller is puzzled as to why Germany has opted to use solutions that have already failed in other countries, recounting a meeting he had with managers of Cailfornia power company PG&E:
“When I told them what the German federal government was planning, their eyebrows went up. California had a similar system, but only until the year 2000. They had blackout situations.”
As a solution to Germany’s power grid needs, Untersteller proposes a “focused capacity market“, where in a complicated process certain flexible and environmentally friendly capacities would be bid on and auctioned off with the aim of fulfilling the requirements for a reliable power supply in a market-oriented manner. It would be costly, but Untersteller says, “Supply reliability has its price“, i.e. the consumer would get stuck with the tab.
On the government’s current plan to reform the power market, Untersteller says that it is based on “ideal conditions – on conditions that in my opinion have very little to do with the daily reality in the energy business.”

"PARIS  —   New embezzlement allegations emerged on Wednesday against the French   presidential candidate François Fillon, adding uncertainty to an already tightly contested election. Mr. Fillon’s campaign was thrown into turmoil last week after Le Canard Enchaîné, a weekly newspaper that mixes satire and investigations, reported that his wife, Penelope Fillon, was paid with taxpayer money for a bogus job as a parliamentary assistant to her husband and his deputy in the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. On Wednesday, the newspaper published new accusations, reporting that Ms. Fillon had held the bogus job for even longer than initially reported  —   from 1988 to 1990, between 1998 and 2007 and finally from 2012 to 2013  —   and that she had been paid 831, 440 euros, or nearly $900, 000, much more than the figure published last week. Mr. Fillon, a former prime minister, won primary elections in November to become the candidate for the   Republicans party. But the allegations have seriously damaged his presidential bid, and the French media, which until last week portrayed him as the favorite, is now openly wondering who might replace him if he drops out of the race. The allegations are especially damaging for Mr. Fillon because he has pledged to reduce wasteful spending and has fashioned himself as a stern and honest politician, untouched by the corruption scandals that have plagued some of his opponents. Le Canard Enchaîné also reported that Mr. Fillon paid two of his five children as parliamentary aides when he was in the Senate, the upper house of Parliament, from 2005 to 2007. In an interview on French television last week, Mr. Fillon said that he had hired them temporarily for their expertise as lawyers. But the French news media was quick to point out that the children, his oldest daughter and a younger son, were not lawyers at the time, only law students, and Le Canard Enchaîné reported on Wednesday that they were paid a total of €83, 735 as   parliamentary aides, or over $90, 000. Under French law, it is not illegal for members of Parliament to hire relatives as aides, provided that the work is genuine. But the initial report in Le Canard Enchaîné prompted prosecutors in Paris to open an investigation to determine if Ms. Fillon actually did the work. Investigators have searched Mr. Fillon’s office at the National Assembly and questioned his wife and him, as well as Marc Joulaud, Mr. Fillon’s former parliamentary deputy. Mr. Fillon has denied wrongdoing and has said he would only drop out of the race if placed under formal investigation and charged. His supporters have mounted a confusing defense of Ms. Fillon, with some suggesting, for instance, that she was never seen in Paris because she worked exclusively in Sarthe, the region of France that Mr. Fillon represents. Others suggested the opposite. Antonin Lévy, Mr. Fillon’s lawyer, was mocked on social media for suggesting that the work of a parliamentary aide was not always “tangible. ” The investigation is also focusing on Le Canard Enchaîné’s report that Ms. Fillon was paid €5, 000 a month from May 2012 to Dec. 2013 by La Revue des Deux Mondes, a political magazine owned by Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, a wealthy friend of Mr. Fillon’s. Ms. Fillon is suspected of having done little besides a handful of short literary reviews. Speaking to   lawmakers on Wednesday, Mr. Fillon accused his opponents on the left of orchestrating an “institutional coup” and asked his colleagues stay loyal to him, according to French news reports. Thierry Solère, a Republican lawmaker who is also a spokesman for Mr. Fillon, said later that “nobody” would prevent Mr. Fillon from reaching the first and second rounds of the presidential election. But others in the party openly questioned Mr. Fillon’s candidacy on Wednesday. Georges Fenech, a Republican in the National Assembly, told France Info radio that the situation was “very, very compromised. ” “I think I am saying out loud what many, many lawmakers are thinking to themselves,” he said, calling for top party officials to designate a new candidate. “We can’t just watch like the orchestra on the Titanic, and continue to play while the ship sinks,” he said. In France, any number of candidates can run in the first round of voting, but only the two top   make it to the runoff. This year, the first round is set for April 23, and the runoff for May 7. An internet poll by the Elabe polling institute, published on Wednesday for Radio Classique and the newspaper Les Échos and conducted before Le Canard Enchaîné’s new allegations, found that Mr. Fillon, who was the favorite in the elections until last week, would not make it to the second round. The French left is deeply divided, and the candidates who have benefited the most from Mr. Fillon’s drop in popularity are Emmanuel Macron, a former economy minister under the current Socialist government who is running as an independent, and Marine Le Pen, the head of the   National Front party. Ms. Le Pen is facing her own allegations of financial misconduct at the European Parliament, where her party is accused of paying its staff members with European Union funds, which can only be used for parliamentary aides. Ms. Le Pen is refusing to repay the €300, 000 that the European Parliament is seeking to recover."
"

Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Roby, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to discuss judicial independence and the rule of law. Judicial independence is of course an important part of our constitutional structure, allowing the third branch of the federal government to check the others. Those checks and balances maintain the separation of powers, which in turn protects our liberty by preventing the concentration of power. And all of that is part of the rule of law, the idea that we have clear rules that apply equally to everyone, including the government itself—rather than arbitrary and opaque rules that work differently for different people.



Now, this hearing’s subtitle implies that something called “court capture” is a threat to judicial independence and the rule of law. Yet I’m not sure that the courts have been captured, or even what such a capture would look like. Is it simply that President Trump has gotten many judicial nominees confirmed? Although this administration has had particular success with circuit judges—53 confirmed, with no remaining vacancies—its just over 200 confirmed Article III judges represent only about a quarter of all such judges, and less than a quarter of the authorized 870 Article III judgeships.1



By comparison, President Carter had 262 judges confirmed—59 of them to the circuit courts—President Reagan had 383, President George H.W. Bush had 193, President Clinton had 378, President George W. Bush had 327, and President Obama had 329. If President Trump loses his bid for reelection, his total will be not much higher than the first President Bush’s and significantly lower than that of President Carter (for whom Congress created many new judgeships to fill). And if President Trump is reelected, even assuming the Republicans keep the Senate, it’s unlikely that his two‐​term total would be significantly higher than our last two presidents. For one thing, there are currently fewer than 70 vacancies—mostly for district judges in states where Democratic senators have refused to negotiate any sort of deals, preferring to leave their states shorthanded rather than to allow Trump to get any say in their judges.2



In other words, if the judiciary has been “captured,” it’s the sort of capture we see under every president—and probably overstated given the district court nominees in states like New York, where the Democratic senators have indeed made deals.



Maybe the nominees themselves have been captured by a particular interest? This can happen with elected state judges, of course, and historically the politics of judicial nominations have indeed been swayed by interests ranging from plantation slavery to the railroads, manufacturing concerns to New Deal allegiances. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse’s own chosen federal judge, John McConnell of the District of Rhode Island, was a well‐​known personal‐​injury trial lawyer who gave generously to left‐​wing causes.3



But there’s no indication that President Trump’s judicial nominees are beholden to the entertainment or hotel‐​development industries in which Donald Trump plied his trade before coming down that golden escalator to launch his presidential campaign. To his credit, President Trump has let the White House Counsel’s Office run the judicial‐​nominations show. Senators will occasionally insist on their own local favorites, but the ratio of intellectually rigorous and independent nominees to establishmentarians is exceedingly high. The result has been Trump’s biggest success, with judges of the same kind and caliber as those whom conservative‐​constitutionalist Ted Cruz would have picked. This administration has surpassed even George W. Bush in picking committed and youthful originalists, particularly in the circuit courts. Former White House Counsel Don McGahn likes to say that, rather than “outsourcing” judicial selection to the Federalist Society or anyone else, he had “insourced” the operation, meaning that his team, which was far leaner than in previous administrations, all understood the need for solid judges with a record of accomplishment and demonstrated commitment to originalism and textualism.



That’s why it’s no surprise that so many of Trump’s nominees are already superstars, and why Democrats have tried to smear them in various ways. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D‐​Calif.) said about Seventh Circuit Judge Amy Coney Barrett, the odds‐​on favorite to be elevated if Justice Ginsburg’s seat becomes vacant, that “the dogma lives loudly within you“4—which sounds like a rejected Star Wars line. Fifth Circuit Judge Don Willett was assailed for humorous tweets. D.C. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao and Second Circuit Judge Steven Menashi were attacked for their (standard conservative‐​libertarian) collegiate writings. California Senators Feinstein and Kamala Harris tried especially hard to block Patrick Bumatay, who became the first openly gay Ninth Circuit judge and first circuit judge of Filipino descent. The American Bar Association too has been a source of renewed controversy, rating three circuit nominees “not qualified,” seemingly based on ideological disagreements. (More on the ABA later.)



Indeed, Democratic senators have used every trick in their power to slow this high‐​quality judicial‐​confirmation train. They no longer have the biggest brake, the filibuster—which former Majority Leader Harry Reid eliminated for the lower courts in 2013, after having employed the first‐​ever partisan filibusters of circuit nominees a decade earlier—so they’ve forced more cloture votes than all previous presidencies combined. Nearly 80 percent of Trump’s judicial nominees have faced cloture votes, including many who are confirmed with upwards of 90 votes. In comparison, about three percent of Obama’s nominees faced cloture votes and fewer than two percent in the previous five presidencies. Until the Senate voted to cut back on floor time, Democrats also demanded the full 30 hours of floor time per nominee the rules allowed, even on judges who ultimately got approved by voice vote. Democrats are also refusing to return “blue slips,” the home‐​state senators’ prerogative to have a say in whether to let a nominee be considered. Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R‐​Iowa) thus made them non‐​dispositive for circuit nominees, assuming that the White House engaged in good‐​faith consultation—a policy Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has continued as chairman.



To put it another way, Trump’s just over 200 Article III judicial appointees have received more than 4,500 no votes, while Obama’s 329 got 2,039.5 Trump’s judges have received nearly half of all no votes in U.S. history, an average of about 22 per judge (and about 36 per circuit judge)—as compared to just over six per judge under Obama, two under George W. Bush, 1.3 under Clinton, and the rest fewer than one. In 2019 alone, when the Senate confirmed 102 judges, those judges received 88 percent more no votes than all 2,680 judges confirmed in the 20th century. The number confirmed in 2019 is eclipsed only by the 135 in 1979, when Congress had just created 150 new judgeships and President Carter’s Democrats had a 59–41 Senate majority. Judiciary Committee Chairman Ted Kennedy (D‐​Mass.) even considered seven circuit nominees in one hearing and the Senate confirmed more than 20 judges on a single day at least twice, confirming more than 97 percent of judges on voice vote and taking _no_ cloture votes.



One final statistic: The average Democrat has voted against nearly half of all Trump judicial nominees, which the average Republican voted against fewer than ten percent of Obama nominees. It’s a shame that quality nominees are confirmed on party‐​line votes; only 16 of 53 circuit judges confirmed under Trump have gotten more than 60 votes. But we’ve gotten here because we’re at the culmination of a long trend whereby different legal theories map onto ideologically sorted parties.



None of this is a sign of “capture.” And yet we have the now‐​withdrawn Advisory Opinion 117, the still‐​pending Judicial Ads Act, and other calls for so‐​called “reform.” Is “capture” simply a term to describe the normal judicial selection and confirmation process when the person making the accusation doesn’t like the president making the nominations? Because political considerations have always been a part of that process.



When Justice Charles Evans Whittaker retired in March 1962 after just over five years on the Supreme Court, John F. Kennedy had his first opportunity to shape the high court. The youthful president selected a man of his own generation, Byron White. White had met JFK in England while on a Rhodes Scholarship—after having been runner‐​up for the Heisman Trophy and spending a year as the highest‐​paid player in the NFL—and the two became fast friends.



White was a vigorous 45 and serving as the deputy attorney general under Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy formally nominated him on April 3, 1962. Eight days later, White had his confirmation hearing, a quick 90 minutes including introductions and supporting testimony from various bar association officials (during which the nominee doodled on his notepad). What questioning there was largely concerned the nominee’s storied football career; “Whizzer” White was surely the last person to play a professional sport while attending Yale Law School. The judiciary committee unanimously approved him, and later that day so did the Senate as a whole, on a voice vote.



My, how times have changed.



The battle to confirm Brett Kavanaugh showed that the Supreme Court is now part of the same toxic cloud that envelops all of the nation’s public discourse. Ironically, Kavanaugh was nominated in part because he was thought to be a safe pick, with a long public career that had been vetted numerous times. He was firmly part of the legal establishment, specifically its conservative mainstream, and had displayed a political caginess that made some on the right worry that he would be too much like John Roberts rather than Antonin Scalia or Clarence Thomas. As it turned out, of course, 11th‐​hour sexual assault allegations transformed what was already a contentious process into a partisan Rorschach test. All told, Kavanaugh faced a smear campaign unlike any seen since Clarence Thomas or even Robert Bork.



Confirmation processes weren’t always like this. The Senate didn’t even hold public hearings on Supreme Court nominations until 1916, a tumultuous time that witnessed the first Jewish nominee and the resignation of a justice to run against a sitting president. It wouldn’t be until 1938 that a nominee testified at his own hearing. In 1962, the part of Byron White’s hearing where the nominee himself testified lasted less than 15 minutes.



But while the confirmation process may not have always been the spectacle it is today, nominations to the highest court were often contentious political struggles. For the republic’s first century, confirmation battles, including withdrawn and postponed nominations, or those upon which the Senate failed to act—Merrick Garland was by no means unprecedented—were a fairly regular occurrence.



George Washington himself had a chief justice nominee rejected by the Senate: John Rutledge, who had lost Federalist support for his opposition to the Jay Treaty. James Madison, the “father of the Constitution,” also had a nominee rejected. And John Quincy Adams, who himself had declined a nomination from Madison, had a nominee “postponed indefinitely” during the lame duck period after Andrew Jackson had stopped his bid for reelection.



Jackson then had a nominee thwarted, but a change in Senate composition allowed Roger Taney to become chief justice a year later—and eventually author _Dred Scott_. John Tyler, who assumed the presidency in 1841 after the one‐​month presidency of William Henry Harrison, never lived down his nickname of “His Accidency.” Congressional Whigs disputed his legitimacy and their policy disagreements extended to judicial nominations: the Senate rejected or declined to act on four Tyler nominees (three of them twice) before finally confirming one.



Indeed, most 19th‐​century presidents had trouble filling seats on the high court. Millard Fillmore was prevented from filling a vacancy that arose during his tenure, as was James Buchanan. Congressional elimination of Supreme Court seats stopped Andrew Johnson from replacing the two justices who died during his presidency. It took Ulysses Grant seven tries to fill three seats. Grover Cleveland ran into senatorial traditions regarding seats reserved for certain states—which he overcame only by nominating a sitting senator.



In the 20th century, Presidents Harding, Hoover, Eisenhower, Johnson, Nixon, and Reagan all had failed nominations—although Harding and Ike got their picks confirmed after resubmitting their names. FDR never had anyone rejected, but his court‐​packing plan was, both in Congress and at the polls. And LBJ’s proposed elevation of Justice Abe Fortas triggered bipartisan opposition over ethics concerns—not a true filibuster because Fortas never gained majority support. Douglas Ginsburg withdrew before President Reagan could send his name to the Senate for having smoked marijuana with his law students; he is thus possibly the last public casualty of the War on Drugs.



Then of course there’s Merrick Garland, the first nomination the Senate allowed to expire since 1881—but the last time a Senate controlled by the party opposite the president confirmed a nominee to a vacancy arising in a presidential election year was 1888. As we know now, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s gamble worked: not only did it not hurt vulnerable senators running for reelection, but the vacancy held Republicans together and provided the margin for Donald Trump in key states. Then Neil Gorsuch was confirmed only after the Senate exercised the “thermonuclear option” and removed filibusters for Supreme Court nominees.



Opportunities for obstruction have continued—pushed down to blue slips, cloture votes, and other arcane parliamentary procedures—even as control of the Senate remains by far the most important aspect of the whole endeavor. The elimination of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees was the natural culmination of a tit‐​for‐​tat escalation by both parties.



More significantly, by filibustering Gorsuch, Democrats destroyed their leverage over more consequential vacancies. Moderate Republican senators wouldn’t have gone for a “nuclear option” to seat Kavanaugh in place of Anthony Kennedy, but they didn’t face that dilemma. And they won’t face it if President Trump gets the chance to replace Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Stephen Breyer, which would be an even bigger shift.



Given the battles we saw over Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, too many people now think of judges and justices in partisan terms. That’s too bad, but not a surprise when, as noted above, contrasting methods of constitutional and statutory interpretation now largely track identification with parties that are more ideologically sorted than ever.



Why all the focus on one office, however high? If Secretary of State John Kerry had died or resigned in the last year of the Obama presidency, it certainly would’ve been a big deal, but there’s no doubt that the slot would’ve been filled if someone with appropriate credentials were nominated. Even a vacancy in the _vice presidency_ wouldn’t have lasted unduly long.



But of course executive appointments expire at the end of the presidential term, while judicial appointments usually outlast any president. A president has few constitutional powers more important than appointing judges. Justice Scalia served nearly 30 years on the high court, giving President Reagan’s legal agenda a bridge to the 21st century. And that goes as much or more for nominees to the lower courts, which after all decided more than 50,000 cases a year even as the Supreme Court reduces its output. For example, a big ruling on nonprofit‐​donor disclosures was made in April 2016 by a district judge appointed by _Lyndon Johnson_.6



Even if politics has always been part of the process, and even if more justices were rejected in our country’s first century than in its second, we still feel something is now different. Confirmation hearings are the only time that judges go toe‐​to‐​toe with politicians—and that’s definitely a different gauntlet than even President Tyler’s nominees ran. So is it all about TV and Twitter, the 24‐​hour news cycle and the viral video? Is it that legal issues have become more ideologically divisive? No, the nomination and confirmation process—an interplay among president, Senate, and outside stakeholders—hasn’t somehow changed beyond the Framers’ recognition, and political rhetoric was as nasty in 1820 as it is in 2020. All these parts of the current system that we don’t like are symptoms of a larger phenomenon: As government has grown, so have the laws that courts interpret, and their reach over ever more of our lives.



Senatorial brinksmanship is symptomatic of a larger problem that began long before Kavanaugh, Garland, Thomas, or Bork: the courts’ self‐​corruption, aiding and abetting the expansion of federal power, and then shifting that power away from the people’s legislative representatives and toward executive branch administrative agencies. The Supreme Court is also called upon to decide, often by a one‐​vote margin, massive social controversies, ranging from abortion and affirmative action to gun rights and same‐​sex marriage. The judiciary affects public policy more than it ever did—and those decisions increasingly turn on the party of the president who nominated the judge or justice.



So as the courts play more of a role in the political process, of course the judicial nomination and confirmation processes are going to be more fraught with partisan considerations. This wasn’t as much of a problem when partisanship meant rewarding your cronies. But it’s a modern phenomenon for our parties to be both ideologically sorted and polarized, and thus for judges nominated by presidents from different parties to have markedly different constitutional visions.



One aspect of that dynamic is the rise of the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, which was founded nearly 40 years ago to counter the progressive orthodoxy in the legal profession. A network of more than 70,000 members, the Federalist Society has done much to enrich our public discourse and bring diverse perspectives to our law schools.



Earlier this year, the Judicial Conference’s Code of Conduct Committee, which is chaired by Eight Circuit Judge Ralph Erickson—who was nominated by President Trump—and includes Rhode Island District Judge McConnell, released an “exposure draft” of Advisory Opinion 117, titled “Judges’ Involvement With the American Constitution Society, the Federalist Society, and the American Bar Association.“7 The upshot of this proposed guidance with respect to several canons of federal judges’ Code of Conduct is that judges could remain members of the ABA, but could not be members of the Federalist Society or the American Constitution Society. Although the proposed rule was withdrawn last month after receiving significant criticism, it merits some discussion because it reflects the impetus for this hearing.



An astounding 210 federal judges signed a letter opposing AO117—which was suspiciously leaked to the _New York Times_ on the eve of the confirmation hearings for now-D.C. Circuit Judge Justin Walker. Drafted by Circuit Judges Greg Katsas, Andrew Oldham, William H. Pryor Jr., and Amul Thapar, the letter was signed by appointees of every president since Richard Nixon.8 Signatories included many non‐​members of the Federalist Society, while some judicial members did not sign (which doesn’t necessarily mean they supporedt AO117). Many Trump appointees signed it, but many others did not. As one observer put it, “The main takeaway is that membership in the Federalist Society shouldn’t be construed as a sign of how bold a judge is.… The second, and more critical conclusion, is that Donald Trump’s appointees to the federal bench shouldn’t be regarded as a monolithic group.“9



The letter made the following claims: “We believe the exposure draft [1] conflicts with the Code of Conduct, [2] misunderstands the Federalist Society, [3] applies a double standard, and [4] leads to troubling consequences. [5] The circumstances surrounding the issuance of the exposure draft also raise serious questions about the Committee’s internal procedures and transparency.” These are indeed the key criticisms of AO117, which I will summarize:



1\. _Conflict with the Code of Conduct_. The Judicial Code of Conduct urges that judges “not become isolated from the society in which they live.” To that end, Canon 4 allows judges to serve as members—and even officers—of “nonprofit organization[s] devoted to the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice.” The commentary to Canon 4 “encourage[s]” judges to “contribute to the law” through membership in “a bar association, judicial conference, or other organization dedicated to the law,” including those focused on “revising substantive and procedural law.” To change judicial policy and deny membership in such organizations separates judges from their communities and reduces opportunities for judges to expose themselves to a wide array of legal ideas.



2\. _Misunderstands the Federalist Society_. Viewing the Federalist Society as a “political” or even “policy” organization is base error. The Federalist Society, unlike the ABA or ACS, has never taken any policy position—not even in an _amicus_ brief. “We are at a loss to understand how membership can be seen as ‘indirect advocacy’ of the organization’s policy positions when the organization itself takes no policy positions,” the judges’ letter states. The Committee noted that FedSoc has “promoted appreciation for the ‘role of separation of powers; federalism; limited, constitutional government; and the rule of law in protecting individual freedom and traditional values.” Of course, those are the bedrock principles of the American constitutional order, one where judges swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution. “Instead of taking specific legal or policy positions, it facilitates open, informed, and robust debate,” the response letter explains. “Indeed, anyone who attends a Federalist Society event will encounter a diversity of ideas far exceeding that of many [I would say almost all] law school faculties.”



3\. _Applies a double standard_. FedSoc was formed partly as an alternative to the largest national voluntary bar association, the ABA. Yet the Committee allows ABA membership—even though the ABA most certainly takes policy/​political positions, including filing briefs on controversial issues, including abortion, the travel ban, the Second Amendment, affirmative action, and same‐​sex marriage. The ABA also lobbies Congress. The Federalist Society does none of these things. The Committee’s justification for the differential treatment is the public perception of FedSoc as conservative, while the ABA self‐​describes as nonideological or neutral.



4\. _Leads to troubling consequences_. That sort of “evolving public perception standard” leads to an untenable situation where one of two horribles will be true: (1) A ban on judicial membership in only one organization that takes no legal, policy, or political positions, the Federal Society, which constitutes rank discrimination; or (2) an extended ban on judicial membership in a host of specialty bars, law school and alumni communities, and even churches and other religious organizations. Neither of these consequences is defensible.



5\. _Issues with the Committee’s procedures and transparency_. Reports suggest that no member of the Committee was allowed to dissent, despite some members’ strong disagreement with the exposure draft. Other reports suggest that at least one Committee member was not allowed to vote on the draft. Essentially, the Committee functioned as a black box to reverse a previous interpretation of ethics rules that had long been considered settled.



I don’t have any other kinds of argument against AO117, but I can add, from personal knowledge and experience, that characterizing the Federalist Society as a political organization, or one motivated by some kind of special interest _that it imposes on its members_ is laughably wrong. The organization’s own statement of purpose describes the Federalist Society as “founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be.“10 Again, these are all truisms that the most left‐​leaning federal judge would be hard‐​pressed to disagree with—with the devil of course being in the details of how to define “freedom,” enforce the “separation of powers,” or “say what the law is.”



In all my years as a member—I joined in my first year of law school, 20 years ago—I have never been asked by anyone at the Federalist Society to take any position or sign my name to any statement. I’m constantly asked, on the other hand, about how best to frame a discussion in a particular area of constitutional law or legal policy, or whether I’d be amenable to debating a point I’ve made in a recent brief or article.



Having been formed in 1982 in opposition to the prevailing left‐​wing tilt in the legal culture—especially at law schools and the ABA—FedSoc strives to present debates and otherwise expose students to a wide range of ideas. It is not a monolith, and indeed I’ve had as many frank and serious disagreements, in person and in writing, with fellow Society members as with members of ACS and other organizations. During the same‐​sex marriage litigation, for example, law school faculty often declined to engage the issue, so FedSoc would provide _both_ speakers (including, frequently, me) to hold debates.



The Federalist Society counts as members people who apply many different kinds of interpretive methods, from natural law theorists to libertarians, those who believe in judicial restraint and those who advocate judicial engagement, textualists and pragmatists, lovers of _Chevron_ deference and those who want to “deconstruct the administrative state.” Indeed, FedSoc‐​member jurists who are textualists nominated by the same president can disagree, as we saw in _Bostock v. Clayton County_ this past term, in which Trump Supreme Court appointees Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh argued against each other regarding the proper interpretation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And of course that decision gave fuel to the rising “common‐​good constitutionalists,” as well as criticism by Senator Josh Hawley (R‐​Mo.) of the efficacy of a conservative legal movement that, in his view, increasingly fails to produce results for the voters who empower it.11



Moreover, progressives and liberals of various flavors are welcome at and regularly participate in Federalist Society events, whether sponsored by student chapters or at the national and regional lawyers’ conventions. Surely people like Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken, former acting solicitor general Neal Katyal, former ACLU president Nadine Strossen, and Harvard Law School _éminence grise_ Laurence Tribe wouldn’t want to legitimate an organization with right‐​wing advocacy goals, and yet they’ve all participated in Society events. (I myself have participated in ACS events, I should add, though I reiterate that ACS is different than the Federalist Society in various ways, including by taking policy positions.)



To put it in political terms, in the 2016 presidential election, Federalist Society members pulled the lever for Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Gary Johnson, and Evan McMullin, as well as writing in various others (anecdotally, Mike Lee and Ben Sasse were popular). Many went into the Trump administration, while others remained or became dedicated NeverTrumpers, leading such organizations as Checks and Balances. Still others remained on the sidelines because politics just ain’t their bag.



In short, the Federalist Society is a membership organization, not a think tank, public‐​interest law firm, or activist group. It doesn’t fundraise for political campaigns or for judicial nominations. It’s by no means a monolith; although its members tend to be conservatives and libertarians of some kind—again, this is a counterweight to the academy and organized bar—their shared policy commitments, appropriately for this hearing, don’t extend far beyond a belief in judicial independence and the rule of law. What membership in the Federalist Society does indicate, however, is a seriousness of purpose, a devotion to the intellectual side of the law, and a rigorous search for truth. It also serves as a signaling mechanism that someone isn’t a partisan hack but rather is interested in, as the commentary to Canon 4 of the Judicial Code encourages, “revising substantive and procedural law.”



Separating judges from the Federalist Society is a solution in search of a problem, as are restrictions on advocating the types of judges people think would be good for the country.



And so we come to the Judicial Ads Act, which, according a press release from lead co‐​sponsor Senator Feinstein, would:



Ironically, soon after the bill dropped, the other lead co‐​sponsor, Senator Whitehouse, along with Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), gave a presentation to the American Constitution Society on the topic of “Captured Courts: The GOP’s Big Money Assault on the Constitution, Judiciary and Rule of Law.“13 ACS described that event, which must be the inspiration for this hearing, as covering “ways that progressive lawyers from across the country can help fight back against these blatant attempts to use the court to achieve right‐​wing goals.“14 The irony is that ACS itself fits the definition of a “dark‐​money group” that tries to influence judicial selection and decision making, taking in millions of dollars in donations from donors it doesn’t disclose. 



Now, I don’t have a problem with ACS not releasing its donor list. By law, it doesn’t have to match the Federalist Society’s practice of listing all donors over $1,000 in its public annual report. And it shouldn’t have to do so if it doesn’t want to, because donor privacy is part of the freedom of association that’s so important to civil society and civic engagement. But those who support the Judicial Ads Act are hypocritical if they don’t condemn ACS—or, even more, Demand Justice or Alliance for Justice, whose sole _raison d’être_ is promoting judicial nominees they think will achieve progressive goals and opposing those they think will not.



And yet Senator Whitehouse has said that he’d be happy to take money from left‐​wing “dark money” groups.15 Indeed, in 2018, liberal “dark money” groups—led by those managed by “dark money monster” Arabella Advisors16—outspent conservative ones for the first time, while reform hawks like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders had their own groups supporting their presidential campaigns.17 So maybe it’s not so much the “dark money” or “donor disclosures” that’s the problem but the ideology or partisan preference of those who are donating or speaking? Those on the left get a pass because they’re promoting justice, while those on the right are evil?



Moreover, former Federal Election Commission chairman Bradley Smith recently explained that so‐​called dark‐​money groups—nonprofit public policy organizations, not political committees—are much less significant than they’re made out to be.18 Since _Citizens United_ allowed nonprofits, labor unions, and corporations to spend on electioneering in 2010, those groups labeled as “dark money” have usually accounted for 3–5% of total campaign spending.19 So far in the current cycle, however, from January 2019 through July 2020, that number is under 1%. FEC data shows that of the more than $6.2 billion spent on federal campaigns during that period, “dark money” only totaled about $20.8 million, which is 0.3% of the total.20



Setting aside that issue of efficacy, as well as the unequal treatment and viewpoint‐​based discrimination—which the First Amendment doesn’t allow—the Judicial Ads Act threatens to complicate our already unworkable campaign‐​finance regime by adding special rules for independent speakers who happen to speak about judicial nominations. Election lawyers must already be rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect of counseling clients how to avoid saying certain “magic words” or defending litigation over whither this or that ad actually concerns judges. Would an ad saying that Donald Trump or Joe Biden would make “the right decisions” (nudge nudge, wink wink) about abortion or gun control qualify as a judicial‐​nominations ad? How about an ad imploring a senator to vote for “the talented people President Trump has chosen to implement his policies”? Senator Whitehouse is essentially inviting the courts to police what can be said about their future colleagues and who can say it.



Because make no mistake: the Judicial Ads Act is not about voter information or political transparency, but instead is intended to chill speech. At a time when 62 percent of Americans are afraid to share their political views, when 32% of Americans (particularly well‐​educated Republicans) fear that disclosure of their political views could harm their careers—for good reason, as _half_ of all strong liberals support firing Trump donors—should we really enact more disincentives to political involvement?21 Another way to describe attacks on so‐​called dark money is as an attack on independent political speech and the freedom of association.



During the Civil Rights era, state governments attempted to force groups like the NAACP to disclose its membership lists. The Supreme Court stepped in and subjected such attempts to “the closest scrutiny.“22 Violations of the freedom of association must advance a compelling state interest and be narrowly tailored to that interest. The narrow‐​tailoring requirement prevents the government from needlessly infringing on constitutional rights when less restrictive means of achieving its goal are available. The Court requires “‘a fit that … employs not necessarily the least restrictive means but … a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective,’” which applies “[e]ven when the Court is not applying strict scrutiny.“23 This narrow‐​tailoring rule reflects decades of First Amendment precedent in cases concerning both associational and non‐​associational rights.



Reducing the First Amendment right to associate and speak anonymously would have profoundly damaging chilling effects in the current political climate. Times of political division bring attempts to silence political opposition, whether through direct government action or through threats and harassment. The NAACP was the subject of numerous attempts to force the organization to disclose its membership lists. In many cases, when individuals were discovered to be members of the NAACP, they quickly became targets of harassment, threats, and violence because of their affiliation with the group. By showing that “on past occasions revelation of the identity of its rank‐​and‐​file members has exposed these members to economic reprisal, loss of employment, threat of physical coercion, and other manifestations of public hostility,” the NAACP demonstrated that forcing disclosure of their membership lists was “likely to affect adversely the ability of [the NAACP] and its members” to engage in their constitutionally protected association and advocacy.24



While the Civil Rights era was unique, the right to private association is still vital. Groups advocating any number of unpopular ideas still face many of the physical, social, and economic dangers that the NAACP faced for decades. During the past several years, donors and activists across the political spectrum have faced death threats, public harassment, and adverse economic actions because of their political views and activities. In 2014, in an early precursor to today’s “cancel culture,” former Mozilla Firefox CEO Brendan Eich was forced to resign after it came out that he gave just $1,000 to the Prop 8 initiative in California that prevented same‐​sex marriages from being recognized.25 Since then, opponents of President Trump have used the internet to organize boycotts of companies because they or their officers donated to the president or other politicians who support him, or even said nice things about him.26 Last year, Rep. Joaquin Castro (D‐​Tex.) tweeted a list of San Antonians who donated to the president, saying it was “[s]ad to see.“27 Most seriously, in October 2018 a pipe bomb was placed in the mailbox of billionaire philanthropist George Soros, who “donates frequently to Democratic candidates and progressive causes” and who is often portrayed as a villain by the right.28



In an era of increasing political polarization, protecting associational privacy becomes even more important. And when groups or individuals espouse unpopular or controversial beliefs, private association is critical. Supreme Court precedent is clear: no matter the level of judicial scrutiny, state actions that infringe First Amendment freedoms, such as the compelled disclosure of donor lists, must be narrowly tailored to the governmental interest asserted. Broader disclosures rules are only warranted where that interest outweighs the chilling of speech and potential for harassment and “cancellation.” So we’re back to “judicial capture,” which seems to be nothing more than disagreement with the interpretive theories of the judges that have been appointed—and more fundamentally a frustration that Hillary Clinton wasn’t making the picks. I get that, but as President Obama liked to say, elections have consequences.



In all of these attempts to stymie the appointment of constitutionalist judges and restrict First Amendment freedoms—not just AO117 and the Judicial Ads Act, but also H.R. 1, the DISCLOSE Act, and plenty of other “reforms”—I hear an echo to FDR’s court‐​packing plan.



After significant churn in the Supreme Court’s personnel in the decade leading up to FDR’s election in 1932, the new president was stymied by the “Nine Old Men” who kept rejecting his ambitions. Yes, he had Justices Louis Brandeis, Harlan Stone, and Benjamin Cardozo on his side—favoring the New Deal, holding an expansive view of federal power, and practicing judicial restraint that deferred to the political branches—but three out of nine is only good for batting averages. Frustrated at not being able to get any new blood onto the Court in his first term, the landslide‐​reelected Roosevelt sent to Congress on February 5, 1937, a plan for a massive “reorganization” of the judiciary that would allow the president to appoint an additional federal judge for each one who didn’t retire within six months after turning 70.



The Judicial Procedures Reform Bill capped the number of total additional judges at 50 and the size of the Supreme Court at 15. Conveniently, six members of the Court, including the Four Horsemen—conservative or classical liberal justices who stood against the New Deal’s constitutional innovations—and Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes (the last chief justice in that role before John Roberts), were over 70. In a March 9 “fireside chat,” Roosevelt assailed the Court majority for “reading into the Constitution words and implications which are not there, and which were never intended to be there” and argued that Congress “must take action to save the Constitution from the Court, and the Court from itself.“29 But the president overplayed his hand, sending a disingenuous message to Congress about “insufficient personnel” that was countered by Hughes himself, in an influential and statistics‐​laden letter to powerful Senator Burton Wheeler (D‐​Montana) that was co‐​signed by Brandeis.



The plan was met with fierce opposition, splitting the Democratic super‐​majority in Congress and drawing a public rebuke from FDR’s own Vice President John Nance Garner. Curiously, three future justices supported the plan: Senator Sherman Minton was enthusiastic, scrapping his own bill that would’ve required a 7–2 vote to hold a law unconstitutional, as was Senator Hugo Black, and Wiley Rutledge, dean of Iowa Law School, was an important academic supporter. Meanwhile, Oswald Garrison Villard, publisher of the left‐​wing _The Nation_ , testified that the bill “opens the way for dictatorship.“30 The Judiciary Committee negatively reported the bill; a month later the full Senate recommitted it to the committee 20–70—where it was stripped of its court‐​packing elements, becoming a technical reform that Roosevelt signed in August.



Of course, two important developments took place between the plan’s announcement and Senate action. First, the Court started upholding legislation of the sort it had previously invalidated, with Chief Justice Hughes and Justice Owen Roberts shifting their votes in a series of cases involving the minimum wage, labor regulation, unemployment insurance, and Social Security. The duo to their graves denied the idea that their shift was politically motivated—FDR’s court‐​packing scheme would almost certainly have failed regardless—but even so, the pragmatic Hughes surely moved out of a recognition of the handwriting on the wall.



But second, and even more importantly, Justice Willis Van Devanter, the oldest and longest‐​serving of the Four Horsemen, announced that he would retire on June 1, 1937. Finally, four‐​and‐​and‐​half years into his consequential presidency, FDR would have a Supreme Court vacancy. As it turns out, this was the first of nine, a number surpassed only by George Washington’s table‐​setting. And they came quickly: by mid‐​1941, just four years after court‐​packing failed, only two justices remained whom FDR hadn’t appointed—and one of those, Stone, Roosevelt had elevated to chief justice. In a very real sense, then, FDR packed the Court the old‐​fashioned way, by maintaining control of the White House and Senate and waiting for natural attrition—although Republicans capitalized on his political impatience to pick up eight Senate seats in the 1938 election, plus 81 in the House. There’s a lesson there for 2020.



As one Court watcher wrote a quarter‐​century ago, “Today’s confirmation battles are no longer government affairs between the President and the Senate; they are public affairs open to a broad range of players. Thus, overt lobbying, public opinion polls, advertising campaigns, focus groups, and public appeals have all become a routine part of the process.“31 Those trends have only accelerated in the intervening 25 years, such that Supreme Court nominations are perhaps the highest‐​profile set‐​pieces in the American political system. Not even set‐​pieces but months‐​long slogs. Once the inside game of picking the nominee ends—that traditional dance between president and Senate—the outside game begins, culminating in the literally made‐​for‐​TV hearing and then a vote that, as we learned with Justice Kavanaugh, can be just as dramatic.



It’s not good, but we’ve gotten here because Congress and the presidency have gradually taken more power for themselves, and the courts have allowed them to get away with it, aggrandizing themselves in the process. As the Supreme Court has let both the legislative and executive branches swell beyond their constitutionally authorized powers, so have the laws and regulations that it now interprets. Competing theories battle for control of both the U.S. Code and Federal Register, as well as determining—often at the whim of one “swing vote”—what rights will be recognized. As we’ve gone down that warped jurisprudential track, the judiciary now affects the direction of public policy more than ever. So of course judicial confirmations are going to be fraught, particularly as competing interpretive theories essentially map onto political parties that are more ideologically coherent than ever.



There are two big buckets of cases where that dynamic has contributed to the ratcheting up of tensions that has both crumbled Senate norms in considering and filtered down into lower‐​court nominations: (1) cultural issues, ranging from abortion and LGBTQ issues to the Second Amendment and death penalty, and (2) what I’ll call “size of government” issues, which encompasses everything from environmental regulations to Obamacare, guidance documents to enforcement practices. And then there’s an overlay of “structural” cases: _Bush v. Gore_ , _Citizens United_ , _Shelby County_ , and partisan gerrymandering—whose legal issues in the abstract shouldn’t have partisan valence, but in the real world of American politics obviously do.



As the response of the conservative legal movement to various judicial provocations has shifted, the debate over that constellation of issues has crystallized. From calls for restraint in the face of the Warren Court’s making up social policy out of whole cloth—which ultimately led to too much deference to the political branches, and thus a long term loss for constitutional governance—the focus now is on engaging with the law, which often calls for invalidating the laws being reviewed rather than exercising “passive virtues.” Indeed, “activism” has become a vacuous term that conveys nothing more than disagreement with the judge or opinion being criticized. The battle has been joined over the legal theory rather than judicial process.



That is, so long as we accept that judicial review is constitutional and appropriate in the first place—how a judiciary is supposed to ensure that the government secures and protects our liberties without it is beyond me—then we should only be concerned that a court “gets it right,” regardless of whether that correct interpretation leads to the challenged law being upheld or overturned. To paraphrase John Roberts at his confirmation hearings, the “little guy” should win when he’s in the right, and the big corporation should win when it’s in the right. The dividing line, then, is not between judicial activism (or passivism) and judicial restraint, but between legitimate and vigorous judicial engagement and illegitimate judicial imperialism.



But the judicial debates we’ve seen the last few decades were never really about the nominees themselves—just like the proposals for court‐​packing and the like aren’t about “good government.” They’re about the direction of the Court. The left in particular needs its social and regulatory agendas, as promulgated by the executive branch, to get through the judiciary. That’s why progressive forces pull out all the stops against originalist nominees who would enforce limits on federal power. Indeed, all of the big nominee blowups in modern times—since the bipartisan opposition to Abe Fortas in 1968—have come with Republican appointments. The one quasi‐​exception didn’t involve any attacks on the nominee, but the rare case of an election‐​year vacancy arising under divided government; Merrick Garland would’ve been confirmed had Justice Scalia died a year earlier.



Not that any of this is a good thing. “I really, really don’t like where we are right now,” sighs former solicitor general Don Verrilli, who had worked on nominations under Presidents Clinton and Obama and laments the evermore toxic atmosphere. “Something needs to be done to change the situation.“32 If nominations were depoliticized, whether through term limits or any other reforms, or some unpredictable shock that recalibrated norms, that would likewise depoliticize the exercise of judicial power, both in perception and reality.



But term limits would take a constitutional amendment and everything else is either unworkable or doesn’t actually solve the identified problem. We can’t just wave a magic wand and go back to some halcyon age where the issues we faced as a country, the development of the law, and the political dynamic, were all different. “If they could truly, truly go back, I hear from most senators that they would prefer a return to the pre‐​nuclear‐​option days,” observes Ron Klain, former chief of staff to Vice Presidents Gore and Biden, “but in many ways, it’s easier for them now, because there’s very little constituency for voting for the other party’s nominees.“33



The only lasting solution to what ails our body juridic is to return to the Founders’ Constitution by rebalancing and devolving power, so Washington isn’t making so many big decisions for the whole country. Depoliticizing the judiciary and toning down our confirmation process is a laudable goal, but that’ll happen only when judges go back to judging rather than bending over backwards to ratify the constitutional abuses of the other branches.



The judiciary needs to once again hold politicians’—and bureaucrats’—feet to the constitutional fire by rejecting overly broad legislation of dubious constitutional warrant, thus curbing executive‐​agency overreach and putting the ball back in Congress’s court. And by returning power back to the states, and the people, while ensuring that majorities on the local level don’t invade individual constitutional rights. After all, the separation of powers and federalism exist not as some dry exercise in Madisonian political theory but as a means to that singular end of protecting our freedom.



These structural protections are the Framers’ best stab at answering the eternal question of how you empower government to secure liberty while also building internal controls for self‐​policing. Or, as Madison famously put it in Federalist 51, his disquisition on man’s non‐​angelic nature, “In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.”



Ultimately, judicial power is not a means to an end, but an enforcement mechanism for the strictures of a founding document intended just as much to curtail the excesses of democracy as to empower its exercise. In a country ruled by law, and not men, the proper response to an unpopular legal decision is to change the law or amend the Constitution. Any other method leads to a sort of judicial abdication and the loss of those very rights and liberties that can only be vindicated through the judicial process. Or to government by black‐​robed philosopher kings—and as Justice Scalia liked to say, why would we choose nine lawyers for that job?



In the end, all of this “reform” discussion boils down to re‐​arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. And this Titanic is not the appointment process, but the ship of state. As noted earlier, the fundamental problem we face, and that the Supreme Court faces, is the politicization not of the _process_ but of the _product_. The only way judicial confirmations will be detoxified, and the only way we reverse the trend whereby people increasingly see judges as “Trump judges” and “Obama judges,” is for the Supreme Court to restore our constitutional order by returning improperly amassed federal power to the states; securing all of our rights, enumerated and unenumerated alike; and forcing Congress to legislate on the remaining truly national issues rather than delegating that legislative power to executive‐​branch agencies.



The reason we have these heated court battles is that the federal government is simply making too many decisions at a national level for such a large, diverse, and pluralistic country. There’s no more reason that there needs to be a one‐​size‐​fits‐​all health care system, for example, than that zoning laws must be uniform in every city. Let federal legislators make the hard calls about truly national issues like defense or (actually) interstate (actual) commerce, but let states and localities make most of the decisions that affect our daily lives. Let Texas be Texas and California be California. That’s the only way we’re going to maintain “judicial independence and the rule of law,” as well as defusing tensions in Washington, whether in the halls of Congress or in the marble palace of the highest court in the land.

Dear Editor



You should encourage readers to write to their local MP regarding the Zero Carbon Bill and post a weekly letter. It seems shaming is the only way to get them to listen to the public. I haven’t received a response to my complaint but that’s OK as I felt much better after sending it. 



Because of National’s decision to support the Zero Carbon Bill, I will not support National in the upcoming elections. A party with more common sense will get my vote, National does not deserve it.  
Within 2-3 days China will produce the same amount of CO2 that New Zealand produces in 1 year. We can turn off our power stations, stop using fossil fuels and launch ourselves back to the Stone Age and **we will have no effect on global warming.** If stopping global warming is so important to the New Zealand government I suggest you start browbeating China and India before you browbeat New Zealanders. 



All of the global warming predictions of climate scientists have been proven wrong over time. The polar bears are not disappearing, they are thriving and their numbers have increased. The peak of Mt Kilimanjaro still has snow (my great aunt was the first woman to climb that mountain). Sea levels have not risen dramatically and islands have not been washed away, in fact their land mass have increased. Storms have not become more intense or more frequent. The Arctic still has sea ice in summer. A fortune teller with a crystal ball would have more luck at predicting the effects of global warming than climate scientists. 



How is the science settled when they don’t seem to know what’s going on? Why is questioning the science heresy when the science can’t even pass the scientific method? Why is warming considered a catastrophe and not a good thing? How can they be [so wrong for so long ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/climate-emergency-fail-of-the-day-27/)and still be credible? Why are you willing to harm our economy based on such flawed science?



The problem with scary predictions is that only time can prove them wrong. We have to wait 20 years to find out. In that 20 years China and India will not halt or reduce their CO2 emissions. Quite frankly, the Zero Carbon Bill is virtue signalling to a world that doesn’t care what New Zealand does and will be as effective as a fart in the wind in stopping global warming.



With the Zero Carbon Bill New Zealand will set an example to the world, in the same way that Venezuela is setting an example to the world. **We will be an example of what not to do.”**



  
Cheers,Tamsin

The sea ice surrounding Antarctica, which, as I reported in my book, has been steadily increasing throughout the period of satellite measurement that began in 1979, has hit a new all-time record high for areal coverage.
The new record anomaly for Southern Hemisphere sea ice, the ice encircling the southernmost continent, is 2.074 million square kilometers and was posted for the first time by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s The Cryosphere Today early Sunday morning. 

The previous record anomaly for Southern Hemisphere sea ice area was 1.840 million square kilometers and occurred on December 20, 2007.
Global sea ice area, as of Sunday morning, stood at 1.005 million square kilometers above average.

"Around 20% of the UK’s farms account for 80% of the country’s total food production, and they do this on about half of all the farmed land there is. At least 80% of farms in the UK don’t produce very much at all. In England, just 7% of farms produce over half of the country’s agricultural output – on 30% of its farmland. A little under half (42%) of England’s farms produce a meagre 2% of the total agricultural output, working just 8% of the country’s total land. In an average year, mixed farming, livestock grazing and cereal farms make a financial loss on what they produce, and much of the income on these farms comes from government subsidy. In all these cases, this subsidy forms the majority of income. Livestock farming is the least profitable sector of all while some of the most profitable sectors like horticulture – producing everything from vegetables to soft fruit and tomatoes – receive very little subsidy. Land is precious, and there are trade offs between designating enough to grow food and reserving it for other vital functions, like natural wilderness for biodiversity, recreation and carbon storage. This is as true in the UK as it is in the rest of the world.  Some farmers argue that they are the custodians of the land and the wildlife that live on it, but much of the evidence suggests that this role is neglected in the UK. Much farmed soil has been drained of its natural nutrients and now relies on artificial inputs like fertiliser. Rather than offering a haven for struggling bird species, it seems little progress has been made in halting declines in wildlife abundance on farmland.  Agriculture is also a major emitter of greenhouse gases, accounting for about 10% of total UK emissions. Some estimates suggest that ten “calories” of fossil fuel energy is needed to produce a single calorie of protein. The EU’s Common Agricultural Policy protected the right of people to farm unproductive land for the sake of countryside prosperity. But farming contributes only about 4% to the rural economy of England. Overall, UK agricultural production has stagnated in absolute terms since the late 1980s. This has meant unprofitable and environmentally damaging agriculture is maintained through subsidy. It’s time that a new policy shifted the balance. Agriculture in the UK uses a vast amount of resources – energy, pesticides, water and mineral fertilisers – compared to the amount of goods it produces. For the productivity of agriculture to match other developed sectors of the economy like construction, agriculture would need to produce five to ten times more from the land it consumes.  Much of this inefficiency is caused by the energy used to produce fertilisers and livestock production. Only about 10-20% of vegetable matter fed to livestock is converted into meat for people to eat. Animals are often fed plant-based food produced on land which could also produce human food. Around 75% of the calories fed to livestock in the UK comes from these sources. As much as ten plant-based meals could be produced for the same material cost as it takes to produce one meat-based meal.  So what’s the alternative? If the UK wants to play its part in feeding the world, keeping people healthy and conserving the environment, there is a very simple way forward. Converting the 50% of land that’s mainly used for agriculture – but which only produces 20% of the UK’s total agricultural output – to other functions, including recreation, storing carbon and enhancing biodiversity.

      Rewild 25% of the UK for less climate change, more wildlife and a life lived closer to nature


 This could be possible over ten years. It would give enough time for people involved in farming relatively unproductive land to adapt. Some of these people will still be paid from public funds but they could be tasked with rewilding their land to forest or other habitats that can lock away CO₂ and expand wildlife habitat. Some will also be rewarded for opening their land for public access. This will be especially important for land near urban areas as access to nature has serious benefits for human health. Growing food in different ways could also make farming more efficient and it would be needed to make up for the small shortfall in production. Vertical farming, hydroponics and aeroponics are all techniques where food is grown according to the principles of manufacturing. This means it’s produced close to where it’s consumed, no pesticides are needed and all nutrients are closely controlled, reducing pollution.  Mobilising British agriculture to help the UK reach net zero emissions would be an incredibly valuable use of the UK’s landscape. But the main challenge to this is convincing the people who currently farm the relatively unproductive land that they need to be a part of this vision. The National Farmers Union – who represent many of these particular farmers – have done much to try and sustain the status quo, especially for livestock agriculture. Overcoming this social inertia will be hard work, but vital. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."
"One of the most frequent subjects that exercises readers of the Upside is global population. There is a persistent view that many of the problems that we address in this series are merely symptoms of a bigger issue, the elephant in the room. Or at least, the 7.7 billion creatures in the room who aren’t actually elephants at all but are human beings. The argument runs like this: we are unlikely to tackle the climate crisis, water shortages, animal extinctions or any of the great environmental challenges of our time unless we do something about the runaway global population. Indeed, some have argued Covid-19 came about because of the unrestrained global spread of another lethal organism: mankind. Some of this is simplistic. The Earth could sustain many more humans if so many of them didn’t fly first class, drive SUVs and eat steak every night. The average person in sub-Saharan Africa consumes a tiny fraction of his or her western counterpart. Yet there is still something quite terrifying about UN projections of up to 11bn souls living cheek by jowl on the planet in 2100. And so it was a relief to read Fiona Harvey’s report this week on new projections that suggest the world may not be nearly as populous in 80 years as once feared. Of course, a contracting global population will bring about problems of its own. We’d love to hear your views on this: is a falling population a good thing in and of itself? Which issues will need urgent attention if, as predicted, populations halve in countries such as Japan, Spain and Italy? Do get in touch in the usual way. Here are some previous Upside population pieces, as food for thought. • How Botswana got its birth rate down. Three-minute read • How many people can the Earth sustain? Five-minute briefing • The problem with ‘GDP’ and the alternatives to it. Four-minute read • The soap opera aiming to get to grips with runaway population growth. One-minute read This subject is sure to feature meanwhile in our next Upside live event with the model and activist Lily Cole two weeks today (Friday 31st). Tickets are inexpensive and can be acquired here. Really hope to see some of you there.  Membership Event: The Upside: In conversation with Lily Cole  Right, before I forget, other Upside pieces this week included: • The super-rich calling for a tax hike – on themselves. Two-minute read • Noise gate: the technology that promises to silence the thrum of traffic. Two-minute read • You’ve heard of the green recovery … so what’s the ‘blue recovery’? One-minute read Remarkably in such a year, there has not been enough death in Norway (the Local reports). It seems physical distancing measures not only put paid to Covid-19, but other transmissible diseases, resulting in 6% fewer deaths in May and 13% fewer in June. In the UK, a different trend: people are quitting smoking in record numbers. According to the BBC, more than 1 million have quit since March. And as for the dreaded lurgy, New York City reported zero deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday, for the first time since mid-March. Not so much whiskey in the jar as in a plastic-free paper bottle, according to this piece from the Optimist. The website also looked into Unilever’s plan for carbon labels on products. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Times reported from a town that has apparently been able to do much better policing with far fewer police. Positive News had a sweet item on the rise of citizen science during the lockdown, and all the discoveries that were made as a result. And finally a cute website that lets you open windows and enjoy vistas all around the world. Back on the subject of global population, Arnold Schoonwinkel wrote in from South Africa with a response to our recent piece on deforestation in Uganda. Uganda’s deforestation is directly linked to its exploding population. While the improved wood burning stove might slow this down, as you imply, continued population growth is likely to neutralise any benefit.Perhaps there is good news from Uganda on successes to introduce family planning? If so, please cover this.  Maya Smeulders, meanwhile, was moved to write by Graham Snowdon’s recent article on the rise in microloans to the developing world. My Rotary Club in Abingdon has been running an small agricultural microcredit project in Uganda since 2007. We combine interest-free loans to farmer groups with training in organic agriculture and bookkeeping. By letting the farmer groups administer the individual loans to their members we keep the costs right down. They know their members better than we do and they all have an interest in the loans being paid back as the group is collectively responsible for returning the loan principal to us three years later. We have a team of local farmers whom we have trained in organic agriculture and who guide the groups in return. The beauty of the scheme is that the group will have its own loan pool by the end of the loan period, so that they do not need us any longer. And Mary Howell wrote in from Gwynedd in Wales asking for news of those helping the dispossessed. Great and heartening article on ways to tackle sea pollution and seeing life in new ways. Is there anyone, apart from charities, working to mitigate the evil of hostile environment, itself a huge contributor to pollution?Anyone out there housing the homeless in ecologically sound ways? Feeding the hungry in sustainable ways?Round our way there are many small scale hydro electric schemes adding to the grid, I don’t know if that counts. Cautious optimism on the vaccine front… cautious optimism for oppressed Sudanese people, and a statue stunt for our times."
"James Lovelock is best known as the father of Gaia Theory, the revolutionary idea that life on Earth is a self-regulating community of organisms interacting with each other and their surroundings. An independent scientist who eschews the academic establishment, he has variously been described as a maverick, prophet of doom, environmental philosopher and Gandalf. This month, he turns 101, but shows little sign of slowing his intellectual output. A paperback version of his latest book, Novacene, will shortly be released and he is working on a follow-up.  Fourteen years ago, you predicted that extreme weather would become the norm and the world would see more disasters in 2020. The first half of this year has seen a global pandemic, the first temperatures over 100F in the Arctic Circle, immense fires in Australia and Siberia, and plagues of locusts in Africa and South America. Do you feel vindicated as a scientist or disappointed as a human that your apocalyptic words have proved prophetic?It’s all pretty obvious really, but you never know when you have got things right until quite a long time afterwards because a surprise can turn up. Besides, I’m not a scientist really. I’m an inventor or a mechanic. It’s a different thing. The Gaia theory is just engineering written very large indeed. I mean you have got this ideal rotating ball in space, illuminated by a nice standard star. Up until now, the Earth system has always kept things cool on the Earth, fit for life, that is the essence of Gaia. It’s an engineering job and it has been well done. But I would say the biosphere and I are both in the last 1% or our lives.  Is the virus part of the self-regulation of Gaia?Definitely, it’s a matter of sources and sinks. The source is the multiplication of the virus and the sink is anything we can do to get rid of it, which is not at the moment very effective. This is all part of evolution as Darwin saw it. You are not going to get a new species flourishing unless it has a food supply. In a sense that is what we are becoming. We are the food. I could easily make you a model and demonstrate that as the human population on the planet grew larger and larger, the probability of a virus evolving that would cut back the population is quite marked. We’re not exactly a desirable animal to let loose in unlimited numbers on the planet. Malthus was about right. In his day, when the human population was much smaller and distributed less densely across the planet, I don’t think Covid would have had a chance. How will lockdown affect this prognosis?After this virus, I suspect quite a hefty change will be discernible. I think people will discover all sorts of things they can do that they didn’t do before. Maybe they’ll realise it is not such a good idea to get fat; that much of the suffering they get in middle age and later life is caused by just eating too much of the wrong sort of food. I always find it fascinating how the statistics illustrate that the health of the nation was enormously better at the end of the second world war than it was at the beginning. Early in your career, you did some research in this field…The first work I did after university was with the Medical Research Council in the department run by the discoverer of the influenza virus, Sir Christopher Andrewes. My job was to measure the number of droplets caused by coughing and sneezing in underground shelters during the second world war. There had been a deadly influenza virus at the end of the first world war and they were mortally afraid of that starting again because the tube was crammed with people. I read that it was at the Medical Research Council that you invented the electron capture detector…Yes, we developed a method of freezing hamsters so they were lumps of ice that you could bang on the table. Then we would bring them back to life in one of the first microwave ovens that existed. It turned out the reasons the hamsters could survive and other animals could not was that their fat had freezing points well below that of water. I asked my colleague Archer Martin, who invented gas chromatography, if he could analyse these things for me. When he saw the size of the sample, he said: “Only if you could invent a more sensitive detector for me.” I went away and in two weeks, I came back with two detectors, one of which was the first commercial one used with gas chromatography around the world and brought in quite a bit of money for the HMRC. The other one was the electron capture detector which later revealed the presence of ozone-depleting gases in the stratosphere and pollutants like PCB in the air, soil and water.It was because of this that I was probably the first person in Britain to be asked by Nasa to help them with the moon and Mars landings. My device weighed only a few grammes and was more sensitive than anything else and used almost no power at all. They thought: “Great, this is what we need. Come over to the States.” So I did. The French philosopher Bruno Latour recently told me your invention of the electron capture detector revealed truths about life on this planet in the same way that Galileo’s telescope revealed truths about the universe. Did you realise how important the device would become?I had no idea at the time. Latour is completely right, but I didn’t see it in that way at first because Galileo’s discovery is much more direct. If you see the moon and the planets orbiting the sun in such and such a way with your telescope, you can come to conclusions about the whole system. With the Earth, if i went to my cottage in Ireland and measured the emissions coming from Laminaria saccharina – a straplike seaweed that releases iodide compounds – I couldn’t jump immediately from that to a theory of how the Earth regulates itself. That is many steps further on. It is just a bit of evidence about the chains of life. As those bits of evidence gradually build up, you get a story like Gaia forming. Latour believes the establishment struggles to accept your ideas because they are such a conceptual leap. He believes the shift from Galileo to Gaia is as big as that from Aristotle to Galileo. But very different, of course. While Galileo opened exploration into an infinite universe, you revealed we are in a closed, very precarious system that we need to stabilise. Do you think people are willing to acknowledge this?I would love to be able to speak to Galileo to understand how he felt. We were both loners who met a lot of opposition. I think Galileo’s problem was largely with the church rather than people at large. It was so contrary to their dogma that they hated it. I have felt for some time that the universities are getting dangerously like the early church. They have dozens of different sects and they are quite proud if you belong to one of them: if you are a chemist you often don’t know anything about biology and so on. This is why ordinary university science is not really helpful because the department looking at seaweed would not be the same as the one looking at methyl iodide. It is a division into bits. It’s time universities were revolutionised and had much more common thinking. It’s amazing how much objection there is to Gaia. I’m wondering to what extent you can put that down to the coal and oil industries who fought against any kind of message that would be bad for them. If Gaia theory were better understood, could it be the basis for a creed that fills in the gaps that religion used to fill in terms of living well, living for others, living for future generations?I think in a way you are right. Nobody fully comprehends Gaia and that includes me, but it’s an easier thing to understand than God and religion. You just have to take those for granted. But with Gaia you can go out in the world and start measuring things. Are you at all religious?No, I was brought up a Quaker. I was indoctrinated with the notion that God is a still, small voice within rather than some mysterious old gentleman way out in the universe. Intuition comes from that voice within and is a great gift for inventors. Do you believe humanity can invent something to stabilise the climate?Well, we better had or we are doomed, but we are doing the opposite by burning fossil fuels. I always advocated nuclear as a good and cheap and sensible way of getting energy especially now that thorium is available as a fuel. But too many people hate it. I like Edward Teller’s suggestion of a sunshade in a heliocentric orbit that would diffuse a few percent of sunlight from the Earth. You would hardly notice it was there. If it could be done, and I think a big Nasa programme could almost certainly do it, it could save our bacon. It seems a more outrageous and difficult proposition than other geoengineering projects like putting sulphur into the stratosphere, but I prefer it. You could make it so that if anything went wrong it would automatically collapse. But overall, I don’t think we should start messing about with the Gaia system until we know a hell of a lot more about it. It is beginning to look as if renewable energy – wind and solar – if properly used, may be the answer to the energy problems of humanity.  You turn 101 years old on 26 July. How will you mark your birthday?It won’t be anything like the party last year or we would be broke. But we will celebrate. If the weather is good, we will go for a walk. My wife Sandy and I go out for a two- to three-mile walk most days, along the coast or up the hills. I’ve been one of the lucky ones who enjoyed lockdown because there are fewer people and no parked cars. And I may work on my next book, which I am deep into now. It is about evolution, particularly evolution of humans. Humans are evolving rapidly. We have changed from a tribal animal into a city animal. Look at most insects and they have trod that path already. There is plenty to write about. Novacene by James Lovelock will be published in paperback by Penguin on 30 July (£9.99)"
"**Facebook has announced that it will not take on any new political ads in the seven days prior to the US election on 3 November.**
However, the firm will still allow existing ads to continue to be promoted and targeted at different users.
Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg revealed the measure in a Facebook post.
He said that he was ""worried"" about divisions in the country potentially leading to civil unrest.
He added that Facebook would also label posts from candidates attempting to declare victory before the votes had been counted.
The social network has faced criticism for allowing political ads to be ""micro-targeted"" on its platform so that they are only seen by small communities rather than debated more widely in the days after they appear.
The Mozilla Foundation has claimed that this makes it easier for politicians and their supporters to parade fiction as fact and avoid being called out on it until it is too late, particularly as Facebook has previously said ads placed by candidates would not be fact-checked.
The new steps could serve as a precedent for how the firm handles elections elsewhere in the future.
Facebook also revealed that it would remove videos of President Trump encouraging voters in North Carolina to vote twice, which is illegal.
Any videos of Mr Trump's comments without contextualising information would be taken down, the firm said in a statement: ""This video violates our policies prohibiting voter fraud and we will remove it unless it is shared to correct the record.""
President Trump has repeatedly claimed the election could be ""rigged"" due to voter fraud.
However, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in previous polls.
""This election is not going to be business as usual,"" Mr Zuckerberg wrote.
""With our nation so divided and election results potentially taking days or even weeks to be finalised, there could be an increased risk of civil unrest across the country,"" he added.
In an effort to stymie the spread of rumours and deliberate falsehoods on Facebook, the firm has said it will implement a series of measures:
Mr Zuckerberg also said that Facebook had also ""strengthened"" its enforcement policies against movements known to spread conspiracy theories, such as QAnon.
Thousands of Facebook groups associated with these movements had already been removed, he said.
The moves have, however, attracted criticism.
The chief of Media Matters for America - a liberal media monitoring body - described it as being a pointless PR stunt.
""They will still let political ads be rerun and targeted to new groups during [the last] week so long as the ad was run and had one impression before 27 October,"" tweeted Angelo Carusone.
""So, you can run a bad ad now, pause it and then reuse it that week.""
An academic who specialises in how tech and politics interact made a related point.
""Campaigns will produce and run thousands of pieces of creative in the days before the cut off so they can run the final week,"" said Daniel Kreiss, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
**By James Clayton, North America technology reporter**
What Mark Zuckerberg is really concerned about here is system lag.
He knows the period before - and after - the US elections are likely to be toxic on Facebook.
Paid political adverts usually take time to analyse. Decisions around placing warnings on ads, or even taking them down, can take days.
And close to election day that could cause an enormous headache for Facebook, as the heat ratchets up.
We already knew of his worries about fake news and voter suppression.
But what's also interesting here is the period he's flagged between voting and the declared result. As he acknowledges, it could take days for a winner to be announced.
Zuckerberg has identified this potential legitimacy vacuum as a great danger for the US. He believes it could be the setting for civil unrest in America.
That's why he's flagging up early that anyone looking to delegitimise the vote will be targeted by Facebook moderators.
Considering Trump is already questioning the legitimacy of the election that could get very, very messy."
"Climate campaigners have launched a formal legal challenge against the government’s green recovery plans, claiming they are inadequate and “clearly unlawful” in light of the UK’s obligations to reduce emissions. Plan B, the pressure group that successfully challenged the UK government over its plans to expand Heathrow, sent a “pre-action” letter to the prime minister and the chancellor on Tuesday, saying the government was missing an historic opportunity to avoid catastrophe.  Tim Crosland, the director of Plan B, said: “The government can either follow the scientific and economic advice and take a decisive step towards a cleaner, fairer and more sustainable economy, creating vast number of new jobs – or it can ignore that advice by prioritising its corporate sponsors and locking us into the path to climate breakdown and a future that is grim beyond words. “It seems that Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings are set on choosing the second option, but we can’t let that happen.” The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, set out £3bn of “green spending” this month, focusing on improving energy efficiency in homes and public buildings. The plan was widely criticised by green groups. Plan B points out the sum was dwarfed by the billions committed to airlines and carmakers and funding for fossil fuels in the recovery programme. It was also only a fraction of the money allocated to “green recovery programmes” in other European countries. Tuesday’s letter is the next stage in the legal challenge which started at the beginning of the month. Then, Plan B said: “The proposed approach is quite clearly unlawful … it is no more than a fig leaf for the government’s new deal for polluters.” It gave the government until 4 August to respond. The government did not respond to the original letter. At the time, a spokesperson defended the package and said the government “continued to take our environmental responsibilities seriously and remain committed to meeting our climate change and wider environmental targets, including net zero [greenhouse gas emissions] by 2050”. Environmentalists argue that the UK’s recovery plans fail to take account of its obligations under the 2015 Paris agreement and the UK’s own net zero 2050 emissions target. Lawyers for green campaigners say the Heathrow case – in which the government’s approval of a third runway was deemed unlawful by judges because it failed to take into account the UK’s obligations under the Paris agreement – set a precedent that forces ministers to assess the impact of their Covid-19 stimulus plans on the climate crisis."

The Week That Was: 2014-08-30 (August 30, 2014) Brought to You by SEPP (www.SEPP.org) The Science and Environmental Policy Project
THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, Executive Vice President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
A Hint of Desperation? The synthesis report of UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) has been leaked to friendly media organizations such as Bloomberg and the New York Times. The IPCC schedule has the discussion of the report and approval during a meeting in Copenhagen from October 24 to October 31, 2014. (During the Copenhagen meeting, on October 26, the future work of the IPCC will be discussed.) The schedule has the presentation and distribution of the synthesis report from December 3 to December 14. One question about the timing of the leak quickly arises: is the IPCC trying to influence the US election on November 4?
Based on comments from journalists who are friendly with the IPCC, the synthesis report is more strident than past reports. Seth Borenstein of the Associated Press wrote:
Global warming is here, human-caused and probably already dangerous — and it’s increasingly likely that the heating trend could be irreversible, a draft of a new international science report says.
There is little in the report that wasn’t in the other more-detailed versions, but the language is more stark and the report attempts to connect the different scientific disciplines studying problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas.
“Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems,” the report says.
According to the publicly available atmospheric temperature data compiled by the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), there has been no warming trend for over a decade. Surface data show no warming for about 17 years.
We now have more than 30 explanations for the failure of the earth to warm. Many explanations have come from members of the Climate Establishment that have benefited from the IPCC and the enormous expenditure of funds from countries such as the United States. Many of these explanations suggest causes of natural climate change that the IPCC failed to consider in its AR5 Summary for Policymakers.
Yet, in addressing the trend of no warming, Andy Revkin wrote: “What’s firmly established is that the climate is warming, that the buildup of human-generated heat-trapping greenhouse gases is contributing substantially to the warming …”
Alarmists are announcing greater certainty in the work, without bothering to ask the central question. How can we know it was CO2 in the recent past, if it isn’t CO2 now? The only answer seems to be appeal to authority, in this case the IPCC. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy and http://www.ipcc.ch/scripts/_calendar_template.php?wg=8

Quote of the Week: I have been asked to talk about what I consider the most important challenge facing mankind, and I have a fundamental answer. The greatest challenge facing mankind is the challenge of distinguishing reality from fantasy, truth from propaganda. Perceiving the truth has always been a challenge to mankind, but in the information age (or as I think of it, the disinformation age) it takes on a special urgency and importance. Michael Crichton September 15, 2003 Number of the Week: 67%
###################################################
IPCC Illogic I – Circular Reasoning: When studying algebra many learned that when presented with an equation such as A+B=10, it is impossible to determine the value of A without knowing the value of B. Similarly, it is impossible to determine the value of B without knowing the value of A. In the AR5 Summary for Policymakers, the IPCC tries to get around this simple logic problem by using models to solve for the values of A & B simultaneously. [Assume A is human influences on climate and B is natural influences on climate and that the calculated values are 7 and 3, respectively.] This creates another problem. The models have not been verified and validated, how does one know that the calculated values are correct?
At this point the IPCC engages in circular reasoning. If A, equal to 7, is removed from the equation, an absurd result occurs, namely 3 = 10. However, a similar absurd result occurs regardless of the values of A and B, as long as the sum of A and B equals 10. The value of A or B must be determined empirically.
Andrew Montford points out another major issue with these presentations. The variations in temperature data have been obfuscated (smoothed) by using decadal averages. As statistician Matt Briggs insists, smoothing time series data can dramatically fool the researcher into being more certain about the final results than warranted by the data. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy.
****************
IPCC Illogic II: The current trend of no global warming has prompted Richard Betts of the UK Met Office to discount the value of climate models for public policy by claiming they are useful for short-term regional projections but not for long-term global projections. Betts is one of the lead authors of IPCC AR5, working group 2, which “assesses the vulnerability of socio-economic and natural systems to climate change, negative and positive consequences of climate change.” Andrew Montford in Bishop Hill, and Bob Tisdale in WUWT, demolish the argument by Betts. It is the fear of long-term global warming, based on projections from the faulty models, that drives funding of the Climate Establishment. See links Models v. Observations and http://www.ipcc.ch/working_groups/working_groups.shtml
****************
IPCC Illogic III: An article by Alex Morales in Bloomberg on the leaked synthesis report stated:
The pace of temperature increases slowed to about 0.05 of a degree per decade from 1998 through 2012 from 0.12 degrees per decade for the longer period spanning from 1951 to 2012. The IPCC said 111 out of 114 climate models predicted a greater warming trend than was observed from 1998 to 2012. And for the period from 1984 to 1998, most models showed less warming than was finally recorded, they said.
Over longer periods, the climate models seem to be more accurate. From 1951 to 2012, “simulated surface warming trends are consistent with the observed trend,” the IPCC researchers said. If models cannot make short-term forecasts, there is no logical reason to assume they will be successful at making long-term forecasts. As pointed out by Bob Tisdale, the models show increasing warming trends later in the 21st century than in the early part of the century. (These trends are 0.23 Deg C/Decade 2000 to 2033, 0.27 Deg C/Decade 2034 to 2066, 0.31 Deg C/Decade, 2067 to 2100.) See links under Defending the Orthodoxy and Model Issues.
****************
Is the Trend of No Global Warming Caused by humans? Examination of the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) graph of Monthly Global Lower Troposphere Anomaly from December 1978 through July 2014 can prompt such a question. After discounting the strong El Niño year of 1998, there is little warming until about 2002-2003, when a jump (step) in temperatures occurred. There is no clear trend thereafter, particularly if one discounts the El Niño year of 2010. The late 20th century warming appears in the surface record, which is subject to many human influences other than carbon dioxide.
Fred Singer, and others, have suggested that the surface records exaggerate late 20th century warming, whatever the reason. If so, then the current period of no warming may be an adjustment to this record. See http://nsstc.uah.edu/climate/2014/july2014/graph072014.png
****************
Avoiding Congress on Climate: Section 2.2 of the Constitution of the United States contains the following: “He [the President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur…” There is nothing stopping President Obama from submitting the Kyoto Protocol to Congress for approval as a Treaty except his realization it would be an embarrassing failure.
According to reports President Obama has given up on extending the Kyoto Protocol or seeking a Treaty. The Administration is trying to devise a binding agreement for the US without the approval of Congress. Many of those who question the quality of the science used by the EPA to declare that greenhouse gas emissions, mainly carbon dioxide, endanger public health and welfare were disappointed that the Federal Courts turned a blind eye to the poor quality of the science. Will the courts turn a blind eye to this apparent effort to ignore Congress and the Constitution? See links under Problems in the Orthodoxy.
****************
EROI: In the August 23 TWTW, unreliable solar and wind power to produce electricity, which cannot be stored on a commercial scale, were identified as luxury goods. They are expensive goods that are not needed in a modern society. This week Andrew Montford is blunter. These renewables cannot sustain civilization. Montford links to a study by John Morgan, posted on the Energy Collective, covering the Energy Return On Invested (EROI) for various types of energy technologies. According to studies, modern civilizations such as Germany and the US, require an EROI of about 7. Needless to say, wind and PV solar do not make the grade. Although one can quibble about the numbers, the report is sobering and should be considered when one is faced with promises blowing in the wind. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy.
****************
Capital Intensive – Green Jobs: The International Energy Agency, proponents of renewable energy, has published a new report of the mid-term future of renewable energy to 2020. Newspapers covering the publication reported largely what they thought was promising news for renewables. However, the report was not so optimistic, unless governments keep policies of mandating and subsidizing renewables. An interesting paragraph in the press release:
The annual report highlights the potential energy security implications of energy use for heat, which accounts for more than half of world final energy consumption and is dominated by fossil fuels. But the contribution of renewables to meet heating and cooling needs remains underdeveloped, with more limited policy frameworks compared with the electricity and transport sectors. Although modern renewable energy sources are expected to grow by almost 25% to 2020, their share in energy use for heat[ing] rises to only 9%, [of the total] up from 8% in 2013.
The electricity from solar and wind is not there when needed the most.
The report did recognize that, generally, renewables are capital intensive, thus provide few permanent “green jobs.” So much for the green jobs myths promoted by politicians. See links under Energy Issues Non-US
****************
Electricity Efficiency: Bureaucrats at the US Department of Energy and European Union are busily determining the desired energy consumption of ordinary appliances used by households. Unfortunately, less energy consumption for the bureaucrats means less efficiency in the appliance for the user. More human work! Drying clothes outside in the sun consumes less electricity than in a clothes dryer – even if it is winter and below freezing. John Brignell has succinct comments on this effort.
The effort by the Department of Energy was funded, in part, by $16.8 Billion in the so-called 2009 stimulus bill. And the politicians do not know why the stimulus failed? See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy, EPA and other Regulators on the March, and Washington’s Control of Energy
****************
Missing Emails: US Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen told Congress he had “moved heaven and earth” in his effort to recover emails by Lois Lerner detailing her efforts to deny special tax status to organizations that appeared to be political opponents to the Administration. The tax status was customarily granted to political supporters of the Administration. It appears that moving heaven and earth was not necessary. The US government has a comprehensive back-up system.
Recovery of missing emails may give some EPA officials discomfort. Efforts to uncover emails from EPA officials with members of green organizations have been thwarted. Perhaps they may reveal questionable relationships. Only time will tell. See links under Litigation Issues
****************
Streams & Waterbodies: The EPA is contemplating expanding its powers under the Clean Water Act. Opponents claim the EPA will be using the Act to seize effective control of vast amounts of private land. EPA denies this, but who would have thought that after Congress failed to pass cap-and-trade, the EPA would embark on controlling carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants? Given this regulatory overreach of the EPA, there is no reason to believe that the EPA does not have designs on controlling private lands
The Republican Chairman of the House Science Committee released one such map. Among the portions that stand out is that the dry Southwest is virtually covered with intermittent and ephemeral (short-lived) streams. See links under EPA and other Regulators on the March.
****************
Iceberg Ride: Professional adventurer and motivational speaker Alex Bellini has announce that to draw attention to global warming (and himself) he will live on an iceberg off the coast of Greenland. TWTW is not impressed. He no doubt will have appropriate food and equipment, much of it made from petroleum products.
If Mr. Bellini desired to impress, he could try to replicate Captain Tyson’s marvelous drift. Abandoned on a small ice flow with few provisions and limited equipment, starting October 16, 1872 Tyson’s party drifted about 1800 miles from Northwest Greenland through the Davis Strait to off the coast of Labrador where they were picked up on April 30, 1873. There were 18 survivors including 5 children. They had no proper lamp, let alone 20th century equipment. They survived on game the Inuit hunters caught – eating flesh and fat, often without cooking. Yet, without fresh fruits or vegetables, let alone modern vitamin pills, the party made it without noticeable scurvy, the most common killer of sailors during the voyages of discovery. That would be a real adventure. See link under Below the Bottom Line.
****************
Number of the Week 67%, EPA Air Quality Trends, 1980 to 2012, show that combined amount of six pollutants in the air has declined by 67% from 1980 to 2012; 72% from 1970. The pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter (10) and sulfur dioxide. Several issues become obvious. One, any studies to justify new regulations using data that are older than say, 10 years, are obsolete. And, two, asthma cases have increased as the air has become cleaner. EPA has no justification to claim that new regulations will reduce asthma cases. Yet, EPA administrator Gina McCarthy claimed that “In just the first year these standards go into effect, we’ll avoid up to 100,000 asthma attacks and 2,100 heart attacks — and those numbers go up from there.” See links under EPA and Other Regulators on the March and http://dailycaller.com/2014/08/27/epa-chief-co2-regulations-are-about-justice-for-communities-of-color/#ixzz3C03Uxu24

From ScienceNordic:
Researchers the world over almost unanimously agree that our climate is changing … But many farmers – at least Swedish ones – have experienced mild winters and shifting weather before and are hesitant about trusting the scientists.
The researcher who discovered the degree of scepticism among farmers was surprised by her findings. Therese Asplund, who led the study, was initially looking into how agricultural magazines covered climate change, but got a lesson in reality from swedish famers.

Asplund found after studying ten years of issues of the two agricultural sector periodicals ATL and Land Lantbruk that they present climate change as scientifically confirmed, a real problem. But her research took an unexpected direction when she started interviewing farmers in focus groups about climate issues.
Asplund had prepared a long list of questions about how the farmers live with the threat of climate change and what they plan to do to cope with the subsequent climate challenges. The conversations took a different course: “They explained that they didn’t quite believe in climate changes,” she says. “Or at least that these are not triggered by human activities.”
The paper:
Climate change frames and frame formation: An analysis of climate change communication in the Swedish agricultural sector
Abstract
While previous research into understandings of climate change has usuallyexamined general public perceptions and mainstream media representations, this thesis offers an audience-specific departure point by analysing climate change frames and frame formation in Swedish agriculture. The empirical material consists of Swedish farm magazines’ reporting on climate change, as well as eight focus group discussions among Swedish farmers on the topic of climate change and climate change information.
The analysis demonstrates that while Swedish farm magazines frame climate change in terms of conflict, scientific uncertainty,and economic burden, farmers in the focus groups tended to concentrate on whether climate change was a natural or human-induced phenomenon, and viewed climate change communication as an issue of credibility. It was found that farm magazines use metaphorical representations of war and games to form the overall frames of climate change. In contrast, the farmers’ frames of natural versus human-induced climate change were formed primarily using experience-based and non-experience based arguments, both supported with analogies, distinctions,keywords, metaphors, and prototypical examples. Furthermore, discussions of what constitutes credible climate information centred on conflict versus consensus-oriented frames of climate change communication along with different views of the extent to which knowledge of climate change is and should be practically or analytically based.
This analysis of climate change communication in the Swedish agricultural sector proposes that the sense making processes of climate change are complex, involving associative thinking and experience- based knowledge

"HONG KONG  —   A   billionaire who has forged financial ties with some of the country’s most powerful families was taken by the Chinese police from his apartment at the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong late last week and spirited across the border, a person close to the businessman said on Tuesday. The billionaire, Xiao Jianhua, who has been missing since Friday, is in police custody in China, where he apparently is safe, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of arrest. Mr. Xiao is a Canadian citizen with an Antiguan diplomatic passport, though he was born in China. His removal from Hong Kong appears to contravene the “one country, two systems” rule that allows the former British colony to run its own affairs and bars the Chinese police from operating here. When asked on Tuesday about Mr. Xiao, the Hong Kong police issued a statement saying that “the subject” had entered mainland China through a border crossing on Friday. His disappearance was reported the following day, but on Sunday one of Mr. Xiao’s family members reported that Mr. Xiao was safe and that the family had asked to withdraw the missing person’s filing. Mr. Xiao, 45, had spent years outside China, most recently staying at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong. The situation is eerily reminiscent of the case of another   holder, the bookseller Lee Bo, who disappeared off the streets of Hong Kong in late 2015, only to turn up days later in Chinese custody. His case, as well as the disappearance of four of his business associates, made headlines around the world and shook many people in Hong Kong, who saw his abduction as a violation of the city state’s ability to run its own affairs, guaranteed by international treaty until 2047. Mr. Xiao, a prodigy who passed the examination to enter the elite Peking University at age 14, controls a sprawling empire with shares in banks, insurance companies, coal, cement and property through his Tomorrow Group. The Hurun Report, which tracks Chinese billionaires, estimated his fortune last year at 40 billion renminbi, or $5. 8 billion. But that vastly understates his wealth, said the person close to Mr. Xiao. Mr. Xiao’s fortunes rose after his graduation from the university in 1990, where he had been head of the official student organization and stayed loyal to the government during the   demonstrations in 1989. In recent years, Mr. Xiao has acted as a kind of banker to the ruling class, paying $2. 4 million in 2013 to buy shares in an investment firm held by the sister and    of China’s president, Xi Jinping. A company he helped to control financed a deal that benefited the    of a top former leader, Jia Qinglin, The New York Times reported in 2014. Mr. Xiao bought the shares from Mr. Xi’s relatives to help them divest financial holdings following a 2012 report by Bloomberg News that detailed his relatives’ wealth. He did it “for the family,” Mr. Xiao’s spokeswoman said in 2014. His fate in recent days has been the focus of media attention and confusion in Hong Kong and in the overseas   press after reports emerged that he had been arrested. On Tuesday, Mr. Xiao posted two notices on his company’s WeChat account saying he had not been taken from Hong Kong to the mainland and instead was “recuperating abroad” and soon would meet with media organizations. In Chinese, there is no ambiguity: “Abroad” means outside the mainland. Those posts have since been removed. Those statements were untrue, according to the person close to Mr. Xiao, and were meant to tamp down interest in the story, because China’s government did not want it publicized. The person did not know why Mr. Xiao had been taken to the mainland, adding that his relatives, including his wife and son, were not in China. The Tomorrow Group has extensive holdings in China. Previous disappearances of Chinese billionaires have generated turmoil in Chinese stock markets, which are closed this week for the Lunar New Year. On Tuesday evening, the Hong Kong police press office would not comment on whether the local police had helped arrest Mr. Xiao and transport him across the border, and it would not say whether the Chinese police had illegally apprehended Mr. Xiao, saying only that it had asked the mainland police for help in the case. The Chinese Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request seeking comment on Mr. Xiao. A spokesperson for the Four Seasons Hotel, where Mr. Xiao lived for years, was not available to comment."

Applying the Palaeo-tropical Cyclone Record
Palaeo-tropical cyclone records have to date been predominantly used to depict long-term trends as well as attempting to understand the causes of these trends. These records can also be useful for more immediate timescales such a reliably deriving the frequency and magnitude of events for present day planning purposes and also for assessing whether tropical cyclones are responding to global climate change. 
Two examples of these uses of long-term cyclone records are presented here. The first […].
The second application is the use of high-resolution isotope records to assess whether tropical cyclone (TC) activity over the past few decades has changed substantially compared to the past 1,500 years.
[…]
High-resolution isotope records of TCs can be preserved within limestone stalagmites. Two records, one from Western Australia [since 500AD] and the other from Queensland [since 1400AD], provide insight into the nature of landfalling TC activity across the Australian continent. These records can be used to assess the role of humans in influencing the behavior of TCs […]. We developed a new index (Cyclone Activity Index – CAI), which calibrates the high-resolution, long-term isotope record of TC activity against the instrument TC record. The CAI allows for a direct comparison between the past and the present, and enables an examination of TC climatology at higher temporal resolution and on annual, decadal or millennial scales simultaneously, without the need to interpolate or extrapolate to account for missing data, which is a problem with the existing record of TCs. The CAI is the average accumulated energy expended over the TC season within range of the site, accounting for the number of days since genesis [of the storm] and the intensity and size of the storm relative to its distance from the site at each point along its track.
Our CAI for Australia shows that seasonal TC activity is at its lowest level since the year 500AD in Western Australia and 1400AD in Queensland and this decline in activity has been most pronounced since about 1960AD. This reduction in activity reflects the forecasts of TC behaviour for the Australian region from a suite of the most recent global climate models except this decrease appears to be occurring many decades earlier than expected.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is a commentary on the NOAA by energy physicist Mike Brakey, also see here, here, here, and here.
==================================
Severe cold is coming
By Mike Brakey
On August 21, the Sun Journal printed NOAA’s “Earth’s Heat broke records in July” claiming the world has gotten hotter each and every year over the last century, and it is the fault of every human on this planet who inhales oxygen and exhales the evil pollutant, carbon dioxide (CO2). I took a deep sigh of relief and exhaled this condemned pollutant the following Monday upon reading, “Farmers’ Almanac forecasts another cold, nasty winter”.
How can two predictions be so far apart? Whom should we believe?
The tie-breaker might be the climate secret an ex-NOAA meteorologist and climatologist, David Dilley, discloses in his free, 49-minute YouTube video: “Is Climate Change Dangerous?” He explains the scientific principles of how climate is governed by natural global cycles that have been documented in clockwork precision over the last half million years. Cycles are predictable. Like the year 1800 in the last 230-year cycle, temperatures have recently stagnated for more than a decade. Volcanic eruptions by Iceland’s Bardarbunga (August 16, 2014-March 2, 2015) assure a continued cooling trend for the northern U.S., as suggested by Lewiston’s Farmer’s Almanac.
Rather than hold my breath and do nothing, I have rolled up my sleeves. Winter is coming! I’ll get an excellent return on my investment by winterizing my Maine home, no matter whose theory is ultimately proven true.

"**Facebook has blocked access in Thailand to a million-member group discussing the monarchy, after the Thai government threatened legal action.**
The firm told the BBC it was preparing its own legal action to respond to the pressure from Bangkok.
Thailand is seeing a wave of anti-government protests which have included unprecedented calls for reforms to the monarchy.
Criticism of the monarchy is illegal in Thailand.
Access from within Thailand to the ""Royalist Marketplace"" group was blocked on Monday evening. The page can still be accessed from outside the country.
The group has more than one million members, ""pointing to its massive popularity,"" group admin Pavin Chachavalpongpun told the BBC.
Mr Chachavalpongpun said the group ""provides a platform for serious discussion on the monarchy and it allows Thais to express their views freely about the monarchy, from the political intervention of the monarchy, to its intimate ties with the military in consolidating the king's power"".
The self-exiled academic is based in Japan. A new Facebook group he set up on Monday evening gained more than 400,000 followers over night.
Facebook confirmed to the BBC it was ""compelled to restrict access to content which the Thai government has deemed to be illegal"".
""Requests like this are severe, contravene international human rights law, and have a chilling effect on people's ability to express themselves,"" it said in a statement.
It said it was preparing a legal challenge.
Thailand forcing Facebook to restrict access to the group has also been strongly criticised by rights groups.
""Thailand's government is again abusing its overbroad and rights-abusing laws to force Facebook to restrict content that is protected by the human right to free speech,"" John Sifton, Asia Advocacy Director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.
""Make no mistake, it is Thailand that is breaking the law here - international law protecting freedom of expression.""
Mr Chachavalpongpun told the BBC the discussions in the group were ""critical of the monarchy"".
""Some members think a constitutional monarchy may still work, but this is the minority. Some think an urgent monarchical reform is needed.""
He is one of three dissidents the Thai government has warned its people to stay away from.
The other two are British journalist Andrew MacGregor Marshall who has published a book critical of the Thai monarchy and Thai political history professor Somsak Jeamteerasakul who is an outspoken critic of the monarchy and lives in exile in France.
Thailand's monarchy has long been shielded from criticism under strict lese-majeste and other laws which punish insult to the royal family with up to 15 years in jail.
Thais are taught to revere the monarchy from a young age.
But that taboo was broken in recent weeks when some activists started publicly calling for reforms to the monarchy - amid wider anti-government protests.
""I think they have pushed the ceiling of the discussion on the monarchy very high and they will continue to do so,"" Mr Chachavalpongpun told the BBC.
""The government tried to shut them up by using legal tools such as arresting the core leaders and blocking access to my group. If the students persist, a harsher measure might be taken, like a crackdown.""
Thai police last week arrested nine people over the protests."
"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump, seeming to relish a fight with Democrats over his nominee to the Supreme Court, encouraged the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, on Wednesday to invoke the   nuclear option and abandon the   threshold for confirmation. “If we end up with that gridlock, I would say, ‘If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,’” the president said. Democrats are weighing strategies for opposing the nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch and debating how aggressively to pursue a battle over a seat that many of them believe was stolen from their party. In selecting a respected, deeply conservative jurist, Mr. Trump has dared Democrats to pursue the kind of blanket obstructionism that they long accused Republicans of embracing during the Obama administration. “That would be an absolute shame if a man of this quality was put up to that neglect,” he said from the Roosevelt Room of the White House. For the Democrats, who have struggled to match the fury and zeal of the party’s base during the wave of   activism since the election, a   showdown may prove unavoidable, doubling as a referendum on resistance tactics to a White House that liberals fear. Democrats intend to repeatedly remind the public about the Republicans’ treatment of Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee to fill the vacant seat last year, who was blocked from even receiving a hearing. Mr. McConnell had said a justice should not be seated during an election year, even though there is no prohibition on such action. Now, their gambit successful, Republicans will seek to capitalize on the groundwork laid since Mr. Trump’s election. Leading conservative groups have united for a   campaign to help Judge Gorsuch, producing television commercials, planning gatherings at megachurches and contacting supporters to encourage them to demand a vote from their senators. For Republicans who were leery of Mr. Trump’s campaign last year, the prospect of adding a conservative to the court was often a powerful motivator to stay in line. He has rewarded their faith. On Wednesday, as Judge Gorsuch made his initial courtesy visits to senators on Capitol Hill, Republican lawmakers assumed the tone of a party in power, appealing for unity and adherence to Senate custom. Judge Gorsuch’s first call after the announcement of his nomination was to Mr. Garland, as a gesture of respect, according to Ron Bonjean, a spokesman for the nomination effort. The nominee was also joined on Wednesday by Kelly Ayotte, a   former Republican senator from New Hampshire, who is helping to shepherd him through the nominating process months after losing her   bid. After greeting Judge Gorsuch during his visit, Mr. McConnell asked Democrats to heed their own calls to restore the court to its rightful size. “I would invite Democrats who spent many months insisting we need nine to join us in following through on that advice,” he said from the Senate floor. So far, Democrats have appeared unmoved, and occasionally seething. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said Judge Gorsuch  —   who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit  —   must meet the   threshold required to overcome a filibuster in the Senate. History  —   and especially recent history  —   demand it, he suggested. “This is nothing new. It was a bar met by each of President Obama’s nominations,” Mr. Schumer said. He argued that if Judge Gorsuch could not attract enough support, “the answer will not be to change the rules of the Senate, but to change the nominee to someone who can earn 60 votes. ” He added that Mr. Trump’s White House had demonstrated “less respect for the rule of law than any in recent memory,” placing a “special burden on this nominee to be an independent jurist. ” Breaking a filibuster would require eight members of the Democratic caucus to join the 52 members of the Republican majority to advance the nomination, or force Republicans to change longstanding rules and push through the nomination on a simple majority vote. Transfers of power from one party to the other often compel lawmakers to shift their perspectives, leaning on arguments they once rejected. But the bipartisan whiplash in the Senate has been especially striking. Since Mr. Trump’s announcement, the two parties have rushed headlong into an embrace of the other’s former talking points. Republicans have cast Judge Gorsuch as an unassailable choice, as Democrats did with Judge Garland, trumpeting his appeals court record and his impressive credentials. They reminded some Senate Democrats that they had voted to confirm Judge Gorsuch to a lower court once upon a time, as some Republicans had for Judge Garland. Senators like Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas  —   who, before the election, raised the possibility of blocking a nomination indefinitely if Hillary Clinton won the presidency  —   have insisted on swift action. And some Democrats have argued, after nearly a year spent lamenting the vacancy on the court since Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, that Judge Gorsuch must not be allowed to assume the seat. “The Democrats should treat Trump’s SCOTUS pick with the exact same courtesy the GOP showed Merrick Garland,” Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama, wrote on Twitter. “Don’t flinch, don’t back down. ” Reactions to Judge Gorsuch’s nomination among Democrats seemed to sort themselves into three camps: There were some cautious statements, often from moderate Democrats in states that Mr. Trump won, urging careful consideration of the pick. There were   concerns raised about Judge Gorsuch’s trail of conservative opinions and leanings. And there were arguments that did not focus much on Judge Gorsuch at all, instead framing the choice of any judge not named Merrick Garland as illegitimate. “This Supreme Court seat was stolen from the Obama administration,” Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said on Wednesday. “It casts a big shadow over it. If this seat is filled in this manner, it’s going to undermine the integrity of the court, the legitimacy of the court, for decades to come. ” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Judiciary Committee, struck a more conciliatory note, to a point. “Republicans were outrageously wrong in denying Merrick Garland a hearing and a vote. But two wrongs don’t make a right,” he said in an interview. “We should support a hearing and a vote for Neil Gorsuch. It’s part of the Senate’s job. ” He added, though, that Judge Gorsuch should be required to clear 60 votes. In the interim, Democrats and progressive activists have begun zeroing in on elements of Judge Gorsuch’s record. Among their concerns is the fact that he has voted in favor of employers, including Hobby Lobby, who cited religious objections in refusing to provide some forms of contraception coverage to female workers. Mr. Schumer said Judge Gorsuch had “repeatedly sided with corporations over working people” and demonstrated “a hostility toward women’s rights. ” Even before many Democrats weighed in, Republicans dismissed any complaints about Judge Gorsuch as empty posturing. Some senators were more creative than others. “Senator Schumer is about to tell Americans that Judge Gorsuch kicks puppies and heckles piano recitals,” Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said. That, he hastened to add, was untrue."

Governments described as _populist_ are now in power in Poland, Hungary, Mexico, and Turkey. Italy and Greece are governed by multiparty populist coalitions, while populists of the left or right are partners in coalition governments in seven other European Union countries. Venezuela is in free fall thanks to the confiscationist policies of a populist government. Brazil has an outspoken populist president. And the ongoing Trumpist takeover of the Republican Party isn’t just a populist spectacle in itself; it has also helped fuel a surge of left‐​wing populism among the Democrats. Those movements espouse a variety of programs across a wide range of political landscapes. What do they have in common?



Historians and political scientists have argued for decades about what exactly populism is, and they haven’t always come to the same conclusions. The political theorist Isaiah Berlin warned in 1967 that “a single formula to cover all populisms everywhere will not be very helpful. The more embracing the formula, the less descriptive. The more richly descriptive the formula, the more it will exclude.” Nonetheless, Berlin identified a core populist idea: the notion that an authentic “true people” have been “damaged by an elite, whether economic, political, or racial, some kind of secret or open enemy.”



The exact nature of that enemy—“foreign or native, ethnic or social”—doesn’t matter, Berlin adds. What fuels populist politics is that concept of the people battling the elite.





Envy and resentment are driving collectivist impulses around the world.



The Princeton political scientist Jan‐​Werner Müller proposes another characteristic: “In addition to being antielitist, populists are always antipluralist,” he argues in 2016’s _What Is Populism?_ (University of Pennsylvania Press). “Populists claim that they, and they alone, represent the people.” In that formulation, the key to understanding populism is that “the people” does not include _all_ the people. It excludes “the enemies of the people,” who may be specified in various ways: foreigners, the press, minorities, financiers, the “1 percent,” or others seen as not being “us.”



Donald Trump casually expressed that concept while running for president, declaring: “The only important thing is the unification of the people, because the other people don’t mean anything.” During the Brexit campaign, Nigel Farage, then‐​leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, predicted “a victory for real people.” Apparently, those who voted against Brexit didn’t just lose; they weren’t real people to begin with.



Not every formulation of populism looks like that. The historian Walter Nugent, for example, argued in 1963’s _The Tolerant Populists_ that America’s historical Populist Party was no more anti‐​pluralist than its opponents. In _Populism’s Power_ , released the same year as Müller’s book, the Wellesley political scientist Laura Grattan offered a definition of populism that has room for pluralist, inclusive movements. But it is the Berlin‐​Müller brand of populism that is currently surging in Ankara, Budapest, and Washington, threatening individual liberty, free markets, the rule of law, constitutionalism, the free press, and liberal democracy.



The policies promoted by those governments vary, but they reject two related ideas. One is pluralism, the idea that people are variegated, with different interests and values that need to be negotiated through democratic political processes. The other is liberalism—not in the narrow American sense of the political center‐​left, but the broader belief that individuals have rights and the state’s power should be limited to protect those rights.



Populists can be “of the left,” but they need not be motivated by Marxian ideas of class conflict or central planning. They can be “of the right,” but they are distinctly different from old‐​school reactionaries who yearn for a lost world of ordered hierarchies; if anything, they tend to dissolve old‐​fashioned classes and social orders into the undifferentiated mass of The People. Or they can reject the left/​right spectrum altogether. As the French populist leader Marine Le Pen put it in 2015, “Now the split isn’t between the left and the right but between the globalists and the patriots.”



Populists frequently believe that the true will of the authentic people is focused in one leader. Hugo Chávez, Venezuela’s late populist president, put it bluntly: “Chávez is no longer me! Chávez is a people! Chávez—we are millions. You are also Chávez! Venezuelan woman, you are also Chávez! Young Venezuelan, you are Chávez! Venezuelan child, you are Chávez! Venezuelan soldier, you are Chávez! Fisherman, farmer, peasant, merchant! Because Chávez is not me. Chávez is a people!” Turkey’s leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, once responded to a lone opposition voice by thundering, “We are the people! Who are you?” And then there’s Donald Trump’s less dramatic declaration that “I am your voice!”



Populists may seek power by democratic means, but that does not make them liberal. They often campaign against limits on the power of the people, especially independent judiciaries and other checks on the executive. Populists can be socialist or nationalist or both, they can be “pro‐​business” (crony capitalist) or “pro‐​labor” (crony unionist), but they share the idea that society must be put under some sort of control, exercised by a leader or a party that represents the true people and is fighting against their enemies.



 **The Children of Carl Schmitt**



Antagonism, thus, is foundational to the populist mentality. And the central theorist of antagonism was Carl Schmitt, a German philosopher of the Nazi era—he is sometimes called the “crown jurist of the Third Reich”—who has had a strong influence on both the hard left and the hard right.



In _The Concept of the Political_ (1932), a relentless critique of classical liberalism and constitutional democracy, Schmitt sought to displace the ideal of voluntary cooperation with the idea of conflict. The “specific political distinction to which political actions and motives can be reduced,” Schmitt wrote, “is that between friend and enemy.” The contemporary theorists who have taken this notion up include the left‐​wing populist Chantal Mouffe and her husband, Ernesto Laclau, author of _On Populist Reason_ (2005).



Laclau, whose ideas have influenced populist governments in Greece and Argentina and populist opposition movements across Latin America and Europe, applies Schmittian thinking directly. Indeed, he goes further than Schmitt, treating enmity per se as the very principle of power. Where Schmitt, a virulent anti‐​Semite, identified the Jews as the perpetual enemy, Laclau’s hostility can be directed against anyone.



For Laclau, a populist movement is a collection of otherwise unrelated unmet “demands” aggregated by manipulative populist leaders. The demands are all different, but they are unified in a movement that constitutes “the people.” The designation of “the enemy of the people” is a strategic matter, a means of assembling a coalition powerful enough to be united under a leader for the purpose of seizing state power.



The final and most toxic ingredient is “affective investment”—that is, emotional engagement. What unites the otherwise disparate and inchoate demands, Laclau says, is the group’s adoration of the leader and hatred of the enemy.



Íñigo Errejón, a leader of the leftist Podemos populist party in Spain and an enthusiastic defender of Venezuela’s regime, builds his populism explicitly on the idea that collectivities are created by positing an enemy against which the people must struggle. In his case, the enemy is “the _casta_ , the privileged.” When asked who the _casta_ are, Errejón responded: “The term’s mobilizing power comes precisely from its lack of definition. It’s like asking: Who’s the oligarchy? Who’s the people? They are statistically undefinable. I think these are the poles with greatest performative capacity.”



Mouffe described the choice of target as essential to building the “sort of people we want to build.” By identifying The Enemy, The People is constructed.



 **It’s Not the Economy, Stupid**



The old standby explanation of populism is that it is a predictable response to economic oppression. Thus, the socialist pundit John Judis argues in 2016’s _The Populist Explosion: How the Great Recession Transformed American and European Politics_ that populism rose in response to “the skewed distribution of jobs and income that neoliberal economics had created over the prior decades.”



Yet populists have surged in popularity or come to power in countries with very dissimilar economic conditions, including some with low unemployment and relatively high economic growth. Nor is the rise of populism a matter of age, with older people supporting right‐​wing nationalist populists and younger people supporting liberal cosmopolitanism: Plenty of young people have been voting for populist parties and candidates. Nor is the populist vote explained robustly by income levels.



The British political scientists Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin point out in their 2018 book _National Populism: The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy_ (Pelican) that a common driver in “national populism” is not falling wages but “relative deprivation—a sense that the wider group, whether white Americans or native Brits, is being left behind relative to others in society, while culturally liberal politicians, media and celebrities devote far more attention and status to immigrants, ethnic minorities and other newcomers.” Rapid change in the status of groups, notably through immigration, causes many people to experience relative downward mobility and to feel that the status of their group is threatened. When Britain voted to withdraw from the European Union, Eatwell and Goodwin write, polling data showed Remainers “talking endlessly about economic risks while Leavers were chiefly concerned about perceived threats to their identity and national groups.” (Brexit is a complex question, of course, and some classical liberals supported it because they feared an unaccountable E.U. bureaucracy. But the movement for Brexit was driven far more by populist concerns than by liberal ones.)



In the U.S., a deciding factor in Trump’s victory was the estimated 9 percent of voters who cast ballots for Obama in 2012 and then switched to Trump, according to survey data analyzed by George Washington University political scientist John Sides. Among white Obama voters who had not been to college, the share who later voted for Trump was a whopping 22 percent. As that past support for Obama suggests, their votes for Trump can’t be reduced to a simple story of racial backlash. Nor was it a simple matter of economics: For the most part, those voters’ incomes and living standards are higher than those of their parents.



But a common motivation for their support for Trump seems to be insecurity about their social status. A 2016 Brookings Institution survey showed that 66 percent of non‐​college‐​schooled American whites “agree that discrimination against whites is as big a problem today as discrimination against blacks and other minorities.” Anxiety about status—in this case a perception of an inversion of the status quo—seems to be a major factor, certainly much bigger than ideological racism. As political scientist Karen Stenner argued based on extensive data in her 2005 book _The Authoritarian Dynamic_ , threats to “collective rather than individual conditions” trigger authoritarian “groupiness,” i.e., populism.



Here’s where classical liberals need to do some serious thinking. A mainstay of arguments for free markets is that when people’s incomes rise at different rates, the important thing is that they’re all rising. Even most left‐​wing egalitarians accept some inequality, as long as it’s necessary for the poor to become less poor. The philosopher John Rawls argued in _A Theory of Justice_ , for instance, that inequalities can be just if they are to the “greatest benefit of the least advantaged,” because then, even the least well off could not complain. But human beings are concerned about more than how well they’re doing relative to how well they did in the past. They also care about how well they’re doing compared to others. They care about hierarchies and social status.



Relative status is quite different from absolute well‐​being. Libertarians have for many years celebrated the rise in status of women, racial minorities, immigrants, openly gay people, and others who had for very long periods of time suffered from low social status. Well, when it comes to _relative_ social status, if some rose, others had to fall. And who perceived themselves as falling? White men without college degrees.



It isn’t just onetime outsiders rising in comparative status. As Charles Murray lays out in his 2012 book _Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960–2010_ , a decline in our collective emphasis on certain traditional virtues—hard work, marriage, and the like—has opened a gulf between college‐​schooled elites and high‐​schooled nonelites. The resentment felt by one side of the divide is, unfortunately, often matched by the arrogance and condescension shown by the other, which merely accentuates the resentment.



Similar divisions are happening in other countries as well, and they seem to be a major driver of populist sentiment. Pew Research Center surveys conducted in 2017 in 15 countries identified ethnocentrism and perceptions of national decline as characteristic of populist voters. In Germany, for example, 44 percent of the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party’s supporters say that life is worse than it was 50 years ago for people like them, compared to only 16 percent of other Germans. While data vary across countries and, as Berlin pointed out in 1967, no one factor can explain all populist movements, such fears of national decline and group status are common, especially in Europe and the U.S. The most important driver in Europe and the U.S. seems to be immigration and what Eatwell and Goodwin in _National Populism_ call “hyper ethnic change”—that is, rapid change in the ethnic mix of a society, with multiple ethnicities joining the social order. (Some Americans have experienced feelings of dislocation and threat to their place in society upon seeing that their old Piggly Wiggly store has been replaced by a _mercado_ with Mexican flags. It’s not the experience of ethnic pluralism that seems to be the problem but the fear that other ethnicities will eventually displace them.)



The percentage of U.S. residents who were foreign‐​born reached 13.7 percent in 2017, the highest percentage since 1910, when it was 14.7 percent. Moreover, since the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, which abolished national quotas and favored family reunions, higher percentages of immigrants have been coming from Asia, Africa, Central America, and the Middle East, accentuating ethnic differences with the native‐​born population.



The Alternative for Germany, which started as a movement against the euro and has morphed into a populist anti‐​immigrant party, has drawn increasing support from less‐​schooled voters from the former states of East Germany. Such voters perceive their status as having fallen in recent decades, and they fear immigration far more than do more‐​schooled voters and those in the Western part of the country, which has seen far more immigration. In fact, the AfD support was strongest in those regions of the East that had seen the least population growth due to migration; people in those places feel that they are being left behind, and they blame immigrants, whom they see more on television than in their neighborhoods.



Similar analyses can be applied to Britain, France, Sweden, and other democracies that have seen surges of populism.



Hyper ethnic change is profoundly unsettling to many people, and it is helping to drive populist political responses. One can dismiss such reactions as irrational or small‐​minded, but many people feel them nonetheless. Moreover, many people are not satisfied with improvements in their conditions if they perceive others— _especially_ outsiders—as doing even better. Envy and resentment have long been drivers of anti‐​libertarian movements, and they seem to be back in a big way. The problem is exacerbated by the increase of welfare‐​state transfer payments and benefits, which outsiders are believed to exploit or threaten.



I fear that we may be entering an age of authoritarian “groupiness” and that the consequences will be terrible for freedom and prosperity. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the rise of far‐​right and far‐​left authoritarian populist movements today is more than a little reminiscent of Europe in the 1930s.



 **The Libertarian Response**



To take on such populist ideas, we must start by understanding them. If fear regarding immigration trends is driving a larger fear of liberal democratic capitalism, one response is to ensure that immigration procedures are (accurately) perceived as orderly rather than as invasive. Attitudes toward both the Syrian refugees fleeing a catastrophic war and the current situation on the United States’ southern border have arguably been shaped for the worse by a failure to fashion more systematic and orderly solutions, entailing a right to work legally, for example.



The reason so many people choose to cross into the U.S. illegally, and in risky ways, is that it’s extraordinarily difficult to obtain a visa at an American consulate and travel by bus or car through a legal port of entry. Those who enter without permission or overstay their visas are less likely to go home, as was previously common, when they are not sure they’ll be able to return to work again in the future. A functioning and efficient guest worker program—one that allows people to easily take temporary jobs in the United States and then return home to their families with the wealth they’ve rightfully acquired—could help calm the worries of American citizens who balk at the idea that throngs of foreigners are forcing their way across the border.



But is there anything _libertarians_ , the vast majority of whom remain outside the halls of power where immigration policy is set, can do?



One idea is to push back against the idea that trade is a zero‐​sum game. Your benefit need not come at my expense. What is good for Germany can be good for France, if Germans and Frenchmen trade goods and services rather than bullets and bombs. Immigrants who arrive to work enrich the people among whom they work. Negative‐​sum games can be transformed into positive‐​sum games by establishing the right institutions: property, contract, and voluntary trade. Trade has improved the well‐​being of Americans, of Germans, of Kenyans, of everyone.



Libertarians also need to take a hard look at our own rhetoric. Trying to divide humanity into taxpayers and tax eaters, as if there were some easy way in a modern society to distinguish the two groups neatly and unambiguously, feeds into populist hatred and rage. By all means cut subsidies, but demonizing the recipients as enemies of the people, as mere parasites, contributes to a climate of resentment, hatred, revenge, and conflict that undermines the framework for peaceful, voluntary cooperation on which liberty rests.



Thinking about the world in terms of friends vs. enemies channels energy into collectivism and demagoguery. To stop authoritarian populism, it’s important not to promote the mentality of enmity that enables it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAlexander Wendt at www.achgut.com/ch, a policy-critical site run by leading German publicists, wrote how Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber recently boasted before journalists of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) how he got Pope Francis to swing over to climate alarmism in His most recent encyclical “Laudato Si”. It wasn’t through open debate.
[Read here for more background on Schellnhuber.]
Wendt quotes the climate-alarmist Schellnhuber:
Over ten years ago the Pontifical Academy held a conference on climate change. Back then also a squad of prominent ‘skeptics’ also were invited; the Vatican’s position at the time was much different than it is today. …It was a tough job to prepare the scientific findings so that the problem is now far better understood in the Vatican.“
In response Wendt writes point that for Schellnhuber: “The major progress made at the Vatican is namely that the Church excluded any controversy in the new, latest debate which he influenced.”
According to Wendt, the FAZ journalists anxiously asked Schellnhuber:
The skeptics were invited as well?”

Schellnhuber replied:
No. But a British politician, Lord Monckton, managed to sneak into a conference. Unfortunately he is all caught up in conspiracy theories. In Rome he sat behind me with his iPhone, eagerly recording everything, and later in his blog made fun about how he fooled the Swiss security. It was a performance like in a Tyrolean peasant theater.”
Wendt summarizes what we naturally can gather from all this:
When it comes to how a debate is supposed to be conducted, we now know quite precisely what Schellnhuber’s idea of this is, especially once his Great Transformation becomes successful one day.”
Schellnhuber is convinced he should have the last and final word. Pope Francis likely views him as a prophet of some sort.
Wendt defended Monkton, writing that the high profile British climate critic is not caught at all up in any “conspiracy theories”, and that he in fact shares many common positions with scientists like Schellnhuber, quoting him in his own words: “Yes, there is a greenhouse effect. Yes, CO2 contributes to it. Yes, it causes warming. Yes, we emit CO2. Yes, warming will result. But not a lot.”
So here we see, just as we suspected, that the Vatican never bothered having any real balanced and open discussion on climate science in the run-up to “Laudato Si”. A terrible misstep.

"**Facebook has shut down a network of more than 150 fake profiles linked to China for ""co-ordinated"" interference in political discussions.**
While mainly concerned with backing China's interests, some also posted about the US presidential election.
It is only the second time that Facebook has identified such fake accounts as originating in China.
The network had about 130,000 followers - although very few of these were in the US.
The accounts starting appearing in 2016, and most of the information was related to China's influence in the Philippines and South-East Asia.
They were traced back to individuals based in Fujan province, who were beginning to pay for advertisements in Chinese yuan, Facebook said.
Much of the content was in support of the Chinese state - such as promoting its interests in the disputed South China Sea.
But there was also some criticism of China, too.
A few accounts had posted about US presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, before he dropped out of the race - as well as others supporting the eventual party nominees Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
More recently Graphika, the social media analytics firm asked by Facebook to research the accounts, found that some used an AI technique known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create believable but completely fake faces to front the profiles.
Ben Nimmo, a researcher at Graphika, tweeted: ""A year ago this was a novelty. Now it feels like every operation we analyse tries this at least once.""
Facebook also removed a network of fake accounts originating in the Philippines which focused on domestic audiences and local news.
It was smaller, with just 57 Facebook accounts, 31 pages and 20 Instagram accounts. In this case, links were found to the Philippine military and police.
They posted in Filipino and English about local news and events, and military activities against terrorism, as well as criticism of communism, youth activists and opposition parties.
**By Shayan Sardarizadeh, BBC Anti-disinformation Unit**
Headlines about Facebook's latest batch of takedowns will inevitably focus on Chinese efforts to interfere in the forthcoming US election. However, while that is a significant angle, it is important to keep things in perspective.
First, this was a tiny operation that failed to make any wide-scale impact before it was taken down. The number of actual US voters who came across its content is most probably negligible.
Second, only a small proportion of the operation's content was about the US election. And even then, the content was not in favour of or against a specific candidate.
Some of the content was supportive of President Trump, while some was in favour of Mr Biden. One page which criticised Mr Trump had no followers at all.
And third, most of the content was directly in line with China's strategic and geopolitical interests, particularly in the South China Sea.
It has become customary to associate Russia with foreign interference campaigns. But entities and governments around the world increasingly see information operations as a means to advance their individual or national security interests.
This year alone, Facebook has removed foreign interference campaigns originating in Iran, China, Ecuador, Iraq, Romania - and even the US."
"Just days before a public town meeting on Tuesday night, Jess Herbst, the mayor of New Hope, Tex. had an official announcement. “I am transgender. ” The statement said that she had transitioned and would no longer use the name Jeff. The message was  a few hundred words long and appeared on the home screen of the official website of New Hope, a town of more than 630 residents about 40 miles north of Dallas. But she appeared to break barriers for the state. “As far as I know, I am the first openly transgender mayor on record in the state of Texas there could be others who never came out,” Ms. Herbst said in an interview on Wednesday. “But I am the first to say, ‘Yes I am transgender and a seated mayor.’ ” Ms. Herbst informed residents in a statement on the town’s website about the change, and the joys of her life as a woman, including her preference in pronouns and the endurance of her marriage. “As your mayor I must tell you about something that has been with me since my earliest memories,” Ms. Herbst wrote. “I am Transgender. Two years ago, with the support of my wife, daughters and    I began hormone replacement therapy (HRT). “At the time, I did not imagine I would hold the mayor’s position, but here I am. ” Ms. Herbst has been active in local government since 2003 as an elected alderman, road commissioner and mayor pro tempore. In 2016, she was appointed New Hope’s mayor after the previous official in that post died. As of Wednesday morning, the New Hope town website was still referring to her as Mayor Jeff Herbst. But Ms. Herbst implied in her statement that she was patient: “I’m not especially sensitive to the pronoun I’m called, and I expect people to take time to make the change. I use the name Jess, a simple change from Jeff. ” “I live my life as a female now, and I will be performing my duties to the town as such,” she wrote. On the town website, she also invited the public to make comments in the town’s public meeting on Jan 31. Ms. Herbst, 58, said in a telephone interview that after posting her statement on Jan. 23, she attended the council meeting for the first time dressed as a woman.’ ”“It was phenomenally positive everyone was supportive,” she said. “We had a fairly packed crowd for a tiny town  —   there were 15 or 20 people there. I explained to the people who had not just had a chance to see the website, and everybody said, ‘O. K.,’ and we went on and had a meeting. ”” ’But as an elected official who was later appointed as mayor, Ms. Herbst said that she was given a “very stern lecture” by the town attorney about laws that govern elections and canvassing, and that she was told not to change her name before the coming election cycle. Ms. Herbst also said she has received thousands of messages of support, and three negative ones. Replies to announcements on her Facebook page and the town’s website appear to be supportive, with residents praising her for coming forward in a state where, in most parts, it is legal to discriminate against people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In January, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, one of the most powerful Republican officials in the state, put Texas on the front lines of the nation’s culture wars when he announced the filing of a bill that would require people in government buildings and public schools to use the bathroom that corresponds with their “biological sex. ” Critics said the bill discriminated against transgender people. Terri Burke, the executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, said Mayor Herbst was showing “tremendous courage in discussing her identity with the public. “We applaud Mayor Herbst’s decision to serve her community openly in public office and take a stand against hateful rhetoric coming from some of our legislators,” Ms. Burke said in an email. “Some Texas lawmakers are attempting to exclude transgender Texans from public spaces with legislation like SB6, but we should be making it easier for them to share their skills and talents with us, not pushing them out of public restrooms and public life. ” Ms. Herbst suggested on the city’s website that the culture was changing in the United States and directed constituents to her personal website, where she has kept a diary over the years. It included a gallery of photos titled, “Who I am now,” juxtaposed with a section called who “I used to be,” with images of her life as Jeff. Ms. Herbst said that she had the support of her family. Her wife grew up in New Hope, and the couple have lived in the town with their two daughters since 1999. “It is gender identity, not sexual preference that applies to me,” the mayor wrote. “I love my wife, and she loves me. We have no intention of change. My daughters have been adamant supporters of me and are proud to tell people their father is transgender. ” In the interview Wednesday, Ms. Herbst said she began living full time as Jess toward the end of September, and gradually broke the news to friends, family and  . Finally, there was no one left to tell but the wider town population, and that was when she made the announcement. “I am being who I am and doing what I have to do,” she said. “I am not trying to make some sort of big statement. ”"

What is the origin of the false belief – constantly repeated by President Obama, the media and others – that almost all scientists agree about global warming?

Claims continue to be made that “97% of scientists agree that climate change is real, man-made and dangerous.” That’s what Secretary of State John Kerry told graduating Boston College students. It’s what President Obama said in his State of the Union address and a recent tweet.

There’s just one problem – aside from the fact that this assertion is being used to help justify policies and regulations that are closing down fossil fuel power plants and crippling our economy. The claim is completely bogus. As Heartland Institute president Joe Bast and climate scientist Roy Spencer make clear in this article, the papers used to create and perpetuate the 97% claim are seriously and fundamentally flawed. The alleged consensus simply does not exist; much less does it represent anything remotely approaching 97%.

The myth of the climate change 97%
What is the origin of the false belief that nearly all scientists agree about global warming?
Joseph Bast and Roy Spencer
Secretary of State John Kerry, President Obama and others frequently claim that climate change will have “crippling consequences,” and that “Ninety-seven percent of scientists agree that climate change is real, man-made and dangerous.” In reality, the assertion is science fiction. The so-called consensus comes from a handful of surveys and exercises in counting abstracts from scientific papers – all of which have been contradicted by more reliable research.
One frequently cited source is Naomi Oreskes. She claimed to have examined abstracts of 928 articles and to have found that 75% supported the view that human activities are responsible for most of the observed warming over the previous 50 years, while none directly dissented. Ms. Oreskes’s definition of consensus covered “man-made” influences but left out “dangerous” – and excluded scores of articles by prominent scientists who question the consensus. She also failed to acknowledge that a study published in the journal Nature noted that abstracts of academic papers often contain claims that aren’t substantiated in the papers.
Another widely cited source for the consensus view is an article in Eos: Transactions of the American Geophysical Union. It reported the results of a two-question online survey of selected scientists, and claimed “97 percent of climate scientists agree.” Most scientists who are skeptical of man-made catastrophic global warming would nevertheless answer “yes” to both questions. However, the survey was silent on whether the human impact – or the rise in temperature – is large enough to constitute a problem. It also failed to include scientists most likely to be aware of natural causes of climate change.
There is no basis for the claim that 97% of scientists believe that man-made climate change is a dangerous problem.

"It’s almost a coronation: Every year, the Sundance Film Festival anoints a darling or two  —   indie   who are poised to break out, usually with their first feature. (Geremy Jasper was one at the festival that just ended in Park City, Utah.) These lucky few tend to go on to   or critical success, maybe even the Oscars. Think Damien Chazelle, whose “Whiplash” was the toast of the 2014 season his “La La Land” is now the    . But what about the festival filmmakers whose works are lauded and distributed, but whose career paths are less charmed? After they’ve packed up their snow gear, there are tantalizing moments and deep frustrations. Many go on what’s known as the “water bottle tour,” meetings with development executives and agents in Los Angeles (where you’re more likely to leave with a bottle of Evian than a production deal). Most don’t have new scripts ready, a huge impediment, said the producer Anne Carey. Then they struggle against the industry’s narrow expectations. “Any person coming out of Sundance is in a box, particularly if you only have one film under your name,” said the filmmaker Justin Simien. “And if you happen to be in the black box or the gay box or the woman box, I think you’re in a smaller box. ” Meanwhile, the clock is ticking: “You have a whole year, and then there’s a whole new batch of kids at Sundance, and then it’s their year,” said the director Kat Candler. “Your spotlight has shifted. ” For three filmmakers  —   Mr. Simien, 33, from Los Angeles Ms. Candler, 42, who lives in Austin, Tex. and Sara Colangelo, 37, based in New York  —   who made their feature debuts in 2014, alongside Mr. Chazelle, what happened next felt like one step forward, two back. Their paths hold lessons for other artists and offer a glimpse into how Hollywood careers are really made. 2014 Two years before, Justin Simien quit his day job to make his debut feature, “Dear White People. ” He had worked in movie marketing, so he had some insider savvy. What he didn’t know was how his film, a satire of race relations set on a college campus, would be received by the mostly white audiences at Sundance. “I was kind of terrified, to be honest,” he said. “Dear White People” struck a chord, earning a festival award for breakthrough talent. A distribution deal soon followed. “I went into it just hoping that when I came out, I could at least pay my rent,” Mr. Simien said. “That didn’t happen. ” But in Los Angeles afterward, he was in demand, attending dozens of development meetings for months. He understood the process: “Part of being a development person is checking off the list” that you’ve met with Sundance alumni, he said. Nonetheless, it seemed like he had arrived. Even if the offers were not as big as those some of his white counterparts were getting  —   “Nobody was talking about ‘Jurassic World,’” he said, the film Colin Trevorrow landed after his Sundance debut  —   he didn’t feel pigeonholed. Several projects floated up, like a dark comedy with Anthony Mackie attached. Yet Mr. Simien was still strapped for cash. Driving to those Beverly Hills meetings, “I was afraid to pull up to the valet, because my hubcaps were falling off,” he said. In the spring, he sold a book version of “Dear White People” that kept him afloat financially. The film opened in the fall, to critical acclaim. 2015 As Mr. Simien toured with his film, he found a second career as a speaker, especially at colleges. “Any school that was dealing with a race issue would book the film and then book me,” he said. He made the movie to spark discussion, so these encounters were gratifying and meaningful. He jotted down stories he heard from the students, too. When a studio approached him about making a TV version of “Dear White People,” his notes  —   fresh ideas  —   were immediately useful. 2016 In May, Netflix announced the series. In June, Mr. Simien sat in a production space and marveled at his fortune. “I’m in an office! There’s a lamp from HomeGoods! It’s ” he said. He presided over a diverse writers’ room of seven people, discussing civil rights, “blacktivism” and cultural identity. With the veteran showrunner Yvette Lee Bowser, he learned to make a TV series. 2017 “That was probably the hardest thing I ever did,” Mr. Simien said in January after finishing the show’s first season. Production had wrapped on Election Day the series’ themes were landing in a much more charged cultural landscape than where they were conceived. “This show is 100 percent part of the resistance,” he said. Mr. Simien is pleased with it but itching to get to other projects. “Creatively, I just need to prove to myself and to others in the industry, I’m not a   pony,” he said. Hiring for his series, he had noted that white male colleagues had been given more career chances. “The opportunities that I have tend to be ” he said, adding, “You just gotta keep grinding  —   which has worked out so far. ”  2014 The   Sara Colangelo arrived at Sundance that January with an ambitious debut, “Little Accidents. ” Set and shot in a West Virginia   town, with a sprawling story line, it was created after Ms. Colangelo won a coveted spot in the Sundance screenwriting and directing labs three years earlier, and secured a budget of $1. 2 million, all major for a   indie filmmaker. The cast  —   including Elizabeth Banks, Josh Lucas and Chloë Sevigny  —   was enviable, too. But even as she set out to unveil it, Ms. Colangelo said, she knew that her film was not exactly what she wanted it to be. “There were moments in the editing room where I was like, I’m enormously proud, but these things might not be working,” she said. Was the film too sad? How would the marketplace react? “I was aware of what the challenges were. ” The film came with    expectations. Critics at the festival praised the acting, though, and the  . Ms. Colangelo made the Los Angeles rounds that fall, and was sent a few scripts, but no jobs materialized. She made ends meet doing corporate videos. Financially, she said, “there were nine months or so where it was like, it’s going to be tough. ” 2015 “Little Accidents” made it to theaters a full year after Sundance. Reviews were largely welcoming, but it barely eked out $10, 000  —   total  —   at the box office. Still, Ms. Colangelo earned a nomination for best first screenplay at that year’s Indie Spirit Awards, and that led to a few    jobs, polishing other people’s work. In the meantime, she watched friends and Sundance alumni  —   mostly men  —   advance. Doubts crept in: Could she have done more on “Little Accidents”? Her male counterparts were often allowed reshoots. Somehow, for them, “the money was found. ” She asked herself, “What kind of leader do you have to be to get those things? Is it charisma? Is it truly gender?” She was buoyed when Israeli producers asked her to adapt an acclaimed,   foreign drama. (They declined to reveal it.) Ms. Colangelo worked on the script for months and finally signed a deal at the end of the year. 2016 As the Israeli film’s location and financiers bounced from Canada to New York, and casting decisions loomed, Ms. Colangelo hung on to direct. She vowed to be more flexible on production details and bolder in her focus on story. 2017 Her   was erased, replaced with excitement, and pride: She plans to begin shooting the new film this summer, shortly after the birth of her first child. “There’s this feeling that the industry sometimes gives you, that you have this window of opportunity after Sundance and if you don’t perform perfectly in that moment or have a perfect script, then the window shuts,” she said. “And I think that’s a dangerous way to think about it. ” Momentum, she discovered, can rebound. “And it’s O. K. to retrieve it and find it later. ” 2014 A   filmmaker with several shorts to her credit, Kat Candler landed at Sundance with the family drama “Hellion. ” “I was definitely hoping to get representation,” she said, a distribution deal and attention for other projects. She knew that breakout success was rare and that her route would be tough, especially without superlative reviews. A month later, she did her water bottle week in Los Angeles. “It felt like ‘The Amazing Race,’” she said, eight meetings a day. Little came of them. “Hellion,” starring Aaron Paul of “Breaking Bad,” opened in theaters five months later, and Ms. Candler hit the road to promote it. Live Q. and A. s, Skype sessions  —   “Anytime anybody asked, it was a yes,” she said. “It was exhausting, after a while. I wish someone had warned me. ” Her promotion helped, but not much “Hellion” just did not have the marketing dollars. In retrospect, she said, her efforts distracted her from “putting all the pieces for another project together. ” 2015 A year after Sundance, Ms. Candler was growing anxious. “I felt like, oh, what am I doing?” she said. But she was halfway into a   mentorship program, sponsored by the Sundance women’s filmmaking initiative. “The life coach was pretty transformative,” she said. She shelved her jealousy about others’ deals. “I can go write for four hours and feel a sense of accomplishment,” she said. A push to break into TV directing was fruitless, though. No one wanted to an untested TV director, even if she had already conquered the big screen. (Male directors, research shows, face a lower bar for hiring.) “Sometimes you just wonder, how much harder do I have to work to prove myself?” Ms. Candler said. Her life coach offered a mantra: You belong in the room. So at every meeting, she said, “I tell myself, ‘You’ve earned your space. ’” In the summer, she shot a campaign for Canon. Besides money from teaching a college class, it was her first real paycheck in years. Still, she worried about car insurance payments and other bills. 2016 Back in Los Angeles, Ms. Candler had meetings about a   feature she was writing. It could go indie or mainstream, depending on the stars and how much control Ms. Candler ceded. “Do I really want to go out for a project that doesn’t have great humanity? No,” she said. A turning point came in the spring, when she shot two episodes of “Queen Sugar,” the series created by Ava DuVernay that employs only female directors. No pitch meetings were necessary they knew each other through the festival circuit. The paucity of female directors has been a hot topic in Hollywood, but Ms. Candler was over it. “Just hire,” she said. “It really isn’t that hard. ” 2017 “Queen Sugar” was renewed, and Ms. DuVernay asked Ms. Candler to return, now as the producing director. Ms. Candler went on to shoot episodes of other series. She has work lined up through 2018. She felt confident before “Queen Sugar,” she said. “I just don’t think that people had confidence in us. Ava legitimized all of us. ” After 17 years in the field, she said, she was at last making a living as a filmmaker."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s one for the stubborn clingers of green energies like wind and sun. German financial daily Handelsblatt here writes about the harsh reality of these so-called clean, free-for-the-taking energies.
In the earlier days of green energy (some 10 or so years ago, then German Environment Minister Jürgen Trittin famously claimed that the cost of wind and solar energy would be easily affordable – equivalent to no more than one scoop of ice cream a month. Environmentalists like David Suzuki once said in a video, “Hey man, it’s for free!” Nothing could be further than the truth.
The Handelsblatt concedes the real (painful) costs of green energy. It writes:
The costs of the Energiewende [transition to renewable energies] for power cosumers in Germany is now running at 28 billion euros annually. A household with a power consumption of 3500 kilowatt-hours annually is thus paying 270 euros a year for implementing the Energiewende.”
That’s the result Germany’s Institute for Economy (IW) calculated on behalf of the Handelsblatt. North American readers should keep in mind that their household energy needs typically run two or even three times higher than the very conservative figure of 3500 kilowatt-hours a year used by the Handelsblatt, this due in large part to harsher winters and hotter summers.
Website The Irish Energy Blog here presents a chart depicting electricity cost as a function of installed sun and wind capacity for all European countries:

The relationship is totally clear: The higher the share of wind and solar power in the power generation, the higher the electricity prices for consumers.
The Handelsblatt cites one industry group representative, Carsten Linnemann: “The consequences of the Energiewende are developing into a dangerous competition factor because it is frightening investors and is costing jobs.”
There’s another sinister side to Germany’s careening Energiewende, the Handelsblatt writes. Because wind and solar power are given the right of way to the power grid over conventional fossil fuel generated power, the conventional plants are forced to run part-time at inefficient levels, which makes them unprofitable. The Handelsblatt continues:
A total of 57 conventional power plants are to be shut down, reports Bild newspaper on Monday, citing figures from the German Power Regulatory Board. That is nine more than at the start of the year. The reason, according to the plant operators, is the lack of profitability due to the Energiewende.”
Of course there will be some out there who will obstinately keep their heads stuck in the sand, and wish all of this wasn’t true.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s a huge problem not only with my NTZ site, but it appears to have affected thousands of other sites running with WordPress.
I need more time (which I don’t have) to muddle through this sh!t.  Sorry about the troubles.
Sarah Gooding best describes the WordPress situation:
“WordPress 4.2.3, a critical security release, was automatically pushed out to users yesterday to fix an XSS vulnerability. Shortly afterwards, the WordPress.org support forums were flooded with reports of websites broken by the update. […]
User confidence in WordPress’ automatic background updates took a dent with the 4.2.3 release. Waking up to broken websites causes users to second guess automatic updates after being assured that maintenance and security releases would not include breaking changes.
When users get burned by automatic updates, in the end it doesn’t matter which party is at fault – whether it’s the core team or a theme or plugin. They simply expect updates to work and not break anything. Even in instances where a poorly coded extension may be at fault, the average user has no way of determining whether or not their active plugins follow WordPress best practices.
The aftermath of the most recent security release is one reason why many developers and users are still wary of automatic updates. Amir Helzer represents many other plugin developers who are eager to find better ways to work together with the core team to provide a better update experience for users. This is especially important for releases like this one where the Shortcode API changes directly affected users’ content. Hezler’s comment reaffirms the fact that development agencies, plugin developers, and core developers are all partners on the same team. It’s time to find better ways of working together to provide the best update experience possible for WordPress users.”

"**Facebook's India executives have been grilled by a parliamentary committee over allegations of political partisanship and hate speech.**
The social media giant is accused of going easy on ruling BJP supporters who allegedly violated hate speech rules.
But the BJP is also irked with Facebook - it has accused it of bias against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The company denies the allegations, but the row puts it in a precarious position in its biggest market.
The app is hugely popular in India, with more than 300 million users - and so is its messaging platform, WhatsApp, which has 400 million users.
The parliamentary committee's closed-door hearing lasted several hours. There were no immediate details of what had been said.
The allegations against Facebook first appeared in a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) last month. The company insists that it doesn't allow hate speech on its platforms.
""We prohibit hate speech and content that incites violence and we enforce these policies globally without regard to anyone's political position or party affiliation,"" Facebook told the BBC in an email recently.
But the WSJ investigation immediately sparked calls for an inquiry, leading to Wednesday's parliamentary hearing. Facebook's head of business for India, Ajit Mohan, is expected to appear before the 30-member committee.
The committee has members from all political parties but it is led by Shashi Tharoor, an outspoken MP from the main opposition Congress party.
The closed-door hearing will cover Facebook policies on ""safeguarding citizens' rights"" and preventing the ""misuse of social/ online news media platforms"" among other things.
The company is accused of allowing anti-Muslim rhetoric and other content on the platform, in what the WSJ said was favouritism towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
The report said that Facebook deleted some anti-Muslim posts by a BJP lawmaker only after the paper asked about them. It also alleged that similar posts by at least three others, who supported the BJP, were not taken down even after they were flagged for violating the company's hate speech rules.
At the centre of the allegations is the person who allegedly made the decision not to delete these posts - Ankhi Das, Facebook's top public policy executive in India.
According to the paper, Ms Das told employees that ""punishing violations by politicians from Mr Modi's party would damage the company's business prospects in the country"".
Ms Das is the subject of a second report by the WSJ, published over the weekend, which alleges that she supported the BJP and Mr Modi, while denigrating the opposition parties in internal messages.
Facebook, however, denied it favoured any political party, and said these messages were taken out of context.
It's unclear what will be the result of the hearing. But the lack of clear Indian laws that regulate such global platforms makes any sort of enforcement hard.
What also complicates matters is the growing influence of social media in elections - Facebook and WhatsApp, especially, play a huge role in Indian politics. Parties, lawmakers and aspiring leaders all use the platforms to mobilise voters, whip up fervour and even shape opinion.
But Facebook's reputation has certainly taken a further hit, as it continues to struggle with similar allegations in other countries. And the storm that is brewing is just the latest in a series of controversies that have marred Facebook's reputation in India, a lucrative market where it hopes to expand.
The company has previously been accused of doing too little to curb fake news and rumours, including those on WhatsApp that were linked to public lynching of some people. And before that, its plan to offer free internet to Indians was stopped by the government after a public outcry alleged that it violated net neutrality.
India's IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad wrote a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday, accusing its employees of ""abusing"" PM Modi and other senior cabinet ministers.
He also said that he had learnt that Facebook had made a ""concerted effort"" to reduce the BJP's reach in the run up to the 2019 election.
The main opposition Congress party has also written to Mr Zuckerberg, accusing his company of ""thwarting the rights and values India's founding leaders had sacrificed their lives for"".
A second letter said the party was considering ""legislative and judicial action"" to make sure ""a foreign company cannot continue to cause social disharmony""."
"In September 1962, American author and conservationist Rachel Carson published Silent Spring. The book’s shocking portrayal of the lethal consequences of the infamous pesticides, such as DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), sparked nationwide outrage and was instrumental in its banning. But recent research from colleagues at Royal Holloway and I shows that almost 60 years on, regulators still haven’t learnt their lessons – and are still approving potentially harmful pesticides that threaten the wildlife on which healthy crops rely. Silent Spring begins with a tale of a fictional village in America that has been ravaged by agricultural insecticides. Carson vividly describes a “strange stillness” as feeding stations once commonly visited by garden birds now lie deserted, and blooming apple trees that no longer receive frequent visits from bees. The book gives numerous examples of how this fictional village was becoming a reality across the world, and highlighted how exposure to then widely used DDT could be fatal for birds, fish and insects – and as a result, threaten many of our food systems. Carson’s elegant, convincing and urgent portrayal of how this and similar pesticides were influencing our environment shook people and governments into action. The chemicals were banned across the world, and pesticide companies are now required to rigorously demonstrate that licensed chemicals do not have lethal consequences for wildlife. Agriculture still required crop protection though, and in the early 1990s neonicotinoid insecticides arrived. Neonicotinoids – or neonics, as they are commonly known – are extremely helpful for farmers. Neonics can be used as a seed coating and will afford the whole plant protection throughout its life, reducing the number of spray treatments crops require and lowering any risks to humans and vertebrate wildlife. Neonics are now the most commonly used insecticide group in the world – but while they’re an improvement on DDT, they’re by no means harmless. Because they protect the whole plant, they also contaminate the nectar and pollen of treated crops and wildflowers. A decade of research subsequently demonstrated that neonics can negatively affect bee foraging, learning, memory, brood care, larval development and egg laying. Whilst these effects are not lethal, they can have subtle, but significant impacts on the health on individual bees, which in the case of social bees, such as bumblebees, can severely impair colony health. As a result, in 2018 the European Union banned the outdoor agricultural use of three common neonics that are known to harm bees, and other pollinators. However, the requirement for a pesticide that affords whole-plant protection remained strong and a few years ago, a new pesticide called sulfoxaflor became the latest attempt to address that need. With a similar action to neonics, it has now been licensed for use in more than 80 countries around the world - including many that still allow the use of neonics. Unfortunately, in 2018 colleagues at Royal Holloway and I found evidence that sulfoxaflor exposure can reduce the number of males and queens produced by bumblebee colonies by up to 54%. This research, published in Nature, demonstrated for the first time that sulfoxaflor can have negative impacts on bumblebees. Now, our most recent research has demonstrated that sulfoxaflor exposure can reduce egg laying by up to 31%, even at the low levels of exposure that bumblebees could experience within agricultural environments. These results are yet to be replicated in the wild, but the evidence suggests that sulfoxaflor could be just as harmful to pollinators as neonicotinoids. So after two previous high-profile regulatory failures how did sulfoxaflor get licensed for use without a true understanding of its potential impact on pollinators? When neonics were first licensed for agricultural use we weren’t aware of the harm they caused, because while the fallout from DDT required producers to rigorously demonstrate that insecticides do not have lethal effects before being licensed, the same was not true for many “sublethal” effects. That is, harms that aren’t fatal in themselves, but can still severely compromise the health of a species or ecosystem.

      Pesticide safety research shouldn't be left to the chemical companies that make them


 To this day, insecticides can still be licensed without their potential sublethal impacts on pollinators being fully assessed. Testing is limited, and only tends to happen later in the regulatory process – by which time chemicals might already be in use. Furthermore, if toxicity experiments at the start of the regulatory process suggest that a chemical is not lethal to bees, then assessments of sublethal effects might not take place at all. What’s more, of the assessments that are carried out, most only test honeybees. Little attention is paid to other wild pollinators such as bumblebees and solitary bees, which are also vital in supporting healthy ecosystems and ensuring that crops continue to yield food. Sulfoxaflor is just one newly emerging insecticide that is being licensed for use, and others may also have sublethal impacts that aren’t fully understood. In order to truly protect wildlife and safeguard pollination, regulators and policy makers must learn from our recent history and consider the potential sublethal consequences of insecticides on pollinators by default – before licences are granted. Failure to do so could result in another “silent spring” – and if the images evoked by Carson are anything to go by, that won’t be good news for anyone.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new social sciences paper by Kaiser & Rhomberg on climate skepticism in Germany titled “Questioning the Doubt: Climate Skepticism in German Newspaper Reporting on COP17” has just appeared in the journal Environmental Communication.
The abstract reads (my emphasis)
“Despite numerous international studies on climate change, there is skepticism in the media and it is prominent in public opinion polls. This article focuses in particular on the framing of climate skepticism in Germany, a country that, in the main, is said to be convinced about climate change. By using a two-step content analysis of 379 news articles (print and online) we demonstrate that climate skepticism is present in German news media reporting on the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP17) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Durban, South Africa. We identify two overarching skepticism frames: skepticism about the phenomenon of climate change and about climate science. Our analysis further shows that climate skepticism is not exclusive to a specific political ideology, even though a newspaper ideology may influence how skeptical frames are being evaluated.”
Sadly, the paper’s biased tone is one of viewing climate science skepticism as being a threat that needs the attention of public policy. It writes in the conclusion (my emphasis):
“Also more global research on climate change skepticism is needed (especially in South America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia and to some extent Asia) to further understand what arguments are used to hinder the global fight against dangerous climate change (Schäfer & Schlichting, 2014).”
Here Kaiser and Rhomberg are running along with the academic herd, accepting the IPCC science at face value without question. Both openly and uncritically accept all the campus chanting that the skeptics are wrong. This blind groupthink is the sorrowful state of how academia works today in Germany.

If the evening of Nov. 4 provided an electrifying moment for conservatives, it came when it emerged that Republicans were going to win tough races not just in states like Iowa and North Carolina — let’s face it, winning states like those is no big deal in a strong GOP year — but also in some of the most passionately Democratic corners of the Northeast. Massachusetts, home of Harvard liberalism, where the share of voters who are registered Republicans stands at a frankly pathetic 11 percent, chose as its governor Charlie Baker, a businessman whose resume includes a stint at Boston’s Pioneer Institute, a free‐​market think tank. Maryland, long known as a strongly Democratic state thanks in part to strong minority demographics and high rates of government employment, elected an unapologetic conservative of its own, businessman Larry Hogan.



This was a genuine feat for Republicans: With the possible exception of California, no major part of the country is as resistant to their message as the Northeast. Democratic White House candidates have swept the region’s 11 states for the past six elections in a row, the only exception being Al Gore’s narrow 2000 loss in New Hampshire. Only three of the region’s 22 senators are Republicans, not much higher than the number of declared socialists (one). Democrats control most of the local legislatures, sometimes by margins that are almost comical, as in Massachusetts where they outnumber Republicans 34–6 in the upper house and 125–35 in the lower. Not a single Republican currently serves as an elected attorney general in the Northeast. If Baker and Hogan can win here, the thought goes, maybe the right kind of Republicans can win anywhere.



At the same time, not a few conservatives around TV sets in Dallas, Phoenix and Chantilly, Va., were feeling perhaps a bit of dread at the thought: Here come more Northeastern Republicans. Every conservative seems to know two things about Northeastern Republicans. One is that no matter how tough or hardcore they may seem, you invariably find in them a spot that’s a bit … squishy. Maybe they’re tough as can be on tax cuts or crime; maybe there’s nothing Establishment about them. But there will be some streak of environmentalism or internationalism, some disinclination to get into big fights over social issues, something borne of compromising with Democrats or caring too much about their good opinion. And that’s squishy, right?



The other thing every conservative knows is that every second or third Northeastern Republican you run into on the street wants to run for president. That describes two of today’s front‐​runners, Mitt Romney and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, plus one from not long ago, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and one who actually served, George H.W. Bush. Soon after the November election, as if two Northeastern governors were not enough for primary voters to choose from, both former New York Gov. George Pataki and former Maryland Gov. Robert Ehrlich made it known that they, too, were available for Oval Office consideration. Although analyst Larry Sabato ranked Pataki and Ehrlich as “seventh tier” candidates, which sounds like something out of Dante, it seemed to confirm that Northeastern Republican governors were once again, in their own way, having a moment.



Let’s agree at once that the “squish” talk is unfair. (For one reason, GOP officials from every state in the union wimp out regularly on Republican principle, and yes, that includes Texas.) But there is something ideologically different about the Northeast. More of the elected Republicans are not social conservatives, and those who are tend to keep a low profile about it in their home campaigns; the big exception is former Sen. Rick Santorum, who left office after a decisive 59–41 dunking from Pennsylvania voters in 2006.





With the possible exception of California, no major part of the country is as resistant to their message as the Northeast.



But it’s not just their ideologies that are different; it’s also their biographies. When these candidates come to national notice, it is usually by holding a single office, governor (you might throw in the governor‐​like post of New York City mayor, which would tend to confirm the rule). Both before and after serving as chief executives in government, they have trouble finding suitable positions in elected office. Their springboard to prominence often consists of holding jobs seen as nonpolitical, especially business person and prosecutor. Why these patterns, and what do they mean for their candidacies?



To find the true founder of Northeastern Republicanism, says political veteran and historian Al Felzenberg, you need to go back all the way to Thomas Dewey, who served three successful terms as governor in New York between 1943 and 1954. While these days Dewey is in danger of being remembered in the history books only as the “man who lost to Truman” in 1948, he was among the key political figures of his era, a massively successful prosecutor and corruption fighter — a theme that will recur — before tackling politics. As rival to Ohio’s Robert Taft, Dewey became known as the leader of the GOP’s Eastern Establishment wing, espousing a kind of centrist business conservatism that endorsed a larger role for government than the Taft people could stomach in areas like state aid to education, while still paying close attention to thrift and honesty in government, tax competitiveness and business climate.



Dewey opposed — unsuccessfully, in the end — the eventual realignment of the two national political parties along ideological lines, said Felzenberg, who has served in federal and state governments and whose books include a biography of former New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean. Dewey’s view of a successful national party, Felzenberg says, was that it “needs some people who are out of step with the national party but in step with their states.” He was also among the first to articulate the distinction between national and state issues, and the opening thus given parties to differentiate their own appeal, so as to reach voters who might be ready to hear a Republican message at the state level but not yet at the national, or vice versa.



Deweyism, if you want to call it that, gave rise to many successors. The most visible for many years was the strain of liberal Republicanism represented by former New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. Rockefeller’s followers threw out Dewey’s fiscal conservatism — often they were happy to outspend the Democrats — and quarreled more bitterly and openly with the emergent Goldwater conservatives from the West and South. But as party realignment proceeded, this style of Republican liberalism lumbered toward extinction. Ambitious liberals correctly saw that their future lay in the Democratic Party, while GOP primary voters in the Northeast wanted candidates who were more recognizably conservative. As the once‐​numerous breed of truly liberal Republicans in the U.S. Senate passed from the scene — Jacob Javits of New York, Clifford Case of New Jersey, Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, Lowell Weicker of Connecticut — none took their places.



Yet Dewey had purposely made his grand political organization big enough to house many types of Republican. Less often reported is that Dewey youth activism also gave a start to such figures as F. Clifton White and William Rusher, key organizers of Goldwater Republicanism and the modern conservative movement.



It also spun off what might be termed a prosecutorial tradition, in which busting corruption in big cities served as a qualification for high political office. When William Weld ran for governor of Massachusetts in 1990, his track record included a five‐​year stint as lead federal prosecutor for the state, with a big emphasis on public corruption that resulted in numerous convictions and guilty pleas at Boston’s City Hall. Weld had been recommended for the U.S. attorney position by an up‐​and‐​coming young lawyer in the Reagan administration named Rudy Giuliani and in turn became Giuliani’s superior when the administration called Weld to Washington to head the Justice Department’s criminal division.



Giuliani himself by then had won national fame by indicting the heads of the five organized crime families of New York as a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, and he went on to be elected mayor of New York City in 1993, serving for two terms. A few years later, between 2002 and 2008, U.S. Attorney Chris Christie took down dozens of New Jersey officials of both parties in corruption investigations, including state senators and county executives. The next year, he was elected governor.



The corruption for which many Northeastern cities are known gives prosecutors an opening. Even when the players are totally clean, however, the political style among Northeastern Democrats tends to reward going along to get along. The best way to achieve higher office is to put in time holding lower office, with glad‐​handing elected jobs preferred. Being an incumbent can shade into a lifelong career. The candidates this system produces can come across as tired: In waiting their turn on the inside and not making waves, they’ve bought into all the little existing arrangements.



Some successful Northeastern Republicans do come up through retail politics; Pataki, for example, started as mayor of Peekskill and state legislator. But an outsider stance often works at least as well. Wall Streeter and business executive Lewis Lehrman self‐​financed a campaign in 1982 and came from obscurity to within two points of knocking off Mario Cuomo. Mitt Romney may now be seen as Establishment with a capital E, but in 2002, fresh off his Olympics success, he rode into state politics in a classic insurgency campaign. If Democratic nominee Shannon O’Brien got elected, he charged, she would govern behind closed doors with the senate president and speaker of the house as a cozy Beacon Hill “gang of three.” It worked. “People wanted a check and balance,” says Charley Manning, a longtime GOP consultant in Massachusetts.



In truth, many of these outsider figures, while not holding actual elective office, had long been active in politics or government service. Romney, like several others, had grown up in a political family, Christie had tried unsuccessfully to win office in Morris County, Charlie Baker and Larry Hogan had served in earlier state administrations, and so forth. But it’s the virtue of necessity: When you live in a place where it’s hard for you to get elected in the first place, at least you can offer the appeal of a new broom.



Besides an independent position outside the gridlock of interest‐​group dealings, Northeastern Republicans running for governor typically appeal to competence. If a snowstorm shuts the highways, if a natural disaster means calling out the National Guard, wouldn’t you rather have a tough‐​minded businessman in charge? Curiously (or maybe not), both Charlie Baker and Larry Hogan last year were given huge openings by exactly the same failings of competence on the part of Democratic administrations in their states, namely the botched launch of Obamacare enrollment plans that cost hundreds of millions of dollars and came out unusable. Other fiascoes included a crime lab scandal and failures at the state children’s agency in Massachusetts, and the Baltimore jail scandal in Maryland. It was the perfect opportunity for both Baker, who in private life had turned around the large Harvard Pilgrim health organization, and Hogan to emerge as the adult in the room.



Baker was known as not much of a social conservative to begin with, while Hogan’s handling of the issue was crucial to his success. Shortly after the Republican primary, he announced that he considered social issues off the table as far as new legislation was concerned, as was gay marriage (“The voters of Maryland have already decided this issue.”).



Democrats then spent much of the campaign trying to draw him back into these controversies, trying to pin him down on whether he disliked the state’s new gun‐​control law or would try to change laws on women’s health. Hogan declined to play, noting that these weren’t issues he was campaigning on and promptly turning the discussion back to the state’s business climate and the many tax hikes the incumbent Democrats had put through. (The Baltimore Sun did not endorse Hogan, but conceded the effectiveness of his “laser‐​like focus on matters of taxes and spending.”) When Democrats insisted he take a stand on the Supreme Court’s Hobby Lobby decision, Hogan cheerfully explained that it “doesn’t have anything to do with being Maryland governor,” not the answer they wanted to hear.



Besides neutralizing the social issues, almost everything else had to go right for Hogan, and it did. Unlike Baker, who had the resources to match and indeed beat the war chest of opponent Martha Coakley, Hogan knew he would be drastically outspent, most outside donors having written off the race as unwinnable, and he took advantage of the state’s rarely‐​used public financing option.



The results confirmed that something new was going on in Maryland. (I pretend to no objectivity about Hogan’s win, having been a volunteer in his campaign.) Democrats managed to get decent turnout from black voters for candidate Anthony Brown, who would have been the state’s first African‐​American governor, but turnout collapsed in liberal Montgomery County. Meanwhile, Hogan not only swept many blue‐​collar Baltimore suburbs with a history of often voting for Democrats, but also managed to win affluent Howard County, which Obama had carried by more than 20 points over Mitt Romney two years earlier.



According to news station WBAL, “some see Hogan’s win as the biggest upset in the country,” a boast that seems not unreasonable given the numbers involved. Ad spending wound up breaking more than 2‐​to‐​1 against Hogan — buys by both parties’ governors associations helped make it less lopsided — while direct spending favored Brown 4 to 1. Perhaps the most astonishing figure, again from WBAL: Hogan had an average of 16 staffers on his payroll, Brown 207. It didn’t save him.



For Republicans in these states, winning office is only the first challenge. “Most of them get elected due to utter disgust or anger with the Democrats, not because their state’s citizens truly want Republican principles,” observes Suzanne Israel Tufts, an attorney and campaign veteran in New York. Then the conflicts begin: “Being a strong leader means sticking with their principles, but often that and representing their electorate pull in two different directions,” Tufts says.



To be sure, most do enjoy a genuine honeymoon period. “Republican governors in the Northeast have tended, maybe more than your typical governor, to have a lot of success in their first year and then backslide,” notes Dan McLaughlin, an attorney and editor at RedState. The word backsliding often comes up in connection with the 12‐​year service of New York’s George Pataki, who scored a string of accomplishments — fiscal upgrades, tough‐​on‐​crime legislation, a turnaround of the once‐​remedial City University of New York — but at length got regularly outmaneuvered by his legislature, which did not share his conflict‐​avoidant disposition. Connecticut’s Jodi Rell, like Pataki a champion at the polls, was widely liked personally but proved no match for her state’s high‐​spending legislature.



These governors need to pick their battles, and many of their victories come by picking issues such as education reform, on which Democrats may themselves be divided. Their role in budgeting is often a key — many have line‐​item vetoes or other relatively strong fiscal powers. William Weld in Massachusetts used a fiscal crunch as the occasion for a meaningful welfare reform that is still remembered today, explaining, “We want to make the safety net a trampoline as opposed to a hammock.”



Even with the occasional disappointing exception, these governors generally deliver on the promise of curbing taxes and spending in comparison to their local Democratic counterparts. The Cato Institute, with which I’m affiliated, issues a report card every two years rating the nation’s governors on their success in holding down spending and tax burdens. Over the past 18 years (1996–2014), Northeastern Republican governors have cumulatively gotten scores of A, B or C 39 times, and D or F only 7 times. Their regional Democratic counterparts, on the other hand, have scored A, B or C 17 times, and D or F a miserable 36 times.



And some triumphs happen just because someone with the right instincts was in the right place at the right time. Northwestern law professor and Federalist Society member John McGinnis says Pataki’s “most impressive act” was one that was hardly noticed at the time and yielded no electoral benefits, namely his appointment to the state’s highest court of Robert Smith, who “became one of the great state court jurists of his time.”



For the most part, the Republican governors also escape serious corruption scandals. (Connecticut’s John Rowland was a painful exception.) The less readily defined phenomenon of patronage and cronyism is harder both to measure and to guard against, especially in a political environment that regularly requires cutting deals across party lines. Christie has stirred national press attention by his close alliance with South Jersey figure George Norcross III, routinely described as the state’s most important Democratic boss. Even Bill Weld in Massachusetts, as immaculate as they come, spent years facing off against wily State Senate President William Bulger, a patronage king who had so succeeded in stuffing the MBTA payroll with his pals that it was nicknamed “Mr. Bulger’s Transit Administration.” Weld blinked, or so his critics say, and finally got Bulger out of the legislature by making him president of the state university.



Unlike Tom Dewey, as one observer notes, modern GOP governors in liberal states “don’t leave much behind” by way of organization. Winning office often requires them to keep a certain distance from a party less popular than they are, which is one reason they often start out having strained relations with major officeholders or activists within their own party (in a notorious slight, Giuliani actually endorsed Mario Cuomo over George Pataki).



Jumping to the U.S. Senate, a common career move for governors, basically never works for Republicans in the Northeast because Democrats long since learned to nationalize federal races there. So while almost every successful GOP governor gets quoted in the press talking up a possible race for Senate, hardly any of them follow through. One who did was Weld, who challenged incumbent Democrat John Kerry in 1996 and, though wildly popular as governor, lost badly.



With no obvious place to go in state politics, it’s less surprising that Northeastern Republicans so often quit the statehouse for jobs out of town. Weld quit in the middle of his second term to take an ambassadorial appointment that didn’t work out, and his successor, Paul Cellucci, did the same, quitting midterm to become ambassador to Canada. Christine Whitman quit the New Jersey governorship to become administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President George W. Bush. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, after winning landslide re‐​election, left midterm to become the first director of Homeland Security.



Which may shed light on why so many of these Republicans run for president: Unless someone happens to offer them a cabinet seat, where else are they supposed to go? And yet nearly always in doing so, like a diver coming up to the surface and getting the bends, they are pained by the need to explain, adjust or forget the positions that worked so well for them under the different pressures of the Northeast.



Are they dissimulating and just saying what they think conservatives in Iowa want to hear? Or, freed at last from the need to represent constituents in Cambridge, Brooklyn and Fort Lee, are they finally letting their real views come through? And either way, are they setting themselves up, in an age of YouTube, for endless teasing at the hands of rivals documenting how their utterances have changed?



Odds are good that over the next couple of years we’ll have some chances to find out.

By Christopher Monckton of Brenchley
In response to an earlier posting showing a picture of me with a camel, George E. Smith asked “Where did you get yourself the horse of a different color? Is it as difficult to ride as it looks? But it does suit you, and is a bit more elegant than floating down on a parachute.” In answer to Mr Smith, here is my account of camel-riding at the Doha Climate Conference in December 2012, with acknowledgements to CFACT.com, where the article, and some of the pictures, first appeared.

The climate camel – going nowhere, uncomfortably
From Monckton of Arabia 
Somewhere in the desert, Qatar
A camel, as Winston Churchill used to say, is an animal designed by committee. The climate scare, like a camel, is an animal designed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Trying to ride a camel for the first time can be what Kai Lung would have called “a gravity-removing event”. Under the rustling palm-trees by the balmy shore of the Gulf, I approached my first camel, Aziz, with that intrepid curiosity that built a great Empire.

CFACT fitted a carbon sequestration device to this camel to cut its CO2 emissions. 
My lovely wife says animals and children are attracted to me – because I have never grown up. I addressed Aziz with an elegant quatrain from Fitzgerald’s perfect translation of the world’s most charming drinking-song, the Rubaiyat of Umar Khayyam:
Awake! for Morning in the bowl of Night
Has flung the stone that puts the stars to flight –
And lo, the Hunter of the East has caught
The Sultan’s turret in a noose of light.
Aziz listened politely, nuzzled me in a friendly way, sniffed my hand thoughtfully, slobbered over it liberally, and then directed a long nostril at my face to get better acquainted. I stroked his neck, wiping the slobber off on it, and he burbled contentedly.
Or so I thought. His handler, with a rapid “chk-chk-chk”, brought him down to his knees and told me to climb on quick. Not quick enough. Before I was halfway into the cloth-covered saddle, Aziz lurched to his feet, flinging me into an elegant and spectacular parabolic trajectory. Upon re-entry, I achieved terminal velocity and crashed firmly into a convenient sand-dune, executing a well-judged judo fall of which my Staff-Sergeant would have been proud. I remembered to go completely limp at the last instant. Sand sprayed in all directions and a new peninsula was created on the Gulf shore.

Umar Khayyam, poet, philosopher, mathematician and astronomer in 11th-century Persia
As I tottered to my feet, dented but unbowed, the two camel-handlers and my three friends were in such fits of unbecoming laughter that I forgot to emulate William the Conqueror by grabbing a fistful of sand and saying, “See, I hold all Araby in my hand” (or at least that part of it that had not been flung into the Gulf by my impact).
Aziz was chk-chked back on to his knees and, this time, I was quicker, leaping into the saddle before we headed skyward.
The object of the exercise was to obtain four camels, affix to their flanks bold placards bearing the words “STOP” “CLIMATE” “HYPE” and the “CFACT” logo of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, which does not believe warmer weather is a bad thing. The idea was to get a suitably atmospheric photograph of our simple message against the backdrop of the verdant palms, the golden sands, the azure sea and the cerulean sky.
This, too, was a gravity-removing exercise, with which my staff-Sergeant would not have been at all impressed. “Your job in the field is to take charge,” he would holler. “If you don’t, somebody else will. Or, worse, nobody else will.”
Among the dunes and the flies, nobody took charge. First we got all four camels on to their knees and stuck the placards on. Then we realized that some placards were on the wrong flank of some of the camels. Then, when we’d gotten all of the placards on the same flank, the message read: “HYPE CLIMATE: STOP CFACT”, which was not at all what we were trying to say.
Meanwhile, back at the Doha conference center, the climate camels were lumbering uncomfortably in all directions and getting nowhere.
The usual factions were maneuvering:
Ø The European tyranny-by-clerk, which needs global warming to be a problem because it can then arrogate yet more centralizing powers to itself, yea, even unto the last fluorescent light-bulb. The EU will sign anything, because the unelected Kommissars who have the sole right to propose its laws do not have to care what the people think, and they want more central power in their hands. They are also advising the envious UN on how to grab all political power by stealth – a treaty here, a treaty there until suddenly democracy has been stolen away forever.
Ø The BRICS bloc – Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa – which is not really a bloc at all. All of these emerging nations cannot afford to allow the vicious policies of the anti-development Greens to interfere with their mission to expand the use of fossil fuels to give their people affordable electricity, lift them out of poverty, and thus benefit the environment by stabilizing their populations. They will sign any treaty that does not bind them to limit their emissions.
Ø The fly-specks: The small island states and other economically tiny nations in the undeveloped world. Their ambition is to extract as much money from the wealthy West as they can get.
Ø The unfooled: Canada, Japan, and New Zealand, who have stayed clear of the now-defunct Kyoto Protocol, which will unavoidably expire December 31 because there was no agreement to extend it by October 3, as its own terms require.
Ø The fools: In this category, Australia stands alone. Its absurd carbon dioxide tax is almost 50 times more expensive than letting global warming happen and adapting in a focused way to its consequences.
Ø The United States: Also in a category of its own, Obama’s U.S. is a house deeply divided. The “Democrats” – more like Communists these days – will do whatever it takes to destroy all (such as fossil-fuel corporations) who fund their Republican opponents. Also, they will sign any treaty calculated to wreck the economy of the West. The Republicans, however, will not. No climate treaty will be agreed to by the U.S. Senate, where Senators Inhofe, Hatch, Vitter, and others have spoken out clearly and consistently against climate-extremism.
Today, His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, Emir of Qatar, addressed the conference. He announced that Qatar now aims to generate one-sixth of its electrical power by solar power, reducing its dependency upon the oil that makes it – per capita – one of the wealthiest nations on Earth.

Monckton, in the traditional dress presented to him by a prominent Qatari businessman, explains climate change to a baffled reporter from The Times.
The real reason for the Emir’s switch to solar power is economic, not climatological. He provides free electricity to his nation, and every gallon of costly oil that he burns for his people is a gallon he cannot sell. Since he has hundreds of thousands of acres of empty sand available, soaked in sunshine more than 300 days a year, solar power (though more expensive than oil in the short term) may one day prove cheaper than oil.
The Emir also confirmed the hopes expressed by the president of the conference, Abdullah bin Hamad al Attiyah, that a real deal would be struck here in Qatar.
However, the climate camels are all heading in opposite directions, and bucking off their riders. Will there be a deal? Yes, of course there will. There always is. The triumphant announcement of success after the talks go into an extra day is now a routine element in the choreography of these stage-managed farces.
If they really want to make the world laugh, all they have to do is film Monckton of Arabia trying to ride a camel.
Back in the desert, we were still trying to get the camels to behave. We told the handlers to rearrange the camels in the right order, but their English was no better than our Arabic, and anyway we were all shouting conflicting orders at them, and the camels had their own ideas of where they wanted to go. The Three Stooges would have done things better than us.
This pantomime went on for half an hour, until I took a command decision to arrange the camels in single file, sit them down, and then affix the placards to their flanks with duct tape, reading from left to right.
“Never go into the field without duct tape,” Staff would holler. “If it moves, salute it. If it doesn’t move, paint it. If it wobbles, fix it with duct tape.”
The Arabs, however, read from right to left, and one of my friends – a photographer – thought the photo would look more artistic that way around.
Later that millennium, we got the camels and the placards in the right places: “STOP CLIMATE HYPE – CFACT”. We took our money shot and it is now safely on the record for all time:
The moving finger writes and, having writ,
Moves on, nor all thy piety nor wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a line,
Nor all thy tears wash out a word of it.
Satisfied, we went for an uncomfortable but triumphant ride on the camels in the kindly breeze, with Aziz tossing his head upward from time to time to snatch a mouthful of leaves from a passing palm-tree. But not before I had briefly become one of the first Brits in space.

The medium is the message – er – or something

"MOSCOW  —   Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s president, hardly misses a chance to talk tough on terrorism, once famously saying he would find Chechen terrorists sitting in the “outhouse” and “rub them out. ” He and President Trump, notably dismissive of political correctness, would seem to have found common language on fighting terrorism  —   except on one point of, well, language. During his campaign, Mr. Trump associated Islam with terrorism and criticized President Obama for declining to use the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism. ” However, Mr. Putin, whom Mr. Trump so openly admires for his toughness, has, for more than a decade, done exactly what President Obama did. He has never described terrorists as “Islamic” and has repeatedly gone out of his way to denounce such language. “I would prefer Islam not be mentioned in vain alongside terrorism,” he said at a news conference in December, answering a question about the Islamic State, a group he often refers to as “the   Islamic State,” to emphasize a distinction with the Islamic religion. At the opening of a mosque in Moscow in 2015, Mr. Putin spoke of terrorists who “cynically exploit religious feelings for political aims. ” In the Middle East, Mr. Putin said at the mosque opening, “terrorists from the   Islamic State are compromising a great world religion, compromising Islam, sowing hatred, killing people, including clergy,” and added that “their ideology is built on lies and blatant distortions of Islam. ” He was careful to add, “Muslim leaders are bravely and fearlessly using their own influence to resist this extremist propaganda. ” And, this being Russia, the failure to adhere to this   interpretation is a prosecutable offense: The Russian news media are required by law to note in any mention of the Islamic State that the reference is to a banned terrorist organization of that name, lest it be misconstrued as denigrating religion. Mr. Putin does not take this stance to soothe the feelings of Western liberals, a group he dismisses as hypocritical in any case. “Putin prides himself on Russia’s intelligence capabilities,” the Brookings Institution wrote in a study of the early formation of his counterterrorism policies. “Russian leaders think they know their enemy,” and it is not the governments of majority Muslim countries such as Iraq and Iran, or the majority of Muslims living in Russia. Instead, Russian counterterrorism strategy focused on financing and militarily backing moderate Muslim leaders, with the breakthrough in the Chechen war coming when the region’s imam, Akhmad Kadyrov, allied with the Russian military. His son, Ramzan Kadyrov, leads the region today. While embracing Islamic leaders as a centerpiece of its counterterrorism strategy, however, the Kremlin did not avoid drawing distinctions along religious lines. The Russian government backed the Kadyrov family’s campaign to revive traditional Sufi Islam in Chechnya as a counterweight to the more austere Wahhabi denomination professed by many separatists. The Wahhabi strain was outlawed in another restive, predominantly Muslim province, Dagestan, and its adherents are persecuted in Russia, rights groups say. Still, the alliance with moderate Islamic religious leaders became important in pacifying Chechnya and other North Caucasus regions, which have ceased to pose a serious security threat to Russia. “Putin rules a multiconfessional country,” Orkhan Dzhemal, a commentator on Islamic affairs, said in a telephone interview, noting that in the United States, in contrast, Muslims are not a powerful political force. “He cannot say ‘Islamic terrorism’ for a simple reason. He doesn’t want to alienate millions of Russians. ” The term preferred in Russian political parlance is “international terrorism. ” In a phone call on Friday, President Trump and Mr. Putin discussed “real cooperation” in fighting terrorist groups in Syria. They could agree on an enemy. But the Kremlin statement described a “priority placed on uniting forces in the fight against the main threat  —   international terrorism. ”"

In all too many minds, the relevance of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is much in doubt. The failure of the 11th Ministerial Conference of the WTO last December in Buenos Aires to complete any new multilateral or other agreements — or even to agree on the traditional declaration concluding the conference — has left many wondering if this is the beginning of the end for the WTO.



Expectations were low in Buenos Aires, and the ministers fulfilled those low expectations. Complicating matters, and further stirring doubts, are the continued assaults of the Trump administration on the WTO, both verbally and in the conduct of U.S. trade policy. Traditional U.S. leadership at the WTO is missing, as members struggle to find a way forward toward further trade liberalization and international economic integration.



Yet, despite the seemingly bleak assessments, some see not the beginning of the end for the WTO, but the end of the beginning. There were clear signs on several fronts in Buenos Aires that WTO members are ready to turn toward “plurilateral” solutions on trade that could, in time, become fully multilateral solutions. Multilateral trade agreements must always be the ultimate goal for the WTO. But there is more than one way to get to multilateralism. Starting with agreements among some, but not yet all, WTO members and then gradually transforming them into fully global agreements appears to be the most promising path to multilateralism in the 21st century.



Digital trade, services trade, fisheries subsidies, environmental goods, investment facilitation, and other issues are all ripe for negotiation and agreement. By taking a plurilateral approach toward multilateralism, the members of the WTO can ensure that this is the end of the beginning — and not the beginning of the end — for the World Trade Organization.



Was the 11th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) last December the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning for the WTO? Trade negotiators came away from the Buenos Aires, Argentina, conference wondering about the future of the rules‐​based world trading system. The headlines following the conference were not encouraging. One publication proclaimed, “The WTO May Have Reached Its Breaking Point.”1 Another read, “It’s the End of the WTO as We Know It — and Trump Feels Fine.”2 Perhaps the most optimistic of all the headline assessments was that of _The Economist_ : “The WTO Remains Stuck in Its Rut.”3 In the public’s mind, and in all too many political and diplomatic circles, the centrality of the World Trade Organization to global trade is much in doubt.



Expectations going into the conference were low, and — by and large — those low expectations were fulfilled. The conference failed to produce solutions that the world very much needs to long‐​festering problems. There was no multilateral outcome at all. Members could not even agree on the customary conference‐​concluding declaration. Many considered it a major achievement that the U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, deigned to attend the conference — although he left early after lecturing the other delegates largely on all that he and President Donald Trump think is wrong with the WTO. The one hoped‐​for multilateral outcome — a long‐​sought agreement limiting fisheries subsidies that support overfishing and illegal fishing — failed once again. And the proposed plurilateral agreement freeing trade in environmental goods that had come so close to closure the year before was barely mentioned in Buenos Aires.



In a world threatened by the seeming retreat of the United States and other countries from the institutions of international cooperation toward the protectionism and mercantilism of “economic nationalism,” uncertainty about the future of the WTO is cause for grave concern. This concern has only been heightened by Trump’s imposition of new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and his announced intention of imposing tariffs on other products. The purported basis of some of these tariffs is national security, but underlying all these measures is the accusation that China (and others) are cheating on trade rules. By acting unilaterally on this issue, however, the United States is circumventing the WTO rules that require all members to take all their trade‐​related disputes falling within the scope of the treaty to WTO dispute settlement for a multilateral judgment before taking any trade action.4



According to Trump, the WTO is a “catastrophe” and has been a “disaster” for the United States.5 At the very least, his tumultuous trade policy signals a turn away from the WTO as the fulcrum of world trade. Globally, a failure by the WTO to continue to provide the framework for rules‐​based trade would lead to a dangerous accumulation of economic disruption and confrontation as more and more countries emulate the United States and fall back into self‐​defeating acts of trade restriction and trade discrimination of all kinds. The ongoing stalemate over updating the global trade rules, evidenced anew in Buenos Aires, only reinforces the inclination of many WTO members to look elsewhere for the solutions they need and does nothing to counter the growing forces against trade and against globalization that are fueling commercial confrontation.



At the same time, however, despite the failure of the ministerial conference to produce any multilateral outcome, there were some encouraging signs in Buenos Aires of systemic evolution on several fronts. Subsets of like‐​minded members pledged to proceed with plurilateral negotiations on a variety of pressing new issues, including digital trade, investment facilitation, disciplines for fossil‐​fuel subsidies, trade opportunities for micro‐, small‐, and medium‐​sized enterprises, and more.6 Even amid current U.S. hostility toward the WTO, a number of these pledges offer real promise. Indeed, in some — such as the initiative on digital trade — the United States seems likely to participate.



Although most of the global trade liberalization accomplished under the multilateral system since the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947 has been the product of consensus‐​based multilateral negotiating rounds, the WTO agreements permit — indeed, they encourage — alternative, plurilateral approaches to liberalization in which some, but not all, WTO members agree to move ahead first with new agreements to liberalize trade. If this is to be the end of the beginning — and not the beginning of the end — of the WTO, the momentum for pursuing such plurilateral deals within the WTO framework must be encouraged and harnessed to establish and modernize world trade rules and to continue to sustain the centrality of the World Trade Organization.



In considering the future of the WTO, it is necessary to understand the importance of multilateralism and nondiscrimination. Central to the success of the international trading system, which gradually evolved from the GATT in 1947 into the WTO in 1995, has been the overarching principle that international trade negotiators describe routinely — and sometimes almost reverently — as _“_ multilateralism _.”_ The logic of multilateralism applies to all kinds of international cooperation, but in trade the enduring goal of multilateralism is to act _globally_ to reduce trade barriers _globally._



This has long been accomplished within the WTO‐​based trading system through the working of one fundamental rule, the rule that requires most‐​favored‐​nation (MFN) treatment, an idea that dates back nearly a thousand years to innovations by the Baltic traders of the Hanseatic League. The WTO most‐​favored‐​nation rule is widely misstated and is even more widely misunderstood. It is thought by many to mean that in lowering a tariff or another barrier to international trade, one country will give the products of another country _more favorable_ treatment than it gives to those of all other countries. In fact, this basic rule of trade means precisely the opposite: products of every other country receive the _same_ trade treatment as products of the _most favored_ of all countries. The rule requiring MFN treatment forbids discrimination between and among the like traded products of other WTO members.



This fundamental trade principle is enshrined as a general obligation of all WTO members in the WTO agreements on goods and on services in the WTO treaty. Thus, whenever a concession on trade in a good or service is made by one WTO member to another, that same concession must be made to every other WTO member. In this way, the mutual reciprocity of trade concessions is “multilateralized,” meaning that all WTO members (and the entire world trading system) benefit from each and every trade concession. Through this mechanism, the reduction of trade barriers over the course of seven decades has been achieved globally. The gains from trade have thus been maximized again and again for all the participants in the system through the successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations conducted first by the GATT and now by the WTO. Through the working of the MFN rule, a multilateral agreement has vastly more potential to lower trade barriers and, thus, to increase trade and prosperity than will any single or series of bilateral or regional agreements.



The potential global economic payoff from continued reliance on the multilateral approach to trade liberalization could be considerable. World Bank models have suggested that a global free trade agreement “could add $5 trillion to the world’s GDP by 2020, $3 trillion of which would go to developing countries. And by the close of this century, such a deal could increase GDP by more than $100 trillion, with most of the gains accruing outside developed nations.”7 Moreover, beyond these numbers, an even greater economic payoff could result from the role of freer trade as a catalyst for necessary economic change. Global free trade would be the equivalent of a global tax cut and could help jump‐​start much of the modernization that is needed globally to meet the new challenges of the 21st century.



We are, of course, a long way from concluding a global free trade agreement. As ambitious as it was, the liberalization implicit in the Doha Round of multilateral negotiations did not begin to approach global free trade. But we are much closer than we were decades ago to global free trade because of our past adherence to the multilateral approach, which has long worked well for the trading system. Now, unfortunately, it does not. Now there are vastly more participants in the trading system and thus many more negotiators at the trading table. Now the economic and related interests of the participants vary more than ever before. And now, therefore, WTO members find it increasingly difficult to negotiate multilaterally under the procedures they have long followed.



Since 1947, multilateral trade negotiations have aimed to produce an outcome characterized as a “single undertaking” — a situation where nothing is agreed until every country taking part in the negotiations agrees on everything. Moreover, multilateral trade negotiations have long sought to achieve a consensus, meaning that nothing can be concluded if any one negotiating party formally objects.8 Now, though, it has become exceedingly difficult for the members to reach a consensus in a single undertaking. The Doha Round, launched in 2001, achieved virtually none of its objectives after 14 years of frustration and impasse.



Despite these real obstacles, the logic of multilateralism remains. When attainable, multilateral approaches to market access and to rules for trade are still the best way to boost world trade and the prosperity that follows. On some significant issues, such as the global market distortions caused by agricultural subsidies, only multilateral solutions are available. Plurilateral solutions will not work. Politically, it would be impossible for the United States to agree to cut its agricultural subsidies if the European Union were not subject to similar terms. And how could the United States and the European Union agree to agricultural subsidies cuts in a plurilateral deal if China were not subject to similar terms? And so on.



Furthermore, changing a rule of general application in the trading system in a less than fully multilateral way would pose fundamental problems. Take, for example, the “national treatment” rule, which forbids discrimination in favor of local producers over foreign producers of like imported products. What would happen to the flow of world trade if national treatment were changed in a plurilateral agreement to mean one thing for some countries and something entirely different for others? As a result, there would be something considerably less than the desired security and predictability for the overall WTO‐​based world trading system.9



On these and on some other issues relating to market access and trade rules, the only solutions are multilateral ones. But, on other issues, including many of the new and emerging 21st‐​century trade issues, there is another approach, one that can produce partial trade solutions now that are potentially preludes to multilateral solutions later.



Contrary to widespread perception, the multilateral agreement that established the WTO does not require that all WTO trade negotiations be conducted multilaterally. WTO members have _chosen_ to continue to pursue new trade obligations multilaterally, but they are not required to do so. An option provided by the WTO treaty is to pursue new trade obligations plurilaterally through negotiations among a self‐​selected subset of WTO members seeking the perceived economic advantages of agreements within the WTO rules framework that are “WTO‐​plus,” which add to existing obligations and afford additional benefits to those members that choose to accept the obligations by becoming parties to the agreements.10



Under the WTO treaty, the WTO‐​plus benefits of these plurilateral trade agreements can be provided in one of two ways. The agreements can be MFN, which means their benefits can be provided inclusively to all WTO members, including those that have not accepted the additional obligations of the multilateral agreement, as is the case with the WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA). Or the agreements can be non‐​MFN, which means their benefits can be provided exclusively only to those countries that negotiate and agree to comply with the additional obligations in the new agreements, as is the case with the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA).



The MFN approach to a plurilateral agreement among an ad _hoc_ and like‐​minded coalition of willing WTO members is more appealing if the agreement is a tariff‐​reducing market access agreement and if a critical mass of participants in the particular market sector in question is seen as having been assembled to agree to the plurilateral agreement, thus minimizing the potential effect of free riders who benefit from the agreement without adhering to its terms. This was the case with the ITA. The non‐​MFN approach is more appealing where the additional obligations are not conventional market access obligations and where the parties to the agreement do not constitute such a critical mass. This was the case with the GPA.



The shared expectation of many of us in the United States and elsewhere who helped establish the WTO was that such plurilateral approaches by like‐​minded WTO members desirous of deeper levels of liberalization and economic integration would be commonplace. We envisaged the WTO as a forum and as a framework for ongoing innovation in providing market access and devising world trade rules to accommodate and facilitate ongoing innovations in an ever‐​evolving world economy. We foresaw the new international institution called the World Trade Organization as addressing emerging trade issues through agreements relating to specific sectors of global commerce and to specific trade issues that — at least at the outset — would be less than fully multilateral.11



It is an understatement to say that not every suggested solution to a trade problem commands immediate universal acceptance. The fact is, very few such suggestions do. In the WTO, it almost always takes time to build a critical mass of countries to move a new idea ahead. It often takes experience to discern just how that idea _should_ move ahead. For some countries, there is, understandably, a natural reluctance to moving forward with new ideas without having the time and experience from which to have some notion of what will happen later.



One of the advantages of a plurilateral approach taken by some, but not all, WTO members in embracing a new idea in trade is that it provides a proving ground of trial and error within the rules‐​based framework of the WTO trading system. Ideas that fail can be abandoned. Ideas that work can be improved and scaled up over time to become part of fully multilateral agreements that bind all WTO members. In some ways, this approach resembles the traditional view of states in the United States as laboratories of democracy — as places where new ideas can be tried first locally and, if successful, adopted by other states and possibly at the national level.



The gradual evolution of the GATT into the WTO demonstrates the wisdom of plurilateralism. Several multilateral trade agreements in the WTO treaty — those dealing with antidumping, safeguards, subsidies, and technical regulations — began as plurilateral GATT codes that were accepted by some, but not all, GATT contracting parties. These codes only became fully multilateral with the establishment of the WTO. In the minds of those who anticipated a series of such plurilateral approaches by the WTO, the same incremental legal path would be pursued in numerous other areas of current and future global trade concern. At first this incrementalism happened: the inclusion of the GPA in the WTO treaty and the conclusion soon afterward of the ITA and the protocols on basic telecommunications services and on financial services. To many, this seemed to be the way forward for incrementally achieving the shared goal of more multilateralism.



But then came September 11, 2001. The 9th WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha, Qatar, which convened shortly after the attacks, saw the launch of the Doha Development Round. Almost out of habit, the conference was a single undertaking bound by the consensus rule. The negotiations continued off and on for 14 years until they ended — not with a bang, but with a whimper — at the convening of the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2015. The only notable negotiating success resulting even tangentially from the Doha Round occurred when WTO members pulled the issue of trade facilitation out of the Doha negotiations and concluded the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement separately and multilaterally in Bali, Indonesia, in 2013.



Failure, once again, to reach a multilateral outcome in Buenos Aires in December 2017 suggests that a course correction is urgently needed for the WTO.



Some WTO members have long been reluctant to support new plurilateral agreements, making it harder to conclude them as WTO agreements. For sound economic reasons, these reluctant members prefer the general — and generally bigger — payoff from multilateral deals. They are also hesitant to assume new obligations on top of those they already have. Sometimes they are unwilling even to permit other members to agree to new WTO obligations that they themselves do not wish to undertake for fear that, as has happened before, those new obligations will be negotiated without them and then eventually become fully multilateral. Not least, many developing countries are of the view that before agreeing to negotiate new agreements, they should get the benefits they feel they were promised, but have not yet received, from previous agreements.



In some respects, this reluctance is understandable. But a refusal, for whatever reason, to allow new plurilateral agreements to be concluded within the framework of the WTO only guarantees that the plurilateral undertakings of like‐​minded countries desirous of more ambitious trade liberalization and integration will occur outside the WTO. Developed countries, in particular, are eager to move ahead on many trade fronts. The reluctance of other WTO members to do so was a catalyst for the negotiations outside the WTO of such “megadeals” as the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP) among countries along the Pacific Rim and the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the United States and the European Union. All the participants in those negotiations are WTO members. Those negotiations could have — and should have — occurred within the WTO, but because the countries involved were unable to move ahead within the WTO, they sought to do so outside the WTO.



Negotiating these megadeals within the legal ambit of the WTO would have reduced the concern among nonparticipating WTO members that they would be locked out of these new trade arrangements. It would also have eliminated the geopolitical undertones that the new arrangements were intended for political reasons to exclude other WTO members. Plurilateral agreements within the WTO are open to all WTO members that choose to accept their obligations. With respect to the TPP, for example, the issue of whether it was intended to surround or isolate China would simply not have arisen; if the TPP were a non‐​MFN plurilateral agreement within the WTO, China (or any other WTO member) could join simply by agreeing to comply with the terms of the agreement.



Negotiating these megadeals and other regional arrangements within the WTO also would have helped minimize the growing concern that the proliferation of international trade arrangements outside the WTO threatens to undermine the basic nondiscrimination obligation of most‐​favored treatment that is at the core of the WTO. 12 Inclusive plurilaterals that are, by definition, MFN would, of course, perpetuate the MFN obligation. Exclusive plurilaterals that are non‐​MFN would initially be discriminatory, but they need not establish trade discrimination permanently. Rather, they could become ever closer to MFN and eventually fully MFN as more WTO members agree to their terms.



Moreover, had these negotiations been conducted within the WTO and aimed at establishing new plurilateral WTO agreements like the GPA and the ITA, disputes arising under their provisions would be subject to the WTO dispute settlement system. Thus, the parties to those new agreements would have had the benefit of both seasoned trade jurists and a body of trade jurisprudence that will otherwise have to be recreated over time under new and untried dispute settlement systems. As it is, the new mega‐​arrangements outside the WTO are only reinventing the existing wheel of dispute settlement in international trade.



It may be asked, why would, say, the United States and Europe want to negotiate the TTIP within the WTO? Would they not want an exclusive bilateral arrangement? In answer, why would they? If other WTO members were willing and able to incur the obligations of a TTIP, would it not be to the benefit of both the United States and the European Union to have a broader terrain for their vision of freer mutual trade and further economic integration? And would not the flow of world trade and world investment be enhanced overall if the ambit of such obligations were not merely trans‐​Atlantic, but transglobal?



An imposing obstacle to non‐​MFN plurilateral agreements is the need to receive the approval of the WTO membership to include them as plurilateral trade agreements in “Annex 4” of the WTO agreement.13 Upon the request of the WTO members that are parties to a plurilateral agreement, the WTO Ministerial Conference “may decide exclusively by consensus to add that agreement to Annex 4.”14 Securing such a consensus will not be easy under any circumstances; it is certainly not easy in the current circumstances.



Generally, developed countries with advanced economies have been eager to negotiate new WTO obligations to meet new economic needs, even if the agreements reached are exclusive because they are non‐​MFN. In contrast, developing countries generally resist non‐​MFN agreements. In addition to their apprehension of new obligations and their focus on getting the benefits of current obligations, they have had little interest in innovations in rule making that do not address their core concerns of agricultural and manufacturing access to the developed world. A number of developing countries, “such as Brazil, China, India, and South Africa have openly expressed their rejection of a plurilateral alternative to the Doha impasse, preferring instead a multilateral approach.”15



At this point, the developing countries that are resisting allowing new non‐​MFN plurilateral agreements as part of the WTO legal framework are simply outsmarting themselves. Their resistance has only encouraged developed countries ambitious for freer trade and more economic integration to turn from the WTO to the alternative of bilateral, regional, and megadeals outside the WTO. The adoption of such new obligations outside the WTO will influence global commerce in the same ways that already make developing countries apprehensive, but they will be voiceless to assert their interests, which would not be so if the new obligations were part of the WTO.



Conceivably, megadeals could be negotiated outside the WTO and later become WTO deals. For instance, the members of the TPP could request that it be added to “Annex 4” and thus become a plurilateral trade agreement within the legal framework of the WTO. As with any other non‐​MFN deal, this would require approval by consensus of the WTO Ministerial Conference. This WTO‐​centered approach would certainly be preferable to the current approach. As it is, other countries can join the TPP only with the permission of the current parties to the TPP. If the TPP were already within the WTO legal framework, other WTO members could join the TPP just by agreeing to comply with, and be bound by, TPP obligations. This said, building a consensus to bring the TPP within the WTO would be an arduous political task. Better to pursue such mega‐​ambitions within the WTO in the first place.



The drift away from the WTO in search of such megadeals is decidedly not in the interest of the vast majority of WTO members, including the developing countries that increasingly have their rightful say in the councils of the WTO and that benefit enormously from the centrality of the WTO trading system. A world of competing trading blocs bound by megadeals would not be a world that benefits those countries that are still on the margins of the world economy. Few of the poorer countries in the world will ever be invited to participate in a megadeal, but if such a deal is concluded within the legal structure of the WTO, they will have the right to benefit from that deal if they are willing to accept its obligations.



A continued drift outside the WTO would bolster the conclusion that now is the beginning of the end for the WTO. A return to the WTO would advance the view that now is the end of the beginning.



Alas, there is not much to suggest a turn back by the United States to the multilateralism manifested in the WTO. Under Trump, the United States is — so far — still showing up for WTO meetings and engaging in WTO dispute settlement (although mostly defensively). The United States is still making occasional WTO proposals, such as its recent and laudable proposal for more compliance with, and more transparency in, required subsidies notifications. At the same time, the United States is often uncharacteristically silent in WTO committee sessions. The U.S. delegates often cannot speak because they have no clear instructions. The traditional leadership of the United States is missing — and is missed — in the WTO.



Trump’s protectionist and unilateralist trade ambassador, Robert Lighthizer, is hardly a tribune for the WTO. One reason why members failed to agree on a unified statement for the customary concluding declaration at the Buenos Aires ministerial conference, and ended up with no final declaration at all, was reportedly because Lighthizer, on behalf of the United States, insisted on excluding language from the declaration describing the WTO as the center of the multilateral trading system. Like the vast majority of other WTO members, the United States has always insisted in the past on including this statement of mutual allegiance to multilateralism. No more. Not only do Trump and Lighthizer not see the WTO as central to world trade, it is not clear that they see the need for the WTO at all. They see international trade as a win‐​lose proposition and a zero‐​sum struggle of all against all. They do not see international trade as a win‐​win proposition for all who participate in trade, which is the motivating philosophical underpinning of the WTO trading system.



Among the Trump administration’s top trade priorities is to defend U.S. sovereignty over the making of U.S. trade policy, which is often portrayed as a necessary response to what it characterizes as WTO overreaching into the sovereign domain of domestic discretion in policymaking. Unlike past U.S. presidents and administrations of both parties, Trump and those who serve him do not seem to understand the concept of sharing sovereignty as an effective means of international cooperation toward the end of solving common global problems. As for international cooperation on trade, Trump and Lighthizer alike have, on many occasions, expressed antipathy toward the WTO and at times have hinted that withdrawing from the organization might be in the best interests of the United States.



Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly expressed a preference for bilateral — over global and regional — trade deals, even though he has yet to secure a single negotiating partner for bilateral negotiations. The only one of 35 ongoing negotiations to which the United States is even nominally a party is the TTIP, which is in limbo because of Trump’s concern that it is a regional agreement and because of his lack of attention to advancing it. It is not hard to understand why few governments want to negotiate with the Trump administration, given that the president pulled out of the TPP, continues to threaten to pull the plug on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has imposed and threatened illegal unilateral trade restrictions and appears to have no coherent or consistent positions on trade policy (or, for that matter, on much else).



In the months following the Buenos Aires Conference, the president seemed to open the door to returning to the TPP, but then changed his mind again. His secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross, is reported to have said that the TTIP negotiations are still alive. Meanwhile, juxtaposed to the administration’s expressions of displeasure with the WTO is its professed interest in continuing to use the WTO dispute settlement system and its intermittent efforts to ensure that U.S. trade laws are being applied in a WTO‐​consistent manner. Incongruities abound.



Given the president’s fickleness in overall policymaking and his predilection for saying one thing in the morning and another thing in the afternoon, who knows the extent to which he and his administration are committed over the long term to what seems a notable shift in U.S. trade strategy from more open to more constricted trade? Trump and his closest trade advisers rarely seem to think of the long term; they only seem to think of the short term. They also cause confusion with an endless stream of inconsistent statements. Having announced, for instance, in a defiant televised address that he was withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement, Trump has also said that he is open to returning to that agreement. But, assuming this is so, at what price to ongoing global combat against climate change? So, too, with trade. If the Trump administration did return to the negotiating table on these megadeals, what would be the U.S. negotiating approach? If the my‐​way‐​or‐​the‐​highway tactics of the United States in the renegotiations of the NAFTA and the Korea-U.S. trade agreement are any indication, little might result from a turn by Trump back to the TPP and the TTIP.



All this said, Lighthizer, who is wrong on so much else about trade and the WTO, was right in declaring after his fly‐​by to Buenos Aires, “Many Members recognized that the WTO must pursue a fresh start in key areas so that like‐​minded WTO Members and their constituents are not held back by the few Members that are not ready to act.”16 The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative tweeted that “the new direction of the WTO is set: improving trade through sectoral agreements by like‐​minded countries.”17 (The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative confirmed, too, that, in the brave and unbridled new world of social media, its tweets are official statements by the United States of America.) Lighthizer also ventured boldly, “MC11 will be remembered as the moment when the impasse at the WTO was broken.”18



Reports of the demise of the WTO are premature. Day‐​to‐​day, the WTO works smoothly. Because of the enabling global framework of WTO rules, almost all of world trade flows easily and without dispute every day. Because of the existence of the WTO dispute settlement system, almost all WTO members choose to comply with almost all WTO rules almost all the time. Most important, because of this system for resolving disputes, WTO members can resolve their inevitable trade disputes with each other peacefully and according to rules on which all members have previously agreed. This remains true despite the shameful recent attacks by the Trump administration on the WTO dispute settlement system and especially on WTO judges.



Nevertheless, Lighthizer was right in telling members in Buenos Aires that the WTO is “becoming a litigation‐​centered organization.”19 The WTO has proven to be proficient at upholding existing rules — an achievement not to be underestimated. But the WTO has not yet proven that it can be equally proficient in agreeing on new rules or on changes in existing rules. Unless members soon learn how to negotiate successfully on trade for the 21st century, the weight of the burden of a backlog of dispute settlement decisions will eventually intensify the dysfunction at the WTO, while its members continue to drift elsewhere to resolve the ever more complex new issues of the global economy.



If it was not clear to WTO members before the ministerial conference in Buenos Aires, it surely should be clear now that if they are going to make progress on trade liberalization any time soon, they will have to do so plurilaterally. With many countries turning inward and with many more increasingly weary of endless global trade negotiations that never seem to produce results, plurilateralism may offer the most promising path to multilateralism in the WTO. Indeed, for now, it may be the only path.



Absent progress within the WTO system, the alternatives are more bilateral, regional, and mega‐​agreements on trade made outside the sheltering legal framework of the WTO among the more ambitious members. Already, hundreds of trade agreements have been concluded outside the WTO — the vast majority of them since the start of the deadlock in the Doha Development Round. What began as an aberration has become a preoccupation. At present, 35 new bilateral and regional trade pacts are under consideration around the world.20



Looking past the apocalyptic headlines and the disappointments in Buenos Aires, there is scope for the more optimistic view that it is not the beginning of the end, but the end of the beginning for the WTO. The absence of a multilateral outcome in Buenos Aires may have triggered a psychological and tactical shift toward pursuit of plurilateral trade solutions. After years of ambivalence for fear of undermining the ongoing multilateral negotiations, like‐​minded members may now move forward as willing allies to modernize the rules framework of the WTO. In the absence — for now — of U.S. leadership, the European Union, Japan, China, Canada, Australia, Chile, New Zealand, and others can help fill the leadership void. On different issues, different leaders or combinations of leaders may emerge.



The list of topics that should be addressed by new trade rules is long and getting longer every day. Based on all that was said and done in Buenos Aires, several of the topics on this long list seem to be good prospects for immediate consideration, including digital trade and services.



 _Digital trade_ seems to be at the top of the list. When the WTO was established a quarter of a century ago, there was no such thing as digital trade. Thus, there were no WTO rules specifically concerning digital trade. All these years later, there are still no specific WTO rules on digital trade: WTO rules are analog, not digital. And while, overall, the growth in world trade has slowed in recent years, trade in digital goods and services has multiplied 45‐​fold in the past decade.21 In ample demonstration of the death of distance, the algorithms of digital trade are everywhere a potent accelerant for globalization and have changed the conduct of international commerce profoundly. Business‐​to‐​business digital commerce is estimated to account for 90 percent of all global electronic commerce.22 A WTO without rules on digital trade is not a “world trade” organization.



In Buenos Aires, a coalition of 71 WTO members (counting the EU member states individually) announced that they will begin exploratory work toward future negotiations on trade‐​related aspects of electronic commerce. They stressed that they are open to the inclusion of additional WTO members. The first session of their talks is to be held in 2018. Although these members have no negotiating mandate from the WTO, they have said they will conduct their talks within the WTO.23 Significantly, the United States joined this coalition, with Ambassador Lighthizer saying, “Initiatives like this among like‐​minded countries offer a positive way forward for the WTO in the future.”24



An issue that should also be near the top of the plurilateral list is _services trade_. For 15 years, Doha Round negotiators were unable to make any headway on services trade by expanding the scope of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, which is part of the WTO agreement. Ultimately, a group of like‐​minded countries began negotiating a separate accord on services on the sidelines of the WTO — but not actually in the WTO — that they called the “Trade in Services Agreement.” These negotiations halted after Trump’s election and have not resumed. The willingness of the United States to negotiate on digital trade and the fact that services account for 75 percent of the U.S. economy suggest that Trump and Lighthizer, who so far have focused mainly on manufacturing trade, may be willing to take another look at this critical issue for American workers and businesses and take part in new plurilateral negotiations aimed, ultimately, at a multilateral solution.



Commitments to liberalize some services, such as occupational licensing and legal services, may be difficult to achieve multilaterally, but many others areas are amenable to plurilateral solutions. Of concern to many WTO members in Buenos Aires was finding a way to advance negotiations on domestic regulation of services. If the United States, China, or any other WTO member is unwilling to join new services negotiations, then other like‐​minded WTO members interested in liberalizing trade in services should simply proceed, where they can, without them.



The WTO ministers agreed in Buenos Aires to continue talking about disciplining _fisheries subsidies_ with hopes of adopting a multilateral agreement by the next ministerial conference in 2019. (In trade negotiations, agreeing to continue to talk is seen as a success; trade negotiators do not understand why the rest of the world is not impressed by such an obvious accomplishment.) The looming deadline on this topic is 2020, when the members of the United Nations — including all 164 members of the WTO — have agreed to discipline subsidies for overcapacity and overfishing and to eliminate subsidies of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.25 Encouragingly, the United States has agreed to continue to participate in negotiations (after rejecting, with its withdrawal from the TPP, the restrictions there on fisheries subsidies, which are much like those being sought in the WTO).26 If these talks reach a multilateral roadblock, then a plurilateral alternative should be pursued within the WTO that could ultimately grow into a fully multilateral solution.



Not to be forgotten are the frustrating negotiations on freeing _trade in environmental goods_ , which are defined by the WTO as “products that can help achieve environmental and climate protection goals, such as generating clean and renewable energy, improving energy and resource efficiency, controlling air pollution, managing waste, treating waste water, monitoring the quality of the environment, and combatting noise pollution.”27 Annual global trade in environmental goods is currently estimated to be nearly $1 trillion and is growing rapidly along with a rising global demand.28 However, tariffs on these products persist and, currently, some WTO members assess duties as high as 35 percent on environmental goods. Liberalizing trade in these products would do much to speed the spread of clean and more‐​efficient technologies throughout the world, including to the developing countries where they are much needed to promote clean energy.



Negotiations on an Environmental Goods Agreement have been in progress for several years. Having started in 2012 with a list of 54 environmental goods subject to tariffs, some 46 WTO members, accounting for most of the world’s trade in these goods, continue to try to conclude an inclusive plurilateral WTO agreement to eliminate those tariffs and extend the duty‐​free benefits to all other WTO members on an MFN basis. These negotiations have stalled as the negotiating countries quarrel over precisely which goods are “environmental goods” that should fall within the scope of the agreement. Is a bicycle an “environmental good”? If so, are all kinds of bicycles “environmental goods”? Should we distinguish between a child’s first bicycle with training wheels and a high‐​performance French racing bicycle? And so on. The negotiating countries have been endlessly creative in constructing arguments for defining virtually everything as “environmental goods.” These negotiations should be resumed and, once an agreement is reached to eliminate barriers to trade in environmental goods, talks should be started on making the new plurilateral agreement an Environmental Goods _and Services_ Agreement by eliminating the barriers to trade in environmental services as well.



Yet another issue ripe for a plurilateral agreement is that of _excess capacity_ for production — in steel especially, but also in some other basic traded products. Global oversupply in these products is depressing world prices, distorting world markets, and consequently intensifying pressures for imposing new unilateral trade restrictions worldwide. Unilateral trade restrictions — such as those imposed by Trump on steel and aluminum — not only violate WTO rules, but also could cause a spiral of global protectionism as countries impose reactive retaliatory measures. Far better to deal with the very real problem of excess capacity by negotiating rules than by a descent into unknown depths of global protectionism.



There are WTO rules to deal with situations of short supply.29 There are, however, no WTO rules to deal with situations of oversupply. When the original 23 contracting parties of the GATT wrote the rules in 1947 in the hungry aftermath of World War II, oversupply was not a trade problem. Now it is, and now WTO rules are needed to help avoid the initiation of what could become a mutually destructive exchange of national trade restrictions and international trade disputes that would grip and, perhaps, paralyze the WTO. Proceeding from the work already being done in the steel sector under the auspices of the G20 group of leading economies, WTO members should negotiate a plurilateral sectoral agreement on steel that could ultimately become a multilateral WTO agreement.



Included in such a sectoral agreement could be guidelines on _best practices_ reminiscent of those in the reference paper to the protocol on basic telecommunications services under the WTO services agreement.30 Along with the agreement itself, those best practices could begin plurilaterally and then, with time, become multilateral. This negotiating approach of setting out best practices could be emulated in other new areas of trade concern, including two areas that drew much attention in Buenos Aires: _gender equity_ and _micro‐, small‐,_ and _medium‐​sized businesses_. The goal of these and other best practices efforts should not necessarily be to create new rules in these areas of concern; rather, it should be to encourage seeing trade policymaking through the lens of these concerns.



Another topic of discussion in Buenos Aires was _investment facilitation_. A large group of WTO members, comprising both developed and developing countries, endorsed a joint statement there agreeing to start “structured discussions with the aim of developing a multilateral framework on investment facilitation.”31 Examples of what an agreement on investment facilitation would contain include strengthened “electronic governance,” such as a “single electronic window” that would publish investment documents and help streamline applications and admissions procedures for incoming investments; a national focal point for mediating and facilitating investor concerns with public authorities; voluntary standards of corporate social responsibility; and guarantees of transparency.32



Ideally, this new WTO framework on investment facilitation would accompany, and perhaps be an expansion of, the multilateral Trade Facilitation Agreement, which was concluded in Bali in 2013 and is now being phased into full implementation. It, too, could be phased in over time, and it could contain differing obligations for WTO members at different stages of development. Moreover, it could be accompanied by technical assistance. Should WTO members not be able to proceed multilaterally on this topic, then it should be the subject of a WTO plurilateral agreement that could evolve into a fully multilateral pact.



If optimism is to be justified, then these few initiatives must be only the start. The topics that now seem closest to successful plurilateral negotiations are far from the only trade topics that can and should be advanced through this approach. There are many others. Some have been included in innovations in some of the bilateral, regional, and mega‐​agreements, including regulatory coherence, technical regulations, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, intellectual property protections, disciplines for state‐​owned enterprises, and trade remedies. Others would address more broadly the role and rules of the WTO in a new world economy facing new opportunities and confronting great challenges extending far beyond traditional trade concerns.



Plurilateral solutions are not the only solutions for the World Trade Organization. Multilateral agreements containing multilateral rules must always be the ultimate goal for the WTO. The logic of multilateralism endures. Indeed, the need to multilateralize international cooperation grows with each passing day. But there is more than one approach to achieving multilateralism. If, after more than two decades of both historic accomplishment and accumulating frustration, now is to be the end of the beginning for the WTO, and not the beginning of the end, then members can no longer afford the illusion that progress consists of merely agreeing to talk or scheduling a meeting or putting a topic on a discussion agenda in Geneva. Progress means getting things done. And that must start now.



Members must begin to negotiate in new ways that will lead to new trade agreements — and soon. If WTO members wait, if they hesitate, if they simply talk without really negotiating, and if they fail to act immediately on their shared realization that new challenges necessitate a new way of doing things, then the next ministerial conference of the WTO in 2019 may be the last one that many involved in trade policymaking will bother to attend.
"
"The thing celebrity magazines never mention about Johnny Depp’s current problems  —   the foreclosures on his homes, how he was said to have cut off his fingertip in a marital dispute, the fact he may need to  sell a small French village to cover debts associated with the subsequent divorce  —   is how his challenges are relevant to the Trump administration. Mr. Depp has appeared in some of the   (“Pirates of the Caribbean”) and weirdest (“Yoga Hosers”) films of the past 30 years, earning him an estimated $650 million. Being a rich movie star, however, does not necessarily bring great financial savvy. Over the past decade, Mr. Depp has paid more than $5. 6 million in interest on overdue taxes, has lent millions of dollars to people unlikely to pay him back and has unwisely splurchased a number of questionable investments, not the least of which is that town near St. . These money missteps, Mr. Depp says, are not his fault. Back in 1999, you see, Mr. Depp hired a firm named the Management Group to oversee his finances. But instead of protecting his fortunes, those financial advisers “engaged in years of gross mismanagement,   and at times, actual fraud,” according to a lawsuit Mr. Depp filed against the company. (The Management Group filed a countersuit on Tuesday denying wrongdoing and arguing that it “did everything possible to protect Depp from his own irresponsible and profligate spending. ”) The alleged fiscal malfeasance visited upon Mr. Depp occurred over 16 years, but the actor was unaware of this skulduggery, his lawsuit asserts, because he simply wasn’t paying much attention to what was going on. Mr. Depp, by his own admission, often had no idea what was occurring in his bank accounts and would regularly sign whatever documents the Management Group put before him, without bothering to read what they said, on the assumption that his financial adviser “was behaving as a loyal fiduciary and prudent steward of his funds and finances,” his lawsuit asserts. And this is where the Trump administration comes in, because that word  —   fiduciary  —   is at the heart of a battle raging within the federal government over how much responsibility we ought to bear in managing our own finances, and how much we should trust the people giving us advice. (Fair warning: The next few paragraphs are wonky, but I promise we’ll get back to Johnny Depp.) In 2015, President Barack Obama asked the federal government to force most of the nation’s financial advisers  —   those people who tell us which stocks to buy for our 401( k)’s  —   to abide by what’s known as the fiduciary standard, a set of rules that would require advisers to give their clients the best possible advice (rather than, say, advice that pays those advisers the highest fees). “It’s a very simple principle,” Mr. Obama said at the time. “You want to give financial advice, you’ve got to put your client’s interests first. ” For most financial advisers, becoming a fiduciary was no big deal, because they had been giving good advice anyway. For instance, the investment firm Merrill Lynch said it would voluntarily hold its retirement advisers to the new standard. “We view the Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule as a positive step for the industry and great news for investors,” reads a company web page. Other investment firms, however, were less enthusiastic about the new rules and began furious attacks. Their objections ranged from the ridiculous (suggesting that tens of thousands of financial advisers would retire en masse to protest the new rule) to the legitimate (profits of some advisers are likely to fall, and the fees paid by some investors may rise under the new rule what’s more, there will most likely be some lawsuits against a small number of advisers as everyone tries to figure out how the new rules work). When Donald J. Trump was elected president, the new fiduciary rules weren’t complete, and now some of his advisers are urging him to freeze or overturn them. The fiduciary rule might be “the dumbest decision to come out of the U. S. government in the last 50 to 60 years,” Anthony Scaramucci, an investment manager and newly appointed White House official, said at a conference, vowing to “repeal it as soon as we can. ” Republicans in Congress have introduced legislation to kill the rules. In truth, this battle is part of a broader clash within the federal government that is likely to shape Mr. Trump’s presidency. At the core of those who oppose the new fiduciary rules is a basic belief: People ought to bear more responsibility for monitoring their finances and lives. The fiduciary standard, its critics claim, does a disservice to the nation by placing the burden of financial accountability on advisers, rather than on us, the people who should be paying attention to what occurs with our bank accounts. We should be expected to scrutinize the advice we receive, these critics say, rather than accept it unthinkingly. A fiduciary protection enfeebles us by guaranteeing we’ll receive only good advice. That argument might seem preposterous  —   what’s the point of seeking advice if you can’t trust the advice giver?  —   until you consider situations like Johnny Depp’s. (See, I promised we’d get back to him.) Mr. Depp’s situation is so complicated that, in most ways, the federal fiduciary rules don’t apply. And his lawsuit will be unaffected by whatever President Trump proposes, because it has been filed in state court. Nonetheless, his suit is illuminating, because it demonstrates that instead of glibly dismissing the rules’ critics, we ought to acknowledge the challenges they voice. Consider, for instance, the claims made by Mr. Depp’s lawyers that the Management Group never once paid the actor’s taxes on time in 16 years (which the company disputes). That’s not great, but at the same time, how many years should a tax adviser miss a deadline before it’s the client’s responsibility to replace him? What’s more, according to the countersuit filed by the Management Group, Mr. Depp’s financial distress was a result of his tendency to overspend  —   at a rate of $2 million a month  —   on items like 14 homes, a chain of islands in the Bahamas, $30, 000 per month on wine, and $3 million to blast the ashes of Hunter S. Thompson from a   cannon. “I need to give my kiddies and famille as good a Christmas as possible,” Mr. Depp wrote to his financial advisers when they counseled him to “take it easy on holiday spending,” according to the firm’s countersuit. “On those few occasions when Depp said he was ready to change his ways, he never did,” the countersuit continues, “and he always went back to his uncontrolled spending. ” For its advice and services, the Management Group was paid $28 million out of Mr. Depp’s accounts. And this is where questions regarding the fiduciary standard come into play, because while Mr. Depp is clearly prone to some very bad financial choices, just as clearly the Management Group has allowed those decisions to occur. If the Management Group were held to the fiduciary standard, his advisers would probably have had more of an obligation to stop Mr. Depp from doing foolish things with his money, like giving it away or impulsively buying a French town. And, if Mr. Depp disregarded that advice, the Management Group might have had an obligation to cut ties with the actor, or at the very least, stop paying itself millions of dollars from his accounts. But, by the same token, Mr. Depp should also have paid at least a little attention to what was going on. Being a movie star shouldn’t excuse you from the obligation of balancing your checkbook once in a while. And that’s the rub for observers like me (and perhaps you) who believe Mr. Obama’s fiduciary rules are good policies and should become established law: We don’t like having to defend the irresponsible choices of people like Johnny Depp. We don’t want citizens to be encouraged to think less about their finances and retirement rather, we want them to think more. Mr. Trump’s advisers have a point when they argue that these new rules might make it easier for average Americans to pay less attention to what’s going on. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have these laws. In the movies, you can assume that everything will work out in the end. Real life, unfortunately, is more messy. Relying on personal responsibility often isn’t enough. And so though we might be annoyed by the whimpers of movie stars, listening to their complaints about the agony of having too many houses is a small price to pay to make sure good advice stays that way. There are no clear heroes and villains in this story, or most others. Let’s hope the president chooses the right script."

" A Melbourne university student has launched what has been described as a world-first legal case against the Australian government, accusing it of misleading investors in sovereign bonds by failing to disclose the financial risk caused by the climate crisis. In a claim filed in the federal court on Tuesday, Katta O’Donnell, a fifth-year law student at La Trobe University, said the government was breaching a legal duty and deceiving investors by not informing them upfront of the climate risk they face.  Climate risk refers to assessments of the expected impact of the climate crisis on investments, including the likelihood that fossil fuel investments will lose value and potentially become stranded as the world reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The Reserve Bank of Australia and the country’s corporate and financial regulators have warned that climate change exposes the economy and financial system to risks that will get worse if action is not taken. O’Donnell’s case, backed by David Barnden of Equity Generation Lawyers, argues that the government and its officials have failed in their duty of care by not taking climate change into account when doing their job. The student said the case had been developed after she introduced herself to Barnden when he gave a lecture at La Trobe on climate risk last year. She said it would put the government “on trial for misconduct” for failing to deal responsibly with the climate crisis. “I’m 23, I look to the future and I can definitely see that climate change is here and is going to get worse,” O’Donnell said. “It’s time the government told the public about the impact climate change will have on our future and the economy.” She said young Australians owned bonds through their superannuation funds but were in the dark about government assessments of the climate risk their investment faced. Sovereign bonds are issued by governments to fund spending. Australia’s are worth more than $700bn, mostly held by central banks and pension funds. “While the current government will be long out of power by the time we can access this money, our financial security … will bear the brunt of its climate legacy,” O’Donnell said. Barnden said he believed it was the first case that dealt with climate change as a material risk to the global sovereign bond market. He said the risk was increasingly being recognised by institutional investors, pointing to the Swedish central bank last year selling bonds from Western Australia, Queensland and the oil-rich Canadian province of Alberta due to their failure to do more to address climate change. “Australia is on the frontline of sovereign climate risk,” Barnden said. “We confront the harrowing physical impacts of drought and bushfires and we also face the financial risks of an economy over-exposed to fossil fuels being left behind as the world shifts to clean energy.” He said the legal claim had been filed after he wrote to the government on O’Donnell’s behalf asking for it to change its disclosure policy. O’Donnell is also represented by the barrister and former federal court judge Ron Merkel QC. A spokesperson for Josh Frydenberg said the Treasury was aware of the claim and Commonwealth legal representatives were considering it, but they declined to comment further on the basis court proceedings were underway. Rob Henderson, a former National Australia Bank markets chief economist, now an economics and financial consultant, said it was a “really interesting claim”. He said there had been a significant shift in thinking over the past decade that had accelerated after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority warned in 2017 that it was not safe for companies to ignore climate risks. He said Australia’s major banks now all published annual climate reports and issued green bonds. “In some ways I’m surprised this claim hasn’t been brought earlier, and the commonwealth hasn’t taken the initiative in laying out how it would do this properly,” Henderson said. “It’s an anomaly in our current financial system.” Apra is developing a climate risk vulnerability assessment for investors based on scenarios published by the Network for Greening the Financial System, a collection of 66 central banks, including the Reserve Bank of Australia. The assessment was expected to be finished by September but has been delayed by the Covid-19 shutdown. The scenarios included an estimate that global GDP could fall 25% below the assumed level this century if the world did not act to reduce emissions. The Morrison government a target of a 26% to 28% cut in emissions below 2005 levels by 2030 – less than scientists say is necessary to play its part under the Paris climate agreement. It is resisting a global push to set a goal of net zero emissions by mid-century."
"In Ireland, there has recently been some controversy over a proposal to transition a number of the country’s dirtiest power stations away from burning peat bogs, which emits even more carbon than coal. Instead, the plan is to burn “biomass” – that is, wood. However, because Ireland has relatively little forestry, there is not enough wood available to meet demand. That’s why Bord na Mona, a semi-state body that manages several peat burning power plants, proposed to source the wood from Australia.  This angered conservation groups, who pointed to the very high carbon footprint of hauling timber all the way from the other side of the world, just to burn it for electricity. And over the summer Irish planning authorities refused permission for one peat-burning power plant in County Offaly to be converted to biomass, putting the plans on hold. Burning Australian wood in Ireland does indeed sound daft, at first. But the true carbon footprint isn’t always as straightforward as it would seem at first glance (just look at how, for example, cutting plastic packaging can sometimes lead to more food spoiling and thus higher carbon emissions, or how cotton or paper bags can sometimes work out worse than a plastic bag). Therefore, since Bord Na Mona has been slow to release details on the potential carbon emissions, I thought it would be useful to try and estimate them myself. First I want to clear up one thing: burning trees doesn’t necessarily count as emissions. Though trees are made of carbon, if at least one is planted for every one cut down then the overall amount of carbon in the atmosphere should remain roughly neutral.  There are many other sources of carbon emissions related to forestry though, including land use changes, forest management or processing of the wood after harvest. But in this particular case, the main source of carbon emissions would be transport.  To make the calculations simple, let’s assume a shipment of exactly 1,000 tonnes of logs from Australia to Ireland, a distance of about 21,000km by sea. We’ll also assume another 500km by lorry to and from the port. The carbon footprint of a cargo ship depends on the type of ship, fuel used, route, speed, and so on, but for a bulk carrier it works out to about 8 grams of CO₂ per km per tonne of cargo.  For trucks it varies between 40 to 90 grams, but 55 grams per km per tonne would be a reasonable estimate. Do the maths and that works out at 168 tonnes of CO₂ emitted by the ship, and 27.5 tonnes by truck, giving a combined total of 195.5 tonnes of CO₂. Whether these emissions are worthwhile depends on how much energy the timber contains, and that depends on the type of wood and its moisture content (wood absorbs water, making it heavier and less energy dense). A fast growing and moderately wet hardwood such as eucalyptus has an energy content of 3,500 kilowatt hours per tonne. We then have to assume the power plant will lose around 70% of all that energy (mostly as heat) when burning it to make electricity.  What this means is 1,000 tonnes of eucalyptus will yield around 1.05m kilowatt hours of electricity (the full calculation is at the end of the article). And when you take the total carbon emitted in transporting those logs to Ireland, and divide it by that total electricity generated, you get a carbon footprint of 186 grams of CO₂ per kilowatt hour.  It is worth emphasising that there is considerable sensitivity in these estimates. If any of the key variables change – if the distance to port increases, if we use a different type of wood with less moisture, and so on – it can have a big impact. By comparison, the carbon footprint of importing biomass from North America to the UK has been estimated at 122 gCO₂/kWh. One 2014 study found that a more conventional biomass operation using locally sourced timber would have a footprint of 30 gCO₂/kWh, compared to 34 gCO₂/kWh for wind and 50 gCO₂/kWh for solar. So hauling biomass such a long distance doesn’t look like a great idea. However, the carbon footprint of peat is at least 1,100 gCO₂/kWh, nearly five times higher, and coal is very similar. And even these figures ignore the enormous environmental destruction that comes from peat extraction or coal mining. So the critics certainly have a point – bringing wood from Australia is indeed considerably worse than any other renewable option. But it’s still better than burning peat and destroying more of Ireland’s diminishing bog lands. Yes, the country could develop other sources of biomass such as agricultural or municipal waste, or fast-growing crops like willow or hemp. But factories take time to build and trees or crops take time to grow, and nobody is going to develop such resources if demand for the fuel simply isn’t there. This is the reality of sustainability: we are often faced with trade offs between least worst options. In fact, Ireland will soon face an even bigger decision. Moneypoint, a coal burning power station and the country’s single largest source of carbon emissions, will hit the end of its service life in 2025 and there is a big question mark about what’s going to replace it. Ultimately, there is no perfect solution to climate change. If there was, we’d have already implemented it. Options need to be carefully evaluated, for the devil is truly in the detail and small tweaks to a process can potentially lead to big changes in carbon emissions. This also shows the importance of long-term planning. After all, had the unsustainable nature of peat burning been acknowledged decades ago, we’d not be in this situation. The full calculation: Total generated from 1,000 tonnes of eucalyptus logs: 1,000 tonnes x 3,500 kilowatt hours per tonne = 3,500,000 kwh x 0.3 (because the other 70% is lost and not converted to electricity) = 1,050,000 kwh Transport emissions: 195.5 tonnes of CO2 are emitted in transporting 1,000 tonnes of logs from Australia to Ireland, or 195,500,000 grams. Divide the carbon emissions by the generated electricity to get a carbon footprint of 186 gCO2/kWh (195,500,000 / 1,050,000 = 186)"

Sir Elton John was asked if he could be any woman alive today, who would he be? 



“John answered: “It’s hard to pick someone from today, because there are so many candidates, but I think I’d choose Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand. She’s one of the few politicians that I respect and love – she’s got dignity and she’s humane. I think she’s doing a brilliant job.”



John isn’t the first celebrity name to praise the prime minister. Ardern attracted admiration from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Russell Crowe for her response to the Christchurch mosque attacks.”



Hollywood A-listers adore Ardern because she surpassed them at their own game of subterfuge. She is the epitome of the worldwide notoriety that they aspire to, and she achieved it by simply donning a head scarf and becoming the face of “world peace”. Naturally, A-Listers drooled.



Oh, the irony of political correctness pushing the Miss World Beauty Pageant off the world stage only to replace it with a politician doing the very same thing, granted Ardern wears more clothing.



Actors are chameleons, their success built on sham and trickery. Rocketman aspires to be Ardern because, in one fell swoop, she leapt ahead of Hollywood wannabes in the publicity stakes.



Naturally, Hollywood celebrities are not usually up to running a country, but neither is our celebrity PTPM. Non-delivery on promises and failure to perform eventually bites her at the polls. Diehard Labour voters will never abandon their princess, but there is only so much neglect even the most disinterested voter can stomach. The decline in Ardern’s popularity began last month when she took a tumble in the polls, dropping over nine points in the Newshub-Reid Research Poll. Note in Boondecker’s photoshop ‘Ship of Fools’ – shrunken ex punters awkwardly disembarking “let me out of here, anyway, anyhow!”



In reality, Ardern is little more than the carved figurehead on the prow of the old sailboat of yesteryear, decorative but completely useless at keeping the boat moving. The whole point of a boat is to go somewhere but Ardern bungles the navigation and abandons it in favour of the more comfortable figurehead role.



The carved figurehead was designed to bring good luck to the sailors and ward off evil spirits. There is a parallel between Ardern’s government and the superstitious sailors of yesteryear in that both are fearful of something that doesn’t actually exist, although they would like you to think otherwise. With sailors of old, it was the mythical sea monster and with the CoL it is [climate change.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/letter-to-the-editor-the-zero-carbon-bill/) There is an element of truth in each myth. A sea monster is a large whale able to sink the boat, and climate change is climate on a daily basis with the capability of sinking civilization. Irrational fear blown out of all proportion is superstition.



Adherence to the climate change myth is a step back to the dark ages. Ardern regularly bangs on about her “modern” approach but contradicts herself by imposing heavy-handed, [controlling dictates. ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/stuart-nashs-buggers-muddle-gun-law-changes/)Fortunately for us, facts always trump superstition in the end. Patience, friends, patience.



Due to her fixation with appearance at the expense of managing the day to day minutiae of governance, she is inclined to drop the ball. On Monday night Newshub reported that Ardern intends to regulate social media, (God help us), and that the Minister of Internal Affairs has already begun the work. 



Says Ardern: “What we are looking for here is just consistency, _moving into the modern era_ , making sure our legislation’s up to date, aah, and that’s an area Minister Tracy Martin’s been working on” and “Minister Martin’s been doing some thinking and some work.” Blah, blah, blah.



Unfortunately for Ardern, Tracy Martin had not been doing any such thing, and immediately refuted Ardern’s claim saying “I’m not working in that space” and “It’s still a conversation to be had”. Even Ardern’s talk is unconvincing and meaningless without supporting action, but fortunately for us this is a welcome, albeit temporary, lifesaver. There is a silver lining to her inaction!



Ardern does not know what her government is doing because she does not pay attention. She cannot possibly be up to speed when her biggest chunk of time is spent in meetings, followed by time spent with the media, including photo shoots for glossy overseas magazines. 



“Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has released her diary as part of the coalition government’s promise of more transparency, showing what she does in her “ministerial” capacity. 



And the first thing to note is that if you want to be Prime Minister, you don’t want to be afraid of meetings or the media.



According to the data released, Ardern spends 19 hours a week at diaried appointments; a third of those are meetings and a quarter are media interviews with outlets here and overseas. 



By comparison, what we’ve called governance – cabinet meetings, Question Time in parliament and the like – **amounts for just three percent of her time**.



About 22 percent of her appointment time – or about four hours a week – is spent giving speeches or making public appearances.”



Working on her public profile is Ardern’s bread and butter. Keeping the government accountable and on track is not. “Isn’t that what you have minions for?” she might as well ask. But if Ardern is not running the country, then who is?

One might think that American society would welcome the news that this is, by all reasonable historical standards, a golden age of peace and security. The great powers seem to have given up fighting one another, the lesser powers rarely go to war either, and levels of internal conflict (civil wars, ethnic conflicts, coups, and major violations of human rights) are at all‐​time lows.1 Terrorism may be the largest security challenge faced by the industrialized world, but it is not on the increase, and it poses less danger for the average American than does a bath.2 The pace of nuclear proliferation has slowed to a crawl, if not yet a complete stop.3 Perhaps most of all, states — no matter how mismanaged, corrupt, or weak — never disappear, because conquest appears to be dead.4 Despite what they may hear from their leaders, and no matter what the various underinformed pundits say, the actual empirical evidence suggests that the American people are safe, at least when compared with any who have come before.5



As those who have tried to spread that kind of information well know, however, large numbers of the American people generally refuse to believe that their basic security is unthreatened. When confronted by the growing mountain of evidence regarding risk in an era far more stable and less violent than any of its predecessors, few inside or outside the foreign policy establishment seem to accept it. Why does that message have such a hard time getting through? Why do so many Americans simply refuse to believe what would seem to be such positive news, that they are essentially safe?



In theory, at least, the “marketplace of ideas,” or the arena of debate in a free society, ought to encourage strong arguments to rise to the surface on the basis of superior logic and evidence and to expose those built on weaker foundations. As John Stuart Mill argued nearly 150 years ago, vigorous public debate should be the ally of truth and wisdom, thus allowing democracies to produce the best policy outcomes.6 Unfortunately, that weeding‐​out process does not always function as well in practice as it does in theory; all too often, the fittest ideas do not survive. Victorious notions, the ones that come to drive policy choices, are just as likely to be those with thin foundations that, nonetheless, proved essentially impervious to alteration by exposure to reason and fact.7



The odds in the marketplace are stacked against many ideas, irrespective of their wisdom, before the competition begins, in part because emotion regularly interferes with reason. Societal debates are not the detached intellectual evaluations of Mill’s imagination, where victory goes to those best supported by evidence and logic, but passionate struggles where entrenched assumptions fight one another for control over decisions (and decisionmakers), and where the outcome is always uncertain. Rather than a marketplace of ideas, in other words, foreign policy debates more closely resemble a battlefield of beliefs.



It is on that battlefield that policy is formed. To explain the behavior of the individual, one should examine his or her beliefs; similarly, to understand the foreign policy actions of a state, collective beliefs are a good place to begin. The triumphs of the United States, as well as its various mistakes, all have their origins in the assumptions that provide the justification for action by shaping the cost–benefit analyses performed before decisions are made. When underconsidered or even pathological beliefs defeat more rational ones, states march toward disaster.



The American marketplace of ideas is impoverished by a number of pathological beliefs, which together make it likely that the American people will remain temperamentally disinclined, at least in the short term, to accept the notion that they do not live in a particularly dangerous world.8 Simple misinformation cannot fully account for that stubborn refusal to acknowledge security. Competing facts are out there, but they often fail to convince the media or elites, both of which are important actors in any society and (more or less) reflect its fundamental attributes. This chapter discusses the reasons for the refusal to recognize safety and explains why belief in a dangerous world simultaneously frightens people and provides a certain level of psychological comfort. That apparent paradox is explicable with an understanding of how beliefs operate and how they help account not only for political behavior but also for all human activity.



The effort to get the country to recognize its fundamental safety and adjust its policies accordingly faces a pair of strong opponents. Central to American perceptions of international politics are two core beliefs: one about the nature of the world and the other about the role the United States should play in it. First, there is a widespread, deep‐​seated, visceral understanding that the world is a dangerous place; second, a great many Americans believe that any peace and tranquility is primarily the result of U.S. actions or of the stabilizing power of U.S. forward military presence. The world is a nest of vipers, in other words, that is kept quiet — to the extent that it is — only by the American policeman.



Those are not merely ideas, or cognitive impressions that are still subject to alteration by the introduction of new information. Those two fundamental understandings, one of the security environment and the other of the proper foreign policy to survive and shape it, are beliefs, or notions that have become internalized and accepted as true, often without much further analysis.9 Beliefs are the assumptions that we all work into our lives, the foundation for the prisms through which actors perceive and interpret their surroundings. They essentially shape the set of behavioral options, acting as heuristic devices for those seeking to organize and interpret new information and to respond appropriately.10 A little background on the nature of beliefs might help explain how they drive U.S. foreign policy and why they prevent society from accepting realistic evaluations of risk.



People are not born with their beliefs; their origins are in nurture rather than nature, and they become accepted not through rational analysis but through trust in those who relay them. Few choose their religious beliefs, for example, on the basis of a review of the evidence. Secular beliefs are also sustained by faith as much as by fact, and they are thus distinguished from knowledge (classically, “justified true belief”) by the absence of any stringent requirement for justification. Although they almost always have some basis in reality, beliefs need not pass rigorous tests to prove that they match it. No amount of evidence has been able to convince some people that vaccines do not cause autism, for example, or that the climate is changing because of human activity. Ultimately, as Robert Jervis explains, “We often believe as much in the face of evidence as because of it.“11



Beliefs are more than merely perceptions or intellectual interpretations of the external world. Once internalized, they can quickly become central to an actor’s identity structure or basic sense of self. Beliefs are visceral as much as intellectual. In other words, they are connected to emotion rather than reason: as such, they are nearly impervious to alteration by new information.12 Tolstoy memorably observed that even the most intelligent people “can very seldom discern even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as to oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions they have formed, perhaps with much difficulty — conclusions of which they are proud, which they have taught to others, and on which they have built their lives.“13



Indeed, part of the reason our beliefs are so resistant to change is because they shape the way that new information is interpreted, and they filter out that which appears to be contradictory.14 “People do not have beliefs, see new evidence, then revise those beliefs in light of that evidence,” wrote Jonathan Mercer. “Instead, people use their beliefs to interpret evidence. People revise their beliefs based on evidence they find credible, but the evidence they find credible depends on their beliefs.“15 In practice, that conclusion means that the arena of foreign policy debate is dominated by people who are likely to disagree vehemently and emotionally when their beliefs come into conflict, as they so often do. Facts may change, but beliefs are likely to stay the same.



Once enough members of a group have internalized a belief, it can come to affect collective behavior, thereby becoming part of the conventional wisdom of widely shared assumptions that, since everybody knows, nobody really considers.16 Collective beliefs tend to be even more resistant to change than do those of the individual, because they are continually fortified by broader society. During the Cold War, people did not need to know much about communism to believe that it was antithetical to U.S. values, for example. What everyone knows must be true. By coloring interpretation of new information and framing the options for action in groups, collective beliefs nearly create their own reality, which may or may not match the material world.



Not all beliefs are created equal. On many political issues, the public tends to take its cues from trusted elites.17 Those instances where the dominant political parties are united on a position tend to be especially persuasive to the American people, who defer to the judgment of leaders, widespread contempt for politicians notwithstanding. Although that is not always the case — elites were unable in the late summer of 2013 to convince the public that intervention in Syria was wise, for example — for the most part, public opinion is especially elite‐​driven when it comes to foreign affairs.18 Where the leaders go, the masses follow. To understand the origins of delusions of danger, therefore, one needs to examine the beliefs of the elite, of those in the influential classes who have a disproportionate effect on the formulation of policy. As long as people run countries, beliefs will explain the behavior of states. Their importance is rarely recognized by most traditional scholarship and analysis of U.S. foreign policy, however.19 Nonetheless, it is not difficult to identify the dominant, collective beliefs among elites that together help lay the foundation for U.S. perceptions of both the outside world and the role that America should play in it. Two in particular work to prevent a more accurate understanding of risk and threat from making much headway in the U.S. public. The next sections explain those beliefs and briefly describe their origins; the last discusses how they can be affected or altered.



Few Americans would agree with the proposition that they exist in what is essentially a culture of fear. Generally speaking, Americans pride themselves on their courage, especially in the face of the various threats they are told lurk around every corner. Although they may not spend their days actively trembling, however, there is little doubt that the American people — and especially their leaders — harbor what might be thought of as geopolitical fear, or the belief that the world is a dangerous place, full of evil actors seeking to do them harm. That fear, a generalized anxiety about the nature of the outside world, has been passed down through the generations and is visible across the political spectrum.



People can be perfectly rational about their own personal safety while harboring unreasonable fear for their country. In other words, perceptions of individual and collective safety need not match. One consistent finding of post‐​9/​11 polling is that the public seems to be more worried about terrorist attacks in general than in its own communities.20 That fear has a certain degree of logic to it, because the country is bigger than their communities, and the former includes the latter. It is that collective anxiety regarding threats not to their person but to their society and, more important, to their way of life that helps define geopolitical fear in the United States.



That fear has been consistent since at least World War II. A variety of analysts and scholars have over the years been puzzled and frustrated by the fact that, despite its size and relative safety, the United States routinely perceives its threats to be dire and immediate.21 Whether the issue is Islamic fundamentalist terrorism, failing states, or rogue actors, the United States tends to detect higher levels of danger than does any other state.



During the Cold War, the pattern was the same: the United States feared an attack by the Warsaw Pact far more than did its West European allies, who presumably had more to lose if such an event occurred; it worried about the influence of communist China more than South Korea, Japan, and the member states of the Association of Southeast Nations; and it obsessed over the potential pernicious influence of Castro and the Sandinistas more than did its smaller friends in the region.22



In 2002, the other members of the “Coalition of the Willing” had a much harder time selling the invasion of Iraq to their publics than did Washington.23 “After the Cold War, and even after 9/11, Europeans felt relatively secure,” Robert Kagan observed. “Only the Americans were frightened.“24 Despite the fact that the other states in the system are all demonstrably weaker than the United States and are, therefore, presumably more vulnerable to a variety of threats, none seems to worry about its safety nearly as much as does Uncle Sam.



The end of the Cold War hardly affected the belief in the inherent dangers of the outside world; if anything, it exacerbated that geopolitical fear. Polls throughout the 1990s revealed high levels of anxiety in the American people on a wide variety of issues.25 By April 2007, 82 percent of Americans told pollsters that the world was a more dangerous place than it used to be and that it was getting worse. One year later, a similar poll found a “significant majority” of Americans reported being anxious about U.S. security, demonstrating that in the United States, “anxiety remains steady over time.” Only 15 percent were not worried about “the way things are going for the United States in world affairs.“26 Elite anxiety mirrors — and leads — that of the public: a 2009 poll found that fully half of the membership of the Council on Foreign Relations considered the world more dangerous than it was during the Cold War. Another quarter deemed the dangers equivalent.27



Anxiety in the public can be at least partially explained by inadequate information about the level of risk that America faces today and perhaps by the lingering effects of 9/11. The beliefs of those who ought to know better, however, often remain immune to the facts. To take but one example, General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was fully aware of the statistics concerning conflict and threats in April 2012 when he gave an address to Harvard’s Kennedy School. The general began by reviewing Steven Pinker’s The Better Angels of Our Nature, perhaps the best‐​known review of the decline of violence worldwide, and then went on to explain how its findings — although empirically indisputable — are functionally irrelevant. His reexamination of the evidence led Dempsey to argue that although the world “seems less dangerous,” it is “actually more dangerous.” That “security paradox,” as he called it, was due to the proliferation of destructive technologies such as ballistic missiles, exploding fertilizer, and computer viruses. “More people have the ability to harm us or deny us the ability to act than at any point of my life,” he argued.28 So although those technologies have yet to affect U.S. security or international politics in any meaningful way, the general believed that catastrophe was right around the corner. The message coming from the top is that danger still exists, so no one should relax.



Dempsey’s remarks might be dismissed as merely the cynical obfuscation of someone with a professional interest in denying safety. Indeed, a number of institutions provide their members with a vested interest in identifying threats and then exaggerating them when necessary. The budget and overall raison d’être of the military, for instance, would be called into question in a fundamentally safe world. The intelligence services issue quarterly assessments of the security environment that regularly foresee drastically worse futures than the present; only the degree and form of chaos change.29 Geopolitical fear has a number of institutional constituencies, in other words, that are professionally inclined to detect threats whether or not they exist. “It is difficult to get a man to understand something,” Upton Sinclair famously noted, “when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.“30



That statement is not to imply that leaders are always, or even usually, insincere when they issue warnings about the various present dangers. People are quite capable of aligning their political interests with their beliefs about security. “Humans are compulsive rationalizers,” wrote the journalist Daniel Gardner in his review of the psychology literature on that issue. “Self‐​interest and sincere belief seldom part company.“31 Even initially disingenuous motivations quickly become the truth, as a result of every human being’s desire to be internally consistent. No matter what President George W. Bush’s initial calculations were regarding Iraq, for example, one should have little doubt that he truly believed (and continues to, despite all evidence to the contrary) that Saddam Hussein represented a clear and present danger and that removing him was the right thing to do. To believe otherwise would be cognitively unacceptable for almost anyone who had ordered men into battle.



Although manipulation of the evidence by elites with vested interests can account for a portion of America’s geopolitical fear, for a complete explanation of its existence one must look elsewhere. The belief in the inherent dangers of the outside world has deep historical roots in the United States. It persists in the post–Cold War era because of a number of factors, at least four of which are worthy of brief mention.



First, their high levels of religiosity compared with the rest of the Western world make the people of the United States more prone to moralism and Manichaeism, as well as more likely to be comfortable with the existence of evil as a palpable force in constant struggle with good.32



Second, because no other state has a political movement quite like neoconservatism in the United States, nowhere else is fear given such promotion in the marketplace of ideas.33 One of the central, defining features of neoconservatives is their enthusiasm for identifying threats. Though hawks exist in every country, no other ideological group advocates quite the same mixture of evangelical faith in democracy and pathological fear of the other. In particular, neoconservatives construct a complex, completely misleading web of danger with every speech they give and op‐​ed they write.34



Third, the American media have little incentive to present the public with realistic information on risk when impending catastrophe sells more papers and attracts the most viewers. Glenn Beck, who is almost a parody of the kind of person Richard Hofstadter had in mind when he wrote “The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” consistently attracts more listeners than does NPR.35



And fourth, the relative power of the United States predisposes its people to geopolitical fear. Unipolar powers are, by nature, supporters of the status quo, any alteration of which can appear to threaten their position. Rich people worry a great deal about their security. They build tall fences, install motion detectors, and hire private security guards to protect themselves and their belongings from the throngs of have‐​nots they assume are plotting to take what is theirs. Wealth creates insecurity in individuals, and it seems to do so in states as well. Those who have more than what could be considered their fair share, perhaps bothered a bit by subconscious guilt, worry about losing what they have more than those who live in relative penury. In international politics, the United States has the most and fears the most too. “America may be uniquely powerful in its global scope,” former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski believes, so as a result “its homeland is also uniquely insecure.“36 That kind of thinking has a certain amount of intuitive appeal, even if it is utterly devoid of logic; if unchecked, it can lead to disaster.



Persistent geopolitical fear filters out of U.S. foreign policy debates any news regarding the decline of warfare, of the miniscule risks to individuals from terrorism, of the deep divides among even Islamic fundamentalists, and of the essential safety of the United States. The notion that the world is a fundamentally dangerous place has long ago passed into the realm of belief, especially among foreign policy elites, where it is rarely subjected to evaluation. Mere reviews of facts are unlikely to change minds on that issue. Those who matter most in the foreign policy process — the elites across the political and strategic spectra, inside and outside of government — rarely give the possibility of fundamental safety much of a hearing. For them, the world is likely to remain a dark place, full of terrors.



Although geopolitical fear prevents current international empirical realities from receiving a fair evaluation by U.S. society, another belief prescribes a specific approach to foreign policy, one that mandates a far higher level of international activism than would otherwise be warranted. Both are based on thin intellectual foundations, and together they encourage a variety of ill‐​advised policies on the part of the United States. According to what might be considered the indispensability fallacy, many Americans believe that U.S. actions are primarily responsible for any stability that currently exists. “All that stands between civility and genocide, order and mayhem,” explain Lawrence Kaplan and William Kristol, “is American power.“37 That belief is an offshoot, witting or not, of what is known as “hegemonic stability theory,” which proposes that international peace is possible only when one country is strong enough to make and enforce a set of rules.38 Were U.S. leaders to abdicate their responsibilities, that reasoning goes, unchecked conflicts would at the very least bring humanitarian disaster and would quite quickly threaten core U.S. interests.39



Brzezinski is typical in his belief that “outright chaos” and a string of specific horrors could be expected to follow a loss of hegemony, from renewed attempts to build regional empires (by China, Turkey, Russia, and Brazil) to the collapse of the U.S. relationship with Mexico as emboldened nationalists south of the border reassert 150‐​year‐​old territorial claims. Overall, without U.S. dominance, today’s relatively peaceful world would turn “violent and bloodthirsty.“40 The liberal world order that is so beneficial to all would come tumbling down.



Like many believers, proponents of hegemonic stability theory base their view on faith alone.41 There is precious little evidence to suggest that the United States is responsible for the pacific trends that have swept across the system. In fact, the world remained equally peaceful, relatively speaking, while the United States cut its forces throughout the 1990s, as well as while it doubled its military spending in the first decade of the new century.42 Complex statistical methods should not be needed to demonstrate that levels of U.S. military spending have been essentially unrelated to global stability.



Hegemonic stability theory’s flaws go way beyond the absence of simple correlations to support them, however. The theory’s supporters have never been able to explain adequately how precisely 5 percent of the world’s population could force peace on the other 95 percent, unless, of course, the rest of the world was simply not intent on fighting. Most states are quite free to go to war without U.S. involvement but choose not to. The United States can be counted on, especially after Iraq, to steer well clear of most civil wars and ethnic conflicts. It took years, hundreds of thousands of casualties, and the use of chemical weapons to spur even limited interest in the events in Syria, for example; surely internal violence in, say, most of Africa would be unlikely to attract serious attention of the world’s policeman, much less intervention. The continent is, nevertheless, more peaceful today than at any other time in its history, something for which U.S. hegemony cannot take credit.43 Stability exists today in many such places to which U.S. hegemony simply does not extend.



Overall, proponents of the stabilizing power of U.S. hegemony should keep in mind one of the most basic observations from cognitive psychology: rarely are our actions as important to others’ calculations as we perceive them to be.44 The so‐​called egocentric bias, which is essentially ubiquitous in human interaction, suggests that although it may be natural for U.S. policymakers to interpret their role as crucial in the maintenance of world peace, they are almost certainly overestimating their own importance. Washington is probably not as central to the myriad decisions in foreign capitals that help maintain international stability as it thinks it is.



The indispensability fallacy owes its existence to a couple of factors. First, although all people like to bask in the reflected glory of their country’s (or culture’s) unique, nonpareil stature, Americans have long been exceptional in their exceptionalism.45 The short history of the United States, which can easily be read as an almost uninterrupted and certainly unlikely story of success, has led to a (perhaps natural) belief that it is morally, culturally, and politically superior to other, lesser countries. It is no coincidence that the exceptional state would be called on by fate to maintain peace and justice in the world.



Americans have always combined that feeling of divine providence with a sense of mission to spread their ideals around the world and battle evil wherever it lurks. It is that sense of destiny, of being the object of history’s call, that most obviously separates the United States from other countries. Only an American president would claim that by entering World War I, “America had the infinite privilege of fulfilling her destiny and saving the world.“46



Although many states are motivated by humanitarian causes, no other seems to consider promoting its values to be a national duty in quite the same way that Americans do. “I believe that God wants everybody to be free,” said George W. Bush in 2004. “That’s what I believe. And that’s one part of my foreign policy.“47 When Madeleine Albright called the United States the “indispensable nation,” she was reflecting a traditional, deeply held belief of the American people.48 Exceptional nations, like exceptional people, have an obligation to assist the merely average.



Many of the factors that contribute to geopolitical fear — Manichaeism, religiosity, various vested interests, and neoconservatism — also help explain American exceptionalism and the indispensability fallacy. And unipolarity makes hegemonic delusions possible. With the great power of the United States comes a sense of great responsibility: to serve and protect humanity, to drive history in positive directions. More than any other single factor, the people of the United States tend to believe that they are indispensable because they are powerful, and power tends to blind states to their limitations. “Wealth shapes our international behavior and our image,” observed Derek Leebaert. “It brings with it the freedom to make wide‐​ranging choices well beyond common sense.“49 It is quite likely that the world does not need the United States to enforce peace. In fact, if virtually any of the overlapping and mutually reinforcing explanations for the current stability are correct, the trends in international security may well prove difficult to reverse. None of the contributing factors that are commonly suggested (economic development, complex interdependence, nuclear weapons, international institutions, democracy, shifting global norms on war) seem poised to disappear any time soon.50 The world will probably continue its peaceful ways for the near future, at the very least, no matter what the United States chooses to do or not do. As Robert Jervis concluded while pondering the likely effects of U.S. restraint on decisions made in foreign capitals, “It is very unlikely that pulling off the American security blanket would lead to thoughts of war.“51 The United States will remain fundamentally safe no matter what it does — in other words, despite widespread beliefs in its inherent indispensability to the contrary.



The first step in the process of altering beliefs is to arrive at a basic understanding of where they come from; the second is to promote competing sets of beliefs, ones based on firm evidentiary foundations that would lead to better policy outcomes. If a more accurate understanding of national security is to be accepted in the United States and the nation’s behavior is to be adjusted accordingly, the two beliefs described earlier must be confronted and altered, or defeated in the marketplace of ideas.



Changing foreign policy beliefs is no easy task. Once internalized, beliefs quickly become part of an actor’s very identity and are, therefore, far more hardy and persistent than are ideas or theories. Elaborate cognitive defenses protect fragile ideologies against potentially contradictory information. Because any new evidence is interpreted according to extant belief systems, reevaluation of core assumptions is rarely even contemplated.52 Changing one’s mind takes a great deal more cognitive energy than merely ignoring potentially troubling evidence, which places inertia on the side of the ideological status quo. Beliefs are, therefore, nearly immune to the effect of even irrefutable empirical data, much less academic argumentation.



Nearly immune, however, is not immune. Even the most deeply held beliefs find it difficult to survive sustained, long‐​term assaults of contradictory information. Psychologists who have studied evolution in beliefs report that despite occasional epiphanies that instantly change minds, like that of Saul on the road to Damascus, generally speaking the process is very gradual, and sometimes imperceptible.53 Individuals often recognize that a change in their beliefs has occurred after the fact, and they resist admitting that their minds are evolving while the process is under way. There are examples of gradual, even generational evolution of beliefs that can give hope to those seeking to expunge fear and indispensability from U.S. foreign policy.



“Social Darwinism,” for instance, poisoned international politics for decades. The belief that humanity was split into a number of distinct “races” in a perpetual existential struggle where only the fittest survive shaped the worldview of generations of leaders.54 Social Darwinism helped justify any number of pathological policies, from imperialism to the Holocaust, but over time, it collapsed under the weight of rational counterargument and evidence. The identification of DNA and the understanding of the genome allowed science to put social Darwinism and its cousins, eugenics and phrenology, to rest once and for all.55 Previously, internalized beliefs about the inevitability of competition between races were slowly changed by the onslaught of evidence and reason, and the understanding that differences among peoples were cultural rather than genetic. The edifice did not collapse all at once or with equal speed everywhere, but over time arguments based on the foundation of social Darwinism stopped winning popular debates on that “battlefield of beliefs,” and foreign policy behavior changed. Precedent, then, exists for evolution in fundamental beliefs, enough for one to hope that a similar process could eventually change popular perceptions toward modern, counterproductive irrationalities.



Precedent does not supply the only encouragement. Changing the dominant U.S. foreign policy belief system is perhaps not as daunting a challenge as it may at first seem, for a number of reasons. First, as already discussed, only a small number of opinions would have to be altered to have a significant effect. As nice as it is to imagine that the United States runs a democratic foreign policy, in reality not all opinions are equally important. Altering the beliefs of the masses may be quite difficult, but it is those of the elite that are decisive in foreign policy; affecting elites, if only because they are fewer in number, might not prove to be an insurmountable task. As influential as NSC 68 was, for instance, it was an internal document read only by senior government officials, and it remained classified until 1975. The various incarnations of the Committee on Present Danger concentrated their efforts solely on the upper echelons of the foreign policy community, and they were quite successful in affecting foreign policy debate and practice. Success in minimizing pathological foreign policy behavior can occur long before majorities alter their beliefs.



Second, there is reason to believe that foreign policy beliefs are not as entrenched as some others. Many modern American politicians — to say nothing of the people they lead — know very little about foreign policy. The U.S. Congress is a wasteland of parochialism, where members can even be punished for appearing to know too much about the rest of the world.56 Those at the top of the executive branch have been little better. The past three U.S. presidents had no background in foreign affairs before coming into office. Bill Clinton even managed to turn his opponent’s foreign policy expertise into a liability in 1992, claiming that it demonstrated that the elder Bush did not pay adequate attention to domestic concerns. Eight years later, voters were unfazed about George W. Bush’s disinterest in the outside world, as manifest in a record of foreign travel stunningly low for a child of privilege, inability to name leaders of key countries, and devotion of only three pages in his campaign memoir to foreign affairs.57 Although Barack Obama spent large portions of his life abroad, he had no direct foreign policy experience before 2008, and his 2012 opponent had even less. So although 21stcentury U.S. presidents have some predetermined beliefs about foreign policy, their beliefs are probably more malleable than those of presidents who have come to office more seasoned in matters of state. Some of the most important, influential minds may not prove to be those most resistant to change.



A third reason for hope can be found in the early indications from the changeover in generations. Generally speaking, young people are more susceptible to the possibility of change, whereas senior members of any generation are much less likely to admit that their long‐​held theories might be wrong. That is particularly true for senior scholars, as Thomas Kuhn has pointed out in his study of paradigms, because they rarely prove eager to adjust the belief systems that have served them well for so long.58 Junior members of any field are much more likely to adopt new theories and beliefs, because they are not as invested in old ways, and they may gain a certain bit of pleasure in tearing down the old shibboleths.59 Public‐​opinion polling has suggested that the youngest generation of adults, the so‐​called millennials, is less concerned about terrorism and less supportive of an activist foreign policy than are its predecessors. Those between the ages of 18 and 29 are half as likely to be concerned about Islamic fundamentalism as those over 60.60 They also appear to be less patriotic.61 It is often said that racism is going away one funeral at a time; perhaps, too, generational change is necessary to relieve some of the pathological popular pressures in the arena of U.S. foreign policy debate.



Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the target of this work is the marketplace of ideas, not the beliefs of every individual who contributes to it. The United States does not always act pathologically, after all. Rational forces are present alongside pathological ones in all foreign policy discussions, and they often win the battle over the direction of policy. It will not require a complete ideological revolution for the United States to minimize the irrational beliefs that plague its foreign policy behavior. Planting the seeds of doubt in influential minds, seeds that can germinate and grow over time, may well prove to be enough to tilt the balance of national debate toward reason. The task of inspiring gradual improvement in U.S. foreign policy performance, therefore, may not be as daunting as it at first seems. In the long run, there is hope, even if few minds will change any time soon.



Thomas Jefferson once wrote, “If we think [the people are] not enlightened enough to exercise control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform that discretion.“62 One of the crucial tasks facing policymakers must be to inform the general public, however slowly and indirectly, of the evidence that might force its members to reexamine their foreign policy beliefs. Because an informed public is one of the central _sine qua nons_ of a healthy, functioning democracy, U.S. leaders ought to repeat the facts about the decline of warfare — and of the real risks associated with terrorism — as many times as necessary for them to become accepted.63 Although simply correcting misinformation will not alter beliefs immediately, over time the constituency for reason will grow.64



Though beliefs are exceptionally slow to change, they eventually do. Few people still believe that the earth is at the center of the universe, for instance, or that insults to honor must be answered by a duel to the death. Assuming for a moment that the current pacific trends in international politics turn out to have staying power, empirical realities will eventually trump pathological geopolitical fear. Even the most deeply held collective beliefs find it hard to persist forever in the face of a sustained onslaught of countervailing evidence. Over time — and perhaps with the change of generations — pure reason can win the battle of beliefs, even if its victory is never certain.

"The installation of new gas boilers must be banned from 2025 or the UK’s net-zero climate target will be “doomed”, according to a high-level commission convened by the CBI. The ban would apply to conventional gas boilers, but hybrid or hydrogen-ready boilers would be allowed under the business organisation’s recommendations, which were developed in collaboration with energy industry leaders. The commission also said that by 2035, no boilers burning any fossil gas should be installed into homes, with technologies including heat pumps and district heating being used instead. Grants or loans should be given to help people and businesses make the switch, it said, which when combined with energy efficiency measures, would lower household energy bills. Heating is the largest single source of carbon emissions in the UK, making up more than one-third of the total. Decarbonising heat is the biggest energy challenge in tackling the climate emergency, particularly because it requires action in millions of individual homes. Currently, just 1m of the UK’s 27m homes have low-carbon heat. The government’s current policy is to ban gas boilers only from 2025 in newly built homes. But the group said taking action to transform the UK’s heating would create 150,000 jobs and help the nation recover from the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Karan Bilimoria, the CBI president and chair of the heat commission, said “A green recovery and progress towards the UK’s net zero emission target are doomed to fail if we don’t address the urgent need to decarbonise the heat in our homes and buildings. “Aside from the moral imperative, there’s also a strong economic case for protecting our planet. [It] would provide a huge jobs boost at a time when [they] are needed more than ever.” Prof Martin Freer at the University of Birmingham and part of the commission said: “Delivering decarbonisation of heating is the biggest energy challenge we face in getting to net zero. Unlike electricity, which can be changed at a systems level, it requires over 20m households to adopt new energy efficiency measures and new ways of generating heat.” The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  The commission members included business leaders from National Grid, UK Energy Research Centre and Cadent, the UK’s largest gas distribution network. The commission report says: “This transition will undoubtedly be disruptive to consumers and businesses.” The new types of heating systems will be more expensive until providers scale-up their production. Lord Bilimoria said: “We do recognise the upfront costs and we don’t think these should be borne by the consumer alone.” The commission said the government had a “pivotal role” to play, which required “political courage and vision” and the creation of a national delivery body for heat, modelled on the organisation that delivered the 2012 Olympics. “[Heat] is going to move to centre stage in the years to come,” said Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s official advisers. “So we really welcome this CBI report, which gives us a sense of what a net zero compatible package of measures might look like.” He said the CCC would publish new advice for government this year, including the critical steps needed to decarbonise UK homes. The commission report says oil-fired boilers are particularly polluting and should be banned from 2023. The alternative to conventional boilers include heat pumps, which draw heat from the ground or air and, as a stopgap to 2035, hybrid systems that combine gas and heat pumps. Installation of heat pumps in homes by Wealden district council led to an average saving of £500 a year for tenants, the commission found. Hydrogen boilers produce only water when burning the fuel, which could be created by renewable energy in the future. The commission said a vital step in installing the new systems was to reduce heating needs by increasing building energy efficiency. Part of the funding needed for this could come from reforming the £2bn-a-year winter fuel payment currently paid to over-65s to target the money at those most in need. The UK will host a critical UN climate meeting in 2021, and Bilimoria said the country could show its leadership on the world stage by implementing the heat commission’s recommendations. The government has been approached for comment."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThough regional, what follows is a scandal that illustrates just how energy laws and policy are formed today in many developed countries: by green activists and lobbyists who have an extreme agenda or narrow, self-serving interest.
German national daily Bild here reports how in Hannover the new energy law for the state of Lower Saxony was not really written by policymakers elected by the voters, but by the Big Green industry lobbyists themselves.
The Bild story bears the title: “Companies write the energy law”

Germany’s number one daily by circulation, Bild, tells of Lower Saxony’s Environment Minister Stefan Wenzel of the Green Party coming under heavy fire from the opposition. The FDP Free Democrats accused Wenzel of having parts of the 79-page draft legislation “dictated to him by the wind industry.” In other words, Bild writes:
Instead having the law formulated by employees of the Ministry, lobbyists participated in the formulation!”
According to Bild 12 environmental activist groups worked on the legislation, including companies such as Enercon and GE.
Bild quotes Free Democrat Dr. Gero Hocker, an environment expert:
The Environment Minister must concede that the wind lobby took over the job of drafting the law. That’s an outrage!”
Bild writes that although it is not unusual to get imput from various organizations, an angered Gero Hocker shot back: “Taking over as they are the formulations is a real scandal.”
Increasingly lawmakers have become marionettes of Big Green…democratic representation be damned. It also doesn’t help that a huge share of German lawmakers are investors in fail-safe, get-rich-quick green energy projects.

You know of the “Gore effect“, Wikiepedia describes it as  “…an informal and satirical term which alleges a causal relationship between unseasonable cold weather phenomena and global warming activism”, so it was appropriate to apply to the situation where the Gore’s Climate Reality Project group tried a political ploys that looked stupid: “I’m Too Hot” trucks and offers of free ice cream to this week’s Environmental Protection Agency hearings on power-plant emissions…when it was 58 degrees and raining. Obviously, CNN’s Bill Weir doesn’t understand satire, much less how to be a professional journalist.
From Mediaite:
It’s safe to say CNN anchor Bill Weir is not a fan of climate change deniers.
On Thursday, the Twitter account for Fox Nation, a blog run by Fox News, tweeted a link to a post headlined, “Climate Doesn’t Cooperate With Al Gore’s Group’s Visit to Denver EPA Hearings.” 
The story, aggregated from the Washington Times, relates to a Denver visit by former Vice President Al Gore‘s “Climate Reality Project” for EPA hearings on power plant emissions.
The group showed up to hand out ice cream even though it was 58 degrees.
Weir retweeted the link, with his own comment: “Weather is not climate, you willfully ignorant fucksticks.”

[ Twitter: https://twitter.com/BillWeirCNN/status/494670062092296192 ]
==============================================================
One wonders why he didn’t say same the same thing about Gore and his ice-cream trucks to treat the “I’m too hot” weather that never materialized. Oh, yeah, bias.
This is probably the best reason ever to tune out CNN, when they hire emotional children like this instead of journalistic professionals, it’s pretty much pointless to watch any longer.
After what I experienced recently, I’m beginning to think that most climate alarmists are nothing more than emotional children disguising themselves as professionals.
UPDATE: I posted this short message, twice. It was deleted both times, but the second time I saved a screen cap. Apparently Bill Weir has an ego that is easily bruised, or there’s somebody at CNN running interference.

You can look here as see that it is now missing.

Class act, guys. No bias there at CNN.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Spiegel (SPON) here has a highly critical story on the scam of climate protection emission certificates and their trading.
The German renowned weekly writes that it may have sounded like a good idea in earlier times, however: “it often enriched only business dealmakers. A study now shows just how brash the tricks were on international climate projects.”
Emissions certificates are yet another classic example of how politicians, scientists and activists passed themselves on as experts on how to curtail emissions when it fact they had no clue and failed to think through the concept. As a result they created an embarrassing disaster that enriched a few swindlers and ended up creating the opposite of what they aimed for. Earlier critics were simply ignored or dismissed as fossil fuel hacks.” Now we are seeing that the “hacks” were right.
Emissions may have risen an estimated 600 million tonnes
According to Spiegel, the Stockholm Environment Institute commissioned the governments of Austria, Switzerland and Finland to study the effectiveness of the Joint Implementation (JI) climate protection instrument, which was the brainchild of Kyoto Protocol architects. The results of that study are now available, and they are extremely embarrassing to say the least.
Spiegel writes that the study shows “how messed up” the JI projects were:
About three quarters of the certificates led to even higher emissions.” […] Through the JI mechanism, global greenhouse gas emissions may have risen an estimated 600 million tonnes.”

The reason for the increase, Spiegel explains, is because many countries issued emissions certificates without even cutting back on any emissions. They were simply printing paper and selling these sheets of paper for real and big money. Countries that bought the certificates then used them to just emit more greenhouse gases. Naturally some few, select people in the middle ended up making big money.
Spiegel cites a result of the study:
About 73 percent of the emissions rights that the researchers studied resulted from measures that could have been carried out without the trading of certificates. ‘That’s printing money,’ says Vladyslav Zherzherin, a co-author of the study.”
At one point in its article Spiegel even writes of “absurd consequences” of the JI rules involving projects in Russia, for example some companies there increased their production of climate gases “in order to get good payments for curtailing them.”
In the meantime Russia has stated that it will not sign on to a new Kyoto Treaty, and so the money-printing machine there has stopped.
According to Spiegel, as a consequence the authors of the study are now calling for “an effective international monitoring of the transfer of emission permit” as part of a new deal in Paris.
What can we gather from all this? There still remains tonnes of easy money to be made in the climate scam. You just need to be connected to the right people.

"At last weekend’s round of movie and television awards, doled out by the producers’ and actors’ guilds, the likes of John Legend and Julia   among others, swung hard at President Trump and his travel ban, to rapturous applause. The friendly reception to hostile fire represented a departure for awards shows, where political acceptance speeches have elicited reactions from eye rolls to noisy dissent. In 1973, the Native American actress and activist Sacheen Littlefeather was met with jeers and later, she said, Hollywood blacklisting after Marlon Brando sent her to refuse an Oscar on his behalf. After Vanessa Redgrave, a supporter of Palestinian rights, deplored “Zionist hoodlums” while accepting her Oscar in 1978, the screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky drew hearty applause for upbraiding “people exploiting the occasion of the Academy Awards for the propagation of their own personal political propaganda. ” Boos rained down on Michael Moore, winner of the 2003 documentary prize, for tearing into George W. Bush’s newly started Iraq war. Getting political at the Oscars was risky, and the assorted causes were always scattershot. But now Hollywood finds itself in 2017. If current trends hold, using stage time at the Academy Awards to take a stand won’t be just de rigueur, but expected. Mr. Trump’s travel ban, along with his combative rhetoric and internet outbursts, have directly shaped this year’s awards race. And Hollywood’s ever more polarized   with him has imbued the season with a heightened sense of both superfluousness and purpose. On the one hand, against a backdrop of geopolitical unrest, the monthslong circuit has felt, to whiskered campaigners, especially frivolous. On the other hand, stars are using the spotlight to broadcast their resistance, starting with Meryl Streep at the Golden Globes. Not everyone wants to hear actors bang on about politics, and audience reception depends on political bent. Many in America who are supportive of Mr. Trump already feel alienated by “Hollywood elites,” and might not be tuning in to the Oscars anyway. But as public arts funding is threatened with cuts, and Mr. Trump unveils other contentious policies, many actors suddenly feel that they must speak out, even if they’re preaching to a choir eager to lap up their every word. Matters came to a head when the travel ban went into chaotic effect over the weekend. One Oscar contender who was immediately affected was the Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, whose drama “The Salesman” is up for the Academy Award for best   film. (His “A Separation” won in 2012.) Now he’s subject to the ban, which sharply limits travel from seven   countries. Mr. Farhadi said that even if he were granted an exemption to travel, he wouldn’t attend. “To humiliate one nation with the pretext of guarding the security of another is not a new phenomenon in history and has always laid the groundwork for the creation of future divide and enmity,” Mr. Farhadi said in a statement. He went on to condemn “the unjust conditions” the order had forced upon citizens of the seven nations. Will this affect Mr. Farhadi’s Oscar chances? You betcha. Not only has the fracas raised the visibility of his film, but it has also made voting for it a political act. The same goes for the nominated documentary short “The White Helmets,” about civilian Syrian rescuers. One of the film’s subjects and a cameraman were to attend the Oscars, according to the filmmakers, but now are shut out, too. The   Swedish actress, Bahar Pars, a star in the Swedish entry “A Man Called Ove,” has said that  she is determined to attend as a statement but that details were still being sorted out. The ban, which the United Nations says has imperiled 20, 000 refugees, also stands to raise the profile of nominated films that explore migrants’ plight, like the documentary feature “Fire at Sea” and the shorts “Watani: My Homeland” and The New York Times’s   “4. 1 Miles. ” As widespread protests roiled airports last weekend, there were questions in Hollywood about whether speakers and winners would take aim at Mr. Trump at the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday, and the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday. Ms. Streep had already set a precedent at the Golden Globes in January: She publicly castigated Mr. Trump for being a bully. If that speech increased her chances at landing an Oscar nomination for her role in “Florence Foster Jenkins”  —   and Hollywood chatter holds that it totally did  —   Mr. Trump sealed the deal. His tweet the next day, calling her one of Hollywood’s “most overrated actresses,” fell smack in the middle of the voting window for Oscar nominations. And, lo, a few weeks later, Ms. Streep became a   Oscar nominee. But she’s Meryl Streep, occupying the tippy top of Hollywood’s living pantheon. Awards strategists rarely want their clients to get political, for it could cost them their audiences, especially in red states. While this might not matter much for this season’s smaller films like “Moonlight” or “Loving,” it could hurt films with bigger   ambitions, or television shows with outspoken stars. This year, though, Hollywood doesn’t seem keen to hold back. At the Producers Guild Awards, presenters and winners emphasized religious freedom, empathy and diversity. Mr. Legend, a presenter at the PGAs and a star of “La La Land,” said he and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, had wrestled with attending given the larger national controversy afoot, and then drew cheers for declaring, “Our vision of America is directly antithetical to that of President Trump. ” Then came the SAG Awards, which are way more lustrous, for they dole out prizes to glamorous actors and are televised. If the night’s winners were not emboldened by, erm, Ashton Kutcher, who kicked off the ceremony by welcoming “everyone in airports that belong in my America,” they surely were by the first winner, Ms.  . A member of Hollywood royalty, and clearly comfortable in the spotlight as well as in her own skin, Ms.   made the political personal by revealing that her father had fled religious persecution in   France and by denouncing the immigrant ban as “ . ” This opened the door, making it O. K. for those who followed to speak out. And they did: Sarah Paulson, Bryan Cranston, Lily Tomlin, Emma Stone, David Harbour and Taraji P. Henson all made assorted impassioned pleas. The classiest one came from Mahershala Ali (“Moonlight”) who, in a quavering voice, spoke of how he and his Christian mother had overcome their differences after he converted to Islam 17 years ago. Mr. Ali is favored to win the Oscar for best supporting actor, and his speech, perhaps the night’s most quietly profound, all but made that certain. If there was one consequence Mr. Trump probably didn’t foresee from his travel ban, it would be helping a Muslim American secure an Academy Award. Whether all of this portends a night of politicizing come the Academy Awards, on Feb. 26, depends on whether controversies set off by the White House or incendiary executive tweets settle down in the next three weeks. Will things calm down? Inshallah."
"What should we do? The world is rapidly approaching 1.5C of warming above pre-industrial levels − the target limit of the Paris agreement − and is on track for 3C unless we take action. So what is the best action to take? In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted that to have a good chance of limiting heating to 1.5C, we should reach net-zero CO2 emissions by around 2050, give or take five years. In fact, for any stable climate we’ll need to reach net-zero emissions at some point in our future.  But net zero is the destination, not the journey. It doesn’t tell us how to get there. The idea of “net-zero emissions” exists because “zero emissions” is too hard − we will use some fossil fuels for the foreseeable future, so we must also suck them out of the air using so-called negative-emissions technologies. The best-known negative-emission technology? A tree. There are also more ancient kinds. Earlier this month, a study explored the possibility of sprinkling a mineral compound over the world’s fields to draw carbon dioxide from the air above. So far, so science fiction. But the compound is just volcanic basalt rock ground into dust, and the chemical reaction is weathering, which is a process as old as the Earth. When carbon dioxide in the air dissolves into raindrops, it reacts with rocks when it falls, and the leftover compounds are washed into the oceans. These compounds are used to build shells and corals, and eventually bright-white limestone like the cliffs of Dover. Slowly, inevitably, this draws CO2 from the air and locks it up for hundreds of thousands of years. Enhanced weathering is the name for accelerating this process to human timescales, by grinding the rocks into dust. The process would even improve the soil, potentially helping to reduce food insecurity in countries that adopted it. The idea is not new, and basalt is not the only suitable rock. A non-profit organisation called Project Vesta, for example, hopes to spread the mineral olivine over beaches to mimic the green-sand beaches found in Hawaii and the Galápagos Islands. But as Phil Holden, co-author of the basalt study (and my colleague), points out: “A key aspect of this paper is the framing of enhanced rock weathering technology in realistic and achievable assumptions, which includes the use of realistic and achievable energy and climate projections.” Is basalt the magic fairy dust to take us to net zero? The team, led by David Beerling, predicted it could remove up to 2bn tonnes of CO2 from the air each year, using mostly waste dust from mining. Strangely, this number − a 5.5% decrease in emissions − is the same as the predicted impacts of the worldwide Covid-19 lockdown this year. As time goes by and our emissions drop, it would become a bigger proportion, potentially saving 12% of the remaining carbon budget for staying below the 2C of heating agreed at Paris. That’s a respectable chunk: but it can’t be the only answer. Other ways to remove carbon dioxide appear, at first glance, to be more effective. The most well known use the Earth’s biological processes, growing trees and plants and locking away the carbon in their leaves and wood. The IPCC noted last year that some estimates for planting widespread forests reached the equivalent of 10bn tonnes of CO2 a year by 2050. Using crops as fuels and capturing the CO2 could reach 11bn tonnes, and burying charcoal in soil up to 6bn tonnes. But these numbers need to be interpreted with great caution: not only are they extremely uncertain but each maximum represents an incredible, impractical amount of land. Weathering doesn’t use up vast tracts of land but it has its own challenges. Much of the research has been theoretical, so more experiments are needed. It will require public support, and this may depend on perceptions, such as how “natural” it is. Understanding how weathering mimics the Earth’s own CO2 regulation system might help with this. Some also fear that extracting CO2 from the air might reduce the incentive to decrease our emissions. But weathering is not a cheap, easy fix. Beerling’s team estimated it would cost $80-180 (£64-£143) to extract each tonne of CO2. It’s cheaper not to emit the stuff in the first place: costing around $20-100 to avoid a tonne of CO2 by replacing coal with low-carbon energy. Given all these pros and cons, what should we do? The answer is: all of the above. We can’t choose CO2 extraction as an alternative to reducing emissions, because we don’t know any way to do it that is quick, effective and cheap enough, while also using low energy, water and land. Negative-emissions technologies cannot be the single solution to climate change: they are necessary, but not sufficient. They only offer a way to scrub the last few stubborn tonnes of CO2 from the air that we can’t avoid emitting. One prediction cited in the basalt study suggested this might be only 2bn tonnes a year − perhaps small enough for weathering alone to deal with − because of the transition to low-carbon technology and new climate policies. But, as the IPCC said in 2018, we cannot escape the fact that limiting global warming to 1.5C would require “rapid and far-reaching transitions” in energy, land, urban infrastructure and industry. The point is that there will be no silver bullet for climate change. No easy choice for the best action to take, no get-out-of-jail-free card. We have left it too late for that: we need to do (almost) everything, and fast. • Dr Tamsin Edwards is a senior lecturer in physical geography at King’s College London"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe news of VW seemingly being caught red-handed rigging emissions tests of its diesel-powered vehicles has hit like a bombshell. The Wolfsburg, Germany based automaker is reeling like never before.
The U.S. Department of Justice is launching a criminal probe, and potential penalties of up to $18 billion may be imposed. The criminal prosecution of VW top managers and engineers for fraud are likely looming.
According to reports, VW engineers tricked the emissions testing software so that it would hide the incline, and thus delivered the results that the company and regulators wanted to see.
Already many are accusing the company of defrauding the public and its customers, engaging in criminal activity, and even committing green high crimes. This is really serious trouble for VW. So what strategy should VW use to defend itself?
Perhaps they ought to take a page or two out of the Climategate Playbook, where thousands of leaked e-mails indicated climate scientists were manipulating data, dubiously splicing datasets, hiding code and even corrupting the peer review process. Following the strategy used in the wake of Climategate, VW should:
1. Claim that the accusers aren’t real automotive experts, and so they shouldn’t be taken seriously.
2. Claim it’s a Nobel Peace Prize winner.
3. Point out that the “emissions trick” is “just a clever mathematical trick to hide” the emissions incline.
4. Set up three “independent” high-ranking commissions – all made up of close VW partners, suppliers and “real experts”, with the task of investigating the allegations.
5. Put out a statement saying that the company is so depressed that it is even having thoughts of committing suicide.
6. Issue an official report from all three commissions exonerating VW, claiming that though the company’s methods were controversial, the vehicles are still all within the spirit of industry standards.

7. Insist that the engineering behind VW diesel engines “is robust” and that their vehicles are among the cleanest cars in the world.
8. Insist that they are the target of a vast conspiracy, all led by Ford, GM and the fossil fuels industry –  and that they are the ones who really need to be investigated.
9. Get 20 leading academics to write a letter demanding the Department of Justice investigate Ford, GM and the fossil fuels industry for obstructing the production of fuel-efficient cars.
10. File defamation lawsuits against any journalists or experts who point out your alleged misconduct, or evidence thereof.
Indeed there are many other strategies that can be borrowed from the Climategate playbook.
Unfortunately the company’s top executives already publicly opened their mouths and appeared to admit guilt, and so they may have unnecessarily complicated or even damaged their case. VW chief Winterkorn said he was “deeply sorry” and ordered an investigation.
Moreover Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, head of VW’s Center of Automotive Research in Germany, said: “This disaster is beyond all expectations.” Disaster? Why? Everyone knows VW makes some of the best and cleanest cars in the world. Why should that be a “disaster”?
Before making such comments VW’s top brass should have first consulted with their technical experts on the matter – and acquired the damage control services of Mann, Jones & Muller.
The strategy was effective for the Climategate scientists, and so it should do the trick for VW.
===============================
PS: Personally I think this is mostly political and it is a first shot in a coming war against the automotive industry and our private mobility. Overall VW cars are clean, well-built, safe, fuel-efficient and reliable cars. I’ve owned 3 in my life and was completely satisfied. The whole affair to me stinks of government attacking one company on behalf of another (or others).

However, after a series of measles outbreaks in 2019, Facebook - which owns Instagram - said it would start directing users to reliable information from the World Health Organization (WHO) when they searched or visited relevant content.
Twitter and YouTube also took measures the same year to steer users away from related conspiracy theories.
However, the platforms tightened their rules after the outbreak of Covid-19.
Facebook said it would remove posts that could lead to physical harm, and would apply warning labels to other relevant posts debunked by fact-checkers.
Twitter said it would remove coronavirus-related posts that could cause widespread panic and/or social unrest, and add warning messages to other disputed or misleading information about the pandemic.
And YouTube said it had banned content about Covid-19 that posed a ""serious risk of egregious harm"" or contradicted medical information given by the WHO and local health authorities.
CCDH said a total of 912 items posted by anti-vaccine protesters that it had judged to have fallen foul of the companies' Covid-19 rules were flagged to the firms between July and August.
Of these:
Among the examples of material that CCDH said was not tackled were:
CCDH added that about one in 10 of all examples made reference to conspiracy theories involving Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, including suggestions that he wanted people to be fitted with microchips that would cause them to starve if they refused a vaccine.
Facebook responded by saying it had taken ""aggressive steps to limit the spread of misinformation"" about Covid-19, including the removal of more than seven million items and the addition of warning labels to a further 98 million pieces of misinformation.
Twitter said that while it did not take action on every tweet containing disputed information about the virus, it did prioritise those that had a call to action that could cause harm.
""Our automated systems have challenged millions of accounts which were targeting discussions around Covid-19 with spammy or manipulative behaviours,"" it added.
And Google said that it had taken a number of steps to ""combat harmful misinformation"", including banning some clips and displaying fact-checking panels alongside others.
But CCDH's chief executive said politicians and regulators in the US and UK must now force the firms into tougher action.
""This is an immediate crisis, with a ticking time bomb about to go off in our societies,"" said Imran Ahmed.
""Social media companies... do not listen to polite requests for change. Given the acute nature of the coronavirus crisis, their failure to act must now be met with real consequences.""
London-based CCDH is funded by the Pears Foundation, Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and Barrow Cadbury Trust, as well as others the group says do do not want to be named in case they are targeted as a result.
Public health experts warn that coronavirus vaccine conspiracy theories spread quickly online and pose a grave threat to all of us.
If a significant number of people decide not to take a safe and approved vaccine, our ability to suppress the disease will be limited.
It's legitimate to have concerns that a vaccine is safe and properly tested. It's also legitimate to want to discuss this in private chats or online.
But claims a coronavirus vaccine will be a tool for mass surveillance or genocide only do harm.
The theories are often spread by popular pseudo-science figures and large Facebook pages notorious for promoting disinformation.
They then drip into the average person's feeds and are sometimes amplified by celebrities, sowing seeds of doubt.
The social media firms say they are taking action, but critics say that if they don't do more - whether voluntarily or under compulsion - they could contribute to a public health disaster."

In a [recent post](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/11/14/170-years-of-earth-surface-temperature-data-show-no-evidence-of-significant-warming/) at WUWT, Thomas K. Bjorklund **,** University of Houston, Dept. of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences suggests that from 1850 to the present, the warming of the surface of the earth is less than 0.07 degrees C per decade which does not correlate with the rate of increase of CO2 into the atmosphere but is more likely to reflect 40 years of increasing intensities of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate pattern.



Using one of the official temperature data sets with a long time series in order to compensate for short period fluctuations they calculated the temperature anomalies from the 1961 – 1990 baseline. This reduces location based effects from individual measurement stations.



What makes this analysis different is that instead of just looking at the anomalies and the trend in those anomalies, this study calculates the rate of change of the trend. (Otherwise known as the first derivative of the trendline.) 



The green curve is a time-series of the month-to-month differences in mean surface temperatures in units of degrees Celsius change per month. These very small numbers are multiplied by 120 to convert the units to degrees per decade (left vertical axis of the graph). Degrees per decade is a measure of the **rate** at which the earth’s surface is cooling or warming.



In a recent talk, John Christy (May 8, 2019), director of the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, reported estimates of noise-free earth warming in 1994 and 2017 of 0.09 and 0.095 degrees C per decade, respectively. The 2017 average value for the green curve is 0.154: this value is 0.059 degrees per decade higher than the UAH estimate. The latest value in August 2019 for the green curve is 0.125 degrees C per decade. **The average degrees C per decade value of earth warming based on the green curve over 2,032 months since 1850 is 0.068 degrees C per decade**. The average rate of warming from 1850 through 1979, to the beginning of the most recent El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), is 0.038 degrees C per decade.



A warming rate of 0.038 degrees C per decade would need to significantly increase or decrease to support a prediction of a long-term change in the earth’s surface temperature. **If the earth’s surface temperature increased continuously starting today at a rate of 0.038 degrees C per decade, in 100 years the increase in the earth’s temperature would be only 0.4 degrees C., which is not indicative of a global warming threat to humankind.**



The 0.038 degrees C per decade estimate is likely beyond the accuracy of the temperature measurements from 1850 to 1979. Recent statistical analyses conclude that 95% uncertainties of global annual mean surface temperatures range between 0.05 degrees C to 0.15 degrees C over the past 140 years; that is, 95 measurements out 100 are expected to be within the range of uncertainty estimates (Lenssen, N. J. L., et al. 2019). **Very little measurable warming of the surface of the earth has occurred from 1850 to 1979.**



“So what about CO2 then?” Excellent question, Smithers! Let’s get rid of everything else except the green line and compare that to CO2 increases, as we all KNOW that CO2 is the evil culprit.



So what gives? And why is the green curve ‘S’ shaped? The author zooms in on the recent years that the global warming scam has been pushed and takes a closer look.



In Figure 3, the December 1979 temperature spike (Point A) is associated with a weak El Nino event. During the following 39 years, five strong to very strong intensity El Nino events are recorded; the last one, in 2015-2016, the highest intensity El Nino ever recorded (Goldengate Weather Services. (2019). The highest ever mean global monthly temperature anomaly of 1.111 degrees C was recorded in February 2016. Since then, monthly global temperature anomalies declined 35 percent to a temperature of 0.724 degrees C in August 2019 as the El Nino decreased in intensity. 



Points A, B and C mark very significant changes in the shape of the green warming curve (values on left vertical axis).



1\. The green curve values increased each month from 0.085 degrees C per decade in December 1979 (Point A) to 0.136 degrees C per decade in July 1988 (Point B); this is a 60 percent increase in rate of warming in nearly 9 years. The warming curve is concave upward **.** Point A marks a weak El Nino and the beginning of increasing ENSO intensity.



2\. From July 1988 to September 2006, the rate of warming increased from 0.136 degrees C per decade to 0.211 degrees per decade (Point C); this is a 55 percent increase in 18 years but about one-half the total rate of the previous 9 years because of a decrease in the rate of increase each month. The July 1988 point on the x-axis is an inflexion point at which the warming curve becomes concave downward.



3\. September 2006 (Point C) marks a very strong El Nino and the peak of the nearly 40-year ENSO transient warming trend, imparting a lazy S shape to the green curve. The rate of warming has declined every month since peaking at 0.211 degrees per decade in September 2006 to 0.125 in August 2019; this is a 41 percent decrease in 13 years.

The UK online Register here reports that the technology guru is not impressed by fad renewable energies wind and sun: “Renewable energy can’t do the job. Gov should switch green subsidies into R&D“.
Moreover Gates thinks they “aren’t a viable solution for reducing CO2 levels” and that power coming mainly from solar and wind energy “would be beyond astronomical“.
Gates made the comments in an interview with the Financial Times. The Register reports:
As for a possible solution for energy with low CO2 emissions, Gates thinks the answer lies in technology innovation. The Register writes: In Bill Gates’ view, the answer is for governments to divert the massive sums of money which are currently funnelled to renewables owners to R&D instead.
Gates also believes that divesture from oil and coal companies will have little impact, and that batteries for storing the sporadic supplies of wind and sun energy are not the answer. Part of the answer, Gates believes, is in nuclear power.

"All homes built from 2022 onwards would be carbon neutral under a Labour government, according to a recent election pledge by the party. Labour has also promised to guarantee “warm homes for all”, by retrofitting the UK’s 27m houses with insulation, double-glazed windows, heat pumps and solar panels, to help them save and produce at least as much energy as they use, effectively neutralising their contribution to the climate crisis.  At the moment, that contribution is surprisingly large – heating and energy use in homes accounts for 18% of the UK’s total carbon emissions. Decarbonising housing is an urgent task and will require a herculean effort – are Labour’s plans up to the job? There’s at least no shortage of potential providers for new, zero-energy homes. Councils could choose to build the houses themselves or work in partnership with private developers and housing associations – non-profit organisations which rent affordable accommodation to people on low incomes or with particular needs. In order to make all new homes carbon neutral by 2022, all builders and developers would need to play their part.

      A hundred years of social housing: how standards and quality got lost along the way


 Retrofitting all existing houses is estimated to cost about £250 billion, of which Labour pledges £60 billion in public subsidy. This would mean government investment would only cover 24% of the estimated cost, with the rest expected to come from “energy savings” down the line.  Meanwhile, councils and housing associations are already under strain to deliver enough affordable housing. In recent years, the amount of investment that the Conservative government has been willing to commit to building houses, through grants to housing associations and councils, has dwindled.  If they want to build new homes, housing associations are expected to build properties for private sale or rent and invest their profits into building social housing – that is, homes that are let for below-market rents.  But this policy of cross-subsidy hasn’t delivered the number of affordable homes that are needed. A public commitment to fund the delivery of environmental standards in existing and new-build homes will be necessary to ensure Labour’s plans don’t fall short. But what could a future of zero-energy social housing look like? In July 2019, a council housing scheme in Norwich called Goldsmith Street won the prestigious Stirling Prize for architecture for its eco-friendly design and for providing 100% social housing. Residents report lower energy bills – as low as £150 a year in some cases – and plenty of green space.    The houses have much thicker insulation than normal, triple glazing and mechanical ventilation which can recover and circulate waste heat. Similar grand designs have offered glimpses of how homes might be greener, but Goldsmith Street’s commitment to social housing could help meet the drastic need for more affordable homes. So how could this tantalising vision become the norm? The answer might seem obvious: make it the law. But the UK construction sector is highly fragmented – and different subcontractors are often responsible for the walls, roof and electricity in a single house. This makes quality control difficult. There’s also a skills shortage, especially when it comes to the detailed knowledge required to build a zero-energy house. And if energy-consuming extras such as underfloor heating or electrically driven windows are added, the energy savings from design may be lost. 


      Read more:
      Climate change means we can't keep living (and working) in glass houses


 One solution might be to mandate the use of Passivhaus Certification, as architects did on Goldsmith Street. Under this scheme, contractors must have the right qualifications and the energy modelling – which determines if a home will truly produce as much energy as it consumes – must be completed in a highly prescribed manner. A guarantee that the correct insulation and other features have been delivered and fitted must be rigorously reported to a third party.  While there are costs involved with this, certified Passivhaus homes typically have heating bills that are one-tenth of the UK average, meaning that residents of a three-bedroom semi-detached house could expect heating bills of around £50 per annum.  Most people would pay more for a car that came with free petrol for life, which is close to what a zero-energy home is. But people will need to believe this is what they will get. More than 40,000 such buildings have been delivered across Europe, and Passivhaus was the route to low-energy construction that Belgium chose.  But Passivhaus only works if the right design decisions are made from day one. If an architect starts by drawing a large window for example, then the energy loss from it might well be so great that any amount of insulation elsewhere can’t offset it. Architects don’t often welcome this intrusion of physics into the world of art. In other industries – high-performance car design for example – the need to work with physics to reduce drag also affords an attractive, low and sleek look. Architects and building engineers aren’t often taught together in the UK, and engineering is rarely included in architecture degrees. Our team at the University of Bath is working on simple energy modelling tools that could help architects incorporate these principles in their designs. To take Labour’s plans from their blueprints and on to streets in the UK, an incoming government will need funding to roll out new homes and retrofit old ones. It will need to introduce regulation to ensure all homes are brought up to standard and drive a revolution in what architects currently consider acceptable for how houses should look and feel. That’s a tall order – but decarbonising each component of society will take nothing short of a revolution.

WRITTEN TESTIMONY TO THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND TECHNOLOGY. MAY 29, 2014
From: http://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/HHRG-113-SY-WState-DBotkin-20140529.pdf
DANIEL B. BOTKIN
Since 1968 I have published research on theoretical global warming, its potential ecological effects, and the implications for people and biodiversity. I have spent my career trying to help conserve our environment and its great diversity of species. In doing so I have always attempted to maintain an objective, intellectually honest, scientific approach in the best tradition of scientific endeavor. I have, accordingly, been dismayed and disappointed in recent years that this subject has been converted into a political and ideological debate. I have colleagues on both sides of the debate and believe we should work together as scientists instead of arguing divisively about preconceived, emotionally based “positions.” I hope my testifying here will help lead to a calmer, more rational approach to dealing with not only climate change but also other major environmental problems. The IPCC 2014 report does not have this kind of rational discussion we should be having. I would like to tell you why.
The IPCC 2014 report is actually a series of reports, each long, complex in organization, and extensive in scope. Since it’s not possible to discuss the Summary Reports for Policymakers in detail today, I will highlight some of my thoughts for you here as they relate to the reports, hoping to bring a saner, more sober approach to this highly charged issue.
To characterize where we are with this report and this issue, I would like to quote James R. Schlesinger, the first U.S. Energy Secretary, who said: “We have only two modes — complacency and panic.”—commenting on the country’s approach to energy (1977)
Now to my major points.
1. I want to state up front that we have been living through a warming trend driven by a variety of influences. However, it is my view that this is not unusual, and contrary to the characterizations by the IPCC and the National Climate Assessment, these environmental changes are not apocalyptic nor irreversible.
2. My biggest concern is that both the reports present a number of speculative, and sometimes incomplete, conclusions embedded in language that gives them more scientific heft than they deserve. The reports are “scientific-sounding” rather than based on clearly settled facts or admitting their lack. Established facts about the global environment exist less often in science than laymen usually think.
3. HAS IT BEEN WARMING? Yes, we have been living through a warming trend, no doubt about that. The rate of change we are experiencing is also not unprecedented, and the “mystery” of the warming “plateau” simply indicates the inherent complexity of our global biosphere. Change is normal, life on Earth is inherently risky; it always has been. The two reports, however, makes it seem that environmental change is apocalyptic and irreversible. It is not.
4. IS CLIMATE CHANGE VERY UNUSUAL? No, it has always undergone changes.
5. ARE GREENHOUSE GASES INCREASING? Yes, CO2 rapidly.
6. IS THERE GOOD SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON CLIMATE CHANGE? Yes, a great deal of it.
7. ARE THERE GOOD SCIENTISTS INVOLVED IN THE IPCC 2014 REPORT? Yes, the lead author of the Terrestrial (land) Ecosystem Report is Richard Betts, a coauthor of one my scientific papers about forecasting effects of global warming on biodiversity.
8. ARE THERE SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE STATEMENTS AT PLACES IN THE REPORT? Yes, there are.
9. What I sought to learn was the overall take-away that the reports leave with a reader. I regret to say that I was left with the impression that the reports overestimate the danger from human-induced climate change and do not contribute to our ability to solve major environmental problems. I am afraid that an “agenda” permeates the reports, an implication that humans and our activity are necessarily bad and ought to be curtailed.
10. ARE THERE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE REPORTS? Yes, in assumptions, use of data, and conclusions.
11. My biggest concern about the reports is that they present a number of speculative, and sometimes incomplete, conclusions embedded in language that gives them more scientific heft than they deserve. The reports, in other words, are “scientific- sounding,” rather than clearly settled and based on indisputable facts. Established facts about the global environment exist less often in science than laymen usually think.
12. The two reports assume and/or argue that the climate warming forecast by the global climate models is happening and will continue to happen and grow worse. Currently these predictions are way off the reality (Figure 1). Models, like all scientific theory, have to be tested against real-world observations. Experts in model validation say that the climate models frequently cited in the IPCC report are little if any validated. This means that as theory they are fundamentally scientifically unproven.
Figure 1: Climate model forecasts compared to real world temperature observations (From John Christy, University of Alabama and Alabama State Climatologist. Reproduced with permission from him.)

13. The reports suffers from the use term “climate change” with two meanings: natural and human-induced. These are both given as definitions in the IPCC report and are not distinguished in the text and therefore confuse a reader. (The Climate Change Assessment uses the term throughout including its title, but never defines it.) There are places in the reports where only the second meaning—human induced—makes sense, so that meaning has to be assumed. There are other places where either meaning could be applied.
In those places where either meaning can be interpreted, if the statement is assumed to be a natural change, then it is a truism, a basic characteristic of Earth’s environment and something people have always know and experienced. If the meaning is taken to be human-caused, then in spite of the assertions in the report, the available data do not support the statements.
14. Some of the reports conclusions are the opposite of those given in articles cited in defense of those conclusions.
For example, the IPCC 2014 Terrestrial Ecosystem Report states that “there is medium confidence that rapid change in the Arctic is affecting its animals. For example, seven of 19 subpopulations of the polar bear are declining in number” citing in support of this an article by Vongraven and Richardson, 2011. That report states the contrary, that the “‘decline’ is an illusion.
In addition, I have sought the available counts of the 19 subpopulations. Of these, only three have been counted twice; the rest have been counted once. Thus no rate of changes in the populations can be determined. The first count was done 1986 for one subpopulation.1
The U. S. Marine Mammal Commission, charged with the conservation of this species, acknowledges “Accurate estimates of the current and historic sizes of polar bear stocks are difficult to obtain for several reasons–the species‘ inaccessible habitat, the movement of bears across international boundaries, and the costs of conducting surveys.”2
According to Dr. Susan Crockford, “out of the 13 populations for which some kind of data exist, five populations are now classified by the PBSG [IUCN/SSC Polar Bear Specialist Group] as ‘stable’ (two more than 2009), one is still increasing, and three have been upgraded from ‘declining’ to ‘data deficient’. . . . That leaves four that are still considered ‘declining’‐ two of those judgments are based primarily on concerns of overhunting, and one is based on a statistically insignificant decline that may not be valid and is being reassessed (and really should have been upgraded to ‘data deficient’). That leaves only one population – Western Hudson Bay – where PBSG biologists tenaciously blame global warming for all changes to polar bear biology, and even then, the data supporting that conclusion is still not available.3“
Polar Bear Status (Source: Polar Bear Science Website.)
 
15. Some conclusions contradict and are ignorant of the best statistically valid observations. For example, the Terrestrial Ecosystems Report states that “terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems have sequestered about a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere by human activities in the past three decades (high confidence).” I have done the first statistically valid estimate of carbon storage and uptake for any large area of Earth’s land, the boreal forests and eastern deciduous forest of North America, and subtropical forests in Queensland, Australia. The estimates of carbon uptake by vegetation used by IPCC and in major articles cited by the reports are based on what can best be called “grab samples,” a relatively small number of studies done at a variety of times using a variety of methods, mainly in old- growth areas. The results reported by IPCC overestimate carbon storage and uptake by as much as 300 percent.4
16. The report for policy makers on Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability repeats
the assertion of previous IPCC reports that “large fraction of species” face “increase extinction risks” (p15). Overwhelming evidence contradicts this assertion. And it has been clearly shown that models used to make these forecasts, such as climate envelope models and species-area curve models, make incorrect assumptions that lead to erroneous conclusions, over-estimating extinction risks.
Surprisingly few species became extinct during the past 2.5 million years, a period encompassing several ice ages and warm periods.5 Among other sources, this is based on information in the book Climate Change and Biodiversity edited by Thomas Lovejoy, one of the leaders in the conservation of biodiversity.6 The major species
known to have gone extinct during this period are 40 species of large mammals in North America and Northern Europe. (There is a “background” extinction rate for eukaryotic species of roughly one species per year.)
17. THE REPORT GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT LIVING THINGS ARE FRAGILE AND RIGID, unable to deal with change. The opposite is to case. Life is persistent, adaptable, adjustable.
18. STEADY-STATE ASSUMPTION: There is an overall assumption in the IPCC 2014 report and the Climate Change Assessment that all change is negative and undesirable; that it is ecologically and evolutionarily unnatural, bad for populations, species, ecosystems, for all life on planet Earth, including people. This is the opposite of the reality: The environment has always changed and is always changing, and living things have had to adapt to these changes. Interestingly, many, if not most, species that I have worked on or otherwise know about require environmental change.7
19. The summary for policy makers on Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability makes repeated use of the term “irreversible” changes. A species going extinct is irreversible, but little else about the environment is irreversible. The past confirms this. Glaciers have come and gone repeatedly. The Northwest Passage of North America has gone and come again. The average temperature has greatly exceeded the present and forecasted and has declined only to rise again.
a. Implicit in this repeated use of irreversible is the belief that Earth’s environment is constant — stable, unchanging — except when subjected to human actions.
This is obviously false from many lines of evidence, including the simple
experience of all people who have lived before the scientific-industrial age and those who live now and so such work as farm, manage rivers, wildlife and forests.
20. The extreme overemphasis on human-induced global warming has taken our attention away from many environmental issues that used to be front and center but have been pretty much ignored in the 21st century. The Terrestrial report in a sense acknowledges this, for example by stating: “Climate stresses occur alongside other anthropogenic influences on ecosystems, including land-use changes, nonnative species, and pollution, and in many cases will exacerbate these pressures (very high confidence).”

21. Do the problems with these reports mean that we can or should abandon any concerns about global warming or abandon any research about it? Certainly not, but we need to put this issue within an appropriate priority with other major here-and-now environmental issues that are having immediate effects.
22. The concerns I have mentioned with the IPCC apply as well to the White House’s National Climate Assessment. I reviewed and provided comments on the draft White House’s National Climate assessment and, unfortunately, it appears that these issues have not been addressed in the final assessment. For example, I stated:
“The executive summary is a political statement, not a scientific statement. It is filled with misstatements contradicted by well-established and well-known scientific papers.”
“Climate has always affected people and all life on Earth, so it isn’t new to say it is ‘already affecting the American people.’ This is just a political statement.”
“It is inappropriate to use short-term changes in weather as an indication one way or another about persistent climate change.”
WHAT HAS GONE WRONG, AND HOW TO FIX IT
1. Rather than focus on key, specific and tractable aspects of climate-change science, the long-term approach throughout the 20th century was to try to create de nova a complete model of the climate.
2. This approach has been taken despite a lack of focus on monitoring key variables over time in statistically and scientifically valid ways, e. g. carbon sequestering by forests; polar bear population counts. As a result, there is an odd disconnect between theory and observation. The attempt to create complete models of every aspect of climate has meant that many factors had to be guessed at, rather than using the best scientific methods. Too many guesses, too little checking against real, observed effects.
3. The IPCC reports are the result of a very large number of people doing long reviews of the scientific literature. This easily leads to people being so overburdened that they misinterpret specific papers, fail to understand where the major observational gaps are, and have trouble making an accurate list of citations and all sources of information. The fundamental IPCC and White House Climate Change Assessment approach has been to gather a huge number of scientists from a large number of disciplines, on the assumption that a kind of crowd approach to what can be agreed on is the same as true scientific advance. While this might seem a reasonable and effective approach, there is some danger in relying on this “crowd-sourced” model of information sharing. Groups of people, particularly when credentialed “experts” are involved, are very prone to a condition called an “information cascade” in which error is compounded by group think, assumptions become unchallenged “fact” and observations play second fiddle to unchallenged models. The excellent scientists involved with the IPCC reports are no less prone to this than the excellent scientists who relied on Aristotelian models of a geocentric universe. Entrenched beliefs are hard to extricate, even amongst supposedly rational thinkers. This is probably in part responsible for the problems listed with the White House Climate Assessment report’s table of Biological Effects, discussed in my document reviewing that report.
4. What a scientist discovers is different from what a scientist says. The first is science, the second is opinion. Have small groups of scientists work on this problem, no more than can easily argue with one another, that is less than 20 and preferably even smaller, representing the primary disciplines. Divide the problem into areas, rather than try to answer all questions in one analysis. I have used this approach in my own work and found it to be successful.8, 9
5. The desire to do good has ironically overridden the desire to do the best science.
6. Under the weight of this kind of crowd rule and approach, some specific alternative approaches to the science of climate change, have not been allowed to rise to the surface.
7. Among the approaches that would improve climate science:
a. Return to the former reliance on science done by individuals and small groups with a common specific interest and focus.
b. Change the approach from trying to make a complete, definitive model of
every aspect of climate to a different level. See kinds of models that explore specific possibilities and phenomena.
c. Get out of the blame game. None of the above suggestions can work as long as global warming remains a moral, political, ideologically dominated topic, with scientists pushed into, or at least viewed as, being either for or against a single point of view.
9. We need to focus again on major environmental Issues that need our attention now (see the list above).
10. ARE THERE EXAMPLES OF THE KIND OF RESEARCH I BELIEVE WE NEED MORE OF? YES.
a. NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS)
b. Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study
c. Whooping Crane monitoring, e.g. of an endangered species
d. In-place monitoring on carbon flux, being done by the USGS in the Great Cypress Swamp, Florida.
e. Many others.

REVIEW OF Climate Change Impacts in the United States: The Third National Climate Assessment. U.S. Global Change Research Program
Jerry M. Melillo, Terese (T.C.) Richmond, and Gary W. Yohe, Eds. 841 pp. doi:10.7930/J0Z31WJ2.
By Daniel B. Botkin: May 29, 2014
[Note regarding my connections with Jerry M. Melillo, one of the three primary editors of this report: When I was on the faculty of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, Jerry Melillo was a graduate student working on his doctorate and we interacted frequently.
Beginning in 1975, Jerry Melillo and I worked at the Ecosystems Center, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA, and we published four scientific papers together, listed at the end of this document.1
COMMENTS ON THE ASSESSMENT GENERAL COMMENTS:
The opening statement of the Assessment (p.1), reproduced here, is characteristic of the entire Assessment in that it violates one of the basic principles of good climatology — never use short-term weather changes as proof of climate change. Climatologists I have worked with over the decades have said this repeatedly. In 1962, when I was a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin working under a science writing fellowship, I spoke with Reed Bryson, said to be the father of the International Geophysical Year and the person who persuaded Richard Keeling to begin measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration on Mauna Loa, Hawaii. At that time Earth had been undergoing a global cooling since about 1940. At first Professor Bryson said “if present trends continue, we are entering a new ice age.” But when I drafted a press release that quoted him so, he thought about it carefully and told me that we could not make that statement, because this was just a short- term weather event.
In the 1980s, I worked closely with climatologist Stephen Schneider and we often gave talks at the same events. Steve, one of the leaders of the modern concern about a possible human-induced global warming, also said that you should never use short-term weather events to infer climate change. I agreed with these experts, and therefore was taken aback by the overall tone of the new White House Climate Change Assessment, which begins: “Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present. Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington State, and maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing climate-related changes that are outside of recent experience. So, too, are coastal planners in Florida, water managers in the arid Southwest, city dwellers from Phoenix to New York, and Native Peoples on tribal lands from Louisiana to Alaska. This National Climate Assessment concludes that the evidence of human-induced climate change continues to strengthen and that impacts are increasing across the country.
Based on what my climatologist colleagues had always told me, the Assessment should
have begun instead by stating: “Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington State, and maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing weather-related changes” outside of their personal recent experience. So, too, are coastal planners in Florida, water managers in the arid Southwest, city dwellers from Phoenix to New York, and Native peoples on tribal lands from Louisiana to Alaska.”
The Assessment concludes that opening paragraph by stating: This National Climate Assessment concludes that the evidence of human-induced climate change continues to strengthen and that impacts are increasing across the country.
Americans are noticing changes all around them. Summers are longer and hotter, and extended periods of unusual heat last longer than any living American has ever experienced. Winters are generally shorter and warmer. Rain comes in heavier downpours. People are seeing changes in the length and severity of seasonal allergies, the plant varieties that thrive in their gardens, and the kinds of birds they see in any particular month in their neighborhoods (p.1).
These opening paragraphs and several that follow directly communicate to the reader, both lay and professional, that human-induced global warming in an immediate disaster. For example:
Other changes are even more dramatic. Residents of some coastal cities see their streets flood more regularly during storms and high tides. Inland cities near large rivers also experience more flooding, especially in the Midwest and Northeast. Insurance rates are rising in some vulnerable locations, and insurance is no longer available in others. Hotter and drier weather and earlier snowmelt mean that wildfires in the West start earlier in the spring, last later into the fall, and burn more acreage. In Arctic Alaska, the summer sea ice that once protected the coasts has receded, and autumn storms now cause more erosion, threatening many communities with relocation.
Scientists who study climate change confirm that these observations are consistent with significant changes in Earth’s climatic trends. Long-term, independent records from weather stations, satellites, ocean buoys, tide gauges, and many other data sources all confirm that our nation, like the rest of the world, is warming. Precipitation patterns are changing, sea level is rising, the oceans are becoming more acidic, and the frequency and intensity of some extreme weather events are increasing (p. 1).
To be scientifically accurate, these paragraphs should instead have been written (my changes noted by underlining): Other weather changes are even more dramatic. Residents of some coastal cities see their streets flood more regularly during storms and high tides. Inland cities near large rivers also experience more flooding, especially in the Midwest and Northeast. Insurance rates are rising in some vulnerable locations, and insurance is no longer available in others. Hotter and drier weather and earlier snowmelt mean that wildfires in the West start earlier in the spring, last later into the fall, and burn more acreage. In Arctic Alaska, the summer sea ice that once protected the coasts has receded, and autumn storms now cause more erosion, threatening many communities with relocation.
Scientists who study weather and climate change point out that short-term, including several decades and longer, changes in weather do not confirm that these observations are consistent with significant changes in Earth’s climatic trends.
These opening statements are directly followed by: Many lines of independent evidence demonstrate that the rapid warming of the past half-century is due primarily to human activities. The observed warming and other climatic changes are triggering wide-ranging impacts in every region of our country and throughout our economy. Some of these changes can be beneficial over the short run, such as a longer growing season in some regions and a longer shipping season on the Great Lakes. But many more are detrimental, largely because our society and its infrastructure were designed for the climate that we have had, not the rapidly changing climate we now have and can expect in the future. In addition, climate change does not occur in isolation. Rather, it is superimposed on other stresses, which combine to create new challenges (p. 1). The assertions in this paragraph are based on the forecasts from climate models and from temperature records. However, Figure 1 shows that the climate models greatly exaggerate the rate and amount of temperature change and are not making forecasts that come even close to fitting the data. Furthermore, Figure 1 also shows that the average Earth temperature in the past 30 years has changed very little if at all, contradicting the assertions on the first page of the Assessment.
Figure 1: Climate model forecasts compared to real world temperature observations (From John Christy, University of Alabama and Alabama State Climatologist. Reproduced with permission from him.)

The Assessment further attributes the supposed climatic warming to human activities that are releasing greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. Therefore the claimed disaster is our fault. But recent evidence shows that temperature change is not tracking the increase in carbon dioxide. The gas has increased from 370 ppm to just over 400ppm, 8 percent, between year 2000 and year 2014 (Figure 2), while the temperature has changed either only slightly or not at all, depending on how one does the analysis (Figure 3). Instead, temperature change tracks closely changes in the energy output from the sun (Figure 4).
Figure 2. Mauna Loa Observatory CO2 measurements

Figure 3. Earth Surface Temperature Departure from 1950-1980 Average

Figure 4. Correlation Between Solar Irradiance and Poleward flux of energy.
Thus the Assessment’s early statements about the dangerous climate change have to do with a hypothetical, not a real, world.

The current evidence from scientific observations show that Earth’s temperature has not changed very much, if at all, since the start of the new century, while carbon dioxide has increased considerably.
Given these facts, the basic opening assertions of the new U.S. Climate Change Assessment are about a hypothetical world, not a real world, and must be taken as a “what if” rather than “what is”. Therefore the dire consequences forecast in the Assessment cannot be taken as reliable, nullifying many, if not most, of the ecological and biological implications the Assessment makes heavy use of.
The time available to write and the space available to publish as written testimony prevent a comprehensive, detailed review of the entire White House Climate Change Assessment. As a result, I have used as an example of the kinds of problems throughout the Assessment the table appearing on pages 204-5, Biological Responses To climate Change. As an ecologist, I have taken that table and reorganized it. This reorganization follows.
Although the document is titled “Climate Change Assessment,” the term “climate change” is not defined and is in fact used with two meanings, natural and human-induced. There are places in the Assessment where only the second meaning makes sense, so that meaning has to be assumed. There are other places where either meaning could be applied. In those places where either meaning can be interpreted, if the statement is assumed to be a natural change, then it is a truism, a basic characteristic of Earth’s environment and something people have always known and experienced. If the meaning is taken to be human-caused, then in spite of the assertions in the Assessment, the available data do not support the statements.
For example, the Assessment’s section titled CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE begins with the statement: Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present. Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington State, and maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing climate-related changes that are outside of recent experience.
If this is to be interpreted as natural, then people have frequently in history experienced
“climate-related changes that are outside of [their] recent experiences,” as the Medieval Warming and Little Ice Age demonstrate,2, 3, 4 and therefore it is not unusual nor unexpected in ordinary life. If this is to be interpreted to be human-induced, then the evidence just discussed demonstrates that this kind of change cannot be attributed to human actions and therefore the statement is false.
ANALYSIS OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ASSESSMENT TABLE OF
ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS (Assessment’s pages 204-205)
Biological responses to climate change
The Assessment presents a list of 30 biological responses to climate change. Since this is my particular area of expertise, I have analyzed this list and sorted the items into the following categories: Where the Assessment is wrong based on my understanding (10 items); Improvements (12 items); Declines (which can be taken as worsening) (No items); Predicted from Climate Models, Therefore Not Fact, especially given the failure of climate models to forecast with any reliability Earth’s increase in temperature since the 1990s (see figure 1) (3 items); and Unlikely or Unsupported Statement (5 items). Within the context of the Assessment, this table comes across as meaning to demonstrate more very negative effects of a human-induced global warming, but since upon analysis none of the 30 appears to be a legitimately supported decline that might occur under a hypothetical global warming or have been directly observed, this table in fact is an argument against the overall message of the Assessment.
(The number that appears at the beginning of each entry is the number in the Assessment’s list. The numbers following each of the Assessment’s entry are the citation number as listed in the Assessment. The Assessment’s statements are in italics; my comments appear in plain font.)
ASSESSMENT IS WRONG
1. 21. Seedling survival of nearly 20 resident and migrant tree species decreased during years of lower rainfall in the Southern Appalachians and the Piedmont areas, indicating that reductions in native species and limited replacement by invading species were likely under climate change.134 Since the climate models are admittedly weak about changes in rainfall, this statement has no relevance to purported human-induced global warming.
2. 27. Water temperature data and observations of migration behaviors over a 34-year time period showed that adult pink salmon migrated earlier into Alaskan creeks, and fry advanced the timing of migration out to sea. Shifts in migration timing may increase the potential for a mismatch in optimal environmental conditions for early life stages, and continued warming trends will likely increase pre-spawning mortality and egg mortality rates.87 Salmon have evolved and are adapted to environmental change.
3. 3. Conifers in many western forests have experienced mortality rates of up to 87% from warming-induced changes in the prevalence of pests and pathogens and stress from drought.118 Important causes of the mortality of trees in western forests are: fire suppression, which promotes insect and disease outbreaks, and from introduced (invasive) insects and diseases.
4. 8. Warmer and drier conditions during the early growing season in high-elevation
habitats in Colorado are disrupting the timing of various flowering patterns, with potential impacts on many important plant-pollinator relationships.77 “Disrupting” is a politically loaded term. The scientific term would be “changed” and this is a good sign, showing the adaptability of species to changing environments.
5. 12. Variation in the timing and magnitude of precipitation due to climate change was found to decrease the nutritional quality of grasses, and consequently reduce weight gain of bison in the Konza Prairie in Kansas and the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma.124. Results provide insight into how climate change will affect grazer population dynamics in the future. This is stated in a way that is not open to scientific evaluation. No doubt lower rainfall has negative effects, but the statement is “variation.” In fact, the publication cited (Craine et al., 2008)5 states that “Greater late-summer precipitation increased bison weight gain . . . “greater midsummer precipitation decreased weight gain.” This is a scientifically interesting result for those focused on wildlife in grasslands, but it is neither a negative nor positive in terms of global warming, because the forecasting models are weakest in forecasting rainfall even annually, let alone seasonally. Therefore these results cannot be taken as negative (nor positive) effects of a global rise in average temperature.
6. 10. Cutthroat trout populations in the western U.S. are projected to decline by up to 58%, and total trout habitat in the same region is projected to decline by 47%, due to increasing temperatures, seasonal shifts in precipitation, and negative interactions with nonnative species.8. Stresses on Cutthroat extend considerably beyond climate change and have to do with fishing intensity, water diversions and other habitat changes, such as competition from introduced, invasive species such as lake trout and rainbow trout.6
7. 28. Warmer springs in Alaska have caused earlier onset of plant emergence, and decreased spatial variation in growth and availability of forage to breeding caribou. This ultimately reduced calving success in caribou populations.138 The implication is that warming will necessarily have a negative effect on caribou, but the paper cited (Post et al., 2008) actually is much more cautious, stating “it is highly relevant to herbivore ecology to consider the manner in which warming will alter spatial patterns of plant phenology at more immediate spatial scales than that of the regional landscape. The paper concludes, cautiously: “ Large herbivores prefer newly emergent forage, presumably owing to the high digestibility and nutrient content of young plant tissues . . . future warming could conceivably impair the ability of herbivores such as caribou to forage selectively, with adverse consequences for their productivity.We suggest, therefore, that it is highly relevant to herbivore ecology to consider the manner in which warming will alter spatial patterns of plant phenology at more immediate spatial scales than that of the regional landscape.”7
There is again an inherent assumption that a steady-state between living things and climate is natural and necessary for a species’s persistent. Wildlife population can and do adjust to changes, but this can take some time. See the examples of current adjustments, which I have added below this table. Give the populations a little time to adjust.
8. 26. Changes in female polar bear reproductive success (decreased litter mass and numbers of yearlings) along the north Alaska coast have been linked to changes in body
size and/or body condition following years with lower availability of optimal sea ice habitat.137. There is evidence that polar bears are adjusting by feeding more on terrestrial prey. Contrary to the publicity about polar bears, there is little information demonstrating any statistically, scientifically valid decline in polar bear populations. I have sought the available counts of the 19 subpopulations. Of these, only three have been counted twice; the rest have been counted once. Thus no rate of change in the population is possible. The first count was done 1986 for one subpopulation.8
9. 7. Quaking aspen-dominated systems are experiencing declines in the western U.S. after stress due to climate induced drought conditions during the last decade.122 Anderegg,
W. R. L., J. M. Kane, and L. D. L. Anderegg, 2012: Consequences of widespread tree mortality triggered by drought and temperature stress. Nature Climate Change, 3, 30-36, doi:10.1038/nclimate1635. Given the failure of the climate models to predict temperature change and the observed lack of a significant recent rise in temperature, it is incorrect to refer to this as a “climate induced’ drought. Moreover, a thousand year tree- ring study shows that deep droughts are characteristic of California. Meteorologist Martin P. Hoerling wrote on March 8,2014 that “At present, the scientific evidence does not support an argument that the drought there is appreciably linked to human-induced climate change.” Hoerling is a research meteorologist, specializing in climate dynamics, at the Earth System Research Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the White House’s National Climate Assessment cites many of Hoerling’s papers, including figure 20.4 “Longer Frost-free Season Increases Stress on Crops,” so his work is respected by the authors.
10. 9. Population fragmentation of wolverines in the northern Cascades and Rocky Mountains is expected to increase as spring snow cover retreats over the coming century.123 The paper cited, Dawson et al. (2011)9, does not mention wolverines. And contrary to making a highly negative statement, the paper states Populations of many species have persisted in situ at individual sites since the last glacial maximum (toleration) and many have undergone habitat shifts, moving short distances (1 to 10 km) to sites with different aspects, slopes, elevations, and other attributes as the environment changed. Migrations of 100 to 1000 km are well documented for many species.
IMPROVEMENTS
1. 2. Northern flickers arrived at breeding sites earlier in the Northwest in response to temperature changes along migration routes, and egg laying advanced by 1.15 days for every degree increase in temperature, demonstrating that this species has the capacity to adjust their phenology in response to climate change.117
2. 11. Comparisons of historical and recent first flowering dates for 178 plant species from North Dakota showed significant shifts occurred in over 40% of species examined, with the greatest changes observed during the two warmest years of the study.75
3. 14. Migratory birds monitored in Minnesota over a 40-year period showed significantly earlier arrival dates, particularly in short-distance migrants, indicating that some species are capable of responding to increasing winter temperatures better than
others.126.
4. 15. Up to 50% turnover in amphibian species is projected in the eastern U.S. by 2100, including the northern leopard frog, which is projected to experience poleward and elevational range shifts in response to climatic changes in the latter quarter of the century.127
5. 16. Studies of black ratsnake (Elaphe obsoleta) populations at different latitudes in Canada, Illinois, and Texas suggest that snake populations, particularly in the northern part of their range, could benefit from rising temperatures if there are no negative impacts on their habitat and prey.128
6. 17. Warming-induced hybridization was detected between southern and northern flying squirrels in the Great Lakes region of Ontario, Canada, and in Pennsylvania after a series of warm winters created more overlap in their habitat range, potentially acting to increase population persistence under climate change.129
7. 18. Some warm-water fishes have moved northwards, and some tropical and subtropical fishes in the northern Gulf of Mexico have increased in temperate ocean habitat.130 Similar shifts and invasions have been documented in Long Island Sound and Narragansett Bay in the Atlantic.131
8. 23. Over the last 130 years (1880-2010), native bees have advanced their spring arrival in the northeastern U.S. by an average of 10 days, primarily due to increased warming. Plants have also showed a trend of earlier blooming, thus helping preserve the synchrony in timing between plants and pollinators.135
9. 24. In the Northwest Atlantic, 24 out of 36 commercially exploited fish stocks showed significant range (latitudinal and depth) shifts between 1968 and 2007 in response to increased sea surface and bottom temperatures.55
10. 25. Increases in maximum, and decreases in the annual variability of, sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean have promoted growth of small phytoplankton and led to a reorganization in the species composition of primary (phytoplankton) and secondary (zooplankton) producers.136
11. 29. Many Hawaiian mountain vegetation types were found to vary in their sensitivity to changes in moisture availability; consequently, climate change will likely influence elevation-related vegetation patterns in this region.139
12. 5. In response to climate-related habitat change, many small mammal species have altered their elevation ranges, with lower-elevation species expanding their ranges and higher-elevation species contracting their ranges.120
DECLINES
None.
PREDICTED FROM CLIMATE MODELS, THEREFORE NOT FACT
1. 30. Sea level is predicted to rise by 1.6 to 3.3 feet in Hawaiian waters by 2100, consistent with global projections of 1 to 4 feet of sea level rise (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10). This is projected to increase wave heights, the duration of turbidity, and the amount of re-suspended sediment in the water; consequently, this will create potentially stressful conditions for coral reef communities.140
2. 6. Northern spotted owl populations in Arizona and New Mexico are projected to decline during the next century and are at high risk for extinction due to hotter, drier conditions, while the southern California population is not projected to be sensitive to future climatic changes.121
3. 19. Global marine mammal diversity is projected to decline at lower latitudes and increase at higher latitudes due to changes in temperatures and sea ice, with complete loss of optimal habitat for as many as 11 species by midcentury; seal populations living in tropical and temperate waters are particularly at risk to future declines.132
UNLIKELY CORRELATION OR UNSUPPORTED STATEMENT
1. 13. (a and b) Climatic fluctuations were found to influence mate selection and increase the probability of infidelity in birds that are normally socially monogamous, increasing the gene exchange and the likelihood of offspring survival. 125
2. 20. Higher nighttime temperatures and cumulative seasonal rainfalls were correlated with changes in the arrival times of amphibians to wetland breeding sites in South Carolina over a 30-year time period (1978-2008).133 Of course. The time period precedes any possible effect of human-induced global warming, and the effect is a truism. Rainfall will affect amphibians. Since the climate models are admittedly weak about changes in rainfall, this statement has no relevance to purported human-induced global warming.
3. 22. Widespread declines in body size of resident and migrant birds at a bird-banding station in western Pennsylvania were documented over a 40-year period; body sizes of breeding adults were negatively correlated with mean regional temperatures from the preceding year.85 The citation for this statement is NatureServe, cited 2012: Ecosystem- based Management Tools Network. [Available online at www.ebmtools.org]. This is a general website. I used its search option and did not find bird-banding nor Pennsylvania, nor any reference to a study of bird-banding in Pennsylvania.
4. 4. Butterflies that have adapted to specific oak species have not been able to colonize new tree species when climate change-induced tree migration changes local forest types, potentially hindering adaptation.119 . The citation 119 in the Assessment is Aumen, N.,
L. Berry, R. Best, A. Edwards, K. Havens, J. Obeysekera, D. Rudnick, and M. Scerbo, 2013: Predicting Ecological Changes in the Florida Everglades Under a Future Climate Scenario, 33 pp., U.S. Geological Survey, Florida Sea Grant, Florida Atlantic University. [Available online at
http://www.ces.fau.edu/climate_change/ecology-february-2013/PECFEFCS_Report.pdf]. I searched this report and found no mention of butterflies. This is probably an inadvertent editing error and the authors of the Assessment meant to refer to some other paper, but since this is the actual listing, the statement is unsupported.
5. 1. Mussel and barnacle beds have declined or disappeared along parts of the Northwest coast due to higher temperatures and drier conditions that have compressed habitable intertidal space.116. The citation listed is Burke, L., L. Reytar, M. Spalding, and A. Perry, 2011: Reefs at Risk Revisited. World Resources Institute, 130 pp. [Available online at http://pdf.wri.org/reefs_at_risk_revisited.pdf]. I searched this citation and did not find any mention of the words mussel or barnacle and the only mention of
“northwest” was “northwestern Hawaii.” Again this is likely a typographic error, but no other statement in the Assessment brought me to a relevant paper either, so the statement is unsupported by the report.
SOME OTHER EXAMPLES OF SPECIFIC STATEMENTS THAT ARE INCORRECT, OR OVERSTATED, OR LIMITED TO A FEW SPECIFIC CASES, OR OTHERWISE OF DOUBTFUL GENERALITY
Given the length of the just-released White House Climate Change Assessment and the time available to review it, I am able to consider only a few examples of other specific problems with the Assessment. I have focused on those that have to do with biological factors. These, however, are representative of problems throughout the Assessment. (Once again, the material in italics is quotes from the Assessment; the material in standard font is my text.)
Cores from corals, ocean sediments, ice records, and other indirect temperature measurements indicate the recent rapid increase of ocean temperature is the greatest that has occurred in at least the past millennium and can only be reproduced by climate models with the inclusion of human-caused sources of heat-trapping gas emissions (p. 559). As we saw earlier, the climate models are not coming even close to forecasting air temperature change, and therefore could not be expected to forecast accurately changes in ocean temperature, so it is not correct to say that something “can only be reproduced by climate models with the inclusion of human-caused sources of heat-trapping gas emissions.”
Warmer air and ocean temperatures are also causing the continued, dramatic decline in Arctic sea ice during the summer (panel D) (p. 560). We published a paper comparing Arctic sea ice extent in the nineteenth century, using historical records from ships hunting the bowhead whale, with those in recent times.10 In this paper we wrote, “Records from May indicate that
end-of-winter sea-ice extent in the Bering Sea during the mid-19th century closely resembled that in the 1972–82 data. However, the historical data reveal that sea ice was more extensive during summer, with the greatest difference occurring in July. This pattern indicates a later and more rapid seasonal retreat.” While the statement in the White House Climate Change Assessment is not contradicted by our paper, the limited statement (about the summer) in the Assessment once again paints a dire picture to the average reader, whereas our work suggests that in fact the sea ice extent recovered over winter, and changes in arctic sea ice are more complicated than the Assessment implies. The problem here is a matter of tone and communication.
Key Message 4: Seasonal Patterns: Timing of critical biological events—such as spring bud burst, emergence from overwintering, and the start of migrations—has shifted, leading to important impacts on species and habitats (p.201). The implication here is that this is entirely negative for life on Earth and will forever be so. But on the contrary, the environment has always changed and is always changing, and living things have had to adapt to these changes.
Interestingly, many, if not most, species that I have worked on or otherwise know about require environmental change, including salmon and sequoia trees. 11 12
Two of the longest studies of animals and plants in Great Britain show that at least some species are adjusting to recent weather changes in “timing of critical biological events, such as spring bud burst, emergence from overwintering.” For example, a 47-year study of the bird Parus major (one of the longest monitoring of any bird species) shows that these birds are responding behaviorally to recent weather changes. A species of caterpillar that is one of the main foods of this bird during egg-laying has been emerging earlier as spring temperatures have risen. In response, females of this bird species are laying their eggs an average of two weeks earlier.13
The second study, one of the longest experiments about how vegetation responds to temperature and rainfall, shows that long-lived small grasses and sedges are highly resistant to climate change. The authors of the study report that changes in temperature and rainfall during the past 13 years “have had little effect on vegetation structure and physiognomy.”14
Of course with any environmental change, not all species will do well. This has always been the case, and is consistent with Darwinian evolution and with ecological knowledge. Black guillemots (Cepphus grylle), birds that nest on Cooper Island, Alaska, illustrate that some species are having difficulties adjusting to climate change. (However, black guillemots in their entire range are not a threatened or endangered species. It is only their abundance on Cooper Island that has declined.)
The problem has been that temperature increases in the 1990s caused the sea ice to recede farther from the island each spring. The parent birds feed on Arctic cod found under the sea ice and must then return to the nest to feed their chicks, who are not yet mature enough to survive on their own. For the parents to do this, the distance from feeding grounds to nest must be less than about 30 km, but in recent years the ice in the spring has been receding as much as 500–800 km (300–500 mi) from the island. As a result, the black guillemots on the island have lost an important source of food. The birds have sometimes targeted sculpin, which is not as abundant as cod.15
But the real problem these Cooper Island birds face today is egg predation by polar bears. With less sea ice during this time period, bears have gone ashore and eaten young birds. In 2009, of the 180 guillemots that hatched, only one on the island fledged (flew away).The solution to this has been to build bear-proof nesting boxes for the birds. In 2010, bear-proof nesting boxes resulted in about 100 birds that fledged.
Two points emerge here. One is that living things do in fact often adjust to changes in the timing of climate events; if not, there would be little or no life on Earth. The second is that the real problem black guillemots face is here-and-now predation, which can be and has been dealt with and does not require a single focus on whether on not the climate change was human- induced.
Chapter 7, Forests, opens with this:
Key Messages
1. Climate change is increasing the vulnerability of many forests to ecosystem changes and tree mortality through fire, insect infestations, drought, and disease outbreaks.
As I noted before, the Assessment suffers from the use of the term “climate change” with two
meanings: natural and human-induced. The implication in this key message is that the forest problems are the result of human-induced climate change, but as I have made clear, both the failure of the models and the failure of temperature change to closely track CO2 make this key statement false. Furthermore, it is well known that (1) forest wildfires are largely due to long- term suppression of fires in the twentieth century, which allowed the buildup of excessive fuel; and (2) that insect infestations and disease outbreaks are heavily the result of introduced species and the failure to remove dead and decaying timber from forests. In addition, this key statement is another example where recent weather patterns are said to represent and prove human-induced global warming, which I pointed out at the beginning is incorrect.
Key Message 2. U.S. forests and associated wood products currently absorb and store the equivalent of about 16% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by fossil fuel burning in the U.S. each year. Climate change, combined with current societal trends in land use and forest management, is projected to reduce this rate of forest CO2 uptake.
As explained in my review of the IPCC 2014 report, the estimates of carbon uptake by
vegetation used by IPCC and in major articles cited by the reports are based on what can best be called “grab samples,” a relatively small number of studies done at a variety of times using a variety of methods, mainly in old-growth areas. The results reported by IPCC overestimate carbon storage and uptake by as much as 300%.16 Therefore this is an unreliable statement.
As I stated at above, these are representative examples of problems that exist throughout the Climate Change Assessment.

This primer is supposed to introduce readers to the workings of the present U.S. monetary system. So it's only natural that it should take established monetary arrangements for granted, including an official, ""fiat"" dollar currency managed by the Federal Reserve System.   
  
And while I haven't hesitated to point out shortcomings in the Fed's management of the dollar, and have even dared to suggest some ways in which that management might be improved upon, I haven't questioned the fact that, whether it does so competently or not, the Fed is indeed ultimately ""in charge"" of the U.S. monetary system. That is, I've assumed, that the U.S. dollar is the only important domestic currency unit, and that the total quantity of dollar-denominated exchange media, the behavior of the general level of prices, U.S. dollar exchange rates, and the periodic flow of domestic dollar-denominated payments, remain under the discretionary control of the FOMC.   




But while a monetary policy primer must generally deal with existing monetary arrangements, it doesn't follow that it should overlook others altogether. ""Policy,"" according to Webster, is ""a high-level overall plan embracing the general goals and acceptable procedures especially of a governmental body."" And though, within the set of possible plans, the most readily-implemented ones take existing institutional arrangements for granted, there are always other, more radical options that involve either replacing established arrangements or confronting them with rival ones with which they must compete.   
  
Radical policy alternatives are, inevitably, controversial ones as well; so a primer is hardly the place for any detailed consideration, let alone a defense, of any of them. Instead, we must settle for a quick glance at several especially prominent or intriguing possibilities, all of which involve moving away from the present, discretionary system and towards a more-or-less ""automatic"" alternative.   




Among various proposals for reforming the present U.S. dollar, none are more controversial than those for re-instating an official gold standard, meaning an arrangements in which official paper U.S. dollars are once again made fully convertible into a fixed quantity of gold, as they had been until 1933. The proposal is controversial in no small part because, so far as many economists are concerned, the historic gold standard was itself a disastrous failure, the passing of which calls, not for tears of regret, but for cries of ""good riddance!""   
  
How to account, then, for the gold standard's enduring appeal, especially among conservatives and libertarians? Part of the answer is that, whatever its shortcomings, a gold standard has the indisputable merit of serving to automatically stabilize the long-run purchasing power of any money tied to it. That property, far from being mysterious, stems from the simple fact that under a gold standard the profitability of gold prospecting and mining increases, other things equal, as prices generally fall, and declines as prices generally rise. Consequently although the general level of prices can fluctuate, it tends to revert over time to a fixed mean.   
  
Another part of the answer is that the gold standard's critics often exaggerate its shortcomings, especially relative to those of actual (as opposed to idealized) fiat standards. On a blackboard, of course, a fiat standard can readily be shown to outperform a gold standard in the long-run perhaps, but certainly in the short-run. But that's true only because, on a blackboard, a fiat standard can be made to do whatever the chalk-wielder likes. In practice, on the other hand, fiat standards can and often do behave very badly indeed. What self-respecting economist, right now, would relish the opportunity to lecture a roomful of Venezuelans on the theoretical advantages of irredeemable paper money?   
  
Moreover, while the international gold ""exchange"" standard that was cobbled together after World War I was a disaster waiting to happen, the prewar ""classical"" gold standard's commerce-invigorating combination of generally fixed exchange rates and reasonable (if less than perfect) price-level stability has never been matched since.   
  
But the most important reason why gold still commands such a following is, if you ask me, more prosaic: it's simply that, for those who distrust bureaucratic control, whether of money alone or of economic activity more generally, the gold standard is simply the most _salient_ alternative. Gold was the last, the most universally embraced, and the most successful of all commodity standards, as well as the one that coincided with a period of remarkable economic progress concerning which even John Maynard Keynes — that arch critic of the ""barbarous"" gold standard — waxed eloquent:   




What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man that age was which came to an end in August, 1914! The greater part of the population, it is true, worked hard and lived at a low standard of comfort… But escape was possible, for any man of capacity or character at all exceeding the average, into the middle and upper classes, for whom life offered, at a low cost and with the least trouble, conveniences, comforts, and amenities beyond the compass of the richest and most powerful monarchs of other ages. The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages… He could secure forthwith, if he wished it, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate without passport or other formality, could dispatch his servant to the neighboring office of a bank or such supply of the precious metals as might seem convenient, and could then proceed abroad to foreign quarters, without knowledge of their religion, language, or customs, bearing coined wealth upon his person, and would consider himself greatly aggrieved and much surprised at the least interference. But, most important of all, he regarded this state of affairs as normal, certain, and permanent, except in the direction of further improvement, and any deviation from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable.



But however much one may regret the passing of the classical gold standard, it doesn't follow that we can do no better than to try and restore it. ""In commerce,"" the great William Stanley Jevons famously said, ""bygones are forever bygones""; and what Jevons says of commerce goes for money as well. Gold may have served as a relatively successful monetary standard in the past. But it doesn't follow that there's anything sacrosanct about gold today, or that a gold standard is still the best of all possible options for fundamental monetary reform.   
  
On the contrary: an official attempt to once again make paper dollars convertible into gold today would be a step no less arbitrary or ""constructivist"" (in F.A. Hayek's sense of the term), than an attempt to make them convertible into silver, palladium, or Japanese yen. To be sure, gold has a nostalgic appeal lacking in the rest. But allowing that consideration to be _decisive_ would be like deciding to replace an aging fleet of jet aircraft, not with newer jets, but with as many propeller-driven biplanes. Don't get me wrong: I'm not saying that gold convertibility couldn't possibly be a good idea. I'm just saying that it wouldn't qualify as a great idea simply by virtue of its historical preeminence. The only real test ought to be whether a revived gold standard would deliver better results than any equally practical (and not merely theoretical) alternative.   
  
Finally, even if no new system could beat a restored classical gold standard, it doesn't follow that such a restoration is possible. If getting one nation alone to return to gold is bound to be extremely difficult, getting a large number of advanced nations to do so simultaneously, so as to have a truly ""classical"" set-up like the one that existed before 1914, would be a truly Herculean challenge.   
  
Furthermore, official gold standards can survive only if citizens trust their governments and central banks to generally keep promises to trade gold for paper. Such trust, having been dealt a severe blow by World War I, died a slow and painful death in the decades that followed it. A new gold standard commitment by the Fed, or by any other central bank, today, is bound to run afoul of this reality, especially by becoming the object of attacks by skeptical speculators. If history is any guide, sooner or later those attacks would force even the most well-meaning central bankers to break their gold-standard promises all over again, though perhaps not on time to avoid leaving their economies in shambles.   




If trying to revive the classical gold standard, or something close to it, is like trying to piece Humpty-Dumpty back together, that doesn't mean that we have no choice but to settle for a paper dollar managed by a committee of fallible (and occasionally fumbling) bureaucrats. In particular, the difficulties inherent in trying to tame the dollar by once again making it convertible into a scarce commodity can be avoided by relying instead on a quantity-based monetary rule. Because such a rule provides for automatic adjustments in the quantity of standard money without allowing people to convert that money into something else, it can't fall victim to a speculative attack, and is that much more likely to endure.   
  
As we've already reviewed some general arguments in favor of having a monetary rule, there's no need to review those arguments again here. Instead, I'd like to consider a radical variation on the old theme, consisting of a quantity rule that's enforced, not by a committee, either voluntarily or with the help of sanctions imposed whenever the rule is breached, but by means of some sort of automatic, fail-safe mechanism.   
  
The general idea is one Milton Friedman entertained for many years. ""We don't need the Fed,"" he said (in one of many similar interviews he gave in the 1990s). “I have, for many years, been in favor of replacing the Fed with a computer” programmed to ""print out a specified number of paper dollars…month after month, week after week, year after year.”   
  
Although the constant (""k-percent"") money growth rate rule that Friedman once favored has itself fallen out of fashion, his idea for a computer-driven money supply couldn't be more _à la mode_. Computers are, for one thing, capable of doing a lot more than they were back in the 90s. And even in the 90s they might have been capable of managing the money supply so as to maintain, not a stable growth rate for B or M1 or M2 or some other monetary aggregate, but a stable level of nominal _spending._ The smooth growth of spending would in turn supply, for reasons we've considered previously, robust protection against severe economic fluctuations.   
  
Indeed, while it's easy to imagine a circumstance in which a constant money growth rule could turn out to be a recipe for macroeconomic chaos, it's darn difficult to imagine a situation in which there'd be much to gain, and little to lose, by sacrificing a stable and customary overall growth rate of spending growth for some other monetary policy objective. A bout of exceptionally rapid spending? A fine way to boost asset prices, no doubt, until one considers the inevitable denouement! Slower spending than usual? Tell it to your average businessman, or employee! Those (mainly Fed insiders) who rail against what they like to characterize as ""inflexible"" rules (as if a ""rule"" could be anything but inflexible!) forget — or pretend not to know — that while some rules would indeed prevent the Fed from having the flexibility to do the right thing, others would mainly serve to deny it the flexibility to do _wrong_ things. A stable spending rule, including one that's ""rigidly"" enforced by a computer, though it would rule out many bad monetary policy options, would also ""rule in"" the good ones.   




Scott Sumner has come up with an alternative plan for targeting nominal spending, which relies not on a computer but on trading in futures to keep spending on target. The plan, called ""NGDP Futures Targeting ,"" starts with the Fed settling on an NGDP growth-rate target — say, 4 percent — and then offering to enter into NGDP futures contracts, with payoffs depending on the future level of NGDP, to anyone who expects it to either exceed or fall short of target. Traders who expect NGDP to come in above target will go long on the futures, while those expecting it to fall short will go short.   
  
How, then, does the Fed manage to actually achieve its target? The answer becomes evident when one considers the link between the futures contracts it enters into for its monetary policy operations. When the Fed _sells_ futures to investors who are betting on excessive NGDP growth, it is withdrawing base dollars from the economy, just as it might by engaging in open-market asset sales. In contrast, when it buys contracts from short sellers, it expands the monetary base. In other words, the very persons who are betting that the Fed will miss its target are also driving it to adjust its policy in a direction calculated to make them lose their bets! As a means for further reinforcing this built-in feedback mechanism, Sumner would also have the Fed engage in ""parallel"" open-market operations for each NGDP contract purchase or sale. In short, by offering to ""peg"" the price of its futures by engaging in as many contracts as it takes to keep the price on target, the Fed essentially stands ready to expand or contract the monetary base by whatever it takes to keep expected NGDP on target.   
  
That, at least, must suffice for the barest of summaries of a plan that has since appeared in several, subtly-distinct versions, each of which has spawned its share of subtle (and not-so-subtle) controversy, with some critics claiming that Sumner's scheme, or some versions of it, unworkable. Do those critics have a point? Perhaps they do, but that's not our concern. We're here neither to praise nor to bury, but only to have a gander at, this and other intriguing future possibilities for monetary policy.   




Of these possibilities none are more intriguing than those held out by so-called cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and its various ""altcoin"" offshoots. As I observed some years ago (and as Tim Sablik explains in this Richmond Fed piece), when it was just starting to gain economists' attention, Bitcoin has properties in common with both gold and other commodity monies on the one hand and deliberately managed fiat monies on the other. Like gold, Bitcoin is unalterably scarce: just as there is only so much gold on the planet, whether mined or as-yet unmined, there are only so many bitcoins to be had — 21 million, to be precise — of which not quite 17 million have been mined as of this writing. And like gold mining, bitcoin ""mining,"" which involves the use of computer-power to solve a mathematical puzzle, is costly. Since bitcoin ""miners"" compete for the privilege of being responsible for some share of any periods' bitcoin output, the marginal resource costs of mining a batch (or ""block"") of bitcoin tends to equal the market value of the coins produced.   
  
Yet unlike gold, and like a fiat money, both the maximum possible output of bitcoin and the number of coins mined in any given period is controlled, not by mother nature, but by a protocol programmed into Bitcoin's open-source software. The protocol adjusts the difficulty of the puzzle bitcoin miners must solve so as to keep total bitcoin output on a predetermined schedule, according to which bitcoin output gradually tapers off, asymptotically approaching, but never quite reaching, its 21 million coin limit. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin's software means that no one is either ""in charge"" of the protocol or capable of altering it. A majority of miners can, however, agree to form themselves into a new branch network or ""fork"" that uses a modified copy of Bitcoin's original protocol, as happened on August 1, 2017, when ""Bitcoin Cash"" split-off from what became known thereafter as ""Bitcoin Core."" Although the fork created as many new ""Bitcoin Cash"" coins as there had been Bitcoin Core coins beforehand, it left the Bitcoin Core protocol itself unchanged.   
  
Bitcoin's odd blend of commodity- and fiat-money properties led me to dub it a ""synthetic commodity money"" some years ago. But the exciting thing about Bitcoin and its various spinoffs and rivals isn't merely that they comprise a distinct sort of basic money, but that their combination of commodity- and fiat-money features is capable, in principle at least, of combining the best properties, while avoiding the worst, of each of those more traditional alternatives.   
  
One of the more common complaints against a commodity standard is that it exposes the value of money to shocks stemming from either new commodity discoveries or from changes in the non-monetary demand for the standard commodity. Bitcoin and other such ""synthetic"" commodity monies are, on the other hand, not subject to similar shocks, because the amount miners can extract is strictly pre-programmed, and because they have no non-monetary (e.g. ornamental or industrial) value.   
  
The big beef against fiat money, on the other hand, is that its quantity can be altered by the authorities placed in charge of it, not only for the sake of promoting economic stability, but for other reasons, if not arbitrarily.   
  
It doesn't follow, of course, that any old cryptocurrency would be a hands-down winner in a race against any established fiat money. Despite its ultimate limit of 21 million coins and skyrocketing transactions fees, Bitcoin might still seem a safer gamble than, say, the Venezuelan Bolivar. But would it really supply a better or more durable monetary standard than the present U.S. dollar?   
  
But the question isn't whether Bitcoin can beat the present fiat dollar. It's whether the basic technology pioneered by Bitcoin might allow some other self-regulating cryptocurrency to do so. Besides giving rise to its own ""Cash"" spinoff, Bitcoin has already spawned dozens of ""altcoin"" rivals, with others yet to come. It's at least conceivable some one or more of these might harbor such properties as would make it a worthy opponent to the present dollar, if not something clearly superior. Consider, if you will, the immense variety of ordinary commodities that either have served as money in the past, or that might have done so, from cowrie shells and tobacco to silver, gold, and even (as more than one prominent economist once proposed) common bricks. Each had its merits and its drawbacks; and every one of them was imperfect. But now consider that the cryptocurrency revolution presents us with a whole new universe of new, albeit synthetic, options to draw upon, each of which has been deliberately endowed with properties calculated to make it an attractive medium of exchange. Call me an optimist, but it seems to me only natural to suppose that one of these innovative products might someday prove just the thing to give even the best discretion-wielding central bankers a run for their (that is, our) money.   




For an upstart currency to make inroads on an established fiat money requires, at very least, that established and would-be monies compete on a reasonably level playing field. That means having rules and regulations that make it relatively easy for persons to either partly or entirely ""opt out"" of an official currency network, and to ""opt in"" to one or more alternative networks. I say ""relatively easy"" because it's inevitably costly to switch from one currency network to another, and especially so when the switch is from a bigger network to a smaller one. A level playing field therefore means, not one where rivals are necessarily well-matched, but one where the game isn't rigged in the home team's favor. In other words, the laws should not _themselves_ favor official money over other alternatives.   
  
It was with that intent in mind that F.A. Hayek, in making his now-famous 1976 case for ""Choice in Currency,"" called upon   




all the members of the European Economic Community, or, better still, all the governments of the Atlantic Community, to bind themselves mutually not to place any restrictions on the free use within their territories of one another's — or any other — currencies, including their purchase and sale at any price the parties decide upon, or on their use as accounting units in which to keep books.



""There is no reason whatever,"" Hayek went on to argue,   




why people should not be free to make contracts, including ordinary purchases and sales, in any kind of money they choose, or why they should be obliged to sell against any particular kind of money. There could be no more effective check against the abuse of money by the government than if people were free to refuse any money they distrusted and to prefer money in which they had confidence. Nor could there be a stronger inducement to governments to ensure the stability of their money than the knowledge that, so long as they kept the supply below the demand for it, that demand would tend to grow. Therefore, let us deprive governments (or their monetary authorities) of all power to protect their money against competition: if they can no longer conceal that their money is becoming bad, they will have to restrict the issue.



Although Hayek's advice seems perfectly reasonable, putting it into practice turns out to be a lot harder than he seemed to think, and not just because governments' would rather keep currency playing fields slanted their way. Consider the case of Bitcoin. In March 2014, the IRS classified it and other cryptocurrencies as capital assets (“intangible property”) rather than as currency, making any trade involving them the basis for either a short- or a long-term capital gains tax, depending on how long the coins were held before being disposed of. As the folks in the Coin Center (a non-profit cryptocurrency advocacy group) explain, this tax treatment puts cryptocurrencies at a disadvantage, not just relative to the U.S. dollar, but relative to official foreign currencies, which enjoy an exemption when it comes to relatively small transactions:   




Say you buy 100 euros for 100 dollars because you’re spending the week in France. Before you get to France, the exchange rate of the Euro rises so that the €100 you bought are now worth $105. When you buy a baguette with your euros, you experience a gain, but the tax code has a _de minimis_ exemption for personal foreign currency transactions, so you don’t have to report this gain on your taxes. As long as your gains per transaction are $200 or less, you’re good to go.   
  
Such an exemption does not exist for non-currency property transactions. This means that every time you buy a cup of coffee, or an MP3 download, or anything else with bitcoin, it counts as a taxable event. If you’ve experienced a gain because the price of Bitcoin has appreciated between the time you acquired the bitcoin and the time you used it, you have to report it to the IRS at the end of the year, no matter how small the gain. Obviously this creates a lot of friction and discourages the use of Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency as an everyday payment method.



The obvious solution, the Coin Center goes on to suggest, is ""to simply create a _de minimis_ exemption for cryptocurrency the way it exists for foreign currency."" But hold on: to really achieve Hayek's ideal, it won't do to level the capital gains tax portion of the currency playing field for cryptocurrencies only, rather than for _all_ potential, unofficial dollar substitutes. But then, just what _shouldn't_ count as such a potential substitute? Surely gold qualifies. But why not silver, or cigarettes, or… the point, as we know from experience, is that all sorts of things are ""potential"" exchange media, and therefore potential currencies. So, to really allow them all to compete on equal terms, one would at very least have to exempt _all_ of them — from taxes to which official dollar trades aren't subject.   
  
In short, Hayek's ideal is just that: something to have governments strive for, rather than something they can be expected to fully achieve in practice.   
  
What's more, Hayek was far too optimistic regarding the likely consequence of making it easier for people to choose among rival currencies. ""Make it merely legal"" for them to switch to something else, he wrote, ""and people will be very quick indeed to refuse to use the national currency once it depreciates noticeably."" But would they? Unlike, say, shoes or soda water, money is a ""network"" good, meaning that one of the most important, if not _the_ most important, determinant of the attractiveness of any particular money is the size of the network of persons prepared to accept it. You might think gold an ideal monetary commodity, and I might hold that Bitcoin is to the dollar what sliced bread is to bread of the old-fashioned sort. Yet when it comes to going shopping, what either of us must first consider is, not what sort of money _we_ like, but what the shopkeepers are prepared to take in exchange for their goods.   
  
It follows that, even if official and unofficial currencies really could have a level playing field to compete on, that field would still be one on which official money would generally enjoy a huge ""home team"" advantage. For this reason, the mere fact that an official currency is depreciating ""noticeably"" isn't enough to incite people to abandon it in droves. Instead, it might take a very substantial rate of depreciation, or some like cataclysm, to bring about rapid change. Cataclysms aside, upstart currencies are more likely to have to start by clawing their way into established currency markets one painful inch at a time, though with each becoming easier than the last as their own, initially tiny networks begin to blossom.   




The alternatives I've considered so far have all consisted either of potential replacements for the U.S. dollar or of novel means for regulating the stock of official (that is, Fed-created) U.S. dollars themselves. Emphasizing such alternatives makes sense, after all, in a primer concerned with ""monetary policy,"" where the most fundamental choices are those concerning what type or types of basic money to employ, and how best to regulate the supply of basic money, assuming that it doesn't adequately regulate itself.   
  
But what about alternatives consisting of banks' readily convertible IOUs, like most bank deposits today that, by virtue of their instant convertibility into official dollars, are very close substitutes for them? Because such bank-created substitutes necessarily ""piggy back"" on the basic monies into which they can be converted, their presence can't generally make up for misbehavior or mismanagement of the quantity of basic money itself, and might even aggravate that misbehavior. A fiat money stock that's allowed to grow so rapidly that it would result in a 20 percent annual rate of inflation in a pure fiat money system will, for example, produce the exact same rate of inflation in an economy in which payments are made exclusively by means of bank IOUs backed by a fixed fractional reserve of the same basic money.   
  
Moreover there's nothing at all radical about having banks supply such alternatives, at least to a limited extent. Today and for some time past bank deposits of various kinds have served, with the aid of checks and, more recently, debit cards, as close substitutes for official monies, to the point of being far more extensively employed in exchange than official monies themselves.   
  
It would, nevertheless, be wrong to suppose that there's no scope for a potential beneficial radical reform involving bank-supplied alternatives to basic money. On the contrary: plenty of scope exists for expanding the role of such alternatives, particularly by doing away with long-standing restrictions on commercial banks' ability to challenge central banks' monopoly of circulating (or hand-to-hand) payments media.   
  
Once upon a time commercial banks routinely issued their own circulating paper notes; indeed, until the latter half of the 19th century bank notes were the most important liability on banks' balance sheets, which were far more commonly employed in making payments than either checks or coins. Nor did central bank notes, which themselves started out as mere IOUs redeemable in gold or silver, only to be transformed into inconvertible fiat money later on, come to generally displace notes of commercial banks until the last decades of the 19th century, and the opening ones of the 20th, when the proliferation of central banks typically went hand-in-hand with laws forcing commercial banks out of the paper currency business.   
  
Received opinion has it that commercial bank notes had to go because central bank currency was better. But now and then received opinion is nothing but hokum, and this happens to be one of those instances. Had central bank notes been better than their commercial counterparts, it shouldn't have been necessary for governments to suppress the latter. Instead, the mere availability of official alternatives should have sounded the death knell of the commercial stuff. Yet instead of that having been the case, in every instance the commercial bank notes had to be snuffed-out, leaving people no choice but to employ official paper money. Nor did the commercial bank currency go down without a fight, in which prominent economists often took part, with many of the most prominent (and most better ones, if I may say so) challenging governments' efforts to establish official currency monopolies, and championing the alternative of free trade in banking, or ""free banking,"" for short.   
  
Strictly speaking, ""free banking"" means more than just allowing ordinary banks to issue paper currency. It also means leaving them free of other restrictions, including restrictions upon their ability to establish branch networks, lend to whomever they wish, charge whatever rates they wish, and hold whatever levels of cash reserves and capital they wish to. Freedom of note issue is only the most controversial of these many aspects of freedom in banking, in part because allowing it would make it possible for the public to rely _exclusively_ on privately-supplied exchange media, with official dollars playing their part only behind the scenes, as bank reserves. Furthermore, in times past, when official money consisted, not of any central bank's inconvertible ""liabilities,"" but of gold or silver coin, not having to rely on a central bank as a source of paper money meant _not having to have a central bank at all_!   
  
Could a monetary system lacking a central bank possibly have been any good? Darn tootin'!   
  
Of all relatively modern monetary systems, none have earned more kudos than the two that most closely approximated the free-banking ideal, namely, the systems of Scotland between the latter 18th century and 1845 and Canada from 1870 and 1914. In both of these, bank-supplied notes and deposits commanded such a high degree of confidence that gold and silver coin hardly circulated. The public's disdain for precious metal money in turn allowed Scottish and Canadian banks to operate on reserve cushions that were slim even by today's standards. That in turn made Scottish and Canadian banks highly efficient intermediaries, with almost all of their clients' savings going to fund relatively productive bank loans and investments. Yet despite this high degree of efficiency, bank runs were extremely rare in both systems, while banking crises, involving simultaneous problems at many banks at once, were almost unheard of.   
  
Why, in that case, does free banking, and especially the idea of letting banks issue their own currency, seem so far-fetched today?   
  
Partly it's because the Fed and other central banks, upon which we're now all too inclined to turn to for information about monetary history, have underplayed such success stories as those of Scotland and Canada whilst sugarcoating their own records. But in the U.S. case it's also due to confusion about the meaning of ""free banking."" Whereas that phrase can refer to genuinely free banking systems like those of Scotland and Canada, it can also refer to any of the systems established through so-called ""Free Banking"" laws passed by eighteen states between 1837 and 1860. Despite their names the later laws didn't come close to allowing genuine freedom in banking. Instead, they all imposed important restrictions upon the banks established under them, including the requirements that those banks refrain from establishing branches, and that they back their notes entirely with specific securities — usually consisting of state government bonds. In several instances such restrictions, far from guaranteeing the soundness of the banks that were forced to abide by them, led to notorious abuses and failures, including episodes of ""wildcat"" banking. All in all, the misnamed ""Free Banking"" era proved to be one of the most unfortunate chapters in U.S. monetary history, because of the direct damage done by bank failures, of course, but also because those failures gave freedom in banking a bad name it didn't deserve.   
  
But what relevance has free (that is, genuinely free) banking today? It's relevant, first of all, because an understanding of its workings suggests that freedom in banking isn't necessarily inimical to soundness in banking, and that the wrong sort of regulations can in fact be worse than no regulations at all. It also suggests that, even if we are determined to rely on a fiat-money issuing Fed as our ultimate source of monetary control, we need not rely upon them to supply hand-to-hand currency. Instead, we might let commercial banks back into that business, while limiting the Fed's ordinary involvement in the market for money to the ""wholesale"" part of that market — that is, to supplying banks with reserves. Commercial banks that could issue their own notes would presumably also be free to experiment with other forms of non-deposit money, including ""smart"" stored value cards, that might eventually replace paper money altogether, except on rare occasions when people lost confidence in the private stuff. I dare say, indeed, that had commercial banks been left in charge of supplying currency all along, paper money would some time ago have gone the way of horses, buggies, spittoons, and slide-rules. What else save a bunch of government monopolists could have managed to keep such low-tech stuff as paper currency in play for so long?   




While in times past free banking was an alternative to central banking, that's no longer so. Today's commercial bank deposits are claims, not to gold or silver coin, but to central bank issued fiat money; and were commercial banks able to supply their own notes or stored value cards to take the place of central bank notes in payments that don't involve drawing upon bank deposits, those notes and cards would also represent claims to central bank money.   
  
In short, so long as we stick to the present fiat dollar standard, instead of replacing it with either a natural or a synthetic commodity standard, no amount of freedom in commercial banking will suffice to render the Fed entirely otiose. No wonder that, when former U.S. Representative Ron Paul and his many devotees campaign to ""End the Fed,"" they have in mind, not just letting bulldozers loose on the Eccles Building, but once again making official dollars claims to some fixed quantity of gold.   
  
Whether one is a hard-core libertarian or not, it's interesting to ponder the extent to which the Fed's role might be reduced, with the help of various more-or-less radical reforms, without either abandoning the present, inconvertible U.S. dollar or sacrificing its integrity.   
  
We've already considered how a carefully-programmed computer, or having the Fed peg the price of NGDP futures, could render the FOMC redundant — in so far at least as that body's challenge can be boiled down to one of maintaining a stable level of overall spending. We've also seen how letting commercial banks issue circulating currency would make it unnecessary for the Fed to be in the currency business, though it would still require keeping plenty of Federal Reserve notes on hand in case a banking panic should break out. Finally, in an earlier chapter we've seen how allowing ""flexible"" open-market operations could make it unnecessary for the Fed to ever make any direct loans to troubled financial institutions.   
  
Yet these are far from being the only possibilities for having a leaner, if not a meaner, Fed. The Fed's reduced involvement in currency provision and last-resort lending would mean a corresponding decline in the importance of the regional Fed banks, apart from the New York Fed, which handles the system's open-market operations. The Fed's involvement in check clearing could also be reduced, by returning that activity to the private sector, which handled it perfectly well until the Fed muscled its way in after 1913. Finally, most of the vast army of economists and other staff personnel presently employed at the Fed, who even now are mainly busy performing tasks that have nothing much to do with fulfilling the Fed's mandate, could be made to seek more productive employment elsewhere.   
  
In short, sticking to a fiat dollar doesn't rule out reforms that would dramatically reduce the Fed's role in the monetary system. Instead of the present, Leviathan Fed, one might have what might be called a ""Nightwatchman"" Fed, capable of doing those things that any responsible fiat money issuing central bank ought to do, but incapable of doing many of the things that irresponsible central banks do all too often.   




By surveying some more radical options for monetary reform, I don't pretend to have made a compelling case for any of them. My only goal has been to suggest that all sorts of alternatives exist, and that each of them has its merits. Will any of them really help? Is one better than the rest? Are there others not mentioned that deserve our consideration? The correct answer to all these questions, and others like them, is ""Maybe."" In other words, such alternatives are, or ought **** to be, worth thinking about, even if some might ultimately be judged unattractive. Allowing ourselves to think outside the established monetary policy box can never do us any harm. Nothing could be more dangerous, on the other hand, than for all of us to assume that, despite its obvious faults, ours happens to be the best of all possible monetary systems.

Paul Hunt, Simon Bridges’ Correspondence and Research Assistant has responded to an email from a reader about National voting for the Zero Carbon Bill as follows:



On behalf of Hon Simon Bridges, Leader of the Opposition, thank you for your email regarding the Zero Carbon Act.



National supported the Zero Carbon Act because we believe there should be an enduring independent Climate Change Commission. An independent Climate Change Commission helps provide certainty and stability for everyone to plan and respond. Regardless of who is in Government, business, households and consumers need to be confident that the advice and reports on any climate change policies are robust and transparent.



National does not agree with everything in the Zero Carbon Act. We put forward several changes to make the Act more science-based and take into account economic impacts. **Unfortunately Winston Peters and New Zealand First blocked every change National put forward in Parliament**. 



Our proposed changes were:



Should we earn the right to govern in 2020 **we will make these amendments in our first 100 days** in office. We will ensure the Bill drives the appropriate long-term change while factoring in the wider impacts on the economy, jobs and incomes.



National will continue to make independent judgments when it comes to climate change policy responses. We continue to oppose the ban on offshore oil exploration imposed by this Labour-NZ First-Greens Government, and we also have opposed calls to declare a climate emergency. 



National supports sensible and practical solutions to address climate change that do not damage our economy or drive up the cost of living. We support policies which give New Zealand’s industries the freedom to grow and prosper. Our approach is to work alongside businesses to enable them to innovate and develop world leading environmental practices. Our farmers, foresters and other primary sector industries understand the importance of looking after their natural environment and have been implementing measures to do so. National will back our businesses to succeed while supporting their development of environmentally friendly technologies and practices. 



Thank you for taking the time to write. Mr Bridges appreciates reading your perspectives and insights on this issue.



National’s wrong thinking begins in the very first sentence. “ **… we believe there should be an enduring independent Climate Change Commission.** ” Why not an independent Gravity Commission? Or an independent Tsunami Commission? Or an independent Cloud Cover Commission? Or an independent Comet Commission? Governments cannot alter any one of those things so why waste taxpayer dollars setting up and staffing the first?



And it will not be **independent** anyway. There will not be a single dissenting voice on the Climate Change Commission. Anyone who does not believe the “[97% of scientists](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/yet-another-climate-fake-news-story-debunked/)” or the “[11,257 ‘scientists’ and Mickey Mouse](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/taking-the-mickey-out-of-the-other-11257/)” will get past the selection process.



Since no one yet has been able to supply a single piece of verifiable physical evidence that increasing the atmospheric concentration of CO2 or methane – let alone the tiny proportion of it that comes from our cars, farms or whatever we do – causes our planet’s mean air temperature to rise, National’s fiddling with target percentages is a waste of time. 



Ditto planting forests as off-sets or buying indulgences off-shore; **none of this is going to change what the climate is going to do** , so changing this Act in the first 100 days when they finally get back into office in the 22nd century is not going to affect the climate in any way.



Withdraw from the Paris Agreement and spend the money on cleaning up our waterways and beaches. Work out a means to turn our trash into heat or power rather than stockpiling it in paddocks or burying it in landfills. Pursue the predator free aim. There are plenty of worthwhile ideals to follow that will improve our environment. 



Playing climate god, is not one of them.

"Severe flooding in India’s tea-growing state of Assam and neighbouring Nepal has killed at least 200 people and displaced millions, severely hampering efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus. In Assam, heavy monsoon rains burst the banks of the Brahmaputra River, causing more than 2,000 villages to be enveloped in floods and mudslides and displacing 2.75 million people in the past two weeks. There have been 85 deaths reported in the state.  Keshab Mahanta, Assam’s water resources minister, said: “The flood situation remains critical with most of the rivers flowing menacingly above the danger mark.” Officials voiced concern that the flooding and hurried evacuation of millions of Assam residents would cause a significant rise in cases of coronavirus in the north-eastern state, known for its tea plantations. At the moment, 50,000 people are sheltered in cramped relief camps but because of the scale and urgency of the evacuations, officials admitted that no physical distancing measures were being enforced. Sanghamitra Sanyal, a member of Assam’s flood management force, told Reuters: “It’s hard to enforce social distancing when people are being ordered to move away from the rising waters. “We’re urging people to at least cover their mouth and nose with a piece of clean cloth.” The number of Covid-19 cases is still increasing rapidly in Assam, with more than 1,000 new infections reported daily, pushing the state’s total to almost 25,000 cases. Last week the total cases in India surpassed a million, making it the third worst affected country in the world. Officials from the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) urged authorities to deal with complaints that mismanaged and contaminated coronavirus waste, including used masks and other personal protective equipment, was washing up in the floodwaters in areas of Guwahati, the largest city in Assam. Authorities confirmed that hundreds of animals had drowned in the flooding, including nine endangered rhinos living in Kaziranga national park, a Unesco world heritage site. Kaziranga national park and tiger reserve, which is home to 2,400 of the one-horned rhinos – the largest concentration of them in the world – has been severely affected by the flooding, with 85% of the 407 sq mile (1,055 sq km) park underwater. Officials said that 59 of the 223 anti-poaching camps had been inundated and as well as the rhinos, among the dead animals were deer, porcupines and Asiatic water buffalo. Flooding and mudslides are an annual occurrence in Assam, but because of global heating their frequency and intensity are increasing. This year’s monsoon rains have affected 28 of the state’s 33 districts – some of the worst flooding in years. Successive governments have made promises to strengthen the state’s flood defences but projects have remained mired in corruption and inefficiency. Nepal also bore the brunt of the floods, with 110 people killed and 50 still missing in the rising waters and mudslides, while more than a million people were displaced. With heavy rains expected to continue over the next few days, authorities said the number of dead was likely to increase."

An article on Politik on Monday under the heading “ _Bridges uses the Zero Carbon Bill to redefine National”_ made for very interesting reading. Perusing the information in the article was like putting the pieces of a jigsaw together.



According to Richard Harman, the decision by National to support the Bill, is the end of a long process of debate within the party, which points to a fundamental realignment of its policies and values. Harman says Bridges has both encouraged and endorsed that debate and its outcomes and there is little doubt that the decision to back the Bill was the one he wanted. Bridges, who Harman says by nature is a bit of a nerd, understands climate change and was at the Paris Summit. According to Politik, Bridges has allowed his party to begin to become an **urban-based liberal party.**



Harman says National chose Scott Simpson, Erica Stanford and Nicola Willis, all of whom are identified with the liberal wing of the party, to lead the Zero Carbon Debate. He says a change like National’s has many fathers and three MPs played a crucial role; Nick Smith, Scott Simpson and Todd Muller. Harman says what National clearly said on Thursday, was that **this was the new National Party.** One other interesting point Harman made was that Judith Collins is not identified with the liberal wing of the party. He says she is the polar opposite.



There were five principles that National would require to be met if it was to support the Bill.



They were:





So what to deduce from all of this. First, it is patently apparent that the hierarchy of the National Party are in agreement with Bridges and want him as leader. He will be the leader going into the next election. National, it would seem, has a fear of not attracting the younger voter and particularly voters in the urban areas. It is now also obvious why National were so keen to parachute Christopher Luxon into Botany. Where this change in focus leaves those in the farming sector, traditionally National voters, is a good question.



 **There is now a widening gap on the right between National and ACT.** ACT is now a viable option for those who are unhappy with the direction the National Party has decided to take. Many of David Seymour’s recent comments will resonate better with some on the right than those coming out of National. I am personally unhappy that National has decided to undertake this change of direction in this manner, rather than present an independent set of policies to the electorate next year.



Other voting options are the New Conservatives and the Sustainability Party. Vernon Tava is going to target the moderates who vote for the loopy Greens. We now have an environmental party minus the communist socialist agenda.



Here is my perfect scenario. Judith Collins joins ACT which is looking more and more like her natural home. ACT immediately garners at least five per cent support. Tava gets enough green votes, hopefully five per cent, to tip them out. Winston fails to get back. National, ACT and the Sustainability Party form a Coalition.



We are allowed to dream, aren’t we?

"The climate is changing at an unprecedented rate, and so are the environments of many plant and animal species. Populations die out in places that become intolerable, and thrive in other places that have become more benign. But for many species, population growth in new places does not keep up with the decline elsewhere. For some species, such as polar bears, such benign places do not even exist. And even if they do, species still face a significant problem: they need to find them. This problem is perhaps more serious for migratory animals, which have to adjust  to not one, but several changing environments that they visit throughout the year. Even after finding a new habitat one year, they must find it again the next, and every year after that. How on earth do these creatures know where to go? This question is not trivial: many migratory populations are declining. What seems to be killing them is their inability to adjust to multiple changing habitats at once. The problem might be that it is hard for them to learn new migratory habits. But a few migratory species are thriving. Among them are barnacle geese, a small-sized goose that winters in Europe and traditionally breeds on the Arctic tundras of Siberia, Svalbard and Greenland. So, how are they doing so well?  We barely know the exact routes of many migratory species, let alone how these have changed over time. But here, barnacle geese are the exception. Ever since their near extinction in the 1950s, when fewer than 500 geese were left, scientists have been monitoring their numbers. The geese were observed in their wintering area at the Solway Firth, between Scotland and England, all along the Norwegian coast during spring migration and up to Svalbard. Each spring from the 1970s onwards, researchers went to Helgeland on Norway’s west coast to observe the geese arriving from the UK to fill their bellies on grass. These fat reserves are essential to complete the second part of their journey north to Svalbard, where they breed. In the early 1990s, bird researchers discovered a handful of barnacle geese in Vesterålen, 350km to the north-west of Helgeland, while they were counting pink-footed geese – another vulnerable goose population. Since then, the number of barnacle geese in Vesterålen in spring has been increasing steadily. From the 2000s onwards, goose observers at the traditional feeding site in Helgeland started to see numbers go down. Currently, the majority of the whole population (now 40,000 birds strong) stops off in Vesterålen. Rapid adjustments? Certainly. The number of geese in Vesterålen in spring has actually grown faster than can be explained by the birth rate alone, meaning that what we’re seeing is not just “the survival of the fittest”. In addition, many individual geese must have switched to feeding in Vesterålen later in life. 


 Along with counting geese, international research groups have been catching geese in the breeding areas on Svalbard since the 1960s, fitting juvenile geese with plastic leg rings with letter codes. This allowed goose observers along the Norwegian coast to actually know which bird they were looking at, and even how old it was. Since 2000, these observers have gathered enough observations of ringed barnacle geese each year to allow proper calculations. This has enabled us to show that geese are indeed switching to Vesterålen in big numbers. In addition, the probability for individual geese to move to Vesterålen has been increasing, and young birds are far more likely to switch than older ones. So are these changes a response to climate change? We analysed the grass growth during the feeding period at both locations, which we could estimate from daily temperature and sunshine levels. The start of grass growth in spring has advanced more than three weeks since the 1970s, leading to a strong increase in grass availability during the goose staging period in spring at both locations. But availability is not all that counts. Barnacle geese arrive in Norway at the end of April. In the 1970s, the snow usually had just melted at that time, and the first grass shoots were coming up. In recent years, the grass was already long when the geese arrived, and contained more cellulose. This is much more difficult for geese to digest than young grass, resulting in a lower rate of fat storage. Vesterålen is further north, and spring starts much later than in Helgeland. This means that due to climate warming, the annual timing of grass growth in Vesterålen now is how it used to be in Helgeland. Fresh new grass now is just emerging in Vesterålen when the geese arrive, enabling the geese to gain weight fast. So yes, the switch makes sense. Does that mean that the geese know that the new place is better? Not necessarily. Most of the switchers are young birds, which do not have much experience. Instead, we think that they follow experienced birds to Vesterålen, perhaps after they have arrived in Helgeland to find there is not enough food to go around. Geese operate in families, staying close to their long-term partners and relatives. They might exchange more information than we know.  It’s the group travelling that does the trick for geese, allowing them to profit from the discoveries of others. The question that remains is why other bird species have not evolved in the same way. Perhaps geese have always lived in a more dynamic environment than other migratory species. Think of shorebirds, which have been dependent on the same shorelines and inter-tidal areas for thousands of years. For them, the current rate of climate change might be something they have not evolved to deal with. Perhaps we are creating a world in which all birds would be better off acting like geese."

Information



This is a letter from John Rofe, a self-declared “Concerned Citizen” to Professor Gerrard, the NZ Prime Minister’s Science Advisor.   
As it is quite long we have ‘serialised’ it over a few days. 



I am amazed that people with professional backgrounds and obvious common sense have failed to “smell a rat” after all the strident warnings of Armageddon not only [failed to materialise many times](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/climate-emergency-fail-of-the-day-27/) over the last 40 years, but also the historic records had to be doctored to try to prove the UN IPCC fraud and yet never succeeded! Fool you once, shame on the UN IPCC. **Fool you a dozen times, shame on you!**



Professor Michael J. Kelly, one of New Zealand’s brightest minds, has just given a speech to the British Global Warming Policy Foundation (as their 2019 keynote speaker). Because he is an engineer, the practical issues he raises should concern you. This video clip is an hour-long…but it explains how stupid and misguided the actions of the present NZ Government really are…although he would be too polite to phrase it that way… 



He also draws attention to the damage that this fraud will inflict on the general public’s opinion of science and scientists. This travesty makes Trofim Lysenko look like a saint by comparison. 



Professor Gerrard, in the 1980’s I was an early fan of the work of the team that did the “Limits to Growth” modelling, and I am acutely aware of the fact that continued exponential growth in a world of large but finite resources is a nonsense. I agree we are past the sustainable carrying capacity of the earth in terms of our human growth aspirations and resource use. Yet we have a Government that just considered it better to permit the importation of foreign (traditional) wives, so as to enable the escalation of further population growth. Political expediency trumps logic, yet in order to advance their incomprehensible demands to cease using fossil fuels on which our entire civilisation is based, **they tinker with keeping the population happy while denying the public the right to be informed about either the limits to our civilisation or the forces affecting climate change. Atmospheric CO 2 content, as with CH4, is simply irrelevant to the grave problems we face and the human predicament when fossil fuels are no longer a cost-effective energy source.**



To survive, each minute of each day we must all either breathe or die. Each adult human inhales 415ppm of CO2 and exhales 40,000ppm of CO2 (and in human exhalations, there is a similarly reduced proportion of O2). Yet we can supposedly all fly around the world to attend climate change conferences while emitting a net 350kg per year of CO2 per person from our exhalations, and decide we are paying for it by killing dairy cows and growing trees. What arrant rubbish this is. 



It is as stupid as Al Gore’s “virtue signalling” by owning an expensive coastal property while signalling impossible sea level rise, riding in his private jet to climate conferences and justifying that by profiting from ownership of a carbon trading business, from which he also claims he buys carbon credits. Meanwhile, the average New Zealander is asked by the false local paragons of virtue (James and Jacinda) to [stop eating meat ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/be-a-real-rebel-eat-meat/)and dairy products and we are even begrudged exhaling our personal 350kgs of CO2 per year. 



Simply put, your Government supports lies to advance their own agenda. They allow the publication of the images of pollution from 3rd world countries which have effectively rejected the Paris Accords as if they were caused within our society – **just so they can lie to us.** They show us images of smoke stacks which falsely accuse the CO2 emissions of being pollution. They show the polar bears as if they were endangered when they are [more numerous than since records began,](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/susan-crockford-no-climate-emergency-for-polar-bears/) and leave Inuit with no hope of being allowed to defend themselves against polar bear predations. Frauds are all built on lies like this and you have unwittingly become part of the lies. The longer frauds run, the more lies must always be furnished.

"There’s little that the left and the right agree on these days. But surely one thing is beyond question: that national governments must protect citizens from the gravest threats and risks they face. Although our government, wherever we are in the world, may not be able to save everyone from a pandemic or protect people and infrastructure from a devastating cyberattack, surely they have thought through these risks in advance and have well-funded, adequately practiced plans? Unfortunately, the answer to this question is an emphatic no.  Not all policy areas are subject to this challenge. National defence establishments, for example, often have the frameworks and processes that facilitate policy decisions for extreme risks. But more often than not, and on more issues than not, governments fail to imagine how worst-case scenarios can come about – much less plan for them. Governments have never been able to divert significant attention from the here and happening to the future and uncertain. A recent report published by Cambridge University’s Centre for the Study of Existential Risk argues that this needs to change. If even only one catastrophic risk manifests – whether through nature, accident or intention – it would harm human security, prosperity and potential on a scale never before seen in human history. There are concrete steps governments can take to address this, but they are currently being neglected. The risks that we face today are many and varied. They include:  Each of these global catastrophic risks could cause unprecedented harm. A pandemic, for example, could speed around our hyper-connected world, threatening hundreds of millions – potentially billions – of people. In this globalised world of just-in-time delivery and global supply chains, we are more vulnerable to disruption than ever before. And the secondary effects of instability, mass migration and unrest may be comparably destructive. If any of these events occurred, we would pass on a diminished, fearful and wounded world to our descendants. So how did we come to be so woefully unprepared, and what, if anything, can our governments do to make us safer? Dealing with catastrophic risks on a global scale is a particularly modern problem. The risks themselves are a result of modern trends in population, information, politics, warfare, technology, climate and environmental damage. These risks are a problem for governments that are set up around traditional threats. Defence forces were built to protect from external menaces, mostly foreign invading forces. Domestic security agencies became increasingly significant in the 20th century, as threats to sovereignty and security – such as organised crime, domestic terrorism, extreme political ideologies and sophisticated espionage – increasingly came from inside national borders. Unfortunately, these traditional threats are no longer the greatest concern today. Risks arising from the domains of technology, environment, biology and warfare don’t fall neatly into government’s view of the world. Instead, they are varied, global, complex and catastrophic. As a result, these risks are currently not a priority for governments. Individually, they are quite unlikely. And such low-probability high-impact events are difficult to mobilise a response to. In addition, their unprecedented nature means we haven’t yet been taught a sharp lesson in the need to prepare for them. Many of the risks could take decades to arise, which conflicts with typical political time scales. Governments, and the bureaucracies that support them, are not positioned to handle what’s coming. They don’t have the right incentives or skill sets to manage extreme risks, at least beyond natural disasters and military attacks. They are often stuck on old problems, and struggle to be agile to what’s new or emerging. Risk management as a practice is not a government’s strength. And technical expertise, especially on these challenging problem sets, tends to reside outside government. Perhaps most troubling is the fact that any attempt to tackle these risks is not nationally confined: it would benefit everyone in the world – and indeed future generations. When the benefits are dispersed and the costs immediate, it is tempting to coast and hope others will pick up the slack. Despite these daunting challenges, governments have the capability and responsibility to increase national readiness for extreme events.  The first step is for governments to improve their own understanding of the risks. Developing a better understanding of extreme risks is not as simple as conducting better analysis or more research. It requires a whole-of-government framework with explicit strategies for understanding the types of risks we face, as well as their causes, impacts, probabilities and time scales.  With this plan, governments can chart more secure and prosperous futures for their citizens, even if the most catastrophic possibilities never come to pass. Governments around the world are already working towards improving their understanding of risk. For example, the United Kingdom is a world leader in applying an all-hazard national risk assessment process. This assessment ensures governments understand all the hazards – natural disasters, pandemics, cyber attacks, space weather, infrastructure collapse – that their country faces. It helps local first responders to prepare for the most damaging scenarios. Finland’s Committee for the Future, meanwhile, is an example of a parliamentary select committee that injects a dose of much-needed long-term thinking into domestic policy. It acts as a think tank for futures, science and technology policy and provides advice on legislation coming forward that has an impact on Finland’s long-range future.  And Singapore’s Centre for Strategic Futures is leading in “horizon scanning”, a set of methods that helps people think about the future and potential scenarios. This is not prediction. It’s thinking about what might be coming around the corner, and using that knowledge to inform policy. But these actions are few and far between. We need all governments to put more energy towards understanding the risks, and acting on that knowledge. Some countries may even need grand changes to their political and economic systems, a level of change that typically only occurs after a catastrophe. We cannot – and do not have to – wait for these structural changes or for a global crisis. Forward-leaning leaders must act now to better understand the risks that their countries face.

"“Flygskam” – the Swedish word for “flight shame” – describes a phenomenon that has taken off around the world, as travellers face growing pressure to reduce their carbon emissions by switching to alternative modes of transport. Climate activists have denounced air travel, settling for boats, trains or, at a pinch, paying to offset the carbon emissions from their flights. Celebrities face criticism for flying by private jet – and Germany’s Green Party has even put forward plans to ban domestic flights within the country.  Yet according to our calculations based on the the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2019 (which we both contributed to), CO₂ emissions from aviation fuels account for a mere 3% of global CO₂ emissions and 8% of worldwide oil consumption. This may not sound like much, but in the past 30 years, aviation fuel consumption has almost doubled, consistently contributing to the growth in global oil consumption.

      Travel the world without destroying it – Imagine newsletter #5


 To see whether the efforts of individuals to cut down on air travel can make a meaningful difference to global emissions, we took a closer look at how fuel consumption by the aviation industry has changed over time, and what trends are set to take hold in the future.  A common way of estimating CO₂ emissions for individual passengers is to take the aircraft type and distance travelled into account. This is the method used by carbon offsetting organisation atmosfair, and the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s carbon footprint calculator.  By contrast, our approach to quantifying CO₂ emissions from flights involves looking at the consumption of aviation fuel. This eliminates the need to rely on estimates of passenger numbers, aircraft type and how full or empty planes are, and can easily be compared to other means of transportation.  An important caveat is that our method ignores the effects of condensation trails or nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted by planes. Including these in the estimates is challenging because their effects only last for a matter of minutes, hours or days. But research suggests that the warming effects of aviation can be much larger, depending on where in the atmosphere NOx are emitted. So our approach only gives a conservative estimate of the emissions from aviation. The figure above shows global oil consumption, measured in million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe). Over the past 30 years oil consumption has risen continuously, amounting to a 50% increase since 1990. Over the same period consumption of aviation fuel almost doubled from 185 mtoe to 343 mtoe.  Compared to other means of transportation, such as road and rail, aviation accounts for a relatively small but growing percentage of oil consumption. In 2018, aviation was a major driver of the 1.2% global increase in oil consumption.  A large share of aviation fuels are consumed in developed countries. In 2018 the US alone accounted for more than 20% of aviation fuel consumption. In the same year half of all aviation fuel consumption took place in OECD countries – a club of mostly developed countries which represent about 15% of world population.  Meanwhile, China, Russia and non-OECD countries in Europe and Asia, which account for almost 60% of world population, consumed 32% of all aviation fuels. Given that the populations of these countries are forecast to grow, we can expect air travel passenger numbers to increase. In fact the International Air Transport Association estimates that China will replace the US as the biggest aviation market by the mid-2020s. To put things into perspective, if China, Russia, non-OECD Europe and the rest of Asia were to fly as much as the OECD countries, total aviation fuel consumption would almost triple from its current level of 343 mtoe to about 935 mtoe. It would further increase to 1,560 mtoe, if the entire world flew as much as OECD countries. This amounts to more than the current global consumption of gasoline and diesel. It’s worth noting that consumption is normally attributed to the country that represents the “point of sale”: for example, if a Norwegian plane refuels in Iceland en route to the US, this counts as Icelandic consumption and emissions. This matters, because any attempts by individual countries to tax aviation fuel would be unlikely to succeed, since planes would simply go out of their way to refuel in low-tax countries, meaning a transnational policy is required. Since 2000 the number of air passengers has almost tripled, reaching a new high of 4.3 billion in 2018. The main driver of growth is budget airlines, which offer primarily short and medium-haul flights in the American and European markets. It’s not all bad, though. As shown in the figure above, the amount of fuel required per passenger has decreased steadily over the years, although the rate seems to have slowed after 2010, despite the introduction of more fuel-efficient planes. The IPCC estimates that 18% of CO₂ emissions from planes can be saved, if air traffic control management and other operational procedures become more efficient. Based on current information it still seems the increase in passenger numbers is likely to outstrip the increase in fuel efficiency, leading to an increase in overall fuel consumption.  Low-carbon sustainable aviation fuels can reduce CO₂ emissions, although only six airports in the world (Bergen, Brisbane, Los Angeles, Oslo, San Francisco and Stockholm) offer them on a regular basis. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that, in 2018, sustainable aviation fuels only accounted for 0.1% of aviation fuel production – so much more could be done to promote their use around the world.  In 2018, passenger planes emitted around 960m tonnes of CO₂, representing 8.5% of emissions from oil products and less than 3% of CO₂ from all fossil fuels – leaving other oil products and coal as the main sources of emissions.

      Flying cars could cut emissions, replace planes, and free up roads – but not soon enough


 But the fact remains that alternative means of travel, especially trains, have a much better carbon footprint than flying. The London North Eastern Railway estimates that it takes about 17kg of CO₂ per passenger to travel from Edinburgh to London, which equates to heating the average UK home for two days. Atmosfair estimates the same journey by plane would produce 145kg of CO₂ – equivalent to heating a home for 22 days. In wealthy nations across the Western world, where people can choose to take alternative transport over short and medium distances at little to no extra cost, “flyskam” may well have its place. But when it comes to tackling climate change, flying less is small piece in a big puzzle. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

Former NOAA meteorologist David Dilley has submitted an essay below that has 2 parts: 1) How the government has been starving researchers who hold alternative opinions of funding, and 2) climate cycles show we are starting a cooling period. 
Readers will recall that David Dilley is a 40-year meteorology veteran and the producer of the excellent video: “Is Climate Change Dangerous?“, which first was presented at NTZ. Since then the video has been viewed more than 10,000 times and the NTZ story shared in social media over 800 times.
==================================
Suppressing the Truth – the Next Global Cooling Cycle
By David Dilley, former NOAA meteorologist
For over 15 years an inordinate proportion of government and corporate research grants have been awarded to universities for a single specific purpose: to prove human activities and the burning of fossil fuels are the main driving mechanisms causing global warming.
Unfortunately agendas by strong arm politics and the suppression of contrary views have become the primary tools used to manipulate the media, local and state governments (and in turn the general public) into believing what they want us to believe.
Many former research department heads, such as Dr. Reid Bryson (known as the Father of Climatology), openly state that research grants are driven by politics, and in order to receive a government grant you have to play the game. Topics for grants go with the political wind.
In the mid 1990s government grants were typically advertised in such a way to indicate that conclusions should show a connection to human activity as the cause for anthropogenic global warming. The result: most of the research published in journals became one-sided and this became the primary information tool for media outlets.
According to some university researchers who were former heads of their departments, if a university even mentioned natural cycles, they were either denied future grants, or lost grants. And it is common knowledge that United States government employees within NOAA were cautioned not to talk about natural cycles. It is well known that most university research departments live or die via the grant system. What a great way to manipulate researchers in Europe, Australia and the United States.
Disinvited, views suppressed
Not only governments manipulate, but so do some universities in order to protect their grants. A perfect example happened in 2012 when I contacted the Eagle Hill Institute in Steuben Maine USA to see if they would be interested in a climate change lecture. It should be noted that the institute has very close ties with the University of Maine. So I indicted that my lecture would involve information on natural climate cycles, and they responded saying, “That is fine.” Then In May of 2013 they asked me to speak at their lecture series on June 29th – an invitation that I accepted. They even consequently advertised the event and posted it on their online calendar.

All seemed well as I prepared for the lecture. But then came the manipulation and suppression of views. Just four days prior to the lecture, three people from the University of Maine viewed our web site (www.globalweatheroscillations.com). The next morning, just 3 days prior to the June 29th lecture, I received an email from Eagle Hill stating that my “lecture is canceled due to a staffing shortage”. Upon checking their web site, the calendar did show my lecture as being canceled, but carried the notation that “we hope to have a different lecture on the 29th”.
So what happened with the staffing shortage? A news service called “The Maine Wire“ interviewed the President of Eagle Hill, and he said that the University of Maine “felt some people in the audience may be uncomfortable hearing Mr. Dilley’s lecture”.
 What did they want to hide from the public? 
The IPCC and most anthropogenic believers want to maintain the belief that global warming during the past 100 years has been caused by human activity alone, and this is why most of their climate talks and lectures do not even mention prior global warming cycles.
The politically driven United Nations IPCC and United States global warming ruse will likely end up being one of the greatest scandals of the 21st century. If left unchecked it will continue to lead the world down a dangerous path that could jeopardize the lives of millions of people. Many have been led to believe the earth is heading into catastrophic global warming. Is this a political ruse, and will it likely blindside governments within the next few years? When it comes to climate, history does repeat itself.
Cooling has already begun
Alternating global warming and cooling cycles have historically occurred and ended like clockwork every 220 to 230 years, with nearly 4000 cycles occurring during the past half million years. The last global cooling cycle began around 1795, or about 220 years ago. If the time clock strikes on time as it has over and over again throughout history, the upcoming cooling cycle has already begun in the Arctic and Antarctic, as shown in my video, “Is Climate Change Dangerous?”
Earth has experienced 5 global cooling cycles during the past 1,000 years (soon to be 6). The initial 20 to 40 years of a new global cooling cycle are historically the coldest period, and associated with the most rapid cooling (see attached graphic). If a large volcanic eruption occurs during this period, large amounts of sulfur dioxide will be emitted into the atmosphere with the cooling cycle being exacerbated by sulfate aerosols floating in the upper atmosphere (www.cas.org/science-connections/volcano). The sulfate aerosols are highly reflective and can cool the earth for 1 to 3 years, with the end result being a year of no summer in some regions of the world.
Major volcanoes during cooling periods
Of the past 5 cooling cycles dating back to 900 AD, 4 were associated with strong volcanic eruptions during the initial 15 to 25 years of the cooling cycles. The volcanic explosive index (VEI) for these eruptions were between 5 and 7 on a VEI scale ranging from 1 to 8. The last occurrence was in 1815, when VEI 6 Tambora erupted. The combination of this massive volcanic eruption occurring some 15 to 20 years into the new global cooling cycle was instrumental in causing the year of no summer in 1816. During the next several years, nearly one third of Europe perished from famine, plague and civil unrest. Back then the earth had a population of 1 billion to feed; today there are 7 billion.
Similar cooling cycles and eruptions occurred in the year 1600 when VEI 6 Huaynaputina (Peru) occurred about 20 years into the new cooling cycle. In 1350 Rangitoto (New Zealand) about 25 years into a cooling cycle, and in the year 834 Eldgja (Iceland) a great VEI 6 eruption occurred about 25 years into the new cooling cycle. The current global warming cycle is now ending.
Shouldn’t governments around the world be preparing for a major event that is by far more dangerous than any warming cycle could possibly be?

"**Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have agreed a deal with major advertisers on how they define harmful content.**
The agreement - with the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) - will see the social networks use common definitions for things such as hate speech, aggression and bullying.
Brands will also have better tools to control where their ads appear.
It follows an advertising boycott of Facebook earlier this year, involving more than 1,000 companies.
The boycott included some of the world's biggest brands - such as Unilever and Coca-Cola.
It was driven in part by the Stop Hate for Profit campaign, a coalition of non-profit organisations urging brands to pull advertising to encourage radical reform of Facebook's hate speech policies.
But this latest agreement is between the advertisers themselves and the social networks, and does not involve the non-profit groups.
It is also specifically about advertising - content policies do not need to change, and decisions about what to take down remain separate.
But the US Anti-Defamation League, responding on behalf of Stop Hate for Profit, gave a cautious welcome to the ""early step"".
""These social media platforms have finally committed to doing a better job tracking and auditing hateful content,"" chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt said.
But he warned that the deal must be followed through, ""to ensure they are not the kind of empty promises that we have seen too often from Facebook"" - and he said his group would continue to push for further change.
Rob Rakowtiz from the WFA said the agreement ""sets a boundary on content that absolutely should have no ads supporting it, therefore removing harmful content and bad actors from receiving funding from legitimate advertising.""
The details are being set by a group established by the WFA, called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (Garm).
It was set up in 2019, long before the boycott, to create a ""responsible digital environment"", and it says the new deal is the result of 15 months of negotiations.
Garm will decide the definitions for harmful content, setting what it calls ""a common baseline"", rather than the current situation where they ""vary by platform"". That makes it difficult for brands to choose where to place their adverts, it said.
The group will also create what it calls ""harmonised reporting"" methodologies, so that statistics on harmful content can be compared between platforms.
By 2021, there will be ""a set of harmonised metrics on issues around platform safety, advertiser safety, platform effectiveness in addressing harmful content,"" it said.
Independent audits will double-check the figures. And, crucially for advertisers, the new deal calls for control over how close an advert will appear to certain types of content.
""Advertisers need to have visibility and control so that their advertising does not appear adjacent to harmful or unsuitable content, and take corrective action if necessary and to be able to do so quickly,"" it explained.
All three social networks publicly welcomed the agreement. None, however, said they were making any immediate changes to their wider content policies."

At first he makes some philosophical points on why free markets are so crucial and why so many Catholics disagree with the latest Pope on climate change policy.
That aside, Joe takes a peek at the upcoming European winter.
The current conditions are starting to favor a colder-than-normal winter and so you might want to keep the long johns well within reach. At the 15:45 mark he shows a chart of the new Jamstec (sp?) model for the coming winter.

The model shows a cold winter in store for Northern Europe, especially Great Britain and a large part of Scandinavia. It’s still early and these seasonal forecasts are fraught with uncertainty. But Joe seems to be leaning toward a cool winter, and so already that is not a good sign.

The reason for the potential cold UK winter is the growing pool of icy sea surface temperatures over the North Atlantic, which played a role in the cold and wet summer Northeast Europe had to endure this year. Here’s the snipped portion of the chart appearing at the 13:45 mark (sorry for the blurry quality):

Joe tells his viewers:
You folks in Europe you watch that cold pool. The fact that it’s getting this far south like this, starting to cool the water near Spain. That’s – the water is warming up here near Iceland – this is gonna promote more ridging in this area of the world. And when there’s ridging in Iceland and Greenland, look out! If that mean trough sinks further south in the North Atlantic, it looks like a nasty winter shaping up, especially for the UK. And we’re telling people that.”
Snow being a thing of the past? Maybe next winter. With a little luck we’ll get a good taste of it in Paris in December. It would be fun watching politicians warn of warming while a blizzard rages on outside. Such an embarrassment of course wouldn’t be the first time.
In the US, charts show a mild start of the winter, but becoming cold beginning in January – especially across the east and south, across Texas.

Regarding this article, I think I’ve found a simple reason for this failure, and the reason will shock and surprise you.
In the article, a news report by TV station WFTS is cited:
WFTS News in Tampa obtained copies of the courthouse’s electricity bills and confirmed the savings are no more than about $2,000 per month. WFTS also confirmed the panels are reducing electricity bills by only 15 to 18 percent, instead of the promised 40 percent.
You can watch the news report here.
They say a picture is worth a thousand words, I’ve got one of those. First, look closely at the picture in the news story above…now look at this picture and note the arrow.

I think the government dufuses and the solar company missed the shading from the nearby tall building (the Hillsborough County Center Building), seen in the photo above which you can inspect yourself at Bing Maps here:  http://binged.it/1tqPjnf
It looks like a little over half of the panels would be in the shade during the afternoon based on my comparison to the article photo, a larger version which exists here:

Source: http://www.naco.org/newsroom/countynews/Current%20Issue/10-18-10/Pages/OldMainCourthousesolarphotovoltaicproject.aspx
That afternoon shade will kill solar panel efficiency big time. The problem will be greater in the winter, at low sun angles, further reducing the efficiency of solar panels which appear to be placed flat on the roof, rather than tilted for maximum efficiency. In fact if you watch the WFTS i-team video, you’ll see that the panels are in fact laid directly on the roof surface. Here is a screen cap showing workers placing flexible panels flat on the roof:

The effect of array tilt angle on solar PV energy output may be up to 20% compared to that of flat installations, depending on latitude. Typical rooftop arrays with tilt look like this:

You can read more about tilt angles and panel efficiency here.
But the tilt issue is small compared to the shading issue by the tall building to the Southwest. using Google Earth’s timeline feature, I found an image from Dec 26, 2012 that shows the peak shading near the winter solstice, it also shows the solar panels in place. Clearly, the shadow will cover a significant portion of the solar panels on the roof for a period of time.
The next thing that needs to be done is a public records request to get the hourly solar power system output data over the past couple of years, it should be an easy matter then to note when the output drops significantly, and to line that up with sun angles and times.
On a daily basis, you can watch the real-time output page here:
Source: http://www.hillscty419piercepv.com/
Below the big dial gauge, if you choose “select gauge” and the “Interval 2-hour Avgs.” you’ll get a bar graph plot of solar output by hour, though there is no facility for getting anything but today’s data. From my observations, it seems that at this time of year, we get a bigger drop-off in production in the late afternoon than we should, which should be almost symmetrical with the buildup in the morning towards peak insolation. The afternoon production seems to have a larger gap.
It will be interesting to see what the public records request for the hourly solar power output data brings.
Full disclosure: I have a solar power system on my own home.

"DHAKA, Bangladesh  —   Bangladesh’s government is moving forward with a plan to relocate Rohingya refugees staying in camps near the country’s largest tourist resort towns to a remote island that is underwater for much of the year. A cabinet order on Thursday directed officials to have the refugees transferred to Thengar Char, an island in the Bay of Bengal that is lashed by high tides   and submerged during the monsoon season. The suggestion that they be moved to the largely uninhabitable marshland several hours by boat from the mainland drew criticism from around the world. The relocation plan was last proposed in 2015, but the government quietly suspended it after criticism from international aid groups and rights activists. Its reinstatement follows the arrival of about 65, 000 Rohingya from Myanmar in October and November, after a crackdown by Myanmar’s army and attacks on security forces by Islamic insurgents. The United Nations has called the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group denied citizenship in Myanmar, the world’s most persecuted minority. John McKissick, head of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the Bangladeshi city of Cox’s Bazar, near the Burmese border, said in November that Myanmar’s government was trying to achieve an “ultimate goal of ethnic cleansing of the Muslim minority. ” Since 1992, about 32, 000 registered Rohingya have been living in two United Nations camps near Cox’s Bazar, but estimates of unregistered refugees range from 200, 000 to 500, 000. Many of them live in two sprawling makeshift shelters close to the official camps, while others are scattered across southeast Bangladesh. Talk of forced relocation worries refugees who have lived in the Cox’s Bazar area for more than two decades. “We have been here for a long time,” one of them, Shafiul Mostafa, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday from one of the camps. “We have gotten to know our neighbors, and we can speak the local dialect, which is similar to our language. If we are taken to a new place, it will be very difficult for us. We won’t be able to communicate with anyone. ” The United Nations refugee agency, which runs the camps, criticized the relocation proposal in 2015, calling it “complex and controversial” and saying that departures would have to take place with the migrants’ consent. Now, the return of the plan has taken aid groups by surprise. “U. N. H. C. R. is concerned about this news and seeking details from the authorities,” Shinji Kubo, a representative of the United Nations refugee agency in Bangladesh, said by email. “Any move must be carried out through a consultative and voluntary process, and the feasibility of the proposed site must be assessed. ” Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International say a recent crackdown in Myanmar indiscriminately targeted the Rohingya, citing satellite imagery showing 1, 500 Rohingya homes burned down and widespread reports of mass killings and rapes. The cabinet in Bangladesh has directed officials to take steps to stop further “illegal entry of Myanmar nationals” and to prevent existing refugees from “mixing in with local populations. ” It also ordered officials to keep all illegal immigrants from Myanmar in designated areas, and to arrest them or push them back into those areas if they tried to leave. The order, which was posted on the cabinet’s website, said the arrival of Rohingya in recent months had raised tensions, created “physical risks” for local people, and caused social and economic problems in Cox’s Bazar. Critics of the relocation say the order has more to do with a desire to develop Cox’s Bazar, home to what the government promotes as the longest beach in the world, into a booming tourism destination to rival others in Asia. “Right now, people here are only building hotels and guesthouses,” said Hayat Khan, an executive at the Ocean Paradise Hotel in Cox’s Bazar. “You go to the beach for half an hour, and then there’s nothing more to do. You need cable cars, and theme parks like the Window of the World in Shenzhen,” he added, referring to a city in southern China. “For that, you will need a lot of investment, and a lot of land. ” Rohingya refugees and their leaders say that they were not consulted about the plan. “If the government wants something, we will have to obey them,” said Mr. Mostafa, the refugee. “At the end of the day, what we want or don’t want is not going to matter to anyone. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s University of Siegen issued a press release on a recent study conducted by climate scientists. It turns out that natural oceanic cycles indeed do play a far greater role on sea level fluctuations than first believed.
Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne.
Therefore, because the factors were not correctly considered in the past, we can immediately conclude that the scary projections made by the IPCC for the 21st century were falsely calculated and are thus likely grotesquely exaggerated.
What follows is the University of Siegen press release, which I’ve translated in English.
=========================================
Natural Sea Level Fluctuations Underestimated
University of Siegen study shows: The effects of natural ocean cycles on sea level changes is greater than first believed
Scientists all agree that global mean sea level rose by 14 to 21 cm since 1900. Up to now everyone assumed that the largest part of the rise was connected to man-made climate change. However a new calculation by a team of scientists led by German scientist Dr. Sönke Dangendorf of the Water and Environment Institute (fwu) of the University of Siegen now shows the causal uncertainties are much greater than previously assumed. The effects of natural ocean cycles on sea level is thus greater than first believed.

“The uncertainties on the causes of the observed sea level rise since 1900 published up to now fluctuate between 2 and 3 cm. Earlier about 90% of the sea level rise was attributed to anthropogenic effects, i.e. caused by man. These figures are based on the assumption that naturally caused fluctuations in the ocean last merely a few years, and thus explain only a very small part of the observed rise. The latest results however shows that the natural ocean cycles even can persist over decades or centuries. Therefore we can no longer exclude that natural fluctuations may have contributed up to ±8 cm to the observed sea level rise,” says Dangendorf (photo). The results have been published in renowned journal “Nature Communications”.
In its 5th assessment report in 2014 the IPCC summarized that ocean heating and melting of glaciers explain about 80% of the observed sea level rise since 1900. On the other hand the share by the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets over the said time period still remains uncertain. What’s clear is that neither ocean warming nor the glacier melting can be traced back 100% to anthropogenic effects. Eduardo Zorita, coauthor and scientist at the Helmholtz Center in Geesthacht, adds: “From earlier studies we know that a considerable share of the glacier contribution over the past centuries results from the Little Ice Age and only 50% are connected to anthropogenic factors. Due to insufficient measurements the man-made share of oceanic warming is known only over the past decades, where it reached about 90 percent of the entire warming. It is in any case improbable that the anthropogenic effect was more than 50 or 60% over the entire 20th century because the greenhouse gas emissions accelerated significantly during this period.
[It needs to be pointed out that man may be blamed for ocean warming only if it is proven that man was responsible for the overall global warming to begin with. This is hotly disputed as there is strong evidence of natural factors behind global warming.]
Tide gauges measuring the water level along the coasts are the main sources of data on past sea level changes. One problem these gauges have, however, is that in addition to the effects of oceanic warming and glacier melt they also measure local wind-induced mass redistributions. It’s a fact that these fluctuations dominate the sea level signal over short timescales. Dr. Alfred Müller, coauthor and professor of mathematics at the University of Siegen, argues: “Wind signals mask all long-term changes – not only those anthropogenic, but also natural ocean cycles. In the past this resulted in almost the entire sea level rise being attributed to anthropogenic effects.”
The scientists selected a new approach with which they analyzed the single components of the measured signal separately. As a result this allowed a more precise description of natural variability. “Using our methodology we reach the conclusion that the minimum anthropogenic part of sea level rise since 1900 is about 45%. This number is smaller than assumed previously, but in any case it agrees better with independent studies on single components (e.g. ocean warming, glacier melt),” Dangendorf summarizes. “Also if the values are less than previously assumed, it is important to point out that a significant part of the rise is attributable to anthropogenic effects,” says Dr. Jürgen Jensen, coauthor and professor of hydromechanics and water engineering at the University of Siegen: “For this reason, and in order to minimize the uncertainties in future projections, it is extremely important that we better understand the individual components as well as the natural and anthropogenic factors.”

New posts can only be viewed through the NTZ homepage. Reader comments function is also disabled by the recent upgrade. Sorry. It’s very frustrating for me as well.
As I’m not an IT guy, nor do I have time to devote to this problem right now, no solution is in sight. Now may be just as good a time to end the climate-blogging career (and just blame site assassins out to get me. /sarc)
 =========================================
Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt recently have had a long series of excellent posts on sea level rise. Not surprisingly they show there’s nothing to worry about on that front. At many locations worldwide sea level is not even rising.
Kiribati
In their latest post Lüning and Vahrenholt write: “Good news from the Pacific: Sea level in Kiribati shows no longterm increase over the past 20 years.”

Moreover satellite measurements also show no trend for the period.

Also Lüning and Vahrenholt write that no region in the atolls have been found where coastal erosion is occurring. What follows is the abstract of a recent paper (emphasis added):
“Coral islands defy sea-level rise over the past century: Records from a central Pacific atoll”
The geological stability and existence of low-lying atoll nations is threatened by sea-level rise and climate change. Funafuti Atoll, in the tropical Pacific Ocean, has experienced some of the highest rates of sea-level rise (∼5.1 ± 0.7 mm/yr), totaling ∼0.30 ± 0.04 m over the past 60 yr. We analyzed six time slices of shoreline position over the past 118 yr at 29 islands of Funafuti Atoll to determine their physical response to recent sea-level rise. Despite the magnitude of this rise, no islands have been lost, the majority have enlarged, and there has been a 7.3% increase in net island area over the past century (A.D. 1897–2013). There is no evidence of heightened erosion over the past half-century as sea-level rise accelerated. Reef islands in Funafuti continually adjust their size, shape, and position in response to variations in boundary conditions, including storms, sediment supply, as well as sea level. Results suggest a more optimistic prognosis for the habitability of atoll nations and demonstrate the importance of resolving recent rates and styles of island change to inform adaptation strategies.”
So why is sea level not behaving like the alarmists said it would? Lüning and Vahrenholt add:
“Like in many other parts of the world, the Pacific ocean cycles play a roll in that they influence sea level in 60-year cycles. In December 2013 a team of scientists led by Jae-Hong Moon published on this subject in the Journal of Geophysical Research. The reported that the satellite data series since 1993 is much too short to allow the identification and computation of the effects of longterm ocean cycles.”
That paper’s abstract tells the whole story (emphasis added):
“Multidecadal regional sea level shifts in the Pacific over 1958–2008
Altimeter data have significantly improved our understanding of regional sea level variability and trends, but their relatively short records do not allow either evaluation of the ocean state prior to 1993 or multidecadal low-frequency signals in the ocean. Here we characterize and quantify the multidecadal regional sea level rise (rSLR) and related ocean heat content in the Pacific from a non-Boussinesq ocean circulation model in comparison with data sets from altimeters, two sea level reconstructions, and in situ ocean profiles from 1958 to 2008. We show that the rSLR trends have undergone two shifts, during the mid-1970s and in the early 1990s, with an east-west dipole pattern in the tropical Pacific. In each of these phases, rSLR accelerated on one side of the Pacific, but decelerated on the other side. The multidecadal sea level shifts can be explained by the dynamical (steric) upper-ocean responses to the surface wind forcing associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), with negligible contributions from internal (depth-integrated) ocean mass changes. Additional model experimentation further confirms that the Pacific wind stress trend over the recent two decades has played an important role in strengthening the rSLR in the western Pacific while suppressing the rSLR in the eastern Pacific. The climate-forced large-scale rSLR variability is likely to impose a long-term and uneven impact on coastal communities.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman NTV public radio reports that solar systems are being hampered by yet another problem: Mafia plundering German solar systems. It’s turning out to be a huge problem, and NTV writes that the solar industry is keeping very quiet about it in order avoid negative publicity. NTV describes how thieves equipped with just a few simple tools are able to strip panels and the expensive power inverters rapidly under the cover of night. Hardest hit are systems installed outdoors in fields – solar parks. NTV describes the night-time theft of one solar installation where the thieves simply used bolt cutters to gain access through a fence to a field with thousands of panels: “They removed almost 200 modules, most likely loading them in one or several small cargo transporters, and disappeared.” The operation took probably less than 2 hours and the loss estimated at 42,000 euros. The thieves appear to be highly organized and the activity involves a black market network that extends to Italy, North Africa and Eastern Europe.  NTV writes it sometimes takes days before the solar system operator realizes part of the system has been stolen, noticing that electric output isn’t what is used to be. By then the thieves are long gone and the trail is cold. Security systems around the perimeter or GPS chips on each module are expensive, and so park operators are hesitant to install them because it takes already years before they start to see a return on their investment. NTV writes that operators are often afraid to inform the insurance companies of smaller thefts for fear of being forced to procure expensive security systems or else have their policies cancelled. NTV writes that damages from solar module theft in Germany runs in the tens of millions of euros annually. The problem is now so big that the German police has set up a special commission aimed at fighting back the solar criminals. Of course this further adds more costs for citizens who are already massively burdened by the high green electricity costs. The following German video from Bavarian BR Television shows how easy it is to steal modules in a matter of minutes, and reports on how one solar farm operator lost 200 panels valued at 40,000 euros.  NTV writes that because of a lack of transparency, the Italian mafia is now in the business of running solar parks equipped with stolen components. “For this reason solar parks in Italy are being used to launder money.”

"In a highly unusual turn of events for a sitting president, a federal judge in Florida on Wednesday ordered a golf resort owned by President Trump to pay $5. 7 million for refusing to refund deposits to members who wanted to resign from the club. In his ruling, the judge said that Mr. Trump, by sending a letter in late 2012 denying access to members who wanted to resign from the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter  —   a process that could take years  —   had set off a contract clause that should have resulted in an immediate refund of their membership fees. Instead, the money was withheld. The decision is the first court judgment against a company owned by Mr. Trump since he became president last month, and underscores that while Mr. Trump has stepped away from the operations of his company, he is certain to remain dogged by legal controversies connected to his business. At his new hotel in Washington, Mr. Trump is suing two celebrity chefs for breach of contract. The two men backed out of the Trump International Hotel development in 2015 after Mr. Trump made inflammatory comments about Mexican immigrants. Separately, the federal government owns the building that houses the hotel, and some legal experts have said that Mr. Trump may be in violation of his lease, which appears to prohibit federal elected officials from leasing the building. And last month, a lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhattan contending that Mr. Trump had violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other businesses to accept payments from foreign governments. Mr. Trump has not sold any of his assets, which include golf courses, commercial real estate and marketing agreements. Rather he has handed the operations of his company over to his eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, a move he hopes will reduce the appearance of conflict of interest. Wednesday’s ruling  —   by Judge Kenneth Marra of Federal District Court in West Palm Beach, an appointee of President George W. Bush’s  —   calls for the club to pay $4. 85 million in withheld fees to 65 club members involved in the lawsuit, plus an additional $925, 000 in interest and other costs. As a result, those members will receive refunds of $35, 000 to $200, 000, depending on their level of membership in the club. Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, said the company planned to appeal. “At the time Trump purchased the club, it was suffering financially, making it unlikely that these members would ever get back their deposits,” Ms. Miller said in a statement. “At trial, we presented overwhelming evidence that the plaintiffs’ memberships were never recalled and that the plaintiffs had waived this argument during the course of the litigation. ” The dispute at the Jupiter club centered on contracts signed by club members with the facility’s previous owner,  . To join, members paid initiation fees as high as $210, 000, depending on the type of membership that they wanted. But under  ’s rules those deposits were refundable when a member resigned. That process, however, could take years and while members on the resignation list waited for their turn to come up they could still use the club so long as they paid annual fees and other costs like food and beverage minimums. That all changed in 2012 when the Trump Organization bought the Jupiter club. Soon afterward, Mr. Trump sent a letter to members saying that those who wanted to resign were no longer welcome there. “I do not want them to utilize the club, nor do I want their dues,” the letter read. After club members sued, Mr. Trump testified in 2015 during a pretrial deposition that although he had signed the letter, it was his   son, Eric Trump, who was in charge of policies at the family’s golf courses. “Eric is much more familiar with this club,” his father said. “He runs it. ” In his pretrial deposition, Eric Trump testified that nothing had changed and that club members seeking to resign had been allowed to use the club so long as they paid their dues. That claim, however, was disputed at trial last year. One member on the resignation list, Richard Slawson, testified that the club’s membership manager told him soon after the Trumps took it over that the club was  . But he continued to receive $6, 000 bills for annual dues and thousands in minimum charges for food and beverages that were never consumed. “I couldn’t believe that we were charged that when we were not allowed to use the club,” Mr. Slawson, a Florida lawyer, said in a recent telephone interview. Confronted with such testimony, the younger Mr. Trump during his court testimony backed off his assertions and acknowledged he had been mistaken. “He made himself our strongest witness,” a plaintiff’s lawyer, Bradley Edwards, said about Eric Trump. “There was no way to reconcile his prior testimony with his testimony at trial. ”"

"It’s a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in the possession of a good fortune may well have worked in the US shale gas industry. In 2018 alone, about 21 trillion cubic feet of natural gas was produced, with commercial buyers paying around US$8 per thousand cubic feet. Given how profitable the US industry has been, it’s no surprise that governments and businesses in Europe were interested. In Poland, shale was seen as an opportunity to reduce or even eliminate dependence on Russian gas and to export gas to the rest of Europe. For the UK, it was hoped that shale could offset declining production from the North Sea and the growth of expensive gas imports. Natural gas and oil can be found in underground reservoirs between the rock grains. These conventional sources can be reached by drilling into such reservoirs, but unconventional natural gas is trickier to get to as it’s trapped between much finer-grained shale rock formations. To release gas or oil trapped in shale rocks, a reservoir needs to be artificially created by fracturing the rock and pumping fluid down the well bore until the structure breaks. The gas or petroleum can then flow out. In other words, a shale gas reservoir isn’t discovered, but created by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing – or “fracking”. A report by the Polish Geological Survey announced Poland’s technically recoverable resources could be 346 to 768 billion cubic meters of natural gas in 2012, while the British Geological Survey estimated in 2013 that the Bowland Shale in the north of England alone could yield 1,800 to 13,000 billion cubic meters. Other countries in Europe were less sanguine. France (2011), Bulgaria (2012), Scotland (2015), Germany and Ireland (2016) all banned fracking for shale gas, citing environmental concerns. The fortunes of the would-be shale gas industry in Europe have tumbled ever since those heady days in the early 2010s. Drilling results in Poland turned out to be poor – of the 72 exploration wells drilled there between 2007 and 2016, 25 were hydraulically fracked. But most of them were declared dry and failed to draw gas to the surface. The major petroleum companies involved pulled out. The UK plodded on alone until November 2019, when the Conservative minority government announced it was withdrawing support for fracking. Many of the UK’s opposition parties had already taken an anti-fracking stance on environmental grounds long before. There have been a handful of shale gas tests in the UK, with most in Lancashire and a few elsewhere in England. While there is a lot of gas trapped within shale rock in the north and south of England, Midland Valley of Scotland and parts of Wales, it’s likely that little of it can be extracted by fracking. Research from the independent ReFINE partnership jointly led by Durham and Newcastle Universities has shown that the estimated volume of technically recoverable shale gas in the UK was based upon a miscalculation. The total volume of shale was reasonably clear, though the quantity of gas within it wasn’t, as few samples of the rock were available for lab testing. Recent work on UK shale samples by Colin Snape at Nottingham University has demonstrated very poor gas yields. The gas may be there but it won’t come out. The situation in Poland is much the same. UK geology is complex and areas that could be explored are much smaller than the uniform and simple geology of the US Midwest. You just can’t drill the numbers of wells required by a shale gas industry and this is exacerbated by the fact that the UK is a crowded island. The accessible area is only about one-quarter of the total shale-bearing area in the country. The legal limit for induced seismicity in the UK is also so low that it effectively excludes any fracking which is designed to break the rock and hence cause Earth tremors. As an inherently chaotic process, forecasting the maximum magnitude earthquake that might result isn’t possible. The UK government announced a pause in shale gas fracking for some areas of the UK on the eve of a general election. It justified the decision on the basis that it’s impossible to accurately forecast the magnitude of induced earthquakes. This is certainly true today but it was also true ten years ago.

      UK government's fracking 'ban' has a convenient loophole


 It’s easier to stop doing something on environmental grounds when it will save face than admit that the UK’s shale gas illusion was just that – an illusion. This decision may be welcomed by many, but the country has wasted a decade or more chasing a fossil fuel fantasy. Distracted by shale, UK governments have let the potential of carbon capture and storage slip, while shying away from the steep emission reductions from heating and transport that are required to meet net-zero carbon targets. The UK’s shale gas unicorn may not yet be dead, as the government has left open a pathway back for the industry. Stopping fracking altogether would remove a major distraction to developing energy policy that reflects the urgency of the climate emergency.

"It is not just meat companies in Brazil that are under pressure over rising deforestation and widespread fires in the Amazon. The government has been forced to react after international investors and CEOs of Brazilian companies have protested, and now its own environmental officials have joined the chorus. But its response is hobbled by a deep distrust of global heating, fed by a far-right ideology reluctant to admit that the climate emergency has a human cause. Brazil’s foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo, has warned that climate change was a plot by “cultural Marxists” and President Jair Bolsonaro made a campaign promise to pull Brazil out of the Paris climate accord before reluctantly backing off. The international community has fought back, with Jan Erik Saugestad, CEO of Norway’s Storebrand Asset Management, leading a group of 29 investors with $3.7tn under management who warned that rising deforestation and the dismantling of environment agencies was “creating widespread uncertainty about the conditions for investing”.  Virtual meetings with Brazil’s vice-president, Hamilton Mourão, environment minister Ricardo Salles and leaders of the Brazilian congress have since been described as “positive”. “The vice-president expressed that the government is committed to keeping deforestation to a historically minimum level,” Saugestad said. “This represents a start of the dialogue.” But he added: “Of course we need to see action on the ground.” Mourão runs Brazil’s Amazon Council and heads up an army operation to counter deforestation and fires. He is sometimes presented as a more moderate counterpoint to the fire and brimstone of his boss, Bolsonaro. But in July last year, Mourão told the Guardian during an event that climate change was “being discussed … if this is a seasonal change, as has already happened in the history of Planet Earth, or if it is something that came to stay”. Salles called the climate crisis “secondary” in 2018. In a cabinet meeting this April – a video of which was released by a supreme court judge – Salles recommended the government use media attention on the Covid-19 pandemic to weaken environmental regulations – exactly what environmentalists had argued the government was already doing. Last September, during an interview with foreign journalists, finance minister Paulo Guedes told the Guardian that “there is still a precarious scientific basis” to climate change science. Such radical views do not sit well with everyone in that group of 29 nervous international investors. “All countries will have to react to the way the international investment community sees things,” said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investment at Nordea Asset Management. “If that is really what they think then they are really quite alone in the international community.” Bolsonaro is unlikely to care very much. He has long made controversial statements about the Amazon and what he sees as European interest in exploiting, not preserving it. He shows no signs of moderating his position. Last July, he responded to rising deforestation by sacking the head of Brazil’s Space Research Institute, the government body in charge of monitoring deforestation. After the highest number of fires since 2010 raged through the Amazon last August and caused an international storm, Bolsonaro falsely accused actor Leonardo DiCaprio of giving money to set it on fire.  He said Brazil was being unfairly criticised over rising deforestation because of commercial interests, an accusation he provided no evidence for. “Europe is an environmental sect,” he said. Agriculture minister Tereza Cristina repeated the accusation the same month. “There is an orchestration there abroad against Brazil,” she said, citing tensions over the trade deal between Mercosur, the South American trade bloc, and the European Union, which countries like Austria have signalled they will not ratify. The Brazilian government does have a plan to fight deforestation, as Cristina noted. It involves regularising the land titles of as many as 97,000 small properties, some of which have been there, she argued, since Brazil’s military dictatorship encouraged Amazon migration in the 1970s. Mourão told foreign reporters on 15 May that land ownership confusion was a major cause of deforestation. “[If] we don’t know who owns the land, we can’t bring them to justice,” he said.  But environmentalists disagree. They say regularising so many land titles, many of which were the result of invasions of public or protected land, means rewarding land grabbing. And current legislation already allows land occupied until 2011 to be regularised, said Brenda Brito, a land specialist and researcher at the Amazon non-profit group Imazon. In fact, Brazil already knows who is behind much of its Amazon deforestation, she said – even though many fines are ignored. A study published in May by MapBiomas – a non-profit group of universities, NGOs and technology companies that studies the Amazon – found over three quarters of deforestation alerts in 2019 overlapped with property with an owner registered on a self-declaratory system. The government argues that developing the Amazon will provide jobs and prevent people struggling to escape poverty from destroying the forest for wood, minerals and land. In May, Mourão said Brazil needed international help to develop into a “new economic model for the 21st century. It has to include biodiversity, innovation and a great deal of technology to reach its full potential,” he said. Last Tuesday, over 600 employees of Ibama wrote an open letter to the organisation’s president, Mourão, as well as the president of Brazil’s supreme court and congress leaders, stating: “Even though other government measures to generate jobs and income in the Amazon region can’t be left aside, without firm action against environmental crimes, the destruction rates of the Amazon forest will not decrease.”  Staff at the agency are banned from talking to the media. Key officials have been sacked for essentially doing their jobs and attacked by Bolsonaro for burning equipment belonging to loggers and miners as they are legally mandated to do."
"In the past five weeks, you’ve seen America inaugurate a president, march for women’s rights, protest an immigration order and debate a Supreme Court nominee. Even if you’ve only occasionally peeked at the news, the shock of so many updates may have left you reeling. This is the moment for a   vacation, especially one where the focus isn’t on screens. But it sounds easier than it is. “Being so technologically connected all the time, as many of us are, is overwhelming, and a break is a way to show yourself some love,” said Miriam Geiser, a travel consultant with KK Travels Worldwide in Chicago who has planned   getaways for clients and has taken several herself. “A   vacation is about slowing down and nurturing yourself so you feel truly mentally and physically rested at the end,” she said. Here is advice on how to take such a trip. D. I. Y. a Digital Detox  You don’t have to camp on a remote island to shed your devices. Leave your laptop and iPad at home, and lock your cellphone in your hotel room safe, using it only for emergencies. Sometimes, just the idea of cutting the cord can lead to anxiety, and the first few hours of such a trip can feel stressful, but Ms. Geiser said that many of her clients who have taken digital detox trips report feeling liberated and peaceful by the second day of their vacation. Suggested destinations: Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur, Calif. and any national park within driving distance. Painting Away the Pressure You don’t have to be Picasso, but a vacation incorporating art can inspire creativity in your everyday life, according to Susan Sparks, a travel adviser at Points of Interest Travel in Aspen, Colo. “Art is a way to express yourself and go beyond your usual spectrum, and that can be very reviving,” she said. Many resorts and spas around the world offer art classes, ranging from a few hours to several days, in painting, sculpture and collage. Suggested destinations: Vik Retreats in Uruguay Ojai Valley Inn  Spa in Ojai, Calif. and Sundance Mountain Resort in Sundance, Utah. Immerse Yourself in Nature There’s nothing more relaxing, according to Ms. Geiser, than being surrounded by nature. Hearing the sound of crashing waves or chirping birds and insects, taking in a beautiful vista on a pristine lake, smelling the flowers of a tropical garden or feeling the warmth of the sunshine on your skin stimulate the senses in a positive way and take you away from the hubbub of your daily life. Spend your days on a   trip, going on hikes, bike rides and walks, or consider kayaking, fishing, horseback riding or snowshoeing. Suggested destinations: Lake Kora in the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York the Resort at Paws Up in Greenough, Mont. Jade Mountain Resort in St. Lucia Minaret Station on South Island in New Zealand. Savoring Rather Than   Food  —   cooking and eating it  —   can actually be a destressor, Ms. Sparks said. “Cooking, even if you only do it for a few hours, shuts off your brain, and at the end, you have a meal that you put your heart and soul into,” she said. Weeklong cooking holidays abound around the world. Suggested destinations: Mamma Agata, a cooking school on the Amalfi Coast of Italy and Ballymaloe Cookery School in County Cork, Ireland. Many hotels also offer   and   cooking classes. The Wellness Retreat Route The singular focus of these means that they do often work. Some retreats are meant to be a lifestyle overhaul with medical professionals who complete a comprehensive diagnostic analysis and provide a customized road map to improve your health. Other programs are more focused on detoxes or cleanses, and others still are spiritual in nature, offering daily yoga or meditation. No matter the approach, you’ll return refreshed. Suggested destinations: The Ranch at Live Oak in Malibu, Calif. Golden Door in Escondido, Calif. Como Shambala in Bali Chablé Resort  Spa in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico."
"NEW DELHI  —   Three years ago, Dr. Rajesh Yadav, an investigator with the India Epidemic Intelligence Service, moved to the city of Muzaffarpur, the site of one of the country’s most mysterious outbreaks. And he waited. Every year in   as temperatures reached scorching heights, parents took children who had been healthy the night before to the hospital. The children awakened with a   cry in the early morning, many parents said. Then the youths began having seizures and slipping into comas. In about 40 percent of cases, they died. Every year in July, with the arrival of monsoon rains, the outbreak ended as suddenly as it began. Beginning in 1995, investigations variously ascribed the phenomenon to heat stroke to infections carried by rats, bats or sand flies or to pesticides used in the region’s ubiquitous lychee orchards. But there were few signposts for investigators. Instead of occurring in clusters, the illness typically struck only one child in a village, often leaving even siblings unaffected. A joint investigation by India’s National Center for Disease Control and the India office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, published  in the British medical journal The Lancet Global Health on Tuesday, has identified a surprising culprit: the lychee fruit itself, when eaten on an empty stomach by malnourished children. In 2015, as a result of the investigation, health officials began urging parents in the area to be sure to feed young children an evening meal and to limit their consumption of lychees (sometimes spelled litchi). In two seasons, the number of reported cases per year dropped to less than 50 from hundreds. “It was an unexplained illness for so many years,” said Padmini Srikantiah, a senior epidemiologist with the C. D. C. and the senior author of the paper. “This is kind of emblematic of why we collaborate, to build this kind of systematic approach. ” The Lancet article walks through a   medical detective story, as epidemiologists like Dr. Yadav closely examined the lives of hundreds of afflicted children, trying to understand everything they had eaten, drunk and breathed. “It was a very intense situation, because we witnessed children dying in front of our eyes every day, as soon as they arrived at the hospital,” said Dr. Yadav, who now works with the C. D. C. in Atlanta. Especially difficult were the detailed interviews of parents, many of whom had carried a convulsing or comatose child for hours to get to the hospital. “They were in a kind of panic,” he said. “Their children were dying, and it was an unknown thing. ” The first clue: There was no evidence the children had infections.  For 20 years, clinicians were unable to determine if the disease, which led to acute brain swelling known as encephalopathy, was caused by an infection  —   the immediate assumption in many outbreaks here. Investigators pored over records from the previous year’s outbreak and were struck by the fact that many of the sick children did not have a fever. Analysis of spinal fluid samples overwhelmingly showed that the affected children did not have elevated counts of white blood cells, a sign the body is fighting infection. The second clue: Most of the victims had very low blood sugar levels.  Having collected biological samples from more than 300 children, the researchers were able to scan a large number of markers  —   including some they hadn’t suspected. Glucose had never been a particular concern for investigators. But some of the affected children had strikingly low levels, and those with low blood glucose were twice as likely to die, Dr. Srikantiah said. “It seemed to be a little signal,” she continued. “One of the things we heard multiple times from the children’s mothers was that they didn’t really eat dinner properly. ” The third clue: Outbreaks had been associated with the ackee fruit.  It was in the fall of 2013, during a conference call with colleagues in Atlanta, that someone mentioned “Jamaican vomiting sickness,” an outbreak in the West Indies that for many decades caused brain swelling, convulsions and altered mental states in children. The outbreak turned out to be tied to hypoglycin, a toxin found in the ackee fruit that inhibits the body’s ability to synthesize glucose, leading to acute hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose levels. “It had been going on for a decade, if not a century, before people really figured out what it was,” Dr. Srikantiah said. “Now, the grandmothers and the mothers teach their kids, ‘Don’t eat the unripe ackee fruit.’ ” By late 2014, laboratory tests confirmed that lychees also contain high levels of hypoglycin, as well as a similar toxin known as methylenecyclopropyl glycine, or MCPG. This was an answer hiding in plain sight. The Muzaffarpur area, in India’s east, produces about 70 percent of India’s lychee harvest, and around the affected villages, “you really couldn’t go 100 meters without bumping into a lychee orchard,” Dr. Srikantiah said, referring to a distance of 330 feet. Though orchards were typically guarded by caretakers, children often ate lychees that were unripe or that had fallen to the ground. But because everyone in the region eats them, it was difficult for many to believe that, in isolated cases, it could set off a catastrophic illness. The fourth clue: Affected children had huge metabolic imbalances. By early 2015, C. D. C. laboratories had developed a test to measure hypoglycin in urine. They found extraordinary abnormalities in the affected children. “The folks in the genetic labs said ‘We haven’t seen anything like this,’ ” Dr. Srikantiah said. “This was clearly abnormal. ” With that established, the investigators asked participants if they would be comfortable issuing recommendations based on their findings: that young children in the affected areas be encouraged to always eat an evening meal, and that consumption of lychees should be limited. Everyone agreed. And it was done."

""Misinformation shared on social media has a serious impact on our elections and undermines our democracy,"" she added.
Other celebrities that have agreed to take part in the boycott include actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Sacha Baron Cohen and Jennifer Lawrence, as well as singer Katy Perry.
""I can't sit idly by while these platforms turn a blind eye to groups and posts spreading hateful disinformation,"" Perry wrote on Instagram.
Actor Ashton Kutcher, who has millions of followers and is also joining the boycott, said ""these tools were not built to spread hate [and] violence"".
The organisers of the #StopHateforProfit campaign, which was launched in June, accuse Facebook and Instagram of not doing enough to stop hate speech and disinformation.
The group has focused on Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp and last year attracted advertising revenue of almost $70bn (Â£56.7bn).
Thousands of businesses and major civil rights groups - including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Anti-Defamation League (AD) - have signed up to the campaign.
""We are quickly approaching one of the most consequential elections in American history,"" the group said in a statement. ""Facebook's unchecked and vague 'changes' are falling dangerously short of what is necessary to protect our democracy.""
In June, Facebook said it would label potentially harmful or misleading posts left up for their news value.
Founder Mark Zuckerberg also said the social media company would ban advertising containing claims ""that people of a specific race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, gender identity or immigration status"" are a threat to others.
""The 2020 elections were already shaping up to be heated,"" he wrote in a statement. ""During this moment, Facebook will take extra precautions to help everyone stay safe [and] stay informed.""
But the #StopHateforProfit campaign called for more to be done, and more than 90 companies subsequently paused advertising in support of its efforts.
As a result of the boycott, shares in Facebook fell dramatically and US media reported that $7.2bn had been knocked off Mr Zuckerberg's personal net worth.
Regulators and policy-makers around the world are concerned about the growth of hate speech, not just on Facebook but on all social media platforms, with many countries launching enquiries into how the tech firms are dealing with the issue."
"Tony O’Connell used to build whatever was put in front of him. The 53-year-old from Wonthaggi, a coastal town in Gippsland, Victoria, has been in construction for 34 years. “What was on the plan was what was on the plan,” he says. “I wouldn’t question it.” That is, until he attended a meeting for a proposed development in the area – one of a number of locals gearing up to run the interlopers out of town. “We all went along thinking, yep, it’s going to be a greenwash and just someone else doing a cookie-cutter development to cut our lovely little town up,” O’Connell says. But he left thinking they might have a point. More than a decade on, that development is The Cape, one of Australia’s leading eco-villages, in the nearby town of Cape Paterson. And O’Connell is one of a growing number of builders trying to improve Australian houses. Now, when a plan lands in front of him, he’s the first to point out how it could improve, coaxing homeowners into making small changes that he calls “two percenters”. A window shifted to a different wall, a patch of concrete floor that soaks up the winter sun – these tweaks can make a big difference. “I get a lot of irate calls from architects,” says O’Connell. According to Trivess Moore, a senior lecturer and researcher into sustainable housing at RMIT, builders – and plumbers, electricians, people who sell appliances and others – are “critical intermediaries” in delivering sustainable housing. Most people build new homes or do renovations rarely, Moore says, which leaves them reliant on tradies for information. “Quite often it might be that someone is recommended to you, ‘Oh, my friend used that builder, I’ll trust whatever they say,’” he says. “[The ideal is] when you do have builders who are going the extra mile, and also going ‘If this was my house, this is what I’d want for a better outcome.’” But green builders have a lot of work ahead of them. Building better houses from scratch is one thing. Improving Australia’s dismal existing housing is another. The national building code currently requires new houses to have a six-star energy-efficiency rating. The majority of houses built before 2005 have ratings between 1.5 and two. “They’re pretty shocking,” says Alan Pears, a senior industry fellow at RMIT who has been working in housing policy since the early 1980s. “[Problems with] windows, the building fabric, poorly insulated, poorly shaded and the houses leak like sieves.” O’Connell says many older homes are so leaky, the air in the house changes over about 15 times each hour. As well, they are full of inefficient appliances, spanning from hot water systems to fridges to lightbulbs to televisions. It all adds up – and exacerbates inequality. People on lower incomes are more likely to be living in older and poorer quality homes, and then either cannot afford or are not in control of upgrades. According to Kellie Caught, senior advisor on climate and energy at the Australian Council of Social Services, low-income households spend 6.4% of their income on energy bills, against a national average of 2.4% and just 1.5% for high-income households. Poor quality housing is also detrimental to people’s health, a factor likely to worsen as the climate crisis unfolds. “We’ve got a lot of people who in winter are suffering from cold,” O’Connell says. “And in summer, we have a higher death toll from people living in heat who can’t afford air conditioning than we do out of bushfires.” There are ways to make older homes more efficient, but some are harder than others. It’s easy enough to put insulation in ceilings and sometimes under floors, to replace lightbulbs with LEDs, and to plug gaps to keep out the cold and heat. Other changes, like upgrading to double-glazed windows, putting insulation into the walls, and buying better appliances can be costly, difficult or both. The poor standard of Australian buildings has prompted calls for a nationwide efficiency drive as part of federal and state coronavirus stimulus spending, which would also help tackle the climate crisis. About a quarter of national emissions are from buildings. The Australian Council of Social Service and the Australian Industry Group are among those to have urged the Morrison government to support an efficiency and solar power package for low-income and social housing, finding it could create 60,000 jobs. The chief scientist, Alan Finkel, has also highlighted the benefits of fixing the country’s leaky buildings, as have groups representing business, the energy industry, the property sector, unions and major investors. Beyond Zero Emissions, a climate change thinktank, analysed what it would take to transform Australia’s building sector as part of what it calls a “million jobs plan”. It found there would be about 200,000 jobs in a five-year program to perform 2.5m “deep energy retrofits” on existing homes and construct 150,000 7.5 star-rated social houses. Separately, researchers from the Australian National University set out to test how Covid-19 stimulus spending could have lasting economic value, cut emissions and improve people’s lives. They found energy retrofits, particular for low-income households, ticked all boxes. “You can just get the dollars out the door and into the community really quickly,” says Prof Frank Jotzo, director of ANU’s Centre for Climate and Energy Policy. “It would be a much better investment economically, socially and environmentally than the Homebuilder program, which is paying money to people who already have a project under way.” Advocates are clear that a nationwide housing overhaul is needed. But it just hasn’t happened. “We’ve been talking about regulating upgrading of older buildings since the 1980s,” Pears says, breaking into resigned laughter, “and we haven’t done it. “I think it’s fair to say there is a lack of will and leadership to drive this because it is tricky.” In the early 2010s, Heidi Lee was the project manager of Beyond Zero Emissions’ ambitious plan to retrofit every single building in Australia. “If you committed to doing it wholesale, it’s much cheaper,” Lee, now the project lead on BZE’s “million jobs plan”, explains. But when it comes to upgrading inefficient homes, you have to spend money to save it, and lots of Australians don’t have the cash sitting around. Another big weak point is the rental market. “The landlord would have to spend the money to upgrade the building and the tenant is the one getting comfortable and having lower bills,” Pears says. “Why would a landlord do that?” One way around this, and a major solution to unlocking mass retrofits, Lee says, is the expansion of environmental upgrade agreements across Australia. Under these agreements, owners can get low-interest loans that cover the upfront cost of energy retrofits and are paid back through council rates. If you get the design right, it doesn’t cost a lot of money to build sustainable Such schemes are currently available in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia, but only for commercial buildings. Victoria recently passed legislation to extend the schemes to homes. The space is still developing, Lee says, but could be extended to social housing. “We see upgrade agreements as a key plan for a green recovery, particularly coming out of Covid,” says Scott Bocskay, CEO of Sustainable Fund Australia. Bocskay says there are a number of other energy-saving schemes and incentives out there – for instance, Solar Victoria offers interest free loans for solar panels – but generally the approach is “fragmented”. Another option for prompting retrofits, Moore and Pears suggest, is putting a minimum energy-efficiency standard on houses that are put up for lease or sale. The Australian Capital Territory intends to introduce such a law for rental properties in 2021. “That’s a way of using the market to lift the bottom, but it also means if you choose not to sell your house for 10 or 15 years or whatever it might be, you don’t have to worry about that,” Moore says. “It doesn’t force everyone to make the change right now but it ensures that over time there is that lifting of standards.” There’s also the question of how to gain public momentum. People building new homes are often pushing for sustainability in the long term, but decision-making for renters tends to be more multifaceted. Plus, a house’s energy performance isn’t exactly visible. “It’s pretty hard to tell if there’s insulation in the walls. A lot of people don’t even know which way the house is facing,” Pears says. “And look, to be honest, most Australians have never lived in a decent house in terms of energy performance. We’ve all grown up in 50- or 20-year-old buildings that are pretty awful, and we don’t even know what a good building is until we live in it.” There’s no doubt homes being built in Australia today are better than those constructed last century. But experts and builders say the six-star requirement is already out of date, and leaves Australia in Europe’s dust. “While that may have been a big step 10 years ago, now six stars is so easy to achieve for a builder,” O’Connell says. “We’re building a lot of homes at the moment that people can’t afford to live in through extremes of temperature. We’re not planning for the future.” If you design a house well enough, O’Connell says, you can get to six stars with single-glaze windows and no insulation. Add a bit of insulation, and it rises to seven or eight. These are the kinds of dwellings he is working on at Cape Paterson, which he sees as a benchmark for better housing in Australia. “If you get the design right, it doesn’t cost a lot of money to build sustainable,” O’Connell says. “It’s when you don’t get the design right and you try to get your energy ratings by putting increasingly more expensive product in to try and achieve the rating, that it does cost a bit.” There are hopes the 2022 revisions to the National Construction Code will see the minimum standard for new homes and significant renovations lifted to seven stars. O’Connell delivers talks to other builders and to councils about building more sustainable homes. Change is slow, he says, but happening. “I think if you went back 10 years ago and talked about sustainable construction, people would think you were proposing to build an igloo somewhere,” he says. Now, people are starting to see sustainability as a long-term benefit instead of a drain on their bank accounts. “It’s hip pocket. They get their quarterly power bill, they know how much it’s costing, you demonstrate how little it can cost,” he says. “I think the thinking has changed now, where people are considering a lot of these things to be a benefit rather than a cost.” The coronavirus pandemic has devastated the economy but also presented a unique opportunity: to invest in climate action that creates jobs and stimulates investment, before it’s too late. The Green Recovery features talk to people on the frontline of Australia’s potential green recovery."

Latest Climate Idiocy: Global Warming Created ISIS
In recent weeks the Obama administration has blamed President Bush and/or the intelligence community for the creation of ISIS, others have blamed President Obama and his reluctance to get involved in another Middle East conflict, but apparently both positions are wrong. According to a recent article in the Huffington Post, the reason why ISIS was able to form and grow so fast was global warming (note: do not check your calendar it’s September not April fools day they really believe this).
The authors of the piece; Charles B. Strozier Professor of History, The City University of New York; and Kelly A. Berkell Attorney and research associate, Center on Terrorism at John Jay College of Criminal Justice believe that ISIS formed because of a severe drought in Syria from 2006-2010 and that drought happened because of—you guessed it—Climate Change.
As the Obama administration undertakes a highly public, multilateral campaign to degrade and destroy the militant jihadists known as ISIS, ISIL and the Islamic State, many in the West remain unaware that climate played a significant role in the rise of Syria’s extremists. A historic drought afflicted the country from 2006 through 2010, setting off a dire humanitarian crisis for millions of Syrians. Yet the four-year drought evoked little response from Bashar al-Assad’s government. Rage at the regime’s callousness boiled over in 2011, helping to fuel the popular uprising. In the ensuing chaos, ISIS stole onto the scene, proclaimed a caliphate in late June and accelerated its rampage of atrocities including the recent beheadings of three Western civilians.
While ISIS threatens brutal violence against all who dissent from its harsh ideology, climate change menaces communities (less maliciously) with increasingly extreme weather.
The drought that preceded the current conflict in Syria fits into a pattern of increased dryness in the Mediterranean and Middle East, for which scientists hold climate change partly responsible. Affecting 60 percent of Syria’s land, drought ravaged the country’s northeastern breadbasket region; devastated the livelihoods of 800,000 farmers and herders; and knocked two to three million people into extreme poverty. Many became climate refugees, abandoning their homes and migrating to already overcrowded cities. They forged temporary settlements on the outskirts of areas like Aleppo, Damascus, Hama and Homs. Some of the displaced settled in Daraa, where protests in early 2011 fanned out and eventually ignited a full-fledged war.
Although I am not a climate scientist (actually neither are the authors) it is easy to strike down their theory, both from a political and a scientific point of view:

ISIS did not form in Syria it formed in Iraq. In fact one of the reasons each party has been able to blame the other for the rise of the terrorist group is that ISIS used to be al Qaeda in Iraq. They were thrown out of the Bin Laden group because the ISIS leaders did not play nice with the al Qaeda leaders.


Perhaps the single most important factor in ISIS’ recent resurgence is the conflict between Iraqi Shias and Iraqi Sunnis. ISIS fighters themselves are Sunnis, and the tension between the two groups is a powerful recruiting tool for ISIS. The Shia government of Iraq refused to share power with the Sunnis (who held power under Saddam Hussein). The Shia/Sunni fight began as a fight over who got to take power after the Prophet Muhammad’s death and has been going on for almost 1400 years–way before ISIS.


Most observers believe ISIS was able to grow because American troops pulled out of Iraq too early and didn’t help out in Syria until it was too late.  Unless the drought happened in Washington DC, it couldn’t have had any influence on the President’s decision.


Droughts? science that states there has been no increase in droughts world-wide. In other words if you believe the world is going to hell in a hand basket due to global warming, that climate change is not increasing the number of droughts in in the world.

“It is misleading and just plain incorrect to claim that disasters associated with hurricanes, tornadoes, floods or droughts have increased on climate timescales either in the United States or globally,” Professor Roger Pielke Jr. said in his testimony before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
In May of 2014 Professor Pielke  published a graph that shows the intensity of the planet’s droughts from 1982 to 2012. The graph shows that neither droughts nor their intensity have seen a growth trend during that 30-year period.

It’s not getting warmer. Its incredible that almost every day the global warming hoaxers come up with another example of how the earth is being destroyed due to their hypothesis like the one being explored here. The truth is as of Sept. 1 the Earth hasn’t warmed in the last 17 years and 11 months (new numbers, through October 1will be out in a few days). Another way to look at it is the warming stopped approximately ten years before the drought in Syria…making it difficult for there to be a connection.

It is interesting that the authors contend “ISIS threatens brutal violence against all who dissent from its harsh ideology” which is true, ISIS not only threaten violence but they follow through with their threats. Also true is that the climate change proponents threaten violence. Thankfully they do not follow through with it, but they do attack people who question their unproven hypothesis as science haters and deniers of truth. Perhaps if they examined the facts instead of desperately trying to prove their hypothesis true climate change enthusiasts would realize the holes in their arguments.
Climate change helping to create ISIS is now #49 on the “official list,” of stupid things global warming enthusiasts have blamed on their failed theory:

In 2015 the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture released the latest iteration of their dietary advice, _Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015–2020_. Upon receiving it, Congress, citing concerns over scientific integrity, commissioned the National Academy of Medicine to review the process of generating those guidelines. In its commission, Congress asked the National Academy of Medicine for full transparency, lack of bias, and the inclusion of all latest available research, however challenging.



By so asking, Congress was suggesting that the federal government’s dietary recommendations — and in particular its long‐​standing demonization of fats and its praise for carbohydrates — were suspect. 



The story starts on January 14, 1977, when the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs published its _Dietary Goals for the United States_ , which, for the first time, attacked overeating. Previously, the Committee had worried about undernutrition, but by the late 1970s it worried that the epidemic of heart attacks could be attributed to an excessive intake of saturated fats. It therefore recommended that Americans eat carbohydrates instead.



Unbeknownst to the vast majority of Americans, however, the theory that replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates would lower the risk of heart attacks was unproven and disputed. Moreover, the government’s dietary advice led Americans to indulge in the widespread consumption of trans unsaturated fats, which are themselves dangerous. Further, this advice coincided with — and probably contributed to — the subsequent epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes.



Today, most nongovernmental dietary advice focuses on the benefits of plant‐​based fats and a Mediterranean diet, and while that, too, may be only a work in progress, it is much better than the paradigm that was disseminated by the government during the 1970s. Yet the government still propagates the oversimplified idea that fats are bad and carbohydrates are good. 



In fact, the federal government may be institutionally incapable of providing wise dietary advice, as Thomas Jefferson warned us in his 1787 _Notes on the State of Virginia_ : “Was the government to prescribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in such keeping as our souls are now.”



The federal government’s agencies have been issuing dietary advice for more than a century, but before 1977 they limited themselves largely to addressing malnutrition among the poor. The first two‐​thirds of the 20th century had witnessed the early triumph of nutrition research when, in a world still concerned with malnourishment, the discipline had helped oversee the discovery of vitamins and the elaboration of the basic principles of metabolic biochemistry. In 1968, the Senate created the Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs. At the instigation of its first chairman, Sen. George McGovern (D-SD) — who was to achieve his greatest prominence when he ran against President Richard Nixon — the committee focused initially on the problems of undernutrition. But a decade later, on January 14, 1977, when it published its _Dietary Goals for the United States_ , the committee launched an attack on the apparent problems of _over_ consumption. In his foreword to the _Goals_ McGovern wrote:



This is the first comprehensive statement by any branch of the federal government on risk factors in the American diet.  
  
Too much fat … [is] … linked directly to heart disease, cancer, obesity and stroke.  
  
… six out of the ten leading causes of death in the United States [heart disease, cancer, vascular disease, diabetes, arteriosclerosis and cirrhosis of the liver] have been linked to our diet.1



The committee reported unanimously, and in his own foreword Sen. Charles Percy (R-IL) wrote, “without government . . . commitment to good nutrition, the American people will continue to eat themselves to poor health.”2 Consequently, the committee explained, “We as a government . . . have an obligation to provide practical guides to the individual consumer as well as to set national dietary goals for the country.” Accordingly, Americans were urged to:



The committee had, in short, officially launched the anti-fat, high-carbohydrate campaign that was to dominate the world of nutrition until recently and which still reigns in official circles.



The problem was heart attacks. These had seemingly come out of nowhere and by 1968, at the height of the epidemic, accounted for more than a third (37 percent) of all deaths in the United States. By contrast, all cancers accounted for only a sixth (17 percent) of all deaths, and strokes only a tenth (10 percent). Accidents, at 6 percent, were the fourth most common cause of death.4 The sudden epidemic of heart attacks was profoundly alarming, especially as it seemed to target otherwise-healthy people at the peak of their performance.



Some physicians argued the epidemic was illusory, the result of better diagnosis and an aging population; yet that argument, although not trivial, was to be disproved. In 1966, for example, Leon Michaels, a Canadian physician, showed that the absence of evidence for heart attacks before the 20th century was indeed evidence for their absence: on comparing the characteristic chest pain of heart attacks with the characteristic pain and symptoms of migraine and gout, he showed that, whereas frequent descriptions of migraine and gout can be found in medical texts from all eras, stretching back to Greek and Roman times, angina and heart attacks started to be described with any frequency only in the 20th century.5 He thus concluded that the death rates from those diseases had increased up to 200 fold between 1901 and 1962, and although that rate of increase cannot be known with certainty, it is now accepted that the rise in the incidence of heart attacks during the 20th century was real (see Figure 1).



 **Figure 1: Death rates per 100,000 people from atherosclerotic heart disease and stroke**  




Faced with such an epidemic, some commentators argued it was surely reasonable for the U.S. government to address it. In 1974, for example, Marc LaLonde, Canada’s Minister of National Health and Welfare, had published a working paper, _A New Perspective on the Health of Canadians_ , intended to prescribe the diet of the Canadian people (in which he suggested that Canadians should eat less fat — in particular less saturated fat and less cholesterol — and more carbohydrates) and some commentators argued it was surely not unreasonable for the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs also to take a position.



It might indeed not have been unreasonable — had the committee’s position been a wise one. Yet the federal government may be institutionally incapable of providing wise dietary advice.



The senators on the Select Committee were not, of course, nutritionists, so they took their lead from the scientists, and from one scientist in particular: Ancel Keys (1904–2004), professor of physiology at the University of Minnesota. It was Keys who launched the modern dietary era in 1953 when he published his paper, “Atherosclerosis: A Problem in Newer Public Health.”6



By 1953 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations had collected dietary information on 22 countries. Keys selected data from six countries (Australia, Canada, England and Wales, Italy, Japan, and the United States) to generate his renowned graph, in which he showed that as the percentage of fat in the diet rose, ranging from Japan (7 percent fat in the diet) through to the United States (40 percent fat in the diet), so the death rates from heart disease of males aged 55–59 years rose accordingly, from 0.5 per thousand in Japan to just under 7 per thousand in the United States.



In 1953, as today, heart disease was understood essentially as the consequence of atherosclerosis. But whereas today we understand atherosclerosis to be an inflammation of the arteries, in 1953 it was seen more as a hardening (technically an arteriosclerosis) caused by the deposition of cholesterol within the arterial walls. Keys proposed that as people ate too much fat (in particular too much cholesterol) the blood vessels silted up with cholesterol, leading the heart to become diseased as its own arteries, being narrowed, failed to provide enough oxygen or nourishment. That process in turn would lead to a heart attack or myocardial infarction as the blood clotted over the cholesterol-filled artery and thus killed the patient. Here was Keys’s model:





**Initial Criticism of Keys’s Model.** It is often forgotten that, from its moment of conception, Keys’s model was heavily criticized: in 1955, for example, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened a small seminar of international experts, who proceeded comprehensively to demolish it (one of his colleagues remembered the WHO meeting as “the pivotal moment in Keys’s life. He got up from being knocked around and said ‘I’ll show these guys.’”).7 Among the critics were Jacob Yerushalmy and Herman Hilleboe, from the University of California, Berkeley, and the New York State Commission of Health, respectively, who attacked the model both at the seminar and shortly afterwards in a paper.8



At the 1955 seminar Keys had claimed “there is a remarkable relationship between the death rate from degenerative heart disease and the proportion of fat calories in the national diet,” which was supportable. But then he claimed “no other variable . . . shows anything like such a consistent relationship,” which wasn’t supportable.9 When Yerushalmy and Hilleboe reexamined the Food and Agriculture Organization data, they showed the association between animal protein and heart disease was stronger than between fat and heart disease. And the association between the total consumption of calories and heart disease was stronger yet. Meanwhile, the strongest determinant of calorie and meat intake seemed to be GDP per capita.



On the other hand, consumption of vegetables seemed to protect against heart disease, even though vegetables contain fat, protein, and carbohydrates. To further complicate matters, it appeared that the greater the consumption of animal fat and protein, the lower the death rates from every other condition except for heart disease.



So, the model that best accounted for the empirical facts was:





As Yerushalmy and Hilleboe pointed out at the 1955 WHO seminar, and as they expanded in their 1957 paper, the data thus suggested the citizens of poor countries (who largely ate vegetables, including starchy vegetables such as maize/corn, rice, and potatoes) didn’t die much of heart disease (but they were vulnerable to other diseases); while the citizens of rich countries (who ate a lot of meat, which includes much fat) died largely of heart disease (but were protected from other causes of death).



And to confirm that GDP per capita seemed central to the development of heart attacks, Yerushalmy and Hilleboe noted that atherosclerosis remitted when people reverted to a pre-Western lifestyle: during the Second World War and its aftermath, many parts of Europe had been reduced to meager diets, and those parts of Europe saw their rates of heart disease fall; but when normal food supplies were restored, heart disease returned. Heart disease, in short, seemed to be a consequence of a Western diet (which was in turn a consequence of Western wealth), but no single element of that diet could be identified as especially responsible.



The discussions at the 1955 WHO seminar were prescient, because the delegates saw ischemic heart disease not as the consequence of a single cause (cholesterol) but as the consequence of many complex, still-to-be-elucidated causes. More of those possible causes were soon being identified, and when in 1957 professor of physiology John Yudkin of the University of London reexamined the Food and Agriculture Organization data, he found:



a moderate but by no means excellent relationship between fat consumption and coronary mortality.… A better relationship turned out to exist between sugar consumption and coronary mortality in a variety of countries.10



Yudkin therefore proposed that sugar, not fat, was bad for the heart, and in his book _Pure, White and Deadly_ he wrote of “good nutritious foods like meat and cheese and milk.”11 Also in 1957, in a paper entitled “Dietary Control of Serum Lipids in Relation to Atherosclerosis” published in the _Journal of the American Medical Association_ , Pete Ahrens (1915–2000) of the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research — the doyen of fat biochemistry — who had long recognized carbohydrates as cardiac killers, was protesting that “unproved hypotheses are enthusiastically proclaimed as facts.”12 (Ahrens was later to greet the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs’ recommendations as treating people as if they were “a homogenous group of Sprague-Dawley rats.”13 ) George V. Mann, a University of Vanderbilt biochemist, was yet another researcher who had shown that Keys’s demonization of animal fats did not fit the cardiac facts.14



Meanwhile, in 1970, Richard Doll, the epidemiologist who had earlier reported that cigarettes caused lung cancer, found, “It is cigarette smoking . . . which is implicated in the aetiology and manifestation of myocardial infarction.”15 Figure 2 illustrates that one nondietary phenomena that tracks the incidence of atherosclerotic heart deaths is cigarette smoking.



 **Figure 2: Male peptic ulcer death rates and per capita cigarette consumption**  




Nor did the list of possible causes stop there, and further causes, including a lack of exercise and excessive stress, were soon identified.



By the 1970s, therefore, the criticisms of the 1955 WHO seminarians had been vindicated, and the only sure model compatible with the data was that found in Figure 3.



 **Figure 3: Proposed causes of atherosclerosis, circa 1970s**  




But which of the many possible factors was responsible for the epidemic of heart attacks could not be isolated.



So why in 1977 did the Senate committee back Keys’s dietary fat hypothesis against all the other possible causes of atherosclerosis? Well, Keys had generated a model: whereas no one could easily suggest how calories, protein, cigarettes, sugar, a lack of exercise, or a lack of vegetables could provoke atherosclerosis, Keys _could_ suggest how fat could do it.



 **Keys’s First Model for Atherosclerosis.** Keys’s first set of points noted that heart attacks were caused by atherosclerosis; atherosclerotic plaques were full of cholesterol; and patients who suffered heart attacks had elevated blood levels of cholesterol. Keys recommended avoiding cholesterol, noting that rabbits fed high levels of cholesterol develop atherosclerosis.16



Under this model:





By 1955, though, Keys had appreciated that dietary cholesterol is not a human danger: our livers synthesize most of our cholesterol, and when we ingest it in our food, our livers simply reduce their creation of cholesterol.17 This is not true of all animals, particularly not of herbivores such as rabbits, which — because plants are low in cholesterol — do not normally handle significant amounts of it. So herbivores, when fed high cholesterol in the laboratory, respond with raised cholesterol in the blood: their livers don’t know any better. But we are omnivores, our livers are not naive, and when fed high cholesterol we do not respond with raised levels of blood cholesterol. For us:





Although by 1955, within two years of originally proposing it, Keys had abandoned the dietary cholesterol hypothesis, for another 60 years the federal government continued to warn against consuming cholesterol-rich foods. It was only in 2015 that its Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee classified high-cholesterol foods such as eggs, shrimp, and lobster as safe to eat: “cholesterol is not a nutrient of concern for overconsumption.”18



This 60-year delay shows how asymmetrical the official science of nutrition can be: a federal agency can label a foodstuff dangerous based on a suggestion, yet demand the most rigorous proof before reversing its advice. The Harvard professor of epidemiology and nutrition Walter Willett, commenting on the asymmetry in a related area of government nutrition advice, described it as “Scandalous. They say ‘You really need a high level of proof to change the recommendations,’ which is ironic, because they never had a high level of proof to set them.”19



And it was Keys himself who championed asymmetry in dietary advice when he wrote in 1957 that nobody had “adequate evidence to state that there is not a causal relationship between dietary fat and the tendency to develop atherosclerosis in man” (i.e., he could condemn fat on the basis of a hypothesis only, yet it could only be classified as safe after exhaustive study).20 So Keys not only launched the cholesterol/fat paradigm on inadequate evidence, he also biased the debate in its favor.



Further, it may seem safer to advise abstention from a particular food than to clear one as safe. Yet this abstention may itself be dangerous, because abstention can have unintended consequences: other foodstuffs must be consumed instead. The Select Committee’s major scientific adviser was Mark Hegsted of Harvard, who wrote in his introductory statement to the _Goals_ of 1977:



The question to be asked, therefore, is not why we should change our diet but why not? What are the risks associated with eating less meat, less fat, less saturated fat, less cholesterol, less sugar, less salts, and more fruits, vegetables, unsaturated fat and cereal products — especially whole grain cereals?21



The answer to this question, namely that it would lead to the eating of more carbohydrates and more trans fats, both of which really are dangerous, would soon emerge. (Trans fats are chemically synthesized unsaturated fatty acids associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease.)



Meanwhile, the 60 years of official misinformation has taken its toll: a 2015 survey by Credit Suisse Foundation (a social research charity) found 54 percent of doctors falsely believed eating cholesterol-rich food raises blood levels of cholesterol and damages the heart. In the words of the survey, “This is a clear example of the level of misinformation that exists among doctors.”22



Keys always saw dietary cholesterol as only one of two problematical factors, and by 1955 he was presenting his second set of facts, noting that eating fat, especially saturated or animal fat, raised the blood levels of cholesterol. His recommendation was that we should avoid eating saturated and animal fats.



From this, he generated his second model:





This, of course, was the model the Select Committee was to eventually to endorse in 1977. But as we have seen, on its being presented to the WHO delegates back in 1955, they had immediately been skeptical, noting:



the evidence is circumstantial … no conclusions of etiological [causative] relationships should be attempted unless the factor is found to be related to the disease by evidence [are] from entirely different types of investigations.23



To counter this skepticism, Keys had launched his famous _Seven Countries study_ , published in 1970, in which he personally examined what people were eating in Finland, Greece, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the United States, and Yugoslavia. He refined his surveys to look at saturated (i.e., animal) fats rather than total fats in the diet, and yet again he found a strong association between (saturated) fat ingestion and deaths from heart disease.24



But the _Seven Countries study_ wasn’t the “entirely different type of investigation” for which the WHO experts had called, as it still generated data that were, in the WHO experts’ words, only “circumstantial.”25 Indeed, when one of Keys’s colleagues, Alessandro Menotti, recharacterized the foodstuffs in the _Seven Countries study_ , he found “sweets” (sugar‐​rich products, cakes, and other confectioneries) in the diet correlated more strongly with coronary mortality than did “animal food” (butter, meat, eggs, margarine, lard, milk, and cheese). Even Keys’s own program of work, therefore, suggested it might be carbohydrates, not fats, that killed people.26



The Select Committee’s gravest offense wasn’t going beyond the verifiable science, but actually flouting it. There is in epidemiology a “hierarchy of evidence”: some data are recognized to be more credible than others, and in particular randomized controlled trials (i.e., experiments) are recognized to produce harder data than observations (which may report only associations, and which may, in turn, mislead). By 1977 (when the Select Committee published its report) no fewer than six randomized trials had been performed on a total of 2,467 males (of whom 423 died from heart problems during the trials) in which their total and saturated fat intakes were reduced by placing them on low‐​fat diets. As predicted by the Keys hypothesis, the subjects on reduced dietary fat showed a fall in their circulating blood levels of cholesterol. But, contrary to the hypothesis, _their mortality rates did not fall_. In their devastating review of the six trials, freelance nutritionist and author Zoë Harcombe and her colleagues in Wales and Kansas City concluded, “Dietary recommendations were introduced for 220 million US citizens … in the absence of supporting evidence from randomized controlled trials.”27



That lack of hard evidence was recognized at the time, and in 1977 the American Medical Association responded to the _Goals_ with the statement:



The evidence for assuming that benefits [are] to be derived from the adoption of such universal dietary goals … is not conclusive, and there is potential for harmful effects.28



Although the committee had, in its _Goals_ , acknowledged the incomplete state of the science of the day, it had also written with approval:



Marc LaLonde, Canada’s Minister of National Health and Welfare, said: “Even such a simple question as whether one should severely limit his consumption of butter and eggs can be a matter of endless scientific debate … [so] it would be easy for health educators and promoters to sit on their hands.… But many of Canada’s health problems are sufficiently pressing that action has to be taken even if all the scientific evidence is not in.”29



On being challenged on the incompleteness of the science, Senator McGovern said “Senators do not have the luxury that the research scientist does of waiting until every last shred of evidence is in,” which is the opposite of the truth: research scientists are at leisure — and are perhaps even obligated — to explore every possible hypothesis, but senators should not issue advice _until_ every last shred of evidence is in, because they may otherwise issue misleading or even dangerous advice.30 As they did in 1977.



We see here a second reason why official dietary advice may be institutionally biased, because officialdom may be under pressure to issue it prematurely, sometimes even by decades. Moreover, this advice may be based on models rather than on hard facts.



The Keys model was two-staged:





Confusingly, both stages of the model were true. Mark Hegsted, the head of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard and the Select Committee’s major adviser, had shown that when humans ate saturated fat their circulating blood levels of cholesterol did indeed rise. Equally, two future Nobel laureates from Texas, Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein, showed — in certain inherited diseases of metabolism — that high blood levels of cholesterol can indeed cause heart attacks. So, the committee put two and two together and supposed:





thus reminding us of H. L. Mencken’s aphorism that for every complex problem there is a solution that is clear, simple, and wrong. As we saw above, when no fewer than six randomized controlled clinical trials had tested the complete model by withdrawing saturated fat from the diet of vulnerable men, their blood levels of cholesterol fell but their heart death rates did not. Why not?



It transpires there are at least three different types of circulating blood cholesterol. One type, so-called HDL (high density lipoprotein) is positively healthful, as it draws cholesterol out of the arteries. Another type, lLDL (large low density lipoprotein), is largely neutral, while a third type, sLDL (small low density lipoprotein) is the one that kills, as it (and its oxidized forms) tend to lodge in the arteries and precipitate the inflammation we know as atherosclerosis. Moreover, saturated fat in the diet tends to raise the circulating levels of the essentially neutral lLDLs, while carbohydrate in the diet tends to raise the circulating levels of the dangerous sLDLs. Therefore, it is carbohydrate, not fat, in the diet that raises the dangerous type of cholesterol, although the mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.



So it is no surprise the six randomized controlled clinical trials failed to find a fall in the rate of heart death rates following the reduction of saturated fat in the diet of vulnerable men. This is because the compensatory rise in carbohydrate intake was dangerous. To Mark Hegsted’s question in his introductory statement to the _Goals_ — “What are the risks associated with eating less meat, less fat, less saturated fat, less cholesterol?” — we can now reply that if, in consequence, people were to follow his advice and eat more carbohydrates and more trans fats in compensation, the risks are of precipitating early death from atherosclerosis. Irony of ironies.



Nonetheless the American people did as they were advised — not just by the government, but also by the mass media, which reinforced the government’s message.31 A survey performed jointly by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Food and Drug Administration showed that, by 1986, 72 percent of adults “believed that reducing high blood levels of cholesterol would have a large effect on heart disease.”32 Consequently, between 1960 and 2000, their per capita consumption of saturated fatty acids fell from 55 to 46 grams per day, and their per capita consumption of cholesterol fell from 465 to 410 milligrams per day. Meanwhile, their per capita consumption of carbohydrates rose from 380 to 510 grams per day and consumption of fiber rose from 18 to 26 grams per day (Figure 4).33



 **Figure 4: Obesity and the consumption of different foods in America, 1960–2000**  




Americans also increased their intake of unsaturated vegetable-derived fats chemically modified as trans fats (as in replacing butter with margarine) because it was believed that saturated rather than unsaturated fat was dangerous. So whereas in 1911 per capita consumption of butter was 19 pounds a year to 1 pound of margarine, by 1976 butter consumption had fallen to 4 pounds a year while margarine’s had risen to 12.34 We now know that trans fats lower healthful HDLs, raise the dangerous sLDLs, _and_ are inflammatory. Consequently, in the words of a recent authoritative review, they “contribute significantly to increased risk of coronary heart disease events.”35



The Select Committee’s demonization of saturated animal fat can only have damaged the health of Americans who followed its advice by causing them to increase their consumption of trans fats.



 **Keys and the Select Committee Vindicated?** Nonetheless, on following the Select Committee’s advice, an odd thing happened to the American people: their rates of heart disease and stroke fell, really quite dramatically (see Figure 1). So, does Figure 1 vindicate the Select Committee’s advice?



Before invoking Figure 1 as vindication of the Select Committee’s advice, consider Figure 2, which illustrates the course of another 20th-century epidemic, that of peptic ulcers. It is often now forgotten, but the 20th century witnessed an epidemic of peptic ulcers that mirrored that of heart attacks. Since nobody has suggested saturated fat is the cause of peptic ulcers, this must warn us not to confuse correlation with causation: a disease may reflect the incidence of heart attacks without that incidence proving that saturated fat is responsible.



Moreover, the stroke data in Figure 1 are incompatible with the Keys hypothesis. Strokes are caused by the same atherosclerotic process as heart attacks, yet their epidemiology looks different: namely, they peak before the 20th century, and during the first half of the 20th century they appear to decline even in the face of the high-fat Western diet. During the second half of the 20th century they continue to decline, even as the Western diet becomes lower-fat and higher-carbohydrate. Figure 1, indeed, shows that variations in dietary composition _cannot_ explain the epidemiology of strokes.



So, how can we explain the epidemiology of strokes? Well, the World Health Organization reports that in 2015, the latest year for which we have data, the two commonest causes of death among low-income economies were chest infections and diarrhea (i.e., bacterial and viral infections of the lungs and guts). But stroke was third.36



Strokes are a disease of poverty, and the British epidemiologist David Barker best explained the association of strokes with poverty when he showed — unexpectedly — a correlation between maternal mortality rates and strokes.37 In his words:



If you want to know how much … stroke there is in any city, any town, any rural village, do not count the hamburger outlets, the tobacconists, the playgrounds. Ask instead how many mothers died in childbirth several years ago.38



Maternal mortality rates are highest where mothers are poor and ill‐​fed and where, in consequence, their fetuses are malnourished. And a malnourished fetus is a fetus under metabolic pressure, so it must make a choice: which organs will it protect? Will it allow all its organs to be malnourished equally, or will it protect some organs at the expense of others? It appears a malnourished fetus chooses to protect its brain (these responses are little different from an adult’s: when adult mammals are starved, most of their organs shrink, the exceptions being the brain and, in the case of male mice, the testicles).39



So, on being starved, the fetus will deprive its other organs of nourishment, and in consequence it will grow into a short adult; and to help achieve that smallness, it will induce its muscles and other major organs to become resistant to insulin. The role of insulin is to direct the glucose we absorb from our food into our muscles and other major organs, so when we become insulin‐​resistant, their glucose uptake will be suppressed, thus sparing it for the brain.40 And, unexpectedly perhaps, it transpires that insulin resistance contributes to atherosclerosis.



Malnourished or poor mothers, therefore, produce children who are prone to developing strokes. But well‐​nourished or rich mothers do not. Hence the slope of the line in Figure 1: as mothers in the West have grown increasingly well‐​nourished, so their babies have been ever‐​less prone to developing strokes.



From the divergences between the two lines in Figure 1 we can see that the causes of strokes and heart attacks must be different. Although both are caused by atherosclerosis, this condition must affect the arteries of the brain and heart in subtly different ways. All, therefore, we can currently state with certainty is that atherosclerosis is an inflammation of the arteries of which there are many possible causes, including the insulin‐​resistance of the metabolic syndrome and raised levels of sLDL, but also including smoking, stress, hypertension, diabetes, and aging, as well as a range of inflammatory diseases including arthritis, lupus, chronic infections, and inflammations of unknown cause. Another inflammatory disease that can apparently cause heart attacks is peptic ulceration, which is caused primarily by infection with _Helicobacter pylori_ , because it transpires there is an association between _H. pylori_ infection and atherosclerosis.41 Importantly, therefore, we still cannot know with certainty what accounted for the epidemiology of heart deaths in the 20th century, which must weaken the confidence with which we can pronounce on any putative causative factor.



Fifty years after Keys had captured the Senate Select Committee’s imagination, the failings of the cholesterol hypothesis had become so obvious that in 2007 Gary Taubes, a science journalist, could publish a book _Good Calories, Bad Calories_ , which became a bestseller. In the book he claimed that carbohydrates in general, and sugar in particular, were the dietary hazards; natural fats were healthful.42



As we have seen above, there was already a long scientific tradition led by such professors as Yudkin, Mann, and Ahrens arguing for carbohydrates/​sugar, not fats, being the cardiac killers, but Taubes also had a populist predecessor, Robert Atkins (1930–2003), who in 1972 had published _Dr. Atkins’ Diet Revolution_. Atkins was a New York cardiologist who found that, for slimming, a diet low in carbohydrates and high in fat and protein worked.43



While Yudkin, Mann, and Ahrens had focused on sugar/​carbohydrates as the cause of _heart attacks_ , Atkins had focused on sugar/​carbohydrates as the cause of _obesity_. And Taubes continued in Atkins’s wake, noting that the epidemic of obesity (and type 2 diabetes) accelerated when fat in food was being replaced by carbohydrate (see Figure 4). Thus, between 1960 and 2000 the incidence of obesity more than doubled, from 13.4 percent of the population to 30.9 percent, while the incidence of type 2 diabetes rose even more markedly, from 2.6 percent to 6 percent of the population. Since 2000 it has continued to rise, and it reaches nearly 10 percent today.44



Yet we should eschew easy myth‐​making. Thus Jennie Brand‐​Miller at the University of Sydney, Australia, has shown that in Australia and the United Kingdom, sugar consumption fell between 1980 and 2003 even as obesity rose, which suggests that obesity cannot be attributed to any single nutrient.45 Moreover, a recent massive study of the literature (data on 68.5 million people) found that while overweight (body mass index [BMI] over 25) and obesity (BMI over 30) are — as is widely known — associated with cardiovascular and other diseases, the impact may be less important than is widely feared, and the authors of the study noted that “the rate of this increase has been attenuated owing to decreases in underlying rates of death from cardiovascular disease.”46 Indeed, life expectancies in the United States have continued to rise (as they have continued to rise among industrialized countries since 1840) by three months for every year lived, or six hours for every day lived, which is truly extraordinary.47 Moreover, the so‐​called “obesity paradox” reveals how, under some circumstances, being overweight can apparently be healthful, and we should remember that as early as 1955 the WHO symposium noted that the Western diet had dual effects in both stimulating and damaging our health.48 We are still trying to understand these effects, and it must be premature to confidently dictate our diet.



There is nonetheless currently a scientific consensus on health and diet, which has been summarized by the American Heart Association:



But this consensus has not yet deeply penetrated the public debate, and while most popular commentators now follow the Taubes anti‐​carbohydrate/​anti‐​sugar story, the federal government and leading medical authorities still follow the traditional anti‐​fat story.50 This divergence of opinion is both unnecessary and unhelpful.



Reducing food to its constituent chemicals such as carbohydrate or fat is now increasingly criticized as “nutritionism,” because such reductionism may mislead by ignoring the complex and generally unknown interactions between the different chemicals in food.51 So, for example, the data may mean that meat is dangerous not because of its fat content but because of its protein or haem content (haem being the iron‐​containing chemical in meat that gives it a red color).52 Equally, a Harvard group has identified that plant‐​based diets that are rich in sugars, starch, or refined carbohydrates may be unhealthful.53



The current American Heart Association advice, therefore, seeks to avoid the nutritionist error by recommending a “Mediterranean” diet (rich in olive oil, vegetables, fruit, nuts, and legumes such as peas, beans, lentils, and chickpeas; moderate in fish, poultry, alcohol, and wholegrain cereals; and low in red meat, processed meat, and sweet foods such as cakes or jams). The similar DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is also recommended by the association.54



Taubes suggested that, calorie for calorie, carbohydrates in the diet may promote obesity more than fat does because they stimulate the secretion of insulin, which in turn stimulates adipocytes (fat cells) to store fat: just as a pubertal girl puts on weight around her hips and at her breasts because of the local actions on fat cells by certain female hormones (not because she’s suddenly started to overeat), so someone who swaps fats for carbohydrates may start to put on weight because of the generalized effect on fat cells of insulin. Further, insulin drives down blood sugar levels, which in turn promotes the secretion of hunger hormones such as ghrelin, which therefore stimulates further eating.55



The central question remains: Why, in 1977, did the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs publish its _Dietary Goals for the United States_ when so many credible authorities, including Yudkin, Atkins, Ahrens, Mann, and the American Medical Association, had anticipated, at least in part, today’s understanding of carbohydrates and other saturated fat substitutes as dangerous?



One problem is that scientists are much less scientific than is popularly supposed. John Ioannidis of Stanford University has shown in his 2005 paper “Why Most Published Research Findings Are False” (which has been cited nearly 5,000 times) that the poor application of statistics allows most published research findings to indeed be false, while Brian Nosek of the University of Virginia recently reported — again in large part because of the poor application of statistics — that fewer than half of published studies in psychology can be reproduced.56 Although Nosek’s findings have been challenged, it is now commonplace to describe a “crisis of reproducibility” in science, and mainstream scholars now write articles with such titles as “Saving Science.”57 Too many research papers, in short, cannot be trusted. Why not?



There is a perverse reason that scientists use poor statistics: career progression. In a paper entitled “The Natural Selection of Bad Science,” Paul Smaldino and Richard McElreath of the University of California, Merced, and the Max Planck Institute, Leipzig, found that scientists select “methods of analysis … to further publication rather than discovery.”58 Smaldino and McElreath report how entire scientific disciplines — despite isolated protests from whistleblowers — have, for more than half a century, selected statistical methods precisely because they will yield publishable rather than true results. The popular view is that scientists are falsifiers, but in practice they are generally verifiers, and they will use statistics to extract data that support their hypotheses. Keys, for example, was not a dishonest man, he was merely a typical scientist who had formulated a theory, which — by using poor statistics — he was able over the course of a long career and many publications to appear to verify.



Aggravating the problem of poor science is that research operates a version of public‐​choice theory: in his 1965 _Logic of Collective Action,_ Mancur Olsen showed how small interest groups can capture public policy, and publicly funded science is no exception. Once armed with power over government‐​funded research grants, access to peer‐​reviewed journals, and appointments to university positions, Keys and his fellow elite researchers could enforce their paradigm on the whole field. Which was why the successful paradigm‐​shifter emerged not as a mainstream scientist but as a journalist — Taubes — who was spared the pressure to conform. And this public‐​choice aspect of science was aggravated by the Senate Select Committee’s endorsement of the fat paradigm, which fueled it, literally, with public money.



The federal government’s failings were further aggravated by lobbying. When McGovern’s committee reported, the reaction from the meat, egg, and other food lobbyists was so vitriolic that the committee was forced to hold additional public hearings. Following those, a second edition of _Dietary Goals for the United States_ was hurriedly released in late 1977, retracting some of its strongest earlier claims. For example, the committee added this sentence: “science [cannot] at this time insure that an altered diet [will] provide improved protection from killer diseases such as heart disease.”59 As it happened, the meat and egg lobbyists were not wrong in all their objections, but they influenced the committee not because of their superior science, but because of their electoral power.



Because of the controversy, the reputation of the Select Committee suffered, and its mandate was allowed to lapse. The issuance of further federal dietary advice was then charged to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA), which have since jointly published, every five years, their _Dietary Guidelines for Americans_ (the most recent was in 2015), which have, however, only reinforced the anti‐​fat, pro‐​carbohydrate message of the original 1977 _Dietary Goals_. This message was to be popularized in the USDA’s Food Guide Pyramid (1992), MyPyramid (2005), and MyPlate (2011).



The USDA was so empowered specifically to help protect agricultural interests, which inevitably has distorted its advice. Marion Nestle, for example, professor of nutrition at New York University, reports that when she was hired to edit the 1988 _Surgeon General’s Report on Nutrition and Health_ ,



My first day on the job, I was given the rules: no matter what the research indicated, the report could not recommend “eat less meat” as a way to reduce the intake of saturated fat, nor could it suggest restrictions on intake of any other category of food.60



Indeed, Marion Nestle’s book _Food Politics:_ _How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health_ , was first published in 2002; it is now in its third edition, and it has been cited no fewer than 2,250 times, yet the food industry still influences the federal government’s advice. Thus the _New York Times_ for January 18, 2016, reported that the early drafts of the _2015–2020 Guidelines_ confirmed that red and processed meats increase the risks of developing bowel and other cancers, but — following the lobbying of Congress by the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association — the reference was removed from the final version.61



The problem of poor science is aggravated in food because of the vast weight of papers (containing highly selective information and highly selective statistics) that are published in distinguished journals by food companies themselves. A recent survey showed, for example, that reviews of the literature authored by scientists with financial links to the sugar industry were _five times less likely_ to conclude that sugar aggravated obesity or weight gain than did reviews authored by independent scientists.62 Where a field of research such as food science can be dominated by producers’ research, therefore, it can be doubly difficult to determine the various sources of bias. And the bias can be secret: we now know, for example, that Mark Hegsted, the Senate committee’s chief scientific adviser, was being secretly paid by the sugar producers to condemn fat and exonerate sugar and carbohydrates.63



Governments may be institutionally incapable of providing disinterested advice for at least four reasons. First, the scientists themselves may be divided, and by choosing one argument over another, the government may be making a mistake. Second, by abusing the precautionary principle, the government may be biasing its advice away from objectivity to risk‐​avoidance long before all the actual risks have been calculated. Third, because of public pressure, it may offer premature advice. And fourth, its advice will be distorted by lobbying.



Congress has lost patience with official dietary advice, so it commissioned the National Academy of Medicine to review “the entire process used” to generate the official guidelines, although unfortunately the review was limited only to methodology and not results.64 But why should the federal government issue health advice at all? The general public, sadly, will give greater credence to federal government pronouncements than the science can bear, and it would surely be healthier to promote a free market in research ideas. There are a large number of scientific institutions qualified to give advice on food, and it would surely be healthier for the public to be exposed directly to their disagreements rather than for the federal government to proselytize an apparent consensus that, in reality, is only partial and selective.



The tragedy is that food science is, because of the power and money of its commercial sponsors, deeply flawed, yet government — by inserting its own biases — has only amplified that science’s faults. Society does need a truly independent, truly high‐​powered entity to interrogate food science’s output, but that will have to be sought among the ranks of people like Gary Taubes, who have made a career of probing the biases of science.



There is a tradition of politicians involving themselves in science. From William Jennings Bryan’s attack on evolutionary theory in the Scopes Trial, to Al Gore and Donald Trump distorting modern climate science, politicians inevitably politicize science and almost always get it wrong; Senator McGovern’s actions were only one example of the many that have damaged the credibility of both science and politics. More than 200 years ago Thomas Jefferson warned politicians particularly not to engage with dietary science, and we need to reheed his warning.65

"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Uber is one step closer to its dream of a   future  —   with a little help from a new partner. The   company announced on Tuesday a partnership with Daimler, under which the German automaker plans to build autonomous vehicles that will operate on Uber’s transportation network. The move marks the first time a major automaker will provide its own   vehicles  —   built entirely   and without Uber’s help  —   specifically to operate on the   company’s network. The agreement is not exclusive, and Daimler may produce autonomous cars for Uber’s competitors, while Uber can also bring other automakers onto what it calls its “open platform” for ride hailing. The two companies said they expected Daimler’s   vehicles to reach Uber’s network “in the coming years. ” “Auto manufacturers like Daimler are crucial to our strategy because Uber has no experience making cars  —   and in fact, making cars is really hard,” Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We can combine Uber’s global   network with the   vehicles of companies like Daimler, so that Uber riders can have a great experience getting around their cities. ” Uber has a history of cooperating with automakers to jointly produce autonomous vehicles. The company has worked with Volvo to develop the XC90, a   sport utility vehicle now being tested in Pittsburgh, near Uber’s   research headquarters. Uber has also modified a fleet of Ford Fusion vehicles, outfitting them with sensors and cameras for autonomous capabilities. Lyft, Uber’s largest competitor in the United States, has also worked closely with a major automaker, General Motors, which is making its own   vehicles for Lyft’s   network. Google struck a deal with Fiat Chrysler last year to work on   vehicles. Uber stands to benefit from the Daimler partnership in several ways. Collaborating with automakers could reduce the perception that Uber is a threat to the sales of the auto industry, for example. The company can also bolster its supply of vehicles to pick up a growing base of riders. Uber faced some setbacks with its   experiments last year. It ended a pilot program in San Francisco in December after disagreeing with California’s Department of Motor Vehicles over whether it had the proper permits for the test. Uber plans to begin a similar test in Phoenix in the coming months. “Daimler aims to be a leader in autonomous driving,” Dieter Zetsche, Daimler’s chairman, said in a statement. “Together with Uber, we seek to combine our strengths. ”"

More despicable climate hype from Noah Diffenbaugh (press release follows) who is ignoring the obvious: California has had far worse droughts before “global warming” was a glimmer in a scientist’s eye, and these were driven by changes in weather patterns that happened long before CO2 became an issue. For example the worst drought of the past century doesn’t even make the top ten. And as this graph shows, our current California drought is but a blip in the larger historical scheme of things:
UPDATE: WUWT reader Jimbo adds in comments that the models are about a 50/50 split over wetter/drier:
To more directly address the question of whether climate change played a role in the probability of the 2013 event, the team collaborated with scientist Bala Rajaratnam, also of Stanford.

It’s called the weather and GIGO. Climate computer simulations are a pile of crap.
Abstract
The Key Role of Heavy Precipitation Events in Climate Model Disagreements of Future Annual Precipitation Changes in California
Climate model simulations disagree on whether future precipitation will increase or decrease over California, which has impeded efforts to anticipate and adapt to human-induced climate change……..Between these conflicting tendencies, 12 projections show drier annual conditions by the 2060s and 13 show wetter. These results are obtained from 16 global general circulation models downscaled with different combinations of dynamical methods…

Extreme atmospheric conditions responsible for drought more likely to occur in current global warming
 
The drought crippling California is by some measures the worst in the state’s history.
Credit and Larger Version
September 29, 2014
The atmospheric conditions associated with the unprecedented drought in California are very likely linked to human-caused climate change, researchers report.
Climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh of Stanford University and colleagues used a novel combination of computer simulations and statistical techniques to show that a persistent region of high atmospheric pressure over the Pacific Ocean–one that diverted storms away from California–was much more likely to form in the presence of modern greenhouse gas concentrations.
The result, published today in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, is one of the most comprehensive studies to investigate the link between climate change and California’s ongoing drought.
“Our research finds that extreme atmospheric high pressure in this region–which is strongly linked to unusually low precipitation in California–is much more likely to occur today than prior to the emission of greenhouse gases that began during the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s,” says Diffenbaugh.
The exceptional drought crippling California is by some measures the worst in state history.
Combined with unusually warm temperatures and stagnant air conditions, the lack of precipitation has triggered a dangerous increase in wildfires and incidents of air pollution across the state.
The water shortage could result in direct and indirect agricultural losses of at least $2.2 billion and lead to the loss of more than 17,000 seasonal and part-time jobs in 2014 alone.
Such effects have prompted a drought emergency in the state; the federal government has designated all 58 California counties as natural disaster areas.
“In the face of severe drought, decision-makers are facing tough choices about the allocation of water resources for urban, agricultural and other crucial needs,” says Anjuli Bamzai, program director in the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, which funded the research.
“This study places the current drought in historical perspective and provides valuable scientific information for dealing with this grave situation. ”
Scientists agree that the immediate cause of the drought is a particularly tenacious “blocking ridge” over the northeastern Pacific–popularly known as the Ridiculously Resilient Ridge, or “Triple R”–that prevented winter storms from reaching California during the 2013 and 2014 rainy seasons.
Blocking ridges are regions of high atmospheric pressure that disrupt typical wind patterns in the atmosphere.
“Winds respond to the spatial distribution of atmospheric pressure,” says Daniel Swain of Stanford, lead author of the paper.
“We have seen this amazingly persistent region of high pressure over the northeastern Pacific for many months, which has substantially altered atmospheric flow and kept California largely dry.”
The Triple R was exceptional for both its size and longevity.
While it dissipated briefly during the summer months of 2013, it returned by fall 2013 and persisted through much of the winter, California’s wet season.
“At its peak in January 2014, the Triple R extended from the subtropical Pacific between California and Hawaii to the coast of the Arctic Ocean north of Alaska,” says Swain, who coined the term “ridiculously resilient ridge” to highlight the persistent nature of the blocking ridge.
Like a large boulder that has tumbled into a narrow stream, the Triple R diverted the flow of high-speed air currents known as the jet stream far to the north, causing Pacific storms to bypass not only California, but also Oregon and Washington.
As a result, rain and snow that would normally fall on the West Coast were instead re-routed to Alaska and as far north as the Arctic Circle.
An important question for scientists and decision-makers has been whether human-caused climate change has influenced the conditions responsible for California’s drought.
Given the important role of the Triple R, Diffenbaugh and colleagues set out to measure the probability of such extreme ridging events.
The team first assessed the rarity of the Triple R in the context of the 20th century historical record.
Analyzing the period since 1948, for which comprehensive atmospheric data are available, the researchers found that the persistence and intensity of the Triple R in 2013 were unrivaled by any previous event.
To more directly address the question of whether climate change played a role in the probability of the 2013 event, the team collaborated with scientist Bala Rajaratnam, also of Stanford.
Rajaratnam applied advanced statistical techniques to a large suite of climate model simulations.
Using the Triple R as a benchmark, Rajaratnam compared geopotential heights–an atmospheric property related to pressure–between two sets of climate model experiments.
One set mirrored the present climate, in which the atmosphere is growing increasingly warmer due to human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
In the other set of experiments, greenhouse gases were kept at a level similar to those that existed just prior to the Industrial Revolution.
The researchers found that the extreme heights of the Triple R in 2013 were at least three times as likely to occur in the present climate as in the preindustrial climate.
They also found that such extreme values are consistently tied to unusually low precipitation in California, and to the formation of atmospheric ridges over the northeastern Pacific.
“We’ve demonstrated with high statistical confidence that large-scale atmospheric conditions similar to those of the Triple R are far more likely to occur now than in the climate before we emitted large amounts of greenhouse gases,” Rajaratnam says.
“In using these advanced statistical techniques to combine climate observations with model simulations, we’ve been able to better understand the ongoing drought in California,” Diffenbaugh adds.
“This isn’t a projection of 100 years in the future. This is an event that is more extreme than any in the observed record, and our research suggests that global warming is playing a role right now.”
The research was also supported by the National Institutes of Health. Rajaratnam was also supported in part by DARPA, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the UPS fund.

"After two weeks and more than 1,800 arrests in London alone, Extinction Rebellion’s latest display of disruption has drawn to a close. The full impact of its “Autumn Uprising” is still to be determined, but one thing is already clear: this time, police in Britain were prepared. Perhaps counter-intuitively, changes to the justice system in the wake of austerity measures have actually boosted the state’s ability to counter Extinction Rebellion’s innovative protest tactics. Now, the road to systemic change appears much longer than the historical successes they take inspiration from. The movement’s main strategy holds that systemic political change can be achieved when a sufficient proportion of the population is willing to risk arrest to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience. As outlined in co-founder Roger Hallam’s Common Sense for the 21st Century, the application of enough pressure “to a single point in time and space” – in this case London – should overwhelm the justice system and force governments to listen. Hallam developed his ideas after studying successful nonviolent mobilisations in Alabama in 1963, Leipzig in 1989, and Nepal in 2006. In all those instances, protesters achieved their goals after reaching a seemingly impossible “tipping point” in the balance of power between the state and its citizens. Growing social movements were met with extremely violent reactions by the police, which backfired. Masses of people joined the protests, filled jail cells and even risked getting shot. Overwhelmed by the scale of mobilisation, authorities implemented many of the changes demanded by protesters. But this time round there’s no guarantee that the story will be the same. Following the 2008 global financial crash, a series of austerity measures in the UK left public services downsized, on stretched budgets, and perpetually reorganising themselves. From health and education to transport and policing, public servants were told to “do more with less”, leaving workforces understaffed, demoralised, and unable to plan for the long term. On the back of these difficulties – and with no political will to increase funding – public service managers resorted to restructuring public services to be “agile”. That is, fast and flexible in the face of limited resources and changing political and public priorities. They began to favour quick experimentation in place of careful deliberation, and empowered workers to collaborate and innovate new responses to problems as they arise. They also embedded a strong culture of performance measurement, so that the value of new ways of working could be quickly and easily assessed. While an agile public service is not equipped to meet all its responsibilities well, it is precisely adapted to meet transient pressing demands. Because of this, it is now much more difficult than it once was for social movements to overwhelm the police service and justice system through a numbers game. For one, the system is already structured to navigate disruption from its own budget holders. Second, it is accustomed to withdrawing services in one place to cover another. Finally, its focus on measurement outcomes means that the burden of taking large numbers of people to court actually presents an opportunity for managers to show that their service is performing well. In April, Extinction Rebellion’s tactics – including the use of glue and locks to more effectively block routes, and swarming tactics to overload sites at risk of being lost – were highly successful. Unused to these strategies, police were unable to unblock some locations in central London for more than a week. In the run-up to October’s rebellion, London’s Metropolitan police (Met) declared its intention “to be agile … and be prepared to change and shift” – and showcased its ability to do so over the following fortnight. Forces came armed with specially trained “protest removal teams” and used Section 14 powers – under which officers can arrest individuals remaining in a specified area – more aggressively. As a result, police made more than twice as many arrests in the first four days of October’s rebellion than in the same period six months earlier. Officers also exercised much more discretion when handling protesters, for example using “pain and compliance” techniques, asking protesters to raise their hands, using plain clothes officers to stir up crowds, and cyber attacks against social media assets. These legally questionable actions have the hallmarks of trial and error experimentation in an attempt to find effective methods of controlling protesters. The biggest experiment of all came when the Met used its Section 14 powers to ban all Extinction Rebellion protests throughout the city. This unprecedented move was widely criticised and is facing a court challenge – but its very introduction is evidence of agile and innovative policing. Even if the blanket ban is ruled unlawful, there’s no guarantee that laws won’t change in the near future. For example, the Met is asking for the legal definition of “disruption” to change because it doesn’t deem current arrangements flexible enough. Extinction Rebellion’s civil disobedience certainly places a burden on the justice system. But to date, that burden is one the Met feels it is “able to cope with”. If the fast-growing movement continues its trajectory, it may yet replicate past successful nonviolent mobilisations. But facing a newly flexible police force with far more options than brutal violence, the goalposts are that little bit further away. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

The major US publishers are asking for better terms when people take out subscriptions to their news platforms via Appleâs app store.
The iPhone maker currently takes a commission from publishers of between 15% and 30% for first-time subscriptions.
However, DCN points out that Amazon enjoys a reduced rate from Apple as it meets certain conditions.
News publishers want to know what these requirements are so they can be offered the same terms, according to the letter written by DCN chief executive Jason Kint.
Apple is also involved in a dispute with Epic Games, the makers of the popular Fortnite video game over revenue it earns from its app store.
The gaming firm has started legal action after being taken off Apple's app store following the fallout. Epic Games is unhappy about the 30% cut Apple takes when players make in-game purchases via the app store.
**Google under pressure**
Fellow tech giant Google is currently involved in a battle with Australiaâs competition watchdog over the payment of news content it uses on its site.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has published draft legislation which called on internet firms such as Facebook and Google to pay for the content they repost.
Google attacked the proposals this week saying its YouTube and Search features could be ""dramatically worse"" if new rules were brought in.
This relates to a recommendation from the ACCC that Google shares more data with publishers about its users, and alerts them when it changes its algorithms.
While Google says it does pay for some news content it uses, the Australian regulator wants to âlevel the playing fieldâ so publishers can negotiate these rates.
**Paying for content**
Some business experts argue that itâs only fair that the search engine giant pays publishers for their quality news content that it reposts.
âLow quality âheadlineâ news will probably always be free, but added value journalism has a significant cost and if that cost cannot be monetised, it will be devalued or it will disappear,â warned Michael Wade, a professor at the IMD Business School in Switzerland and Singapore.
âGoogle, Facebook and others have been getting away with giving it away for free for too long,â Professor Wade told the BBC.
Google says it is currently working on a global licensing programme to pay publishers for high-quality content that it hopes to roll out later this year.
This will help publishers monetise their content and âlets people go deeper into more complex stories, stay informed and be exposed to a world of different issues and interests,â said Google spokesman Brad Bender.
âThe very content creators that have done so much for Google are in danger of extinction if Google doesnât do a better job of sharing the gains from its technology with the actual content creators,â added financial technology entrepreneur Dr. Richard Smith."
"Our objective in making this film was something of a psychology experiment: We sought to capture people facing a difficult situation, to make a portrait of humans in doubt. We’ve all seen actors playing doubt in fiction films, but we have few true images of the feeling in documentaries. To make them, we decided to put people in a situation powerful enough not to need any classic narrative framework. A high dive seemed like the perfect scenario. Through an online advertisement, we found 67 people who had never been on a   (about 33 feet) diving tower before, and had never jumped from that high. We paid each of them the equivalent of about $30 to participate  —   which meant climbing up to the diving board and walking to its edge. We were as interested in the people who decided to climb back down as the ones jumping. We filmed it all with six cameras and several microphones. It was important for us not to conceal the fact that this was an arranged situation, and thus we chose to show the microphones within the frame. Ultimately, about 70 percent of those who climbed did jump. We noticed that the presence of the camera as well as the social pressure (from those awaiting their turn beside the pool) pushed some of the participants to jump, which made their behavior even more interesting. In our films, which we often call studies, we want to portray human behavior, rather than tell our own stories about it. We hope the result is a series of meaningful references, in the form of moving images. “Ten Meter Tower” may take place in Sweden, but we think it elucidates something essentially human, that transcends culture and origins. Overcoming our most cautious impulses with bravery unites all humankind. It’s something that has shaped us through the ages. ‘Ten Meter Tower’ appeared at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. It is part of a series produced by independent filmmakers who have received support from the nonprofit Sundance Institute."
"Krill are best known as whale food. But few people realise that these small, shrimp-like creatures are also important to the health of the ocean and the atmosphere. In fact, Antarctic krill can fertilise the oceans, ultimately supporting marine life from tiny plankton through to massive whales and, through their faeces, they can increase the store of carbon in the deep ocean. In a review we recently published in Nature Communications, we highlighted this less well-known role of Antarctic krill. Krill are able to fertilise the oceans and help store carbon because they release essential nutrients, including ammonium and iron, into the surrounding water, either excreted as a waste product or in solid faecal pellets. These nutrients can then be used by tiny ocean plants at the base of most marine food webs (phytoplankton) to photosynthesise and grow. This is much the same process as humans adding nutrients to a field through a fertiliser.  The Southern Ocean surrounds Antarctica and is a long way from landmasses from which nutrients are washed into the ocean. As a result, nutrient concentrations can be low, particularly of iron which is essential for phytoplankton to grow. Concentrations tend to be highest near the Antarctic continent itself, its sea-ice and a few remote islands.  Krill waste also influences the carbon cycle. Krill poo is in the form of relatively large, carbon-rich pellets which can sink quickly to the deep ocean where they may remain for many years. This means krill poo can lock carbon away from the atmosphere for long periods of time. Our synthesis has highlighted that young krill who live near sea-ice may be particularly important in the carbon sink. This is because they live deeper in the water column than adult krill. So any pellets released by younger krill have a better chance of escaping any ocean currents that may return them to the surface, and instead sink further until eventually reaching the deep ocean. But what happens when humans disrupt these natural cycles, for example through fishing or causing climate change? Humans also commercially fish for Antarctic krill – in fact, krill is the most fished animal in the Southern Ocean. Their oily bodies are either used in pharmaceuticals as an alternative source of omega-3, fed to livestock and aquaculture fish, used in pet food or a small amount are even prepared for humans to eat. Warming over the past 90 years has meant Antarctic krill have moved south toward sea-ice and fewer juveniles are surviving to adulthood. Given the likelihood that juveniles are also important in the carbon sink it is crucial to ensure that in future fishing boats do not encroach on young krill habitats near the sea-ice. The krill “fishery” is international, made up of companies from a number of different countries and managed sustainably by international convention – the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources – which sets limits so that only 0.5% of the population is fished in a given year. This ensures that there is enough food in Antarctic waters for whales and penguins, and safeguards the future catch. Scientists and the krill fishery need to work together though to protect nutrient cycles, the carbon sink and the environment. In fact, we believe it is unlikely that any fishery globally considers the impact that removing animals like krill or fish has on nutrient cycles. We still don’t know exactly how removing krill from the oceans will impact the atmosphere and oceans, and how climate change will further exacerbate this. But one thing is for sure, krill are important in supporting life and storing carbon in the oceans.  Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

"Butterflies are rather like Goldilocks, preferring conditions to be neither too hot nor too cold, but “just right”. Under climate change, the temperature at any given time of summer is, on average, getting warmer, leaving butterflies (and their nocturnal cousins, the moths) with the challenge of how to remain in their optimal temperature window. One of the main ways in which species are achieving this is by changing the time of year at which they are active. Scientists refer to the timing of such lifecycle events as “phenology”, so when an animal or plant starts to do things earlier in the year it is said to be “advancing its phenology”.  These advances have been observed already in a wide range of butterflies and moths – indeed, most species are advancing their phenology to some extent. In Britain, as the average spring temperature has increased by roughly 0.5°C over the past 20 years, species have advanced by between three days and a week on average, to keep track of cooler temperatures.  Is this a sign that butterflies and moths are well equipped to cope with climate change, and readily adjust to new temperatures? Or are these populations under stress, being dragged along unwillingly by unnaturally fast changes? In a new study published in Nature Communications, colleagues and I sought to answer this question. We first pulled together data from millions of records submitted by butterfly and moth enthusiasts to one of four recording schemes run by charities or research institutes. This gave us information on 130 species of butterflies and moths in Great Britain every year for a 20-year period between 1995 and 2014. We could then estimate the abundance and distribution of each species across this time, along with how far north they had moved. The data also, crucially, allowed us to estimate subtle changes in what time of the year each species was emerging from the chrysalis as a fully-grown butterfly.  Analysing the trends in each variable, we discovered that species with more flexible lifecycles were more likely to be able to benefit from an earlier emergence driven by climate change. Some species are able to go from caterpillar to butterfly twice or more per year, so that the individual butterflies you see flying in the spring are the grandchildren or great-grandchildren of the individuals seen a year previously.  Among these species, we observed that those which have been advancing their phenology the most over the 20-year study period also had the most positive trends in abundance, distribution and northwards extent. For these species – such as Britain’s tiniest butterfly, the dainty small blue – emerging early in spring gives more time for their later-summer generations to complete their reproductive cycles before the arrival of autumn, allowing more population growth to occur. Other species, however, are less flexible and restricted to a single reproductive cycle per year. For these species, we found no evidence of any benefit to emerging earlier. Indeed, worryingly, we found that the species in this group that specialise in one very specific habitat type (often related to the caterpillar’s preferred diet) actually tended to most harmed by advancing phenology.  The beautiful high brown fritillary, often described as Britain’s most endangered butterfly, fits this category perfectly. It is found only alongside the dog-violets that its caterpillar eats, in coppiced woodland and limestone pavement habitats. It’s also a single-generation butterfly that has advanced its phenology. This suggests that climate change, while undoubtedly not the sole cause, might have played a part in the downfall of this species. All is not lost, however. Many of Britain’s single-generation species show the capacity, in continental Europe, to add a second generation in years that are sufficiently warm. Therefore, as the climate continues to warm, species like the silver-studded blue might be able to switch to multiple generations in the UK as well, and thereby begin to extract benefits from the additional warmth, potentially leading to population increases. More immediately, we can arm ourselves with this knowledge to spot the warning signs of species that may be most at risk. Clearly the single-generation habitat specialists are of particular concern, as many are already endangered or vulnerable – not just the high brown fritillary and silver-studded blue, but also species such as pearl-bordered fritillary, grizzled skipper and the particularly sought-after white admiral of southern England. Multi-generation species that are failing to advance their phenology might also be threatened: into this category falls another of Britain’s most sharply-declining butterflies: the wall brown. Using this knowledge to help protect moths and butterflies from climate change is not simply important for the sake of the butterflies and moths themselves – these species also play a number of important roles in our ecosystems. Their caterpillars consume vast quantities of plant material, and in turn act as prey for birds, bats, and other small mammals, while moths even act as pollinators of a surprisingly wide range of plant species, possibly including some important crops.  According to Butterfly Conservation, around two-thirds of butterfly species have declined in the UK over the past 40 years. If this trend continues, it might have unpredictable knock-on effects for other species in the ecosystem. Only by arming ourselves with an understanding of why butterfly numbers are down can we hope to halt or reverse the decline.  Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

A growing literature defines security in relation to the individual. Instead of focusing on a state’s external threats, scholars of “human security” focus on a broader set of threats. This approach includes threats — such as poverty and pollution — to individuals within states. Scholars of human security began to take that approach at the end of the Cold War as state‐​to‐​state warfare seemed less relevant. Those scholars do not dismiss the importance of a state’s ability to defend itself. Rather, they tend to argue that without human security, there can be little traditional state security and vice versa, and some conclude that threats to U.S. human security are increasing. This chapter concludes otherwise: the United States is secure in both the traditional sense and with respect to human security.1



Consider first the traditional definitions of security that focus on a country’s external threats. The United States has not faced a great‐​power rival since the end of the Cold War, and none are likely to emerge. Its closest rivals, such as China and Russia, cannot compete militarily and struggle to project military power abroad.2 Furthermore, the United States’ geography and nuclear prowess make it an unlikely target for invasion. In addition, the United States has powerful allies and maintains unequaled diplomatic power. According to John Mueller of Ohio State University, terrorism is not a considerable threat either:



Furthermore, it is unlikely that terrorists will be able to obtain nuclear weapons. In sum, as John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago argues, no great power in world history comes close to enjoying the traditional state security that the United States does today.4



Scholars of “human security” argue that as threats from foreign states diminish, as they have for the United States, security analyses should shift focus to individuals. Any meaningful discussion of security, they argue, should include other dangers such as hunger, disease, violent crime, pollution, and natural disasters. Those risks kill far more people than war, genocide, and terrorism combined.5 Human security scholars suggest that to evaluate the security of a country’s citizens, one must consider whether people are “able to take care of themselves … [whether they] have the opportunity to meet their most essential needs.”6



Human security is not an esoteric concept used exclusively by university professors. Influential people and policymakers have also adopted that approach. For example, President Dwight Eisenhower’s national security agenda focused on the improvement of human security indicators such as education and transportation.7 Similarly, Cold War defense secretary James Forrestal argued: “The question of national security is not merely a question of the Army and the Navy. We have to take into account our whole potential for war, our mines, industry, manpower, research, and all the activities that go into normal civilian life.”8



International organizations such as the United Nations have also used the human security approach, even forming the United Nations Commission on Human Security.9 Kofi Annan, former secretary‐​general of the United Nations, said: “Security can no longer be narrowly defined as the absence of armed conflict, be it between or within states … [We must] adopt a much more coordinated approach to a range of issues.”10 Other international organizations, including the World Bank and the Organization for Security and Co‐​operation in Europe, have adopted the human security approach in all but name.11 Public intellectuals, such as Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, have championed the notion of human security.12 And several governments, such as Canada and Japan, have adopted human security goals in their foreign policy approaches.13



If one considers the growing importance of human security, is it reasonable to ask how secure the United States is (or Americans are)? How does one evaluate the human security of a state? Because human security focuses on the security of individuals, we could compare Americans with citizens of “peer nations,” such as Australia or Canada. Unfortunately, cross‐​country comparisons of human security indicators such as wealth, child mortality, and good governance do not tell us how secure the United States is. They tell us only how secure the United States is relative to other countries.



To evaluate whether the United States is “human secure,” then, requires considering whether a majority of Americans have attained an ideal level of each indicator of human security. In many cases, that ideal is obvious: for instance, no occupational deaths among any Americans are ideal according to human security scholars. In some cases, the ideal is not obvious: how many additional forest hectares per annum are ideal? And in other cases, arithmetic mean measures of indicators, such as life expectancy, make it unclear what proportion of Americans has reached an ideal level (see Figure 1). In all of those cases, one should consider whether the trend is in the right direction — that is, whether the population is becoming more or less secure over time. Combining both approaches — evaluating whether a majority of Americans have reached an ideal level of security and considering security trends over time — will indicate whether Americans are human secure and what to expect regarding their security in the future.

Indicators of human security are threats to individuals’ lives and livelihoods. This chapter uses those indicators defined by the United Nations’ 1994 Human Development Report.14 That report was the first in which a world‐​class organization endorsed human security as a national security approach. It has shaped the human security school ever since its publication. The Human Development Report defines the following human security threats:



Evaluating U.S. human security according to those criteria shows that although some U.S. residents are insecure in certain aspects, the majority of Americans are secure and are becoming more secure all the time.



There are many ways to measure the danger of injury and disease, and an exhaustive discussion is beyond the scope of this chapter. This section will use HumanProgress.org’s statistics on life expectancy, injury, and disease as representative indicators of health security.15 As the following figures demonstrate, most Americans are healthy, and the nation is becoming healthier.



Americans live long and healthy lives. Infant mortality afflicts a tiny percentage of babies in the United States and is dropping (see Figure 2). Only a small percentage of children suffer malnourishment — between 1 and 4 percent, depending on how it is measured.16 Americans are also living longer. In the 1960s, women lived to about age 73; now, the average life expectancy is about 81. Men’s life expectancy during the same period has risen from age 66 to about 76 (see Figure 1). Moreover, a tiny fraction of Americans suffers premature death — 14 percent of men and 8 percent of women — and the rate is dropping.17 Work‐​related injuries and fatalities affect a small share of the population and are declining. For instance, 2.5 million workers suffered a temporary or permanent injury in 1999 (i.e., less than 1 percent of the population). By 2008, only 1 million workers suffered the same (see Figure 3). Although more than 6,000 people died at work in 1999, by 2008, about 5,200 people died while working.

In addition, disease is uncommon and becoming rarer. For example, fewer men and women are dying from the most common types of cancer.18 Although 13 men per 100,000 died of prostate cancer in the 1950s, only 10 men per 100,000 die of the same disease today. Similarly, 21 women per 100,000 died of breast cancer in the 1950s, whereas now only 15 women per 100,000 die (see Figure 4). AIDS‐​related deaths are also at an all‐​time low since the disease was first discovered. Although 55,000 Americans died each year of AIDS‐​related illnesses in the early 1990s, now 17,000 die each year. And deaths from tuberculosis have been almost eliminated, with only 0.2 people dying per 100,000 people now versus 0.5 people dying per 100,000 in 1990.



Unfortunately, there are a few negative trends. For instance, more women are dying in childbirth in the United States now than in the past. Suicide, if counted in health security, is also becoming (marginally) more common. However, those negative trends are outweighed by positive ones. The health of the average American is high, and the nation’s health is improving. Those improvements are even more promising when considering the simultaneous expansion of the U.S. population. Americans are, therefore, “health secure.”

Americans enjoy a high and growing level of “environmental security.”19 Population growth,20 for example, has slowed. That trend is seen throughout the developed world, including in the United States. Since 1960, population growth has declined from 1.7 percent to 0.8 percent, and the number of births per woman has declined from 3.7 children to 2.1 children.



Forest coverage, far from abating, is increasing (see Figure 5). That development is partly driven by increased productivity in farming, which also allows more Americans to be fed by less land under cultivation.

Although carbon dioxide emissions have risen since the 1960s, the rate of increase is slowing. Moreover, carbon dioxide emissions per dollar of gross domestic product (GDP) and per person have dropped over the same period (see Figures 6 and 7). Although increasing world emissions may pose an as‐​of‐​yet‐​unobserved security risk to Americans, the positive effect is clear. People’s use of carbonaceous energy improves human security as they use it to harvest food, to deliver health care, and to stay warm — among countless other security uses.



Vulnerability to extreme weather has abated. While nearly 1,000 Americans died each year, on average, from hurricanes in the first decade of the 20th century, that figure has averaged well below 100 per year in nearly every decade since the 1940s. The temporary spike to 127 deaths per year in the 2000s reflects deaths caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, but the annual average today remains well below levels in the early 20th century (see Figure 8). Some 41 Americans per million died from heatrelated deaths in the 1960s. That number declined to 5 people per million in the 1990s.

All Americans have had access to improved sanitation since 1990.21 That improvement means that every American has access to facilities that separate human excreta from human contact via (for example) flush toilets connected to sewers. Among Americans, 99 percent have had access to improved drinking water sources since 1990,22 which means nearly every American has access to drinking water that is safe and protected from contamination.



However, the picture is not all rosy. The United States used an additional 0.6 percent of its total renewable water resources between 1990 and 2005 alone.23 Methane emissions have barely dropped since 1990.24 Although hydrofluorocarbon emissions have been dropping in recent years, that drop came after a long uptick since the early 1990s.25 Luckily, human ingenuity means the overall picture for environmental security is a positive one. Fewer people are dying from extreme weather events. Fewer are exposed to pollution that can cause sickness. And environmental protection and resource conservation are becoming the norm. Americans are — and are becoming more — “environmentally secure.”

Poverty, one indication of a lack of economic security, is uncommon in the United States. When official data were first collected, the poverty rate was about 22 percent of the population. It soon dropped, and for about the past 50 years, the poverty rate has hovered between 12 and 15 percent.26 Therefore, a minority of Americans lack sufficient income with which to obtain basic necessities.



Most Americans’ incomes are rising, allowing them to afford much more than the basics. Since the 1950s, inflation‐​adjusted GDP per person has risen from under $15,000 to over $48,000 (see Figure 9). Those gains were felt across all income brackets; even the lowest‐​income quintile’s real, inflation‐​adjusted income rose by more than 49 percent between 1979 and 2010.27 Before the 1960s, Americans spent more than half of their disposable income on basic necessities. Now they spend less than a third of their incomes on basics (see Figure 10). Indeed, the very definition of basic necessities has expanded with rising incomes. Items that were once considered luxuries are now counted as essentials. As incomes have risen, many goods have also become cheaper, which means Americans have more money available to improve their lives.

In the 1970s, 163.5 million plane trips were taken each year; now, 707.5 million are taken. The median living space for American households has risen from 1,500 to 2,200 square feet since the 1970s, while fewer people live in each household (see Figure 11). Whereas 2 percent of Americans had cellular phone subscriptions in the 1990s, now 90 percent do. And although 1 percent of Americans used the Internet in the 1990s, today 74 percent of the population does (see Figure 12). And those facts don’t take into account that most products, such as cell phones, have become more useful over time. The United States’ score on the Human Development Index — combining measures of life expectancy, education, and GDP per capita on a scale from 0 to 1 — has risen from 0.84 to 0.91 since the 1980s.

Americans from all income groups have more money and are better able to live comfortably, to travel freely, and to communicate widely than ever before. As poverty persists in the United States for a minority, the vast majority grows more secure economically every year.



The repression of individuals and government control of information are primary indicators of political security. Indexes of political repression show that Americans enjoy a high level of political freedom, though it has improved little over time.28 That finding is counterintuitive.



Traditional measures of political freedom, such as the World Bank’s voice and accountability index, have declined since the 1990s (see Figure 13).29 Declining index scores for freedom of association are consistent with the weakened privacy rights as revealed by Edward Snowden.30 Dropping scores for freedom of expression are consistent with chilled speech in public places (especially in universities).31



 **Figure 13: U.S. Score on the Voice and Accountability Index, 1996–2011**



 **Source:** Human​Progress​.org; World Bank, info​.world​bank​.org/​g​o​v​e​r​n​ance/ wgi/index.asp.



Declining scores for a free press since 2009 are consistent with the government’s insistence that New York Times reporter James Risen reveal sources, accusations by the Justice Department against Fox News’s James Rosen, and the seizure of two months of Associated Press journalists’ phone records.32



More optimistically, the rule of law has improved in the United States since 1996, from a score of 3.95 to 4.09 on a 5‐​point scale. And Americans have enjoyed essentially perfect civil liberties since the early 1970s (when records began).33 The same goes for political rights. It is legitimate to question whether those latter scores are deserved considering the previously mentioned abuses. That discrepancy may be the result of the subjective nature of political repression indexes. Or perhaps Freedom House, the creator of those final two indexes, finds perfect civil liberties impossible to attain, leading it to conclude that the United States approaches the attainable ideal.



Ultimately, few consider the United States to be a place where citizens face widespread political repression. The indexes indicate that Americans enjoy secure political rights. Some of the indexes report that those scores are slipping over time. Therefore, although Americans are in greatest danger of a security decline in that realm (compared with the other six types of human security), they still enjoy a high level of political security.



Most Americans have reliable access to food. When evaluating “food security,” human security scholars often consider not only the availability of food but also its affordability. As shown earlier, even the poorest Americans’ inflation-adjusted incomes are rising. Agricultural yields in staples such as wheat and corn have also increased since the 19th century as prices have dropped (see Figure 14). As a consequence, Americans spend less of their total household expenditure on food over time (see Figure 15). So not only do Americans have easy access to cheaper food, but also they have more money left over to improve other aspects of their lives. Those great advances in food security are partly responsible for the fact that Americans’ food consumption exceeds what is necessary for survival and has increased over time. In addition, Americans are eating more healthy foods than in the past, such as vegetables and seafood, which contribute to increased protein consumption (see Figures 16, 17, and 18).

Community security includes discriminatory violence against any particular communities. Community violence in the United States is low and, in most cases, declining. Nonlethal hate crimes against African Americans have fallen since the mid‐​1990s. Those crimes now affect a tiny minority of the population (see Figure 19). Antigay hate crimes are a mixed bag. Simple assault and homicide of gays have risen, whereas aggravated assault has declined — both to a modest degree. Luckily, those crimes affect only a tiny minority of gay people — far less than 1 percent. The security of homosexuals has improved considerably in at least one way: intimidation of gay people has dropped by more than 28 percent since the mid‐​1990s.



Other statistics indicate that community tensions are declining. For example, 68 percent of whites supported school segregation in the 1940s, and now fewer than 5 percent do (see Figure 20). The use of community rights terms, such as “civil rights” and “gay rights,” has risen since the 1950s, indicating the growing importance of recognizing and curbing discrimination (see Figure 21).34

Although racial and ethnic conflict in the United States has not been eliminated, a small fraction of minorities are targeted for violence on the basis of their identity. Therefore, the United States can be said to enjoy a high level of “community security.”



Personal security (i.e., concern with violent crime) is the final class of indicators of human security. Steven Pinker of Harvard University has argued:



 **Figure 22: Approval of Husband’s Slapping Wife in the United States, 1968–1994**



 **Source:** Human​Progress​.org; Steven Pinker, _The Better Angels of Our Nature_ (New York: Penguin Books, 2011), p. 409.



It makes sense, then, that a small and declining proportion of Americans suffers from violence of all types. Spousal abuse in the United States is rare and dropping. The approval of a husband’s slapping his wife dropped dramatically between the 1960s and 1990s (see Figure 22). In 1993, about 1,000 women per 100,000 were assaulted by their spouses. In 2005, about 350 women out of 100,000 were assaulted. At the beginning of the same period, about 160 men out of 100,000 were assaulted by their spouses each year. In 2005, about 90 men out of 100,000 were assaulted (see Figure 23). Homicides of intimate partners have also dropped. In the 1970s, about 1.44 women and about 1.23 men per 100,000 were murdered by their spouses. Now only 0.79 women and 0.23 men per 100,000 are murdered by their spouses. In addition, rape has dropped by 80 percent, and murder has dropped by 42 percent since the 1970s (see Figure 24). Finally, although intentional homicide36 in the United States rose in the 2000s, the rate has since dropped to about 13,000 homicides per year. And even at the height of violence, perpetrators murdered a tiny fraction of Americans. Violence affects a minority of Americans and is affecting fewer every year, which means that Americans are personally secure and becoming more secure over time.

Human security scholars sometimes include income inequality in their discussions, though it is unclear how inequality affects security. What does someone else’s income imply about one’s own security? Certain forces that lead to inequality — theft, political corruption, exploitation, and so forth — may affect one’s welfare. But those forces are simply a few of several explanations for inequality.



The bottom 20 percent of income earners in the United States have a smaller share of national income now than in the 1970s. That fact, however, does not imply that anyone is worse off in an absolute sense.



People are not poor because others are rich. Across every income quintile, incomes are rising, and fast. Since the 1970s, real incomes have risen in every quintile by a minimum of 40 percent.37 Those inflation adjusted income gains have been more dramatic for the poorest, whose incomes have risen by 49 percent.38 And four out of every five people become richer than their parents.39 In addition, consumer goods tend to become cheaper over time, so the welfare of Americans from every income group has risen even more than those numbers indicate.



Growing inequality in the United States is a fact, but it does not imply a reduction in human security. Real incomes have risen across every income group, and they continue to rise. Nearly every American is wealthier than at any time before. And greater wealth improves citizens’ quality of life and security.



Despite common claims that the United States is doing poorly and getting worse, things are, in fact, good and improving for today’s 317 million Americans. Americans are secure with regard to traditional security threats, such as nuclear proliferation, terrorism, and great‐​power conflict. Americans are also secure with regard to human security. Of course, not all Americans are equally “human secure.” However, even the least secure enjoy a considerable and increasing level of security. And the most pessimistic should acknowledge the following: few individuals in the United States are violently targeted because of their ethnic affiliation. Food is widely available and, in many cases, more affordable than in the past. Political repression is low. Americans are becoming richer, with more money to spend on luxury goods like computers and cell phones. The rate of environmental degradation is slowing, with environmental indicators improving. And perhaps best of all, people are living longer. Therefore, inhabitants of the United States are secure and are becoming more secure all of the time.

28 The United States’ high level of political freedom is indicated by a score reaching the index’s upper bound.



29 According to Freedom House, press freedom in the United States has worsened, going from 14 to 18 on a 100‐​point scale, where a score of 1 signifies perfect press freedom. Press freedom measures laws that restrict or influence reporters, political manipulation of the media, and economic forces that affect press quality. According to the World Bank, the United States’ voice and accountability score has declined since 1996. The voice and accountability indicator is defined as “perceptions of the extent to which a country’s citizens are able to participate in selecting their government, as well as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and a free media.” Respondents’ feelings about their ability to participate may not reflect whether they are able to participate.



30 Memberships in several civil society groups have dwindled since the National Security Agency revelations. Since courts have recognized the relationship between freedom of association and privacy of association, the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles filed suit against the NSA.

33 Freedom House defines a country with a civil liberties score of 1 as enjoying a wide range of civil liberties, including freedoms of expression, assembly, association, education, rule of law, religion, equality of opportunity, and free economic activity. That definition is surprising since it probably includes a measure of press freedom, yet Freedom House gave the United States an imperfect press freedom score. It did so presumably because the United States’ score of other civil liberties was high enough to offset a less‐​than‐​perfect press freedom score.



34 Although that finding concerns only English‐​language books, it serves as an indication of Americans’ acceptance of those communities since the United States is where the most English speakers are found.

36 The United Nations, the source of those data, defines “intentional homicide” as “unlawful homicides purposely inflicted as a result of domestic disputes, interpersonal violence, violent conflicts over land resources, intergang violence over turf or control, and predatory violence and killing by armed groups. Intentional homicide does not include all intentional killing; the difference is usually in the organization of the killing. Individuals or small groups usually commit homicide, whereas killing in armed conflict is usually committed by fairly cohesive groups of up to several hundred members and is thus usually excluded.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterPersonally I find it difficult to believe some people are unable to comprehend the sun’s impact on our climate, especially when something like 99 point-something-percent of the earth’s energy comes from the sun. Even a vegetable notices when a cloud blocks out the sun, when the sun sets, or when it doesn’t get very high above the horizon. So I guess when it comes to solar sciences it wouldn’t be much of a stretch to argue that solar deniers are probably even dumber than a plant.
At any rate, geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Professor Fritz Vahrenholt bring us the latest literature on the sun’s clear impact on the earth’s climate at their Die kalte Sonne site.
=====================================
The Sun Drives Climate: The Latest from America
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The sun is a major climate factor – also in America. In May 2014 Gorji Sefidmazgi and colleagues underscored this in a study appearing in the journal Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics. The scientists investigated the temperature development of North Carolina over the past 60 years. Here they found that the fluctuations are almost totally explainable by solar and oceanic cycles. Here’s the abstract:
Trend analysis using non-stationary time series clustering based on the finite element method
In order to analyze low-frequency variability of climate, it is useful to model the climatic time series with multiple linear trends and locate the times of significant changes. In this paper, we have used non-stationary time series clustering to find change points in the trends. Clustering in a multi-dimensional non-stationary time series is challenging, since the problem is mathematically ill-posed. Clustering based on the finite element method (FEM) is one of the methods that can analyze multidimensional time series. One important attribute of this method is that it is not dependent on any statistical assumption and does not need local stationarity in the time series. In this paper, it is shown how the FEM-clustering method can be used to locate change points in the trend of temperature time series from in situ observations. This method is applied to the temperature time series of North Carolina (NC) and the results represent region-specific climate variability despite higher frequency harmonics in climatic time series. Next, we investigated the relationship between the climatic indices with the clusters/trends detected based on this clustering method. It appears that the natural variability of climate change in NC during 1950–2009 can be explained mostly by AMO and solar activity.”
Some months later, in October 2014, a team of scientists led by Erich Osterberg published a study in the Journal of Geophysical Research that examined the influence of solar activity fluctuations on the Aleutian Low in the Gulf of Alaska. The results show: The changes in the Aleutian Low over the past 1500 years correlate strongly with solar activity. Strong solar activity is typically related with a weak Aleutian Low and Tropical La Nina conditions. The abstract:

Mount Logan ice core record of tropical and solar influences on Aleutian Low variability: 500–1998 A.D.
Continuous, high-resolution paleoclimate records from the North Pacific region spanning the past 1500 years are rare; and the behavior of the Aleutian Low (ALow) pressure center, the dominant climatological feature in the Gulf of Alaska, remains poorly constrained. Here we present a continuous, 1500 year long, calibrated proxy record for the strength of the wintertime (December–March) ALow from the Mount Logan summit (PR Col; 5200 m asl) ice core soluble sodium time series. We show that ice core sodium concentrations are statistically correlated with North Pacific sea level pressure and zonal wind speed. Our ALow proxy record reveals a weak ALow from circa 900–1300 A.D. and 1575–1675 A.D., and a comparatively stronger ALow from circa 500–900 A.D., 1300–1575 A.D., and 1675 A.D. to present. The Mount Logan ALow proxy record shows strong similarities with tropical paleoclimate proxy records sensitive to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and is consistent with the hypothesis that the Medieval Climate Anomaly was characterized by more persistent La Niña-like conditions while the Little Ice Age was characterized by at least two intervals of more persistent El Niño-like conditions. The Mount Logan ALow proxy record is significantly (p < 0.05) correlated and coherent with solar irradiance proxy records over various time scales, with stronger solar irradiance generally associated with a weaker ALow and La Niña-like tropical conditions. However, a step-like increase in ALow strength during the Dalton solar minimum circa 1820 is associated with enhanced Walker circulation. Furthermore, rising CO2 forcing or internal variability may be masking the twentieth century rise in solar irradiance.”
Then a month later, in November 2014, a group of scientists lead by Keyan Fang published a paper appearing in the Journal of Climate, on the relationship between solar activity with the climate development in North America and North America. Using a dataset spanning 600 years the authors show that there is a close coupling between the continents. The abstract:
Covarying Hydroclimate Patterns between Monsoonal Asia and North America over the Past 600 Years
Proxy data with large spatial coverage spanning to the preindustrial era not only provide invaluable material to investigate hydroclimate changes in different regions but also enable studies on temporal changes in the teleconnections between these regions. Applying the singular value decomposition (SVD) method to tree-ring-based field reconstructions of the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) over monsoonal Asia (MA) and North America (NA) from 1404 to 2005, the dominant covarying pattern between the two regions is identified. This pattern is represented by the teleconnection between the dipole pattern of southern–northern latitudinal MA and the dipole of southwest NA (SWNA)–northwest NA (NWNA), which accounts for 59.6% of the total covariance. It is dominated by an antiphase low MA and SWNA teleconnection, driven by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and is most significant at an interannual time scale. This teleconnection is strengthened (weakened) in periods of increased (decreased) solar forcing and high (low) temperature, which is associated with intensified (weakened) ENSO variability. Additional forcing by SST anomalies in the Indian and western Pacific Oceans appears to be important too.”
Now let’s jump to the southern hemisphere to South America. In June 2015 a group of scientists led by C. Turney of the University of New South Wales in Sydney published a study in the journal Climate of the Past Discussions on the climate history of the Falkland Islands. Using a charcoal record the scientists reconstructed the strength of the westerly airflow over the past 2600 years. Using spectral analysis Turney and his team found the 250-year characteristic cycle, which is in the range of the Suess-de Vries cycle. One fascinating result: The westerly airflow of the Southern Hemisphere blew in sync with the cycles of the sun. Here’s the abstract:
A 250 year periodicity in Southern Hemisphere westerly winds over the last 2600 years
Southern Hemisphere westerly airflow has a significant influence on the ocean–atmosphere system of the mid- to high-latitudes with potentially global climate implications. Unfortunately historic observations only extend back to the late nineteenth century, limiting our understanding of multi-decadal to centennial change. Here we present a highly resolved (30 yr) record of past westerly air strength from a Falkland Islands peat sequence spanning the last 2600 years. Situated under the core latitude of Southern Hemisphere westerly airflow, we identify highly variable changes in exotic pollen derived from South America which can be used to inform on past westerly air strength and location. The results indicate enhanced airflow over the Falklands between 2000 and 1000 cal. yr BP, and associated with increased burning, most probably as a result of higher temperatures and/or reduced precipitation, comparable to records in South America. Spectral analysis of the charcoal record identifies a 250 year periodicity within the data, suggesting solar variability has a modulating influence on Southern Hemisphere westerly airflow with potentially important implications for understanding global climate change through the late Holocene.”
Just like we reported some time ago: Solar activity also in South American monsoons over the last 1500 years.

Of course readers have the choice of believing a growing mountain of solar-climate papers authored by dozens of distinguished scientists, or an amateur who doesn’t even read the papers.

"On Tuesday, Joe Biden did something unprecedented for a Democratic candidate assured of nomination: he moved left. In a speech delivered from Wilmington in his home state of Delaware, Biden unveiled the most ambitious clean energy and environmental justice plans ever proposed by the nominee of a major American political party. The plans, which the Biden campaign described to reporters as “the legislation he goes up to [Capitol Hill] immediately to get done,” outline $2tn in investments in clean energy, jobs and infrastructure that would be carried out over the four years of his first term. Forty percent of these investments would be directed to communities of color living on the toxic edge of the fossil fuel economy – communities that have also been among the most devastated by the coronavirus pandemic. Biden proposes to pair these investments with new performance standards, most notably a clean electricity standard that would transition the United States to a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035. Part of Biden’s “Build Back Better” agenda, these plans are a Green New Deal in all but name. If you set aside the most attention-grabbing left-wing programs included in New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s 2019 Green New Deal resolution, like Medicare for All and a federal job guarantee, Biden’s plans broadly align with an approach advocated by the left-wing of the Democratic party. Firstly, like the Green New Deal, Biden’s plans reframe climate action as a jobs, infrastructure and clean energy stimulus. After three decades of economic elites failing to pitch a carbon tax as a solution to the supposed “market failure” of greenhouse gas emissions, Biden has elected to focus instead on economy-wide performance standards as the cutting edge of decarbonization. And while earlier generations of Democrats wanted consumers to foot the bill for that clean energy transition at the gas pump, a position shared by Milton Friedman, Biden takes Keynes and Franklin Roosevelt as his intellectual and political forebears. Perhaps most encouragingly, Biden views the workers, unions and communities of color most impacted by the fossil fuel economy and the potential shift away from it as deserving special attention. In his view, climate action cannot be separated from economic, environmental and social justice. This is, in the broadest strokes, the climate policy gospel according to many progressives. Biden’s plans draw upon the Green New Deal-inflected recommendations issued by the joint taskforce convened by surrogates of the Biden and Bernie Sanders campaigns, including Ocasio-Cortez. They also crib heavily from plans devised by Washington governor Jay Inslee’s climate-focused presidential campaign and are delightfully similar to policies drafted by Data for Progress, an upstart leftwing thinktank where I work. (Full disclosure: we provided research and recommendations to the joint taskforce and campaign.) Now, Biden would be wise to run on these ideas and staff up his administration to make them happen. Over recent months, public opinion research from Data for Progress has shown that climate change is a uniquely favorable general election issue for Biden and Democrats. When it comes to climate and clean energy priorities, voters trust the Democratic party more than the Republican party by an 18% margin. Climate change is a strong mobilization issue for the young voters Biden has struggled to attract to his campaign. In a May survey, 61% of voters under 45 said they would be more likely to vote for Biden if he committed to a platform that would move the United States to a 100% clean energy economy, with just 14% reporting that such a platform would make them less likely to support the Democratic nominee. A more recent survey fielded in late June by Climate Power, the Global Strategies Group and Data for Progress found that bold climate action was also persuasive for middle-of-the-road and Latino voters. Even after survey respondents were shown strong messaging attacks from Trump and Republicans claiming that Democrats wanted to pass a $100tn Green New Deal that would increase taxes – as well as more outlandish arguments that Democrats were going to take away hamburgers, pickup trucks and airplanes – voters moved even further in Democrats’ direction. Middle partisans shifted two percentage points further in favor of Biden, while Latinos leaned a further four points towards him. These findings show that one of Trump and Republicans’ favorite act: that “Venezuela-style socialists are going to take away the American way of life” – doesn’t work. In fact, an analysis of the 2019 Cooperative Congressional Election Study published by Data for Progress found that 2016 Trump voters who are unsure how they will vote in 2020 are uniquely cross-pressured on climate issues. They view climate change as being much more important than other 2016 Trump voters and side with Biden and Democrats on key policy issues, like the Paris Climate Agreement and Clean Power Plan. Crucially, they also tend to be young, meaning that if Democrats can attract these voters in 2020, they could grow their base for years to come. As Biden prepares for election day in November, he would be wise to run on his Green New Deal-style climate plan. And if he wins – which polls suggest he will – he’s going to need to staff up to turn these campaign promises into laws. Here, activists still have a lot of leverage. The most recent polling from Data for Progress shows that 44% of voters would be more likely to support a candidate who doesn’t take money from fossil fuel companies, executives and lobbyists and that 49% would be opposed to industry representatives receiving appointments to government agencies and the White House. These are strange and scary times. The pandemic has laid bare some of the most devastating and brutal flaws of our corrupt president and our nakedly capitalist society. The coronavirus has skewed the electorate in favor of the Democrats, but the terrifying scale of the three-pronged crisis of pandemic, unemployment and climate change has tilted the party’s response even further in favor of its left wing. Biden rode a wave of establishment endorsements to the nomination this spring. But come fall, it’s progressive ideas that just might carry him and his party to the presidency.

"ATLANTA  —   As a young prosecutor in the late 1990s, Sally Q. Yates sat at a conference table with a former sheriff and began picking away at his story. With an F. B. I. agent watching, Ms. Yates soon had the lawman in knots about a deposition. “I watched him as she broke him down, and he confessed that he had lied under oath,” the agent, Oliver G. Halle, now retired, recalled on Tuesday. “She can be very disarming, but underneath that disarming appearance is a woman who knows how to fight. ” As acting attorney general, Ms. Yates picked the fight of her life on Monday when she ordered the Justice Department not to defend President Trump’s executive order blocking refugees and restricting immigration to the United States. Ms. Yates became convinced, based on the president’s own statements, that he had intended to unlawfully single out Muslims, senior officials said. “We have comments from the president about what this is supposed to do,” Ms. Yates said in one meeting on Monday, according to two people involved in the discussions. She later added, “The intent was clear from the face of it. ” Ms. Yates, 56, was swiftly fired. Before she even finished packing up her office, she had become a hero to many Democrats, the face of a simmering resistance inside the government to Mr. Trump’s administration. Her firing was a politically divisive turn in a career that had, until now, earned her bipartisan praise. “She will be a hero of the American people, a hero of what’s right,” Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, said in 2015 at Ms. Yates’s confirmation hearing. “She’ll call them like she sees them, and she will be fair, and she will be just. ” While Ms. Yates was a reliably liberal voice in the Justice Department on issues of civil rights, criminal justice and sentencing, she worked her way up as a career prosecutor in Atlanta under political appointees from both parties. A native Georgian, she led prosecutions against some of the highest profile defendants in Atlanta, including former Mayor Bill Campbell, a Democrat who was accused of racketeering and tax fraud, and Eric Robert Rudolph, who set bombs at a park during the 1996 Olympic Games, a gay nightclub and two Southern abortion clinics. She also took on the leaders of an Atlanta suburb who refused to allow construction of a mosque. The Justice Department sued, and the city reversed itself. “Religious freedom requires that local government decisions impacting the exercise of that freedom be free of discrimination,” Ms. Yates said at the time. When Ms. Yates, who declined to comment on Tuesday, became deputy attorney general in 2015, she told colleagues that she had no intention of merely being a caretaker. “We’re going to run through the tape,” she often said. In Washington, her outgoing personality made her a counterpoint to her more reserved boss, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. At times that made Ms. Yates the face of the Justice Department in ways that caused tension with Ms. Lynch’s staff. Ms. Yates was regarded as professionally ambitious, though she has told friends that she has no interest in running for political office. Last year, Ms. Yates and Ms. Lynch earned the ire of Democrats  —   including many in the department  —   for not intervening to prohibit the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, from sending a letter to Congress in the final days of the presidential campaign. The letter raised the prospect of new and potentially damaging evidence against Hillary Clinton related to an investigation that had been closed. Nothing came of the new evidence, and Mrs. Clinton’s team says the letter cost her the presidency. Her supporters argued that Justice Department leaders were too timid to stand up to Mr. Comey. Mr. Trump’s executive order prompted a new challenge for Ms. Yates, who was serving until the Senate confirmed a new attorney general. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel had reviewed and signed off on the order, but Ms. Yates believed that the department had to also consider the president’s intent, which she said appeared aimed at singling out people based on religion. Mr. Trump had promised to do as much. His campaign website still calls for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on. ” After the decision was announced, one of his advisers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, said in an interview that Mr. Trump had wanted a Muslim ban but needed “the right way to do it legally. ” Mr. Trump then said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network that Christian refugees would be given priority for entry visas to the United States. In meetings on Monday, some in the department said it should defend the order, as it normally does. Others disagreed. Prominent lawyers echoed that debate on Tuesday. Some former Justice Department officials, like Martin Lederman, praised Ms. Yates’s decision. Ms. Lynch said “her courageous leadership embodies the highest traditions of the Department of Justice. ” But others, like Jack Goldsmith, said she should have either defended the president’s order or resigned. George J. Terwilliger III, a former deputy attorney general who, like Ms. Yates, served briefly as acting attorney general, said that Ms. Yates had made herself and the Justice Department “look blatantly political. ” Ms. Yates considered resigning, four current and former Justice Department officials said, but she concluded that doing so would only defer a difficult decision to a temporary successor. That dilemma was foreshadowed two years ago in her confirmation hearing, when Senator Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican who is poised to become the next attorney general, questioned whether Ms. Yates had the independent streak needed to be the Justice Department’s second in command. “If the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say no?” Mr. Sessions asked. “I believe the attorney general or deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and Constitution and give their independent legal advice to the president,” Ms. Yates replied. Shortly after 9 p. m. on Monday, roughly three hours after she ordered department lawyers not to defend the president’s position, a White House courier arrived with a copy of her dismissal letter. “Dear Deputy Attorney General Yates,” said the letter, which was signed by John DeStefano, an assistant to Mr. Trump. “I am informing you that the president has removed you from the office of Deputy Attorney General of the United States. ”"
"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump made clear in his fiery inaugural speech that he was going to challenge the Washington establishment. Now the establishment is quickly pushing back, creating a palpable air of uncertainty and chaos in the opening days of his administration. The new president fired an acting attorney general who refused to defend the administration’s executive order on immigration. Democrats on Tuesday boycotted Senate confirmation hearings to prevent votes on cabinet nominees. State Department employees opposed to the administration were urged to quit if they didn’t like Mr. Trump’s direction. Even after years of unbreakable gridlock and unyielding partisanship, it was a jarring new level of confrontation and conflict, and it was contributing to a building sense of crisis just as the new president was to disclose the identity of a new Supreme Court nominee  —   a selection certain to further inflame tensions. Republicans, adjusting to the new era, seemed blindsided by the rapid pace of events and the worrying failure of the new administration to engage in the   and consultation that would typically accompany the issuance of a potentially explosive proposal like the freeze on visas for refugees and immigrants from select countries. “It’s regrettable that there was some confusion with the rollout,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan told reporters Tuesday, noting that top Republicans learned of the contents of the order only as it was being issued. That secretive, closely held approach may be the preferred choice of the president and   disrupters like his senior adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, who is quickly emerging as the power in the West Wing, but not by more conventional politicians who definitely don’t like to be caught off guard. Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said similar failings had emerged in the early days of previous administrations but would not be tolerated for long. “You get a brief period you’re allowed for a learning curve, but after that, you have to get your act together,” Mr. King said. One veteran of past Republican administrations, acknowledging the Trump White House was still in its “shakedown” phase, encouraged the president’s staff to focus more on consultation to avert confusion. “Process matters,” said Kenneth M. Duberstein, who served as chief of staff to Ronald Reagan. “You are dealing with not just senior management, but with a variety of constituencies and a board of directors of 535 people. ” Still, the main Republican objection seemed to be with the handling of the executive order by the inexperienced and understaffed White House rather than the actual content of the order. Several Republicans noted that they were fully supportive of the border control effort and that the substance mirrored legislation the House had passed last year. Unlike the Democrats, there was almost universal support among Republicans for the firing of Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general. Republicans say they remain eager to work with the president to reverse what they see as Obama administration overreach and put their own conservative stamp on the government. In their view, the furor and continuing tumult in official Washington isn’t necessarily upsetting to the voters back home. “President Trump has made clear that he is a man of action and we are ready,” said Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, a member of the House Republican leadership. How ready remained an open question. Most in Congress, regardless of party, take their role seriously as members of a coequal branch of government and they don’t take well to being kept out of the loop on matters for which they will be held to account. In other corners of the establishment, the reaction to the first days of the Trump era was not nearly as enthusiastic as that of Ms. McMorris Rodgers. One usually   Republican consultant who didn’t want to be identified picking a fight with the new president said a continuation of the turmoil would quickly call into question the basic competency of the new administration. He noted that despite being in the middle of past Supreme Court confirmation fights, he surprisingly had not heard from the White House for ideas on how to handle the coming one. Democrats remained generally aghast, with Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, noting a “very tense environment between Democrats in Congress and the White House, and I think these executive orders have really pushed to the limit the relationship between us. ” At least part of the mounting consternation in the capital was because of the clear break with ingrained rituals and ways of doing business. When Democrats were clashing with President George W. Bush, there was a general expectation of how things would go and the realization that both sides understood their roles. Over eight years of the Obama administration, the two parties settled into a predictable pattern of Republicans opposing the president and Democrats trying to find a way around it. Despite frequent visits to the brink of crisis, the adversaries tended to find a resolution before the damage was beyond repair. With the Trump team, no one as yet is sure what to anticipate, leaving nerves jangled and people wondering what is next  —   a rollback of gay legal protections (denied by the White House) or a move against the young undocumented immigrants in the   Dreamers program? What about a clash with Iran or an embrace of Russia? Mr. Trump and his team seem in some ways to be enjoying the confusion they have come to create. “We’re going to be changing a lot of  —   a lot of the rules,” the president exclaimed Tuesday at a White House meeting with pharmaceutical executives. His comments were aimed at what to do about drug development and pricing. But they seemed to imply so much more, keeping Washington on edge."

Dear Dr. Neuber,
On April 9, 2015, at the web platform “Entwicklungspolitik Online” (epo online) there appeared an article: “Climate change: Arctic air temperature climbs 1.3°C per decade”, which was about a recent visit to Spitzbergen by the German Federal Minister for Education and Research, Prof. Dr. Johanna Wanka. The article quoted the AWIPEV research team which you yourself coordinate as follows:
Since the regular data recording in 1993, the mean annual air temperature at Spitzbergen has increased an annual average of 1.3°C per decade.”

Of course this is true. However in my view it absolutely should have been pointed out that between 1940 and 1970 a cooling of the exact same amount as the warming that followed over the past 40 years occurred at Spitzbergen. Here I cite the GISS temperature dataset for Spitzbergen, see http://www.kaltesonne.de/news1-6/.
Overall today’s temperatures are at the level of 1930, after having gone through a complete warm-cold-warm cycle.


My question to you: Did the AWIPEV delegation advise the Minister and the accompanying media of this important context? How is it possible that this omission was allowed in the epo-online article, which as a result suddenly makes the climate situation at Spitzbergen look completely different?
To be transparent I would very much like to publish your answer at www.kaltesonne.de.
Kindest regards

Today, almost two weeks later, Dr. Lüning’s inquiry remains unanswered. This leaves us to wonder if AWI is too embarrassed to face the issue.

"The world will be watching the US presidential election on Tuesday 3 November, but just 24 hours later is another hugely consequential news event when the US will formally leave the Paris climate agreement. The Trump administration set the withdrawal in motion with a letter to the UN, and, in a coincidence of timing, the US will exit the day after the election, joining Iran and Turkey as the only major countries not to participate in the agreement. After decades of negotiations, all 197 nations in the world agreed to voluntarily cut the heat-trapping pollution that is causing the climate crisis. Only a handful have not ratified the deal. It is seen by many as the minimum effort the world needs to make on cutting emissions – but it still took a monumental diplomatic push to clinch the deal. It came together in Paris in 2015, under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The US negotiating team – including the then secretary of state, John Kerry – scrambled to try to Republican-proof the agreement. President Obama, who was part of 11th-hour efforts calling round other world leaders to join, said in his address “we met the moment”, called it a turning point, while acknowledging more would need to be done. The agreement’s official goal is to keep the world from becoming 2C hotter than before industrialization. But its ambition is to limit heating to 1.5C, a best-case-scenario scientists see slipping out of reach. Each country agreed to set its own targets and report back on progress. There have been some achievements in cutting emissions but the work countries have done so far is not enough to limit the temperature rise to 2C. The world is already about 1C hotter than the pre-industrial period. Despite the Paris agreement, it is on track to become around 3C hotter. Already, humans are suffering from what they have done to disrupt the climate. And yet more heating will trigger more intense heatwaves, faster sea-level rise that will flood major cities, and more extreme weather disasters that will strain government responses. Trump held a news conference in the White House’s Rose Garden in June 2017 when he vowed to exit the agreement, saying it was unfair to the US, which would leave and then start negotiations to re-enter it or a new accord “on terms that are fair to the United States”. “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” he said (the mayor of Pittsburgh responded by saying the city stood with Paris). Trump, though, could not immediately leave the agreement – he can do so only after the November election, in a quirk of timing. So on 4 November 2019, the US began the year-long process to pull out of the deal, sending the United Nations notification that it would formally withdraw on 4 November 2020. In just a 2C hotter world, according to an analysis of 70 peer-reviewed studies by Carbon Brief: Seas could rise an average of 56cm, or nearly 2ft. 30m people in coastal areas could be flooded each year by 2055. Thirty-seven per cent of the population could face a severe heatwave at least every five years. 388m people could be exposed to water scarcity and 195m will be exposed to severe drought. Maize crop yields could fall 9% by 2100. The global per-capita GDP could fall 13% by 2100. The short answer is: no. During the last four years, Trump’s administration has undermined international climate efforts by aggressively supporting fossil fuels. Domestically, Trump has rescinded or weakened essentially all the major regulations that were meant to encourage a shift away from oil, gas and coal, and toward cleaner sources of energy. He has eliminated Obama-era rules requiring lower-carbon electricity and cars. He has expanded opportunities for drilling and mining. With another four years as president, Trump could lock in those changes, further delaying action at a time when scientists say it is urgently needed. The US promised to cut emissions 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. The reductions were meant to be just the beginning of US efforts. Depending on how deeply the economy is hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, the US could see its emissions drop between 20% and 27% below 2005 levels by 2025, according to an analysis by the economic firm Rhodium Group. While the US could technically achieve what it pledged, those reductions are not nearly enough to stall significant global heating. If every country made efforts on par with the US goals, the world would still get 3C or 4C hotter, according to independent analysis by the Climate Action Tracker. Even without the US government, the power sector has shifted away from coal and toward cheaper natural gas and renewable energy – contributing to the drop. But reductions beyond what Rhodium projects would probably require new rules and incentives from the government. Biden would immediately move to rejoin the Paris agreement, which would take about 30 days. The former vice-president has outlined an ambitious climate plan, but most of it requires sign-off from Congress. His proposal will be nearly impossible to implement if Democrats do not take control of the Senate. Significant climate legislation will be difficult to pass even if Democrats do have a majority in the House and the Senate and Biden is in the White House. Biden has said he would set in motion plans to cut US emissions to net-zero by 2050 – which is on par with what scientists say every nation in the world needs to do to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. He wants the electricity system to be carbon-free by 2035. He says he would invest $2tn on clean energy infrastructure and other climate measures, spending as much as possible in his first four years in office. The presumed Democratic nominee would decarbonize buildings, invest in high-speed rail and try to make the US the top producer of electric vehicles. If Donald Trump is re-elected and the US remains outside the Paris agreement, other nations might be less likely to pursue aggressive climate actions. The US is the biggest historical contributor to climate change, even though it holds just 4% of the world’s population. China is the biggest current emitter. It is dramatically slowing its domestic emissions growth, although it is also funding new coal plants in developing countries. With the US out of the picture, China could have more geopolitical influence, including in climate negotiations. It could also benefit greatly from clean energy manufacturing, particularly if the US continues to fall behind. Even if the US national government is not active in climate efforts, green-minded US states and localities would likely come together to continue to pledge action to the world."
"BRUSSELS  —   The president of the European Council warned Tuesday that President Trump was a potential threat to the European Union, including the American leader’s bellicose pronouncements with major geopolitical challenges like Russian aggression, China’s assertiveness and international terrorism. In a letter sent to European leaders, Donald Tusk, the council president, wrote that those factors and “worrying declarations by the new American administration all make our future highly unpredictable. ” He appeared to question whether the United States would maintain its commitment to European security under Mr. Trump’s leadership. “For the first time in our history, in an increasingly multipolar external world, so many are becoming openly   or Eurosceptic at best,” Mr. Tusk wrote. The letter was released ahead of a European Union summit meeting in Malta on Friday Mr. Tusk is responsible for setting the agenda for the meetings. “Particularly the change in Washington puts the European Union in a difficult situation with the new administration seeming to put into question the last 70 years of American foreign policy,” he wrote. The European Union has been struggling to contend with fractious internal forces. Among them: the vote by Britain to leave the bloc, the organization’s failure to establish a unified response to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and the debt crisis that has driven many Greeks into poverty. And then there are external pressures like Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Before the election and since taking office, Mr. Trump has lauded the vote by Britain, known as Brexit, and said the country would thrive outside the European Union. He met with Nigel Farage, a populist leader of the campaign to leave the bloc, before seeing Prime Minister Theresa May. And at one point he went so far as to suggest that Mrs. May appoint Mr. Farage as Britain’s ambassador to the United States. Mr. Trump has also praised President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and indicated he would pursue friendlier relations with Moscow, even as Russia encourages chaos on the European Union’s eastern border. Mr. Tusk’s letter does not reflect a new policy for the European Union, and member states of the   bloc are not required to act on Mr. Tusk’s advice when they meet on Friday. But many European leaders have made their differences with Mr. Trump known. After the United States said it was temporarily blocking refugees from entering the country, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany felt compelled to point out to Mr. Trump the obligations of nations under the Geneva Conventions to protect refugees of war on humanitarian grounds. And President François Hollande of France said he had reminded Mr. Trump that “the ongoing fight to defend our democracy will be effective only if we sign up to respect to the founding principles and, in particular, the welcoming of refugees. ” Mrs. May, of Britain, sought in a meeting with Mr. Trump last week to confirm his commitment to NATO he was dismissive of the alliance, the bedrock of European security, during his campaign. Now, the sentiments expressed in Mr. Tusk’s letter are pushing European leaders’ exasperation with the American president further into the public view. Mr. Tusk has sounded the alarm about the existential crises facing the bloc before, but never with the urgency he displayed in the letter. And he has never before included a longstanding ally like the United States in the list of challenges. “An increasingly, let us call it, assertive China, especially on the seas,” he wrote, “Russia’s aggressive policy toward Ukraine and its neighbors, wars, terror and anarchy in the Middle East and in Africa, with radical Islam playing a major role, as well as worrying declarations by the new American administration all make our future highly unpredictable. ” Much of the frustration Mr. Tusk displayed in his letter stemmed from what Guntram B. Wolff, director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels, said was Mr. Trump’s “de facto supporting” of populist forces that could further upend the European order.   populist challengers in France, Germany and the Netherlands have adopted some of his   rhetoric in their own campaigns. Still, Mr. Wolff said it was unwise to enter into a war of words with the Trump administration. “We need to uphold our values here, but does it mean that we need now a declaration where we put the United States on the same level as ISIS?” he said. “No, I don’t think so. I don’t think it that would be helpful in any way. ” The   volley of opprobrium on Friday included an accusation by Peter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump’s new National Trade Council, that Germany was manipulating its currency to gain a trade advantage. Mr. Navarro told The Financial Times that Germany was using a “grossly undervalued” euro to “exploit” the United States and its partners in Europe. That did not sit well with Ms. Merkel, who defended the European Central Bank’s independent role at a news conference on Friday: “Because of that we will not influence the behavior of the E. C. B. And as a result, I cannot and do not want to change the situation as it is. ” The value of the euro is near a   low compared with the dollar, allowing German carmakers and other manufacturers to sell their goods more cheaply in the United States. But German firms also employ around 670, 000 people in the United States, including many in a BMW factory in Spartanburg, S. C. the carmaker’s largest in the world, and a Mercedes factory in Tuscaloosa, Ala. These are the sort of manufacturing jobs that Mr. Trump says he wants to keep in the United States. Jan Techau, director of the Richard C. Holbrooke Forum in Berlin, a research center dedicated to diplomacy, said Mr. Tusk’s letter was less a warning to the American president than it was a message to Europeans not to be lured away from union, or to be tempted away from the bloc by favorable bilateral ties offered by the Trump administration. “He is encouraging everyone to fall into that trap,” Mr. Techau said of the American president. Mr. Tusk, by contrast, is making the case for Europeans to stick together for their own survival. “He wants to remind them that there is something bigger at stake than just what they are going to be talking about in Malta,” Mr. Techau said."
"Thanks to the efforts of climate activists, the climate and ecological emergency has never been more prominent. But acknowledging the problem is just a starting point. Now this momentum must be harnessed to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reverse habitat destruction. To accelerate this transition, we need a vision of the future – and there are many out there. The problem is that some of these visions severely misunderstand and underestimate the nature of the crises we face. If we rally behind the wrong one, we may end up propelling the planet all the more quickly towards destruction. Building a future in sync with the natural world will not be easy. Our collective imagination is bound to ideas that have delivered us to the cusp of environmental catastrophe. The ways we work, travel, eat, and even think are all locked into systems that perpetuate the use of fossil fuels, encroach on the natural world, and exploit wealth and resources from the Global South. This means that to avoid the worst of climate breakdown, we have to transform every aspect of society as we know it. But to do this well requires deep understanding of why industries have been allowed to pollute the upper atmosphere, and how we can build economic and political infrastructure to stop emitting greenhouse gases and degrading ecosystems. Worringly, this understanding is sorely lacking in two of the most popular emerging visions of the future – ecomodernism and left accelerationism. In a nutshell, both envisage that technological progress will allow us to address climate and ecological breakdown while also dramatically increasing production and consumption. These imagined futures have obvious appeal to those who enjoy the luxuries of consumption and technological innovation. But the premises on which they rest are fatally flawed. The latter is completely disengaged from sustainability sciences. Ecomodernism is more engaged, but it tends to ignore the unjust distribution of environmental benefits and burdens from climate breakdown, and downplay how the organisation of our societies drives ecological crises. As a result, it focuses only on superficial social change. Proponents of both are often hostile to many ideas and individuals within the environmental movement. As such, they are seriously derailing momentum in tackling the climate crisis. The scientific evidence tells us that it is simply not possible to continue increasing consumption and greenhouse gas emissions on the current trajectory without exhausting Earth’s resources and crossing planetary boundaries – limits to Earth’s biological, chemical and physical systems that represent a safe operating space for humanity. Beyond these boundaries, we run the risk of causing abrupt and irreversible environmental changes that threaten the stability of Earth’s systems and human civilisation. For starters, all technology-focused future visions require wildly unrealistic increases in energy generation. This is a problem because since we have used up most of the easy to access sources, the quality of our energy resources is declining. Compared to a few decades ago, we need to input much more energy for every unit of energy we produce. While the energy cost of renewables is falling, vast increases in consumption only make the transition to renewables harder, and will put a huge additional burden on our already vulnerable energy systems. To navigate the high resource demands of their imagined futures, ecomodernist and left accelerationist visions rely on fairy tale technologies that do not exist. For example, the future vision of Fully Automated Luxury Communism (FALC) peddles promises of asteroid mining to address resource shortages on Earth. But we do not know if low-carbon space travel is possible. Ecological crises are happening now. We need to take action now. Searching for low-carbon space travel takes attention and resources away from social changes that we know can work.

 FALC’s vision has been accepted uncritically in prominent media outlets such as The New York Times and The Guardian, despite being thoroughly debunked by environmental scholars. This distracts from the hard but necessary work of changing the energy system now. Given the risks presented by climate breakdown above 1.5℃ of global heating – possibly just a decade or two away – we cannot afford to back future visions that do not prioritise immediate and large-scale cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.  More fundamentally, the ideas underlying technofix futures arguably aren’t far from the type of thinking that created the climate and ecological crises in the first place. They imagine luxury as heavily based in material consumption – as author of FALC’s manifesto Aaron Bastani says: “Cartier for everyone, MontBlanc for the masses and Chloe for all.” As a result, they tend to overlook and devalue aspects of our world that are less obviously associated with luxury: the natural environment, clean air, animal life, time spent with family and friends, local communities. These things may not provide material luxury, but they do make life worth living – and do not necessarily have to use up our scarce energy and material resources. Where FALC attempts to provide for all using the notion of luxury, feminist and ecologically-oriented economists and design theorists look to alternative strategies to generate prosperity. We propose a redesign of future ways of living based on different values: the ethics of care, regenerating nature, and distributing its benefits fairly.  Cooperatives, time-banks and community-owned renewable energy systems are already putting these values into practice. These organisational models create regenerative and distributive systems supporting prosperity for all, and addressing climate breakdown at the same time. Of course, these alternative futures will require us to fundamentally transform our culture as well as our economy. Clearly technofix futures are more attractive options for many of those who are not on the frontlines of climate chaos – and who might be able to continue living high-consumption lifestyles for a decade or two more.  But nothing other than dramatic societal transformation will be sufficient to avoid catastrophic climate change for the vast majority of the world’s population – and eventually, everyone. It may sound daunting, but rejecting the ecologically harmful assumptions on which our culture is currently built offers us a unique chance to build a healthier and fairer world.

"**Facebook and Twitter have penalised Donald Trump and his campaign for posts in which the president claimed children were ""almost immune"" to coronavirus.**
Facebook deleted the post - a clip from an interview Mr Trump gave to Fox News - saying it contained ""harmful Covid misinformation"".
Twitter followed by saying it had frozen a Trump campaign account until a tweet of the same clip was removed.
US public health advice makes clear children have no immunity to Covid-19.
A Facebook spokesperson said on Wednesday evening: ""This video includes false claims that a group of people is immune from COVID-19 which is a violation of our policies around harmful COVID misinformation.""
It was the first time the social giant had taken action to remove content posted by the president based on its coronavirus-misinformation policy, but not the first time it has penalised Mr Trump over content on his page.
Later on Wednesday, Twitter said it had frozen the @TeamTrump account because it posted the same interview excerpt, which President Trump's account shared.
A Twitter spokesman said the @TeamTrump tweet ""is in violation of the Twitter Rules on COVID-19 misinformation"".
""The account owner will be required to remove the Tweet before they can Tweet again.""
It later appeared to have been deleted.
Twitter last month temporarily suspended Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, for sharing a clip it said promoted ""misinformation"" about coronavirus and hydroxychloroquine.
But in March, Twitter said a tweet by entrepreneur Elon Musk suggesting children are ""essentially immune"" to coronavirus did not break its rules.
Speaking by telephone to morning show Fox and Friends on Wednesday, Mr Trump argued it was time for all schools nationwide to reopen.
He said: ""If you look at children, children are almost - and I would almost say definitely - almost immune from this disease.
""So few, they've got stronger, hard to believe, I don't know how you feel about it, but they've got much stronger immune systems than we do somehow for this.
""And they don't have a problem, they just don't have a problem.""
Mr Trump, who is running for re-election in November, also said of coronavirus: ""This thing's going away. It will go away like things go away.""
Children can catch and transmit the virus, but they run an extremely low risk of becoming ill from it.
Adults - and particularly older adults - are far more likely to be seriously ill and die from complications.
The largest study done so far, involving more than 55,000 hospital patients, found that only 0.8% were under the age of 19.
Half of all the people with confirmed coronavirus who were admitted to critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were 60 or older as of 31 July, according to a research charity.
A recent US study of coronavirus cases among 7,780 children from 26 countries found almost one in five patients had no symptoms. Another one in five developed lesions on their lungs during the infection.
Some 3.3% were admitted to intensive care units and seven deaths were reported, according to the research from the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.
A study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that people under 20 were about half as susceptible to coronavirus infection as those over 20.
There have been some extremely rare cases of children developing an inflammatory syndrome similar to Kawasaki disease, and scientists are exploring a possible delayed immune response to coronavirus.
In June, Facebook said it had removed adverts for President Trump's re-election campaign that featured a symbol used in Nazi Germany.
The company said the offending ad contained an inverted red triangle similar to that used by the Nazis to label opponents such as communists.
Mr Trump's campaign team said the far-left activist group antifa uses the symbol and it was a reference to them.
The ads, which were posted on the site on pages belonging to President Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence, were online for about 24 hours and had received hundreds of thousands of views before they were taken down.
Hundreds of school districts around the country have scrapped plans to reopen as coronavirus infections have spiked in a number of US states.
Some 20 of the nation's largest 25 school districts have announced they will start remotely.
Among the schools that are not reopening is one attended by the president's son, Barron Trump, in suburban Maryland.
St Andrew's Episcopal School said in a letter to parents it would opt instead for virtual learning to protect the health of students, families and staff.
Last week Georgia's largest school district, Gwinnett County, returned to school campuses to start planning for autumn reopening.
A day later, 260 employees had been told to stay away from their schools because they tested positive for coronavirus, or had been exposed to someone else who had the infection.
One of the first school districts in the nation to reopen, near Indianapolis, Indiana, had a student test positive on the first day.
The child's parents had sent him to campus, knowing that his test result was pending, schools officials said.
Other students who had come within 6ft of the patient for more than 15 minutes were sent home to self-isolate for 14 days."
"With a general election underway, Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, recently announced that fracking has been halted in the UK – but a closer look at this moratorium covers reveals a loophole. The suspension applies in the north of England, but the smallprint reveals that similar fossil fuel exploration in many traditionally safe Conservative constituencies in south-east England will be just as open for business as before.  The term fracking (from “hydraulic fracturing”) has come to describe a range of methods of drilling for oil and gas that are more correctly known as unconventional extraction. These are techniques reserved for oil and gas that is hard to access. Fracking – the injection of sand, water and toxic chemicals at high pressure to widen small fractures in shale rock, releasing trapped gas or oil – is just one of them. The government’s moratorium makes clear that fracking in Lancashire is a no-go. After government agency the Oil and Gas Authority reported that it was not possible to predict the probability or size of tremors from fracking, Cuadrilla’s operations at the now infamous Preston New Road site – which caused a magnitude 2.9 earthquake – are no longer lawful. The same is true for other fracking sites in earlier stages of development in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. But the north of England is not the only region in the UK that unconventional exploration for oil and gas is afoot. In the rolling hills south-west of London, work is also underway to extract gas and oil using similar methods. At numerous sites in Surrey and Sussex, companies are in the process of – or are planning to – inject acid in boreholes to widen fractures in the rock below.  This may be at a low pressure (a technique termed acidisation) or a higher pressure (acid fracking). But, crucially, both of these techniques tend to use pressures lower than the threshold at which the government’s moratorium outlaws fossil fuel extraction. So, fossil fuel exploration in south-east England usually encompassed under the term “fracking” is in fact exempt from this “ban”. Similar to the opposition to fracking in Lancashire, many local residents in Surrey have expressed serious concern at earthquakes as strong as magnitude 3.2 in the area. Researchers at the British Geological Survey and Imperial and Bristol universities ruled out a link to oil and gas exploration, but the earthquakes alone indicate that there are faults, or cracks, underground that could potentially be further destabilised by fossil fuel extraction. As such, there is strong local opposition to the operations. Interestingly, the constituencies surrounding these sites are largely safe Conservative seats that are expected to be held relatively comfortably. In contrast, Leave-voting seats in the North are key targets for the Conservatives this election. The party may struggle to reverse its distant second to Labour in the constituency of Preston itself, which houses the epicentre of local resistance to fracking in the Preston New Road protest camps. But in a region largely opposed to fracking, the ban may well be a boost to efforts to win over the so-called “Workington Man” – older, white, Leave voters who could be tempted to deviate from their usual Labour leanings.

      Can the Conservative Party win in the North of England?


 Consistent with the notion that government policy on domestic fossil fuel production is aimed at winning votes rather than a desire to cut emissions, it has just approved the opening of the Woodhouse Colliery coal mine. The mine sits in the Cumbrian constituency of Copeland, where the Conservatives hold a marginal lead over Labour and the Liberal Democrat vote barely registers. Importantly, unlike the broad opposition or ambivalence to fracking, the promise of new jobs from the coal mine has helped build local support. Deliberately or not, the current party of government’s “ban” on fracking hears local opposition in seats it is targeting in the north of England, but ignores similar opposition to unconventional extraction in its southern strongholds. Whether this will help the government to remain in their position come election day remains to be seen.

WUWT readers may recall: Upside-Side Down Mann and the “peerreviewedliterature” at Climate Audit. Steve McIntyre wrote then:
“…there isn’t a shred of doubt that Mann et al 2008 used these proxies upside down from the Tiljander interpretation. “
It seems the use of “upside down data interpretation” has leaked into a White House official report. WUWT reader “Jimmy” says in Tips and Notes: Check out the interesting temperature graph on this economic post from the White House today, “Deviation from Normal Temperature”. 
Excerpt:
3. The first quarter of 2014 was marked by unusually severe winter weather, including record cold temperatures and snowstorms, which explains part of the difference in GDP growth relative to previous quarters. The left chart shows the quarterly deviation in heating degree days from its average for the same quarter over the previous five years. By this measure, the first quarter of 2014 was the third most unusually cold quarter over the last sixty years, behind only the first quarter of 1978 and the fourth quarter of 1976. In addition, there were four storms in the first quarter that rated on the Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS). The right chart shows that no quarter going back to 1956 had more than three such storms.

Yes, while technically correct, showing heating degree days, it is upside down to the normal human interpretation of temperature, especially when the title says “Deviation from Normal Temperatures” while presenting degree days rather than a temperature plot. The other two largest positive spikes are the brutal winters of 1977 and 1978.
Source:  http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/05/29/second-estimate-gdp-first-quarter-2014
UPDATE:  here is how I would have presented this graph. Simply changing the title removes the inverted thinking about “Deviation from Normal Temperatures” and leaves it technically correct without unnecessarily confusing the reader.

Most people looking at that graph don’t have a clue what a heating or cooling degree day is. In case you don’t, here is a definition from NOAA/NWS
Q: What are degree days?
Heating engineers who wanted a way to relate each day’s temperatures to the demand for fuel to heat buildings developed the concept of heating degree days.
To calculate the heating degree days for a particular day, find the day’s average temperature by adding the day’s high and low temperatures and dividing by two. If the number is above 65, there are no heating degree days that day. If the number is less than 65, subtract it from 65 to find the number of heating degree days.
For example, if the day’s high temperature is 60 and the low is 40, the average temperature is 50 degrees. 65 minus 50 is 15 heating degree days.
Cooling degree days are also based on the day’s average minus 65. They relate the day’s temperature to the energy demands of air conditioning. For example, if the day’s high is 90 and the day’s low is 70, the day’s average is 80. 80 minus 65 is 15 cooling degree days.
Heating and cooling degree days can be used to relate how much more or less you might spend on heating or air conditioning if you move from one part of the country to another. Of course you’d have to take into account how well insulated your new home will be in comparison to your old one and the different costs of electricity, gas or heating oil. You could also use records of past heating degree days to see if the money you’ve spent on insulation, or a newer furnace or air conditioner is paying off. To do this, you’d also need records of past energy use.
The heating degree season begins July 1st and the cooling degree day season begins January 1st.

But also of interest in the same report is this graph and summary, which does make sense. It seems the winter of 2013/2014 set a new record for snowstorms.

4. Within the first quarter, several key indicators were lower in January and/or February before rebounding strongly in March, suggesting that the severe weather had a disruptive effect that only began to abate at the end of the quarter. Light vehicle sales, average weekly hours, core retail and food service sales, and core capital goods shipments dipped starting in December and/or January before bouncing back in March, and so were left little changed for the quarter as a whole. One outside group has estimated that the elevated snowfall in the first quarter slowed the annual rate of GDP growth by 1.4 percentage points, with all of that lost activity to be made up in the second quarter.
With this severe winter behind us, I have to wonder if any similar WH economic report (or any U.S. government report) exists that shows anything close to “slowed the annual rate of GDP growth by 1.4 percentage points” for a warmer than normal period. The summer of 2010 would be a good candidate for such a report.
If readers know of one, leave a note in comments.

"BEIJING  —   President Trump’s combative phone call with Australia’s prime minister over a refugee agreement has set off a political storm in that country, one that threatens to weaken support for a   alliance with the United States just as many Australians say they want closer ties with China. Enthusiasm for the alliance in Australia, one of America’s closest partners, which hosts American spy facilities and rotations of American Marines, had already been under pressure from China, with which Australia conducts the most trade. Reports that Mr. Trump had scolded Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Saturday, before abruptly ending the call, are likely to further undermine confidence in the United States, Australian analysts said. “Trump is needlessly damaging the deep trust that binds one of America’s closest alliances,” said Professor Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the Australian National University in Canberra. “China and those wishing to weaken the strongest alliance in the Pacific will see opportunity in this moment. ” In less than two weeks in office, Mr. Trump’s actions have strained alliances and alienated potential partners of the United States, and his phone call with Mr. Turnbull seemed to be one more example, this time with a country that has fought on America’s side since World War I. His administration’s confrontational stance on Iran has undermined liberal voices in that country his restrictions on immigration from some predominantly Muslim  countries have been widely criticized by allies and his rejection of the   Partnership trade deal threatens to push countries in the   region, including Australia, closer to China. Like many countries in the region, Australia depends on the United States for its security but looks to China for its economic   and it does not want to choose definitively between the two as they wage a global contest for power. Experts said the American and Australian militaries were sufficiently intertwined  —   the Royal Australian Air Force has flown in Syria, and Australian soldiers have helped train the Iraqi Army  —   that the countries’ security arrangements would endure. But the trust and confidence underlying the longstanding alliance will be harmed by Mr. Trump’s apparent lack of respect, and his remarks will be very costly in the public domain, they said. The phone call on Saturday became contentious after Mr. Turnbull pressed Mr. Trump to honor a deal in which the United States had agreed to take in up to 1, 250 refugees being held by Australia at offshore detention centers. Under the terms of the deal, hurriedly worked out by Mr. Turnbull and former President Barack Obama in New York last year, Australia would also accept Central American refugees staying in a Costa Rican detention facility. Australia has been harshly criticized for its offshore detention policy, and the issue is politically delicate at home. Many of the refugees it holds, on the Pacific   of Nauru and on the island of Manus in Papua New Guinea, are from Iran and Iraq. Both countries are among the seven whose citizens are barred from entering the United States for at least 90 days under the executive order Mr. Trump signed on Friday. In his conversation with Mr. Turnbull the next day, Mr. Trump said the deal with Australia was going to hurt him politically, according to a senior official in the Trump administration. Late Wednesday, hours after details of the call were reported, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that the agreement was “dumb. ” He said he would need to “study” it, leaving the door open to renege or to accept fewer refugees. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters in Washington on Thursday that Mr. Trump would allow the deal to proceed as long as the refugees were subjected to “extreme vetting. ” Mr. Spicer also said Mr. Trump remained “extremely upset” over the deal arranged by his predecessor. Mr. Turnbull, whose popularity has been sagging over domestic issues, struggled on Thursday to cast the call in a positive light, fending off demands from the opposition Labor Party that he detail exactly what Mr. Trump had said. Even after Mr. Trump made his remarks on Twitter, Mr. Turnbull insisted in a radio interview that he had “a clear commitment from the president” that the resettlement plans would proceed. “The alliance is absolutely rock solid,” Mr. Turnbull said. “It is so strong. ” The United States Embassy in Canberra had tried to help Mr. Turnbull with his predicament earlier Thursday, saying the White House had confirmed that the agreement would be honored. But after Mr. Trump wrote about the refugee deal on Twitter, the embassy referred questions about the agreement to the White House. Mr. Turnbull’s Liberal Party is the more conservative of Australia’s two major parties, and it has been a stalwart supporter of close ties with the United States. The Labor Party has leaned slightly more toward China, but as the debate over relations with Washington has intensified in recent months, former leaders of the party have become outspoken critics of the United States and have argued for shifting toward Beijing. Australian attitudes toward relations with the United States, which have historically been favorable, are now under pressure from China and its trading weight, according to polls. That is largely because the enormous Chinese demand for  Australia’s resources  —   particularly iron ore, natural gas and coal  —   has bolstered Australia’s economy for more than a decade. Chinese students also contribute substantially to Australian universities and schools, so much so that many of the institutions are dependent on the fees for survival. And under a new trade agreement, Australia is exporting large quantities of wine and meat to China. After Mr. Trump, in office just a few days, scrapped the   Partnership  —   a regional trade pact that the Obama administration had hoped would be an economic counterweight to China  —   Mr. Turnbull announced that he would seek to reconstitute the deal without the United States, but possibly including China, another indication of Beijing’s clout. A 2016 survey conducted by the public policy group Lowy Institute asked respondents to identify the country that was more important to Australia 43 percent chose the United States, and 43 percent China. In 2014, 48 percent had answered the United States, and only 37 percent had chosen China, said Sam Roggeveen, a senior fellow at the institute. According to the 2016 survey, 45 percent said that Australia should distance itself from the United States if Mr. Trump became president, Mr. Roggeveen said. “We can assume that number will now rise,” said Mr. Medcalf, of Australian National University. “This incident will only intensify the damage done by Trump’s abandonment of the T. P. P. which would have been a pillar of strategic partnership as well as of trade. ” The United States operates signals intelligence and radar facilities in remote corners of Australia that are becoming more important as North Korea’s nuclear threat expands, said Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. “Australia shares raw and finished intelligence in the closest possible collaboration you can imagine,” Mr. Jennings said. “It is extremely high tech. It is something no countries can equal, and it is part of what is known as the Five Eyes intelligence operation. It has created the highest possible level of trusted collaboration between the five countries. ” The Five Eyes countries are Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. Mr. Trump visited Australia in 2011, expressing a great liking for the country and entering the fray with China. On Twitter, he called it a “beautiful country with terrific people who love America. ” Then he added that Australia should “screw” China by raising its commodity prices. James Goldrick, a former rear admiral in the Australian Navy who served in Afghanistan, said that if Mr. Trump’s current abrasive attitude continued, it would probably make Australia a less publicly cooperative partner of the United States. “If the Trump administration pursues a less consultative approach, Australia will need to become more public in expressing its opinion on American initiatives that it does not wholly support,” Mr. Goldrick said. China’s role in Asia and North Korea’s nuclear efforts are far more important to the United   alliance than any one telephone call, said Peter Hayes, an Australian who is the director of the Nautilus Institute, a   research institute on security issues. But Mr. Trump’s “ability to create chaos” has placed those important strategic questions under a “dark cloud,” he said. “The United States has invested five decades in creating that system of alliances, and it is evident Trump is pretty ignorant of it and doesn’t care about it, to the extent he knows about it,” Mr. Hayes said."
"**Facebook has deleted a post in which President Trump had claimed Covid-19 was ""less lethal"" than the flu.**
Mr Trump is at the White House after three days of hospital treatment having tested positive for the virus.
He wrote the US had ""learned to live with"" flu season, ""just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!""
Twitter hid the same message behind a warning about ""spreading misleading and potentially harmful information"".
Users have to click past the alert to read the tweet.
""We remove incorrect information about the severity of Covid-19, and have now removed this post,"" said Andy Stone, policy communications manager at Facebook.
An exact mortality rate for Covid-19 is not known, but it is thought to be substantially higher - possible 10 times or more - than most flu strains, according to Johns Hopkins University.
The President has reacted by posting: ""REPEAL SECTION 230!!!""
This is a reference to a law that says social networks are not responsible for the content posted by their users.
But it allows the firms to engage in ""good-Samaritan blocking"", including the removal of content they judge to be offensive, harassment or violent.
If the law were to be repealed, social media companies would face being sued over the edits and changes of user content they made.
This is the second time that Facebook has deleted a post from the president. Twitter has intervened more often with deletions and warnings.
Both social networks have vowed to combat potentially dangerous misinformation around the virus.
But Mr Trump has taken issue with what he sees as editorialising by the companies.
Shortly after Twitter put a warning label on his posts for the first time in May, Mr Trump signed an executive order to repeal Section 230.
The proposal has attracted cross-party support - but for different reasons.
The Republicans say there is a bias against or even outright censorship of conservative views online and want this to stop. The Democrats say they are more interested in the spread of misinformation.
Last week, the US Senate Commerce Committee issued subpoenas for the heads of Facebook, Twitter and Google to probe the matter further.
Pressure has been mounting on Facebook and Twitter to do more to tackle misinformation both about the pandemic and the US election. For that reason, their decisive action on Trump's recent post promoting false claims about the severity of coronavirus will be welcomed.
That said, Trump's comments about the flu - and those yesterday saying ""Don't be afraid of Covid"" - have already started to fuel conspiracy theories online.
Posts in pro-Trump and anti-mask Facebook groups have shared the comments with captions about the pandemic not being real, or not very serious. They have also used it to encourage others not to follow health guidance like wearing a mask or social distancing.
Early on in the pandemic, the BBC investigated the human cost of misinformation, including those who fell seriously ill because social media posts led them to doubt the reality or severity of the pandemic and ignore advice.
The hope will be that this action from social media sites could reduce the risk of that happening - but those who may have already been exposed to this disinformation could be impacted.
And all eyes will be on social media sites to see if they keep up this approach to tackling disinformation - coronavirus, political or otherwise - especially from the US Election candidates as polling day nears."
"**Tech firms have been urged to stop advertising to under-18s in an open letter signed by MPs, academics and children's-rights advocates.**
Behavioural advertising not only undermines privacy but puts ""susceptible"" youngsters under unfair marketing pressure, the letter says.
It is addressed to Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft.
In a separate move Google-owned YouTube is accused of unlawfully mining data from five million under-13s in the UK.
European data protection laws forbid the mining of data of young children.
""The fact that ad-tech companies hold 72 million data points on a child by the time they turn 13 shows the extent of disregard for these laws, and the extraordinary surveillance to which children are subjected,"" the letter reads.
""There is no justification for targeting teenagers with personalised ads any more than there is for targeting 12-year-olds.
""You, the most powerful companies on the internet, have a responsibility to protect your users.""
Among the 23 signatories are MP Caroline Lucas and clinical psychologist Dr Elly Hanson. Friends of the Earth is also named on the letter.
It was co-ordinated by Global Action Plan, which argues that online advertising accelerates consumerism, and adds unnecessary pressure to the planet.
All the firms involved have been asked to comment but none has yet responded.
Separately, privacy advocate Duncan McCann is suing Google on behalf of five million British children, claiming it broke privacy laws by tracking children online, in breach of both UK and European data-protection laws.
The case, lodged with the UK High Court in July, will be strongly contested by YouTube which will argue its platform is not for children aged under 13.
Mr McCann, who has three children under that age, believes damages of between Â£100 and Â£500 could be payable to children who are found to have had their data breached."
"
Numbers released today by NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center show that not only has July been abnormally cool in the USA, but so has 2014 in general. For the last 30 days, there have been 574 record highest temperatures in the USA, and 1,726 record lowest. A ratio of 3 to 1, indicating that July was very cool. But, the year so far has also been cool.
So far for the USA year to date, the numbers of record lows outpace the highs two to one.

This year, here have been been 12,644 daily record lowest temperatures versus 6,615 record highest temperatures in the USA, a ratio of 1.91 to 1.0.
For all types of high and low daily records for the year to date, there were 29,372 cold records versus  16,761 warm records, a ratio of 1.75 to 1.0
If all high and low daily record types are considered for the last 365 days, cold still outpaces warm. There are 46,712 cold records versus 36,650 warm records.
The ratios for monthly all time records also see cold records outpacing warm ones.
From the National Climatic Data Center:
The summaries below list the number of records broken for several recent periods is summarized in this table and updated daily. Due to late-arriving data, the number of recent records is likely underrepresented in all categories, but the ratio of records (warm to cold, for example) should be a fairly strong estimate of a final outcome. There are many more precipitation stations than temperature stations, so the raw number of precipitation records will likely exceed the number of temperature records in most climatic situations.

For all time records, cold and warm records are about evenly balanced for 2014, with 28 warm records year-to-date versus 32 cold records.
As mentioned earlier by NCDC recent records (30 days or less) are probably underrepresented.

 **New Conservative**  
Leighton Baker  
Leader



New Conservative is concerned the recently endorsed Carbon Zero Bill will have little, if any, measurable benefits to New Zealand, but could seriously impinge on the sustainability of our food and goods production.



New Conservative would remove New Zealand from the Paris Accord, abandon the ETS, and rescind the [Carbon Zero Bill](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/new-conservative-says-no-to-zero-carbon-tax/) for the following reasons.



Firstly, New Zealand farming could already be net carbon zero if all the plants that grow here were included in calculations. Instead, only plantation forests are included, which neglects all the native plants, hedgerows, trees, crops, etc., on farms. In a similar way that businesses could not survive if they had to pay all the GST they collect to the government without any deductions for GST they have paid to suppliers, we cannot make farmers accountable for all the CO2 they produce without deducting all that they sequester.



Secondly, because New Zealand produces food, rather than just clipping the ticket on others’ production, we will naturally produce more carbon. However, nations need our food, so limiting production would be a negative outcome for other nations, and ourselves. Seeing that we produce that food economically and generally pretty sustainably, it makes more than just economic sense for New Zealand to continue to produce the food that feeds more than 8 times our population.



Thirdly, the effects of carbon on the environment is a long way from being proven. Most of the modelled projections on climate change have been so inaccurate that the whole theory must be challenged. We have seen no significant accelerated sea-level rise, and since no one can quantify the percentage of effect that man has on the climate, it would be more responsible to aim funds at mitigating any effects of a changing climate than trying to halt something that nobody knows how to control.



Fourthly, those who are most adamant that we reduce our carbon continue to fly around the world in their private jets and first-class tickets to more talk-fests about it, making it blatantly obvious that they do not really believe the doctrine they are pushing. In the same way that an advocate of veganism would lose all credibility if seen with a medium-rare ribeye, these climate alarmists have lost their mojo.



Fifthly, restricting our economy while other significant carbon emitters ramp up their production means the minute savings we make are quickly swallowed up in a day offshore. **Our Government’s role is to protect, enable and encourage New Zealanders, not dance on the world stage.** New Zealand is innovative and resourceful and we should be using those qualities to come up with specific pollution solutions that we can export worldwide.



Researching and creating pollution solutions that have worldwide applications would actually provide a greater benefit to the Earth’s environment than the billions thrown at carbon reduction.



New Conservative understands it is much easier to throw rocks than lay bricks, and that is why most of our policies have practical applications developed by people working in the front line of their industries.

"UNITED NATIONS  —   The new secretary general of the United Nations said on Wednesday that the Trump administration’s visa bans for citizens of seven   nations “violate our basic principles” and would do little to stem the threat of terrorism. “This is not the way to best protect the United States or any other country in relation to the serious concerns that exist of the possibilities of terrorist infiltration,” said the secretary general, António Guterres, in his first detailed remarks on President Trump’s executive order, which also indefinitely suspended Syrian refugee resettlement. “I think these measures should be removed sooner rather than later. ” Mr. Guterres, who took over as leader of the United Nations a month ago, was for 10 years the head of the United Nations refugee agency. He said Syrians today had the most urgent need for protection. “I strongly hope that the U. S. will be able to   its very solid refugee protection in resettlement and I hope that the Syrians will not be excluded in that process,” Mr. Guterres told reporters at the United Nations headquarters. The secretary general stopped short of calling Mr. Trump’s executive order illegal under international law. But asked whether it violates international obligations, he said: “I think that those measures indeed violate our basic principles. And I think that they are not effective if the objective is to really avoid terrorists to enter the United States. ” Mr. Guterres is under enormous pressure. On the one hand, he must speak out against discrimination, in keeping with the rules enshrined in international conventions. On the other, he needs to avoid alienating the president of the United States, which is the United Nations’ biggest financial backer. Mr. Guterres declined to comment about the White House’s reported threats to cut financial support to the United Nations, saying he did not want to prejudge what has not yet been announced. “When you talk too much about things that have not happened, you trigger the happening of those things,” he said. He said he had held “a very constructive discussion” with the new United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley. “What I am doing is to do everything I can to prove the added value of the U. N. to recognize the U. N. needs reforms, to be totally committed to those reforms,” Mr. Guterres said. That, he argued, is “the best way to get, indeed, the support of all member states, including the United States of America and the new administration. ” Mr. Guterres had been more restrained in his criticism of the Trump administration’s travel ban than some others at the United Nations. The organization’s top human rights official, Zeid Ra’ad   said in a Twitter post this week that Mr. Trump’s order flouted international law. On Wednesday, five independent human rights experts for the United Nations also criticized the Trump administration in a statement that described the new American policy as a discriminatory action that had stigmatized Muslim communities. The countries affected by Mr. Trump’s order are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Mr. Guterres, in his comments on Wednesday, also warned of a backlash. “When we adopt measures that spread anxiety and anger,” he said, “we help trigger the kind of recruitment mechanism that these organizations are doing everywhere in the world. ” Legal experts say the executive order could collide with international law. It is already facing numerous legal challenges in American courts. No country is legally obliged to provide resettlement to refugees, and every country has the sovereign right to decide who is admitted into its territory. But the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a treaty that came into force in 1976, prohibits a country from passing laws that discriminate on the basis of religion or national origin. James C. Hathaway, a University of Michigan law professor, argued that the United States therefore cannot limit resettlement based on religion or national origin. Additionally, laws governing the rights of refugees prohibit sending people back to countries where they could face persecution. In a post on the legal site Just Security, Mr. Hathaway called Mr. Trump’s executive order “willfully blind” to the United States’ obligation under that law."
"I am tramping through the long grass of a Sussex nature reserve with supermodel-turned-activist Lily Cole. Beyond the gorse and the bracken, a vast open sky stretches before us. It certainly beats a sterile Zoom call. “How amazing is this?” she says. “I’ve been talking about moving to nature for years and then, finally, I decided to do it two years ago. I’ve been very grateful for it in general and particularly, obviously, these last few months.” Cole, 32, has just rocked up on a big beast of an e-bike. Of course she is on a bike, though she could have as easily been driving her fancy electric Tesla car. The Tesla tech whiz Elon Musk is just one of the so-called “Wizards” she has interviewed for her book, Who Cares Wins: Reasons for Optimism in Our Changing World. The Wizards are the people who are using technology in an attempt to innovate us out of the environmental crisis. In the other camp are the “Prophets” who say we must cut back, travel less, consume less, simplify. Cole examines both approaches in the book.  Today Cole is in full Prophet mode in her “old, well-loved boots”, with her trademark flame-red hair tied in a top knot, but shaved underneath – an extremely beautiful hippie Prophet, dressed for comfort in jeans in a Conscious Exclusive bamboo fabric, T-shirt and cool round Wires sunglasses, a sustainable business she is involved with. As for many of us, her lockdown has been an “emotional roller coaster” but she daren’t whinge: “I feel like we’re in such a privileged position here. I can’t complain.” She has been “baking a ton, gardening a ton”, making nut milks, doing yoga, enjoying slowing down and spending more time with her five-year-old daughter, Wylde.  So far, so hashtag blessed, and it would be easy to peg Cole as a virtue-signalling, silver-spooned bluestocking, but that would be to do her an injustice. Yes, her Uncle Adam was heir to a seat at the House of Lords (he turned it down to become a cinematographer, then a pioneer in sustainable energy), but Cole’s own upbringing was more frugal than gilded. She was born in Devon to a fisherman father and a mother who is an artist and writer; her parents split when she was seven weeks old. Cole was raised in London by her mother, who suffers from a rare genetic condition and was frequently unable to work. Her grandparents owned a farm in South Wales. Cole was scouted outside a Soho burger bar by Storm Models when she was 14, and modelling was a dream ticket for her. In no time she was pulling sickies from school to work with the world’s most prestigious brands – Alexander McQueen, Louis Vuitton and Chanel to name but a few – and appearing on Vogue covers internationally. But pretty soon she was grappling with the darker side of consumerism’s lurking complexities. At 15 she was (uncomfortably) wearing fur on the catwalk. By 17 she had found her voice. “Eventually saying no to fur cost me work, but it was a fairly straightforward choice to make: little boxes on contracts, usually appearing next to ‘No Nudity’”. A more complex decision came when she found herself caught up with the jewellery company De Beers, which had been accused of evicting the San people to mine diamonds in Botswana. The company denied any wrongdoing, but in a bold move for one so young, Cole refused to work for them and instead helped the San sell their own fair trade jewellery. “This experience in Botswana marked me. I felt an enormous responsibility to understand and respect what I was selling. I wasn’t just buying the companies’ products, I was asking other people to buy them too,” she writes. It’s telling that we still know Cole as a supermodel. Though she rarely models these days, her distinctive face and bright auburn hair are what we remember, yet modelling was only ever part of her story, a sideline, first to her academic life – she has a double first in history of art from Cambridge and got straights As in her A-levels – then to her entrepreneurial ventures and acting. Her first role was in the 2007 remake of St Trinian’s, followed by Terry Gilliam’s The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus, and in 2017 she played the Virgin Queen in Channel 5’s Elizabeth I. She has also stepped behind the camera to make a film about the plight of the refugees on the island of Samos, and has lent her time and profile to numerous charities and social enterprises. “I’ve been quite lucky in that modelling is something you can do part-time, but ironically it’s the most visible part of my life, even though I spend less time doing it, because it only takes a few seconds to take a photo that’s then very visible and always there, in comparison, say, to the many months I might spend slogging behind a computer.” In her latest incarnation as a writer, Cole spends the morning working and afternoons with her daughter. There has been no rigorous home-schooling. Cole is a fan of “the Scandinavian approach” and “preserving the sanctity of childhood” until the age of seven. Of course she is. But still she has been “finding ways to slip in lessons”, writing in a more playful way by making postcards for people and reading Philip Pullman’s Northern Lights. In her book, Cole takes a deep dive into the issues surrounding gender equality and the environment. She mentions that when she was pregnant she wrote a Post-it Note contract, which was “part in jest (but in spirit very serious!)” agreeing to split the childcare 50/50 with her partner, tech-entrepreneur Kwame Ferreira.  The “contract” with Ferreira was prompted by an article she read that said most couples never discuss the division of childcare before their baby’s arrival. “It really rang out to me,” she says. So how is that working? Do they have a timetable? Does her partner stick to it? “I think it works really well – I’d highly recommend it. I’m not saying everyone has to make that choice or do the same division we decided on,” she says. “It’s not a rigid thing, more a loose understanding that we try to honour.” Then, in a typically cerebral response, Cole spends a good five minutes explaining the philosophy behind this choice. “I’m not saying I’m against, in any form, women taking time out to look after their children; if that’s what they want to do it’s a beautiful decision to make. The point I’m making is, I think ideas about who is responsible for the children have a big impact on gender parity for women. I’m not saying there’s a ‘right’ way to do it; I’m encouraging parents to be conscious of what they want, rather than slipping into what their parents did. Or what their grandparents did.” She also mentions that she supports single motherhood and same-sex parenting. “Sorry – long answer,” she says. “But it’s important, right?” As we tramp through the long grass, passing the odd dog walker, Cole nods hello. This is the other part of the countryside equation that she appreciates. But does she miss London at all? “I like being able to access it, but I don’t miss the daily experience. I feel like all my defences are up: it’s so urban and busy, and no one says hello. It’s a little bit more human here.” Last year, Cole signed a letter in support of Extinction Rebellion, with other celebrities such as Jude Law, Jaime Winstone and Daisy Lowe, who work in fashion and film, jetsetting industries with huge carbon footprints – but Cole won’t be drawn into finger-wagging. The sensible answer would be to make the rich pay for their oversized carbon footprints, with a pollution tax on flights, as suggested by the campaign A Free Ride, she says. We could each have just one tax-free return flight a year. Cole tries hard not to fly herself, “but without saying I’ll never fly again” because it’s more difficult to travel ethically than you think. After hearing Greta Thunberg speak in Stockholm, she attempted to come home by train. “But that route isn’t really designed for that. I fucked it up.” After two days, four train rides, a bus ride, a ferry crossing and a night sleeping in Copenhagen, she missed her last connection. In the end she booked a (very cheap) flight, offsetting it on Climeworks, and cried in frustration because she felt like a failure – but also because it seemed indicative of a wider problem. She had more luck travelling to Portugal on a bumpy, old-fashioned, 1980s sleeper train, which delighted her daughter with its fold-down beds and grey felt walls. “It was awesome, so much more memorable than travelling by plane.” This is all very right-on of course, but Cole is able to laugh at herself (and frequently does). She is well aware of her privileged position. Fearing criticism, she questioned whether she should even write the book at all. “I’m definitely not perfect, but then no one is,” she admits. “I think that’s a natural instinct that comes from a society that is quite tough on each other. But being tough does nothing but distract from the conversation and the effort. So you have to resist that. It would be nice if we were a bit more forgiving as a culture,” she says. She is now embracing the idea of being “an imperfect environmentalist”. Cole’s first exposure to activism came at the age of eight, when her 16-year-old cousin, Emma, was photographed chained to a tree in newspapers. “I was, like, why is my cousin tied to a tree?” Emma has since said that she thinks this approach alienated people, that people looked at activists chained to trees and thought: “I’m not like that, so the environment isn’t something I need to care about.” Does Cole agree? “I can really understand what she was saying because you don’t want to create an ‘us’ and ‘them’ mentality. The reality we’re dealing with should make everyone an environmentalist. It’s something that concerns us all in the same way as Covid is something that concerns us all: the environment is similarly real. It’s really important to keep listening and to stay open-minded, because we’re all in this together, no one has the right answers. No one knows what’s right.” What law would she introduce if she were prime minister for the day? “From an environmental point of view? Put a price on pollution.” A similar tax caused uproar in France, when fuel tax riots engulfed Paris in 2018. “But the devil is in the detail right? They didn’t design it in the right way, so it impacted people financially. But there are examples, like Canada, where it’s well designed and doesn’t penalise poorer communities, and can even offer wealth redistribution, with the tax redistributed equally among citizens, so the less you pollute the more you make.” The ink was just drying on her book when Covid-19 hit. She has spent part of lockdown rewriting the preface, but does she think we will take this chance to finally pivot, to let nature bounce back? “We’ve yet to see what will happen with Covid. Whether it will be a distraction, because we’re focused on a new set of problems or whether it will compound it. I hope it compounds it because we’ve already started experiencing some of the things scientists have been warning about for years.” Like the bushfires? “Yes and Covid itself is a result of the way we’re interacting with the natural world, the way we’re industrialising animal agriculture – and that’s not a conversation that’s in the mainstream.” On her bleakest days Cole says she soothes herself with the thought that if we don’t get our climate sorted the Earth will carry on regardless. “What’s the worst-case scenario? Just that we’re going to wipe ourselves out, along with other species, but the world will no doubt bounce back and there might even be more interesting creatures that emerge instead of us.” Unless you live in an entirely self-sufficient way, everything we touch, eat and use is connected to a complex web of trade relationships that we are responsible for being part of. When we make a purchase, we are explicitly supporting that way of doing business by giving a company our money; we are funding them keeping going. Of course, the power of money lies not just in how you spend it, but also in how you earn it, save it and invest it. Many of us want to earn our money working for – or setting up – companies that are looking to solve problems. Employees often have the greatest leverage to change the working practices inside companies, and there has been a boom in social businesses and new legal structures that seek to remodel a new vision of capitalism. My journey in thinking about these issues began when I was plunged head first into the epicentre of consumerism: fashion. I was always a fairly material girl: I remember trawling Portobello Market from a very young age, begging my mum to buy me a trinket. I had a penchant for dressing up, and second-hand clothes were my palette. Mum’s answer was usually no, met by hysteria. But sometimes she would give in and buy it. Then a store opened in Kilburn selling new clothes at unbelievably cheap prices: T-shirts for £1, dresses for £3. I saved my Christmas money and would fill up one of their big baskets until it was so heavy I could barely lift it. I never considered how clothes could be made so cheaply. It was as if they had dropped from heaven. And one day, my life changed. I was walking in Soho with friends when a man approached us, holding a little white card and said something about modelling. I pocketed the card and let my heart spring under a cautious face. My mum took me into the modelling agency the first time. I was given a big blue book, which would be filled with pictures of me: I was to become my own travelling saleswoman. I had just turned 14 and the blue book was heavy with possibilities. Fashion offered a fairytale for my inner child, and initially I indulged it without question. I made money and friends, and fulfilled my dream of travelling. Yet it also offered me a surprising gift: an education in capitalism. Who Cares Wins: Reasons for Optimism in Our Changing World by Lily Cole (Penguin Life , £20) is out on 30 July.

The news cycle Saturday was dominated with coverage of the hundreds of thousands of women, many donning pink hats, gathering in major cities for “women’s marches” to protest Donald Trump. Anyone watching the news would have gained the distinct impression that these marches purported to speak for women across the country, with headlines like: “Women’s Marches Protest Trump Election & Agenda,” and organizers emphasizing that “we represent half of this country.” 



But could we be honest about what this really is? This isn’t a “women’s march” but a _liberal_ women’s march. Despite the organizers’ promises to the contrary, these marches were by no means inclusive and failed to represent the diverse array of priorities that many women across the country have. Some were even actively discounted.



For instance, march organizers excluded feminist pro‐​life groups from being full partners in the event. As one activist tweeted, “Nope, you cannot be anti‐​choice and feminist. Forcing birth on unwilling women is misogynist act.” It may be, but the Pew Research Center finds that 40 percent of women think abortions should be illegal in most or all cases. Are these marches truly “women’s marches” when they exclude 40 percent of American women? 



**I Coulda Been A Supporter**





I wanted to attend the women’s march but was turned off by its divisiveness, exclusiveness, and politicization.



To be perfectly clear, I support the constitutional right of these women to publicly organize and express their beliefs. I also agree with many of the priorities they highlighted, including protecting civil rights of LGBTQ people, immigrants, people of color, Muslims, criminal justice reform, and opposition to bigotry, to name a few. 



But I also feel somewhat betrayed. I was initially inclined to attend the march myself, but its organizers allowed it to become politicized, divisive, and exclusive. Wasn’t the protest about protesting _against_ exclusivity? 



I was outraged after the “Access Hollywood tapes” revealed Trump bragging about groping and grabbing women without their permission, after learning he said women should be dumped around age 35, and when reports from multiple women confirmed that he did routinely grab and kiss women without their consent. I was angered when he called Megyn Kelly a “bimbo” and Hillary Clinton a “nasty woman,” terms he appeared to reserve just for women who cross him. These are many of the issues that prompted the Women’s March in the first place.



Trump’s actions and words made me think of the number of times I’ve been grabbed by men. Talk to just about any woman, and she will report similar types of experiences. It’s particularly frustrating because there is little recourse for women without hurting their own careers and reputations in the process. Kelly recounted facing this very type of dilemma early in her career when Roger Ailes repeatedly tried to kiss her but she knew she couldn’t tell anyone because it would be career “suicide.” It’s ridiculous that this remains an issue in the modern era, but it is. 



Regardless of your political ideology, position on same‐​sex marriage, tax rates, gun issues, college funding, corporate donations, etc. most all women can agree that Trump’s attitudes toward women are unacceptable. His words and actions are a personification of a decrepit culture that some men wrongfully embrace for which they should be held accountable and corrected in the public sphere. 



**We Could Have Agreed on a Lot**



That’s what these marches could have been about yesterday, and something women can agree on regardless of their ideological stripe. But instead, these marches turned into a protest about the common litany of liberal policy priorities. No, I’m not angry about corporate revenues being too high. No, I don’t understand why we must force people against their will to fund abortions if they believe it’s wrong. No, I don’t think it’s wise for government to use tax dollars to pay for everyone’s college. No, I don’t believe capitalism is exploitation, but rather a system that has done more to lift people out of poverty than any other system yet discovered. 



While the speakers highlighted important issues, they were not representative of diverse viewpoints but rather of those from the left end of the political spectrum. Ashley Judd’s speech in particular delved at times into the wacky, declaring that “I didn’t know devils could be resurrected, but I feel Hitler in these streets, a mustache traded for a toupee, Nazis renamed ‘The Cabinet.’” Michael Moore encouraged attendees to join Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro Choice America, or a climate change group —hardly an ideologically diverse set of groups.



Why weren’t prominent non‐​liberal women who were also outspoken against Trump invited to speak, such as S.E. Cupp, Ana Navarro, Condoleezza Rice, or Mindy Finn? Why was there only room for individuals of one political persuasion like Michael Moore, Elizabeth Warren, Van Jones, Gloria Steinem, Cecile Richards, and Ashley Judd? 



So let’s be honest: this was a liberal women’s march. And that’s fine. But it’s not a “women’s march” protesting Trump. The organizers were not inclusive and sought to only include women who share their economic, cultural, and social policy views. 



But women are not a monolithic group. We have different policy positions on taxes, spending, abortion, same‐​sex marriage, guns, capitalism, etc. Furthermore, many of us share the same goals but may disagree about the best way to achieve them. If one is going to plan a “women’s march” and purport to speak for “women” as a whole, they cannot restrict those invited to speak, to partner, and to attend to just one end of the political spectrum. 



There is plenty we as women can agree on; why would we needlessly exclude?

Last week I was chatting with a real estate agent who has a superb property for sale on Petone foreshore. With a busy road between the house and the beach, it has fabulous sea views, and is in a prime location for the local cafes and restaurants in Petone. This house, I thought, will sell for a small fortune.



Well, no. It might not. Because apparently it is almost impossible for a buyer to get insurance for properties on the foreshore. Or round at Eastbourne for that matter, if the property is on the waterfront. Even though there is a road between the properties and the beach, there too, insurance is very difficult, if not impossible to obtain.



Yes, I thought it was the old stalwart, climate change, raising its ugly head again. I was about to go off into a diatribe about sea-level rises being minimal, when I was stopped short by the real estate agent. The reason is nothing to do with sea-level rises – not along there anyway. The reason for a lack of insurance in this area is tsunami risk.



So, have insurance companies assessed that there is a greater risk of a tsunami now than, say, 30 years ago? Is this simply because we have never had a tsunami, but we might?



A year or so ago, IAG announced that they would not take on any new insurance on properties anywhere in Wellington, as they felt they were sufficiently exposed in the area. Obviously, their concern is the risk of a large earthquake but Wellington has always been an earthquake risk. Is it a bigger risk now than, say, 30 years ago? Nobody had trouble getting insurance back then, and everyone knew that Wellington was earthquake prone.



It is not just Wellington. All around the country, there are similar stories. I was refused insurance on a rental property a few years ago because we had not had time to get a new electrical code of compliance. This was an existing house, in a completely different area, and I had never been asked that question before. We got insurance elsewhere, but it came as a surprise. Nowadays, such things are commonplace.



It makes no sense when insurance is all about risk. That is the name of the game. They charge a premium and take a risk. But these days, it seems that insurers charge high premiums, but take as few risks as possible. It is like having your cake and eating it too.



And boy, are premiums going through the roof these days! The problem is that, as premiums get more and more expensive, people will start going without insurance, and that will not be a good thing for anyone. Many people are saying that they no longer bother with contents insurance. The irony is that buying new furniture is less expensive than insuring what you have. Really. 



Something is going to have to happen here. The whole thing is becoming ridiculous. It is easier to get insurance in California than in some parts of New Zealand, and they have earthquakes, tsunami risk and wildfires to contend with as well.



While there are very few areas where I agree with this government, it could be the perfect government to bring back something along the lines of State Insurance… no, I don’t mean the company that was flogged off overseas, but an actual state insurer, that provides insurance cover and charges reasonable premiums. This is, of course, typical broad based Labour policy, but it could provide the country with a much needed backstop in an area where the private sector is letting us all down. Badly.



Many readers of _The BFD_ will not like the idea, but the alternative seems to be many people, particularly the elderly or those on low incomes, going without insurance because either premiums become impossibly expensive, or the insurers refuse your application. What do you do if you have owned a house on the Petone foreshore for years and suddenly you cannot get insurance? Your risk has not changed noticeably. It is your insurance company’s appetite for risk that has changed.



It is only a matter of time before we have either a lot of uninsured houses, or a new state insurance entity. The latter would be preferable because, as we saw in Christchurch, those who had no insurance at all were backed by the government in the end. Far better for those people to have paid some premiums at least, rather than the taxpayer cover the whole damned lot.



Interesting subject. What do you think?

"The Paris agreement to tackle climate change is an extraordinary opportunity. In a remarkable display of unity, almost every nation on Earth has agreed to make critical changes that will help humanity avoid disaster. By aiming to limit global warming to 1.5C, it represents the world’s best chance of adapting to a crisis that threatens our planet’s very existence. But Donald Trump is walking away. This decision is politically shortsighted, scientifically wrong and morally irresponsible. By leaving the Paris agreement, he is undermining his country’s future. Every single day, we see the effects of climate change across the US. From catastrophic forest fires in California to rising sea levels in Miami and devastating flooding in Texas, these changes are a real and present danger. Our climate is visibly changing and the consequences will be disastrous for everyone. Despite this, the president is closing his eyes to reality. He is turning away from the only opportunity to save humanity from the effects of rising temperatures. Far from making America great again, his decision leaves it isolated – as everyone else comes together to face this great challenge. President Trump’s stance is all the more bewildering because climate change does not respect borders. This crisis will not bypass America because he chooses to ignore it. Fires will burn just as wildly and rising seas continue to threaten coastal cities. No country is an island and America cannot pull up the drawbridge to escape a crisis enveloping the whole world. Walking away will also do nothing to stop the consequences of climate change arriving on America’s doorstep. According to the World Bank, the effects of rising temperatures could force 1.4 million people to abandon their homes in Mexico and Central America, where one-third of all jobs remain linked to agriculture. Many of these climate refugees will head to the US. Tackling climate change is an international problem that needs an international solution. The Paris agreement is the result of decades of careful work and a solution that will benefit everyone – including America – long-term. We need a low-carbon strategy for everything from food and water systems to transport plans and we must design climate resilience into our infrastructure. By investing in climate-adaptation strategies now, we can protect against the worst impacts of the risks and dangers that lie ahead. A Global Commission on Adaptation report found that investing $1.8tn globally in adaptation by 2030 could yield $7.1tn in net benefits. Planning now and prospering, rather than delaying and paying for the consequences later, will sort the winners from the losers in this crisis response. There is a brutal irony in that the world at large is finally waking up to the climate crisis as President Trump ignores the science. The EU is creating a Green Deal for a more sustainable economy and China is greening its infrastructure spending as leaders across the globe realise that we are running out of options. Without the Paris agreement, America will start sliding backwards just as everyone else accelerates. History does not look kindly on leaders who do not lead when disaster threatens. There is a moral bankruptcy in looking away in a time of crisis, which resonates down the decades. This is all the more poignant as, across America, we can see many local efforts to try to plug the gap in the country’s climate strategy. Many Americans understand what their leader does not: we are running out of time to try to stem disaster, and their very lives may be under threat. Politicians from across the US political divide can also see what is coming – and what is necessary to avert disaster In Boston, city leaders have launched Climate Ready Boston to help create a more resilient future by redesigning buildings and waterfront parks, and elevating pathways. In Miami, the Miami Forever Bond includes nearly $200m for climate-change adaptation, countering sea-level rise through measures such as planting mangroves along the waterfront and raising sea walls. Politicians from across the US political divide can also see what is coming – and what is necessary to avert disaster – from Republicans such as Miami’s mayor, Francis Suarez, to the Democrats, who have presented a Green New Deal. But this international crisis cannot be solved by local action, important though that is. We need the US to show leadership and place the whole might of US innovation and expertise behind this most important of endeavors. President Trump has made a grave mistake in withdrawing from the Paris agreement at this critical juncture. His actions lessen America, a country that has always taken pride in doing the right thing, at the right time, and seized opportunities for technological and economic transformation. But it is not yet too late to find a way back and this is one error that can be undone. We can only hope that America recognises this before it is too late.

"Nearly 80,000 jobs could be quickly created through a stimulus plan that aims to rebuild the Australian economy from recession while tackling the climate crisis, an analysis commissioned by the Climate Council says. The report by the consultants AlphaBeta says 76,000 positions could be created over three years through nearly $22bn of combined public and private investment. It focuses on 12 areas including creating large-scale renewable energy projects, restoring degraded ecosystems, better dealing with organic waste, retrofitting inefficient public buildings and expanding electric vehicle networks.  It found 70% of the jobs would be in construction and administrative support roles, 42% would be based in regional areas and nearly a third would require little training. The AlphaBeta work joins research commissioned by other advocacy and non-profit organisations that have proposed stimulus programs that would also cut greenhouse gas emissions rather than reinforce fossil fuel industries. Andrew Charlton, a director with the consultancy and a former economics adviser to then prime minister Kevin Rudd, said the research highlighted stimulus projects that prioritised economic recovery, but would also leverage private investment and accelerate the shift to clean energy, a move that would reduce costs in the long-term. “If you can spend the money in that way you’re doing the taxpayer a big favour,” he said. The analysis suggested investment in pilot-scale green hydrogen developments would be of the most benefit to the economy, yielding $4 of private spending for every public dollar invested. Large solar and windfarms would unlock $3 for every dollar spent, while electric vehicle infrastructure, improving waste collection and smaller, community-scale energy and storage projects could create $2. AlphaBeta said the jobs plan could be tailored to meet the different needs of states and territories. In New South Wales, the best opportunities were in building public transport infrastructure and big renewable energy plants; in Victoria, it was utility scale clean energy and organic waste management. Ecosystem restoration was identified as a leading job creator in all other states and territories, often alongside clean energy. The result would be a cleaner Australian economy, which is currently 43% more emissions-intensive than the OECD average. The country emits more per unit of GDP than each of the European Union, Japan, the US and Canada. Significant figures from across the community, including business leaders, unions and the welfare sector, have pushed for a green recovery from recession. Several groups have suggested work-intensive programs to improve the energy efficiency of Australia’s substandard housing and building stock. A report by Beyond Zero Emissions, an energy and climate change thinktank, found practical projects to decarbonise the economy could on average create 355,000 jobs a year for five years. The Morrison government has not yet made low-emissions investments a priority in its response. The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, called for a gas-fired recovery, and the National Covid-19 Coordinating Commission has strongly backed expanding the gas industry while giving little consideration to renewable energy, but the idea of a green recovery has won more support from some state governments. Charlton said the AlphaBeta work differed from Beyond Zero Emissions’ report by focusing solely on what could be delivered immediately. “Our real lens here is an economic lens. How do we use the imperative to rescue the economy to support some of the long-term challenges? It’s saving the planet by saving the economy,” he said. Amanda McKenzie, the Climate Council’s chief executive, said the AlphaBeta plan would put the country “on a practical, jobs-rich path and focuses on areas most in need”. “It sets us up for the future by creating jobs and tackling climate change,” she said. “It’s a win-win solution.”"
"WASHINGTON  —   Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee sought to stall the confirmations of Steven Mnuchin and Tom Price, President Trump’s picks for Treasury secretary and secretary of health and human services, by refusing to attend scheduled votes on Tuesday. As Mr. Trump’s dramatic firing of his acting attorney general threw the capital into tumult, Democrats on Tuesday also seized on the contentiousness to try to block Senator Jeff Sessions’s nomination as attorney general because they said he was too close to Mr. Trump. In describing their tactic of boycotting the votes on nominees to Treasury and to health and human services, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said that recent news reports suggested Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Price had given false statements in their nomination hearings. He said more information was needed before making judgments about the nominees. “We have made clear that we need additional information,” Mr. Wyden said. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, assailed the nominees for failing to be honest with the committee. “The truth matters,” she said. “That’s not what has been happening here. ” Republicans expressed dismay at the delay. “I think this is a completely unprecedented level of obstruction,” said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican from Pennsylvania. But with a Supreme Court vacancy nearing its   point after a long blockade by Republicans, Democrats were not exactly feeling the heat, at least not yet. During a   hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrats painted Mr. Sessions as an extremist legal savant for Mr. Trump in support of   ideologies, while Republicans portrayed him as a   lawyer and    prosecutor who would enforce the law as written. “How could we possibly conclude that this nominee will be independent?” asked Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She said that Sally Q. Yates, the former acting attorney general fired late Monday, showed “guts” and independence in refusing to defend Mr. Trump’s executive order banning immigrants from seven largely Muslim countries. “I have no confidence that Senator Sessions will do that,” Ms. Feinstein said. Democrats hope to turn the tumult into a referendum on Mr. Sessions, an Alabama Republican, and whether he would have the independence to serve as the nation’s chief law enforcement official after emerging as one of Mr. Trump’s closest advisers in the presidential campaign. Democrats are already calling it “the Monday night massacre” after Mr. Trump fired Ms. Yates, the acting attorney general, for refusing to defend his immigration order in court. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said in opening the hearing that there was still “no mystery” whether Mr. Sessions would be confirmed, since the Republicans hold a majority. He urged approval of Mr. Sessions as quickly as possible to restore leadership at the Justice Department. At Mr. Sessions’s nomination hearing this month, Democrats challenged him repeatedly about whether he would have the independence to stand up to Mr. Trump if the president veered into legally questionable terrain. Mr. Sessions assured the lawmakers that he would be able to “say no” to the president and would not be a “mere rubber stamp for the president. ” Mr. Sessions said he was not involved in drafting the contentious executive order on immigration. Republicans showed no sign of breaking rank as they defended Mr. Sessions, a friend of many senators who served alongside a number of them on the committee. The hearing evolved into dueling portraits of what Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, called “two different people. ” Senator John Cornyn, the Texas Republican, scoffed at the “faux outrage” from Democrats who cast Ms. Yates’s stance as a “a   act of political courage. ” Democrats, he said, were unfairly making Mr. Sessions the target of their anger because they “still seem to be upset about the results of the election. ”"
"**Facebook has removed or restricted thousands of groups and accounts sharing and promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory.**
It is part of a new policy that aims to limit the risks to public safety posed by QAnon, ""offline anarchist groups"" and US-based militia organisations.
The company said that it had removed ""over 790 groups, 100 pages and 1,500 ads tied to QAnon"".
It also imposed restrictions on more than 1,950 groups and 440 pages.
More than 10,000 Instagram accounts associated with the movement have also been restricted.
QAnon is a conspiracy theory that believes US President Donald Trump is waging a secret war against a ""deep state"" network of paedophiles who are powerful government, business and media figures.
When asked his opinion on QAnon during a press conference, President Trump claimed not to know much about it, saying: ""I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate"", remarks which have been interpreted by some as tacit approval for the conspiracy.
As well as targeting the QAnon conspiracy, Facebook said that they had also removed content from other ""militia organisations and those encouraging riots"", including some antifa (anti-fascist) groups.
It said it had growing concerns over groups which have ""celebrated violent acts, shown that they have weapons and suggest they will use them, or have individual followers with patterns of violent behaviour"".
Under the new policy, groups, pages and Instagram accounts associated with these movements will be removed if they discuss potential violence, ""including when they use veiled language and symbols"" associated with the movement.
Facebook will still allow people to post content in support of these groups and movements, although it will ""restrict their ability to organise"".
This means that these pages and accounts will not be recommended to users, the ranking of their content in newsfeeds will be reduced, and titles and hashtags associated with them will be limited in search results.
In addition, Facebook will ban the groups from placing adverts or selling products, and prohibit fundraising in their support.
**By Shayan Sardarizadeh and Jack Goodman** **,** **BBC anti-disinformation team**
QAnon began in October 2017 on the anonymous message board 4chan. A user claimed to have top-security clearance within the US government and signed off their posts anonymously as ""Q"" - hence the name QAnon. Q communicates in cryptic posts and claims to be involved directly in a secret Trump-led investigation of a global network of child abusers.
QAnon followed on from the ""pizzagate"" saga in 2016 - a fake theory about Democratic Party politicians running a paedophile ring out of a Washington pizza restaurant.
QAnon influencers have big audiences on social media. They urge followers to ""do their own research"" - in other words, watch YouTube videos and talk to other supporters - to solve Q's puzzles. In its nearly three years of existence, the conspiracy has drawn huge traffic on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Reddit, attracting hundreds of thousands of dedicated followers. This includes celebrities and dozens of candidates running for the US Congress this year.
During the coronavirus pandemic, Q influencers have spread unfounded theories about coronavirus, calling it a ""deep state"" hoax, and have promoted misinformation about face masks and vaccines.
Last month both Twitter and TikTok also cracked down on QAnon content.
Twitter banned thousands of accounts and said it would block QAnon urls, while TikTok deleted hashtags that signposted QAnon videos.
The FBI last year issued a warning about ""conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists"" and designated QAnon a potential domestic extremist threat.
President Trump was asked about QAnon at a press conference on Wednesday.
When asked to comment on QAnon followers' far-fetched theory that he is secretly saving the world from a Satanic cult of paedophiles and cannibals, he responded: ""I haven't heard that, but is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing?""
He went on to claim ""we are saving the world from the radical-left philosophy that will destroy this country"".
Mr Trump has, in the past, retweeted content from known QAnon sympathisers, as well as tweets containing hashtags used by believers in the conspiracy.
Some QAnon supporters are running for office including the Republican congressional candidate for Georgia."
"When the Boy Scouts of America announced Monday that transgender boys would be welcome to camp, hike and earn merit badges alongside their peers, the move brought praise from critics of the organization who for years have called for more inclusive membership rules. But the decision, which came with little warning and reversed a more than   stance of determining gender based on birth certificates, further alienated many religious conservatives who were longtime advocates of the program. “Now we see once again that the Boy Scouts really is committed to a   culture war that evangelical Christians and many other Americans just can’t accept,” said Russell Moore, the president of the Ethics  Religious Liberty Commission, the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention. Mr. Moore, a former scout, said Southern Baptist churches and others had been dismayed by Boy Scout policies for several years, as the Scouts moved first to allow openly gay youth members, and then openly gay adult leaders. Though several Southern Baptist congregations have stopped sponsoring Scout troops, Mr. Moore said others had held out hope that the organization would return to a more conservative worldview. “I think, for some, this will be the final sign that it’s time to go,” Mr. Moore said. Whether the new rules would lead to an influx of transgender scouts seemed uncertain. Besides one highly publicized case of a transgender boy being excluded from a New Jersey Scouting unit, there had been limited attention on the issue before this week. Boy Scouts officials declined to be interviewed, and would not comment on how many youths the decision might affect. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Boy Scouts said it was “no longer sufficient” to rely on a birth certificate to determine gender. “The B. S. A. is committed to identifying program options that will help us truly serve the whole family,” said the spokeswoman, Effie Delimarkos, adding that those efforts would remain “true to our core values, outlined in the Scout Oath and Law. ” For many years, the Boy Scouts have found themselves facing conflicting forces on issues of sexuality and inclusion. The Scouts contended with a pattern of declining membership, canceled corporate donations and public criticism over the group’s restrictions on gay youths before easing those rules in 2013. And the move this week to allow transgender youths was hailed by some as a positive, overdue step toward equality. “No one should be denied the opportunity to participate in any Boy Scout troop because of their gender identity or expression,” Jonathan A. Greenblatt, the chief executive of the   League, said in a statement. But many Scout units are sponsored by conservative religious denominations that have opposed the changes, saying the organization has betrayed its values by loosening membership rules. Tami Fitzgerald, the executive director of the North Carolina Values Coalition, said the transgender decision indicated that the Scouts “have diverged greatly from their founding principles. ” Ms. Fitzgerald, who said her brother was an Eagle Scout, said the Values Coalition was now encouraging families to consider alternatives to the Boy Scouts. Such conservative alternatives already exist. After the decision to allow gay members, John Stemberger, a former scoutmaster, pulled his sons out of the Boy Scouts and helped start a new program called Trail Life USA. Mr. Stemberger said Trail Life, which he described as a “distinctly Christian scouting organization,” was active in all but a few states with nearly 30, 000 members, a tiny fraction of the roughly 2. 3 million youths enrolled in Boy Scout programs. Mr. Stemberger said he expected that the decision on transgender youths might prompt more families to enroll their sons in Trail Life. He said that the Boy Scouts’ transgender policy seemed inevitable given the change on gay membership, but that he was surprised by how quickly it came about. “They are basically doing what gay activists want them to do because they lack the courage to defend their own tradition and their own Scout Oath and their own Scout Law,” Mr. Stemberger said. Despite disenchantment from many on the right, the Boy Scouts have reported less pronounced membership declines in recent years. The Roman Catholic and Mormon churches, which collectively sponsor a large percentage of Scout units, have not left in overwhelming numbers, as some feared, and campouts, service projects and pinewood derbies have continued. Whether allowing transgender boys to join will lead to significant departures remains unclear. Representatives of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Lutheran   Synod did not respond to requests for comment about the policy. The Mormon Church said in a statement that its leaders were studying the announcement. But in some places, reaction was pointed and critical. A statement from the Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis referred to transgender boys as “girls struggling with gender dysphoria,” said Boy Scout policies were “becoming increasingly incompatible with our Catholic values” and expressed hope that the Scouts would “recognize their error. ”"

Over the weekend Dr. Roger Pielke Junior let it be known on his Twitter feed that he’s had it up to his “keester” with certain climate activists, especially the ones that are harassing a former associate of his, simply because that person IS a former associate.
It’s pretty ugly and it underscores how climate zealotry has gotten out of control. I myself have been at the receiving end of some of this to the point where I have had to increase security at my home and at my business. 
I’ve also had to increase my personal security due to the fact that on occasion, due to the fact that I’m a well known local person and recognizable due to my exposure on radio and television, I am occasionally accosted in public over my stance on climate. But my issues pale in comparison to what Dr. Pielke writes of.


I learned this weekend of a senior climate scientist harassing one of my former students – just because of that fact. WTF?
— Roger Pielke Jr. (@RogerPielkeJr) June 29, 2014



Climate zealots working to damage my professional career is one thing. Going after early career folks associated w/ me is pretty disgusting.
— Roger Pielke Jr. (@RogerPielkeJr) June 29, 2014

And this is what I consider to be the quote of the week:


I work w/ lots of climate scientists who are decent, hard working & brilliant. But there's a few who are completely obsessed and malicious.
— Roger Pielke Jr. (@RogerPielkeJr) June 29, 2014

When I think of “obsessed and malicious” in the context of “climate scientists”, this image immediately sprang to mind. This was from AGU 2013, where a session about “climate scientists under attack” was mainly just a big whiny gripe about FOIA requests.
L-R Naomi Oreskes, Jeff Ruch (PEER), Kevin Trenberth, Michael Mann, Andrew Dessler, Ben Santer. Photo taken at AGU Fall meeting, 2013 by Anthony Watts
The irony of this photo is that one of the people on that panel has been launching lawsuits against climate skeptics, yet I don’t know of a single climate skeptic that has launched a lawsuit against any climate scientist, other than a countersuit to force the issue into court, rather than let it be drug out for years as some sort of slow motion financial punishment.
The other irony was that sitting in the front row listening to how these folks tell their stories of how they have been so “horribly abused” by climate skeptics questioning their science,  the “climate antichrist” (me) sat there quietly and listened, not disrupting, being careful not to appear threatening in any way. I asked no questions, and left the meeting quietly.
In addition to the regular attacks that we get daily of climate skeptics just being stupid, paid for shills, etc. we occasionally get wild claims that climate skeptics should be put on trial, imprisoned, or even killed. There is also an undercurrent of climate ugliness that pervades in social media. I’m not talking about the obvious rants such as climate skeptics are shills for “big oil”, I’m talking about when unscrupulous people bring your family into it.
There’s just no excuse for this sort of stuff:

I have blurred out the name which happens to be the name of “Goddard’s” son. I’m not going to add to the damage by allowing the name here.
Thankfully, upon being challenged on this ugliness, Mr. Venema apologized and retracted his Tweet; he says it was a re-tweet, but even if it was, re-tweeting something so obviously ugly and stupid puts his motivation into question.
The whole episode is odd, because on one hand Mr. Venema is preaching for tolerance and restraint, and more civil scientific discourse, and then we have an “off the rails” moment like this coming from him.
We all have our moments where our judgment lapses, but this suggests to me that the inner id of some climate activist folks is saying that they know better than we do how to live our lives and raise our children, which is often more the characteristics of a religion, than a science.
Maybe this inner conflict is why some climate activists play dress up Nazis, though, it isn’t always so ugly, sometimes they dress up as superheroes.

"The UK could eliminate the majority of the carbon dioxide emissions from road freight by installing overhead charging cables for electric lorries on “e-highways” across the country, a report by government-funded academics suggests. The plan for a so-called electric road system would cost £19.3bn and put all but the most remote parts of the UK within reach of the trucks by the late 2030s, with the potential for the investment to pay for itself within 15 years, according to the report by the Centre for Sustainable Road Freight. The centre is backed by government research grants and industry partners including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and John Lewis. The catenary cables, powered by the national electricity grid, would link to lorries driving in the inside lanes on 4,300 miles (7,000km) of UK roads through an extendable rig known as a pantograph – similar to those on the top of electric trains. The electricity would power the lorry’s electric motor, as well as recharging an onboard electric battery that would power them to their destinations beyond the electrified roads. The engineering company Siemens and the lorrymaker Scania have already carried out extensive tests of e-highway electric road systems in Germany, Sweden and the US. Officials from the UK’s Department for Transport were scheduled to visit the test sites in Germany in March, but the trip was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The road freight sector is a large contributor to the climate crisis, accounting for 5% of the UK’s carbon dioxide emissions in 2018, according to government figures, as well as pollutants from diesel engines that harm human health. Road transport was the sector with the largest increase in global greenhouse gas emissions over the last decade, according to the Committee on Climate Change, which recommended on-road charging for lorries in its latest report to parliament. Battery-powered electric lorries and vans are already viable options for the short-range deliveries in urban areas that make up about a third of road freight usage. However, the other two-thirds – long-haul deliveries by lorries – are difficult to decarbonise because of range and weight requirements. The lithium ion batteries used in electric cars do not currently have a high enough energy density to be viable for long-distance haulage, meaning trucks such as Tesla’s planned Semi could require tonnes of batteries, denting their efficiency and raising their cost. In contrast, a lorry fitted for electric roads would only require a battery of similar size to an existing Tesla car to be able to cover the vast majority of the UK, according to David Cebon, a professor of mechanical engineering at Cambridge University who co-authored the study. Multiple lorrymakers are developing lorries running on hydrogen fuel cells, but the authors of the study argue that “green” hydrogen trucks would use three times more energy than an electric road system. This is because energy is lost at every conversion: using solar energy to make hydrogen and then a fuel cell to generate electricity again. The electric road system would also have a major advantage over alternatives in that it would be possible to tax the electricity used by lorries, enabling the government to easily replace revenues lost from taxing diesel fuel, the report said. “If you have an inefficient energy system, you build fundamental inefficiencies into your economy, which puts the country at a competitive disadvantage,” said Cebon. “You create efficiencies [by using the ERS] that give you financial headroom. The government can generate tax revenues through this scheme because it is efficient.” The report suggests that a first phase of building work on the busiest roads could take two years, costing £5.6bn. However, electrifying those most popular routes alone would cover almost a third of the miles travelled by heavy goods vehicles in the UK. Later stages would bring the total cost to £19.3bn. Lower energy costs are predicted to pay back vehicle operators for the investment in new vehicles within 18 months, while electrification infrastructure could pay back its investors – either government or private – within 15 years, the report said."

Boris Johnson famously wants to “unleash Britain’s potential.” But where economic growth is concerned, the Bank of England thinks the problem is too little potential in the first place.



Last week, it revised down “potential output growth” for the next three years, from 1.4 per cent to 1.1 per cent per year, implying less capacity for growth without overheating. That’s a stark contrast with the historic 2.8 per cent growth rate that Sajid Javid aspires a return to.



Potential growth is calculated by making judgments on potential additional hours worked economy‐​wide and on potential labour productivity growth (i.e. improvements in output per hour worked). On both, the Bank’s judgment is grisly.



With unemployment low, employment high, and EU immigration slower, the Bank revised down growth attainable by simply adding people or hours. More worryingly, it has given up expecting a productivity growth rebound, instead judging our post‐​crash performance a kind of “new normal.” For 2020–23, it expects productivity growth of 0.5 percent per year; far below the 2.2 per cent per year seen pre‐​crash or even the above one per cent forecast last year.



If this seems dry and arcane, the implications are not. If accurate, worse potential growth driven by weak productivity means less robust improvements in living standards, a worse “structural” budget deficit, and macroeconomic “stimulus” becoming more impotent. Indeed, trying to “boost the economy” through Government spending or monetary stimulus would more likely just generate inflation.



As Javid prepares for his March Budget then, the Bank’s verdict should trouble him. Last March, the Office for Budget Responsibility itself forecast potential growth at 1.5 per cent for 2020, rising to 1.6 per cent through 2023. But that assumed productivity growth jumping to 1.3 per cent per year. If the OBR now agrees that 0.5 per cent is likelier, Budget day will bring terrible economic headlines.



Now we should not take the Bank’s judgment as gospel, of course. Economists understand less about “potential” than reporting suggests. Defining “capacity” for companies, let alone large economies, is hard. As Chris Dillow has written, in a world of intangible assets and digital technologies it’s not even clear what capacity means. What is Google’s “capacity”? The Bank may prove as unduly pessimistic as it recently was overoptimistic.



But that doesn’t make its intervention unimportant. Olivier Blanchard, Guido Lorenzoni and Jean Paul L’Huillier’s work suggests negative judgments from forecasters about potential growth can become self‐​fulling. If consumers and investors expect to be poorer, they might cut their cloth now. They find, internationally, that a 0.1 per cent downward revision to potential growth leads to a fall in consumption growth that year of anywhere between 0.4 and 0.7 per cent. Just what the Chancellor needs.



Few can deny too the problem that the Bank’s revised judgment reflects. As years since the financial crisis roll by, it becomes ever easier to conclude that Britain is in a productivity growth slump with no sign of returning to pre‐​crash trends. The question really is: does the government intend to do anything meaningful about it?



It feels tired to posit this question. Commentators like me having been making the case for trying to raise the potential growth rate since 2010, to little avail. Partly this reflects a helplessness from policymakers in the face of trends beyond their control; partly it’s disagreements about what pro‐​growth policy is.



So let’s recognise uncomfortable truths upfront. Yes, slower growth across countries since the crash suggests something about the bank crisis or the unsustainability of what went before has impaired growth. Yes, an ageing population is another headwind. And, yes, Brexit has slowed growth to date, though how much due to pure “uncertainty” chilling investment, as opposed to negative expectations about future trade policy, is unclear.



But acknowledging all this shouldn’t induce fatalism. In fact, it strengthens the imperative for other pro‐​growth policies in recompense. We shouldn’t just treat the economy’s weak potential as a fait accompli — an unwelcome external force that affects budgets. No, given its importance, we should see weak growth as a failure of collective current policy. At the very least, sustained poor growth gives reason to review programmes tolerable in “good times” that we suspect come with a growth trade‐​off.



Is the government really prioritising growth today? Javid’s ambition is commendable, but actions must follow words. Prioritising something means willingness to accept trade‐​offs in its pursuit. Yet last week, ministers were asked to consider cutting programmes that didn’t fulfil the Government’s stated priorities — tackling crime, funding the NHS, or “levelling up” regions. Growth got no mention. Indeed, if growth is a priority, why not ask “does this programme improve the economy’s potential?”



Often, it seems that the Government thinks talking about any economic policy is synonymous with being pro‐​growth. But, listening to recent announcements, it’s difficult to conclude that rapid growth is a guiding star.



True, in some areas people like me just disagree with them on what might boost growth — little surprise given how contentious the literature is. Dominic Cummings thinks a British ARPA will generate loads of spillovers from public science and R&D spending. Javid thinks a further education skills push will raise human capital in the long‐​term. The whole government seems sold on regional infrastructure being transformative (Japan through the 1990s colours me sceptical). We can debate this, while recognising that government noises on planning have been well‐​evidenced and unambiguously pro‐​growth.



In other areas though, growth is clearly a secondary concern, at best. No coherent tax reform agenda appears likely, and Ministers are prioritising a broad‐​based National Insurance cut that will do little for potential growth. Boris Johnson talks up the benefits of using regulation to strengthen environmental outcomes and worker protection; there’s little mention of growth trade‐​offs here, or a pro‐​growth review of repatriated EU laws.



Though Johnson laments mercantilists and tariffs, last week his government briefed on using them to encourage countries to make trade deals with it — an approach that has seen Donald Trump cripple U.S. manufacturing productivity by raising its input prices. Public service reform ideas seem non‐​existent. The minimum wage keeps being raised. On infrastructure, HS2 is being prioritised over schemes with bigger estimated economic bang for the pound. And whatever your view of climate change, it’s undeniable that rapid decarbonisation impairs an economy’s growth potential, despite fairytales of win‐​win “green growth.”



Now, setting all dials to maximise growth is neither easy nor politically viable. Governments, understandably, have other aims and electoral mandates. But given its central importance — not least how it can make all other challenges easier — it still gets insufficient attention. With the government’s healthy majority, anti‐​growth headwinds, and leaving the EU, there’s surely never been a more necessary or better time to act on the Bank’s warning and try to see what sticks.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCanadian climate scientist Dr. Tim Ball recently published a new book on climate science: The Deliberate Corruption of Climate Science. What follows later (below) is a short interview with Dr. Ball.
“Government propaganda” …”corrupt science” 
In the book Ball writes that the failed predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), coupled with failed alarmist stories such as the complete loss of Arctic sea ice by 2013, are making the public increasingly skeptical of government propaganda about global warming. People were already skeptical because they knew weather forecasts, especially beyond forty-eight hours, were invariably wrong, and so today more people understand there is no substance to global warming claims and that it is based on corrupt science. Now they are asking: Who perpetrated the deception and could a small group of people deceive the world?
In his book The Deliberate Corruption of Climate Science” Dr. Ball explains who did it and why.
Ball was among the earlier dissidents and as a result he became the target of media articles and false information promoted by a scurrilous website funded by a chairman of a large environmental foundation. He was a real threat because they couldn’t say he wasn’t qualified.
Dr. Ball has been the subject of three lawsuits from a lawyer operating in British Columbia. For the first one, he decided to avoid the expense of a challenge and so he withdrew what he had written. Then, within nine days, he received two more from the same lawyer suing for defamation because of harsh criticism he made of a climate scientist. At that point, he and his family decided they had to fight back.
As Ball carries on his legal battle he maintains that climate deception continues and that the public is paying a high price for completely unnecessary energy and economic policies based on the pseudoscience of the IPCC. Not to mention the social devastation of communities devastated by job losses.
“Their last effective chance”
Dr. Balls say the rhetoric and stream of misinformation increases as the perpetrators, now including the Pope, build up to their last effective chance to influence an increasingly skeptical world. When the Global Warming theme failed, they tried Climate Change. The Climate Change theme has failed, so now they are trying Climate Disruption as defined by President Obama’s science Czar, John Holdren—all to justify expensive government programs. The impetus for a global carbon tax and global governance represent the central theme of a climate conference scheduled for Paris in December 2015, the United Nations Climate Change Conference or COP21.
INTERVIEW
What follows are some questions that Dr. Ball kindly answered:
What scientific reason do you think CO2’s role is far less?
Water vapor is 95% of the total greenhouse gases by volume, while CO2 is approximately 4%. The human portion is only 3.4% of the total CO2. They try to claim CO2 is more effective, but it’s a false claim called “climate sensitivity”. The number the IPCC use for sensitivity has constantly declined and will reach zero.

What factor has been the most responsible for the warming over the past 25 years?
The same factor as it has always been, changes in the sun. The IPCC dismiss the sun because they only look at variation in radiative output, but that is only one of three ways the Sun affects global climate.
What do you think the global temperature will do over the next few decades?
Decline. The major short-term control of global temperature is variation in the strength of the Sun’s magnetic field. As it varies it determines the amount of cosmic radiation reaching the Earth. The cosmic radiation creates cloud in the lower atmosphere and it, like a shutter in the greenhouse it determines the sunlight reaching the surface and therefore the temperature.
What do you think of the claimed “97% consensus”?
It is completely false and was deliberately manufactured by John Cook at the University of Queensland. There are more detailed analyses of the corruption but this is the best layman’s account. www.forbes.com/sites/alexepstein/.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how honest have the major climate institutes been with the public?
-10. If they knew what was wrong it is deliberate and criminal. If they didn’t know they are grossly incompetent. 
Other comments by Dr. Ball:
The biggest problem for the public is they can’t believe that an apparent majority of scientists seem to support the IPCC science. The simple answer is, very few are familiar with the science. They, like most of the public, assume other scientists would not distort, manipulate, or do anything other than proper science. When scientists find out, they are shocked, as exemplified in German meteorologist Klaus-Eckert Puls’s comment:
“Ten years ago I simply parroted what the IPCC told us. One day I started checking the facts and data—first I started with a sense of doubt but then I became outraged when I discovered that much of what the IPCC and the media were telling us was sheer nonsense and was not even supported by any scientific facts and measurements. To this day I still feel shame that as a scientist I made presentations of their science without first checking it.”

"Doomsayers and hopemongers alike may need to revise their climate predictions after a study that almost rules out the most optimistic forecasts for global heating while downplaying the likelihood of worst-case scenarios. The international team of scientists involved in the research say they have narrowed the range of probable climate outcomes, which reduces the uncertainty that has long plagued public debate about this field. Their increased confidence about the sensitivity of the climate should ease the job of policymakers and diminish the scope for scepticism but it is far from reassuring for the future of the planet. “The main message is that unfortunately we can’t expect that luck will save us from climate change,” Reto Knutti, professor of climate physics at ETH Zurich’s Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science. “The good thing is that we’ve somewhat narrowed the range of future long-term warming, the bad thing is that we can no longer hope or claim that the problem will just magically go away.” Until now, the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change has estimated a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide from its pre-industrial level of about 280 parts per million has a 66% chance of heating the planet by between 1.5C to 4.5C. In May, atmospheric CO2 reached 417ppm, and is rising by about 2.5ppm per year. Optimists could seize on the lower number to say no action was necessary. Pessimists could point to the higher figure to warn apocalypse was nigh. The study, published in Reviews of Geophysics, shrinks that 66%-likely range of climate sensitivity to between 2.6C and 3.9C, or slightly wider if more uncertainties are included. This smaller band is still dangerously high, which means there is no room for complacency, but the most dire predictions are now considered less probable. “It is moderately good news. It reduces the likelihood of some of the catastrophically high estimates. If we were planning for the worst, the worst has become less likely,” said one of the authors, Zeke Hausfather, of the Energy and Resources Group at University of California Berkeley. “But fundamentally, it means we must do more to limit climate change. We are not anywhere near on track to do that.” Climate sensitivity measures the susceptibility of Earth’s climate to human influence. It has been considered the holy grail of climate science since the first 1.5C to 4.5C estimate in 1979. Numerous papers have been published on the subject, but that range has barely changed until now. The latest, more precise study is likely to be the most influential yet because it is written by more than a dozen experts and draws upon the widest range of evidence, including observed physical processes, historical climate data, and records from the ice age. The lead author of the study, Prof Steve Sherwood of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, said understanding the potential range of climate sensitivity was crucial. He said: “All the other impacts of climate change scale with climate sensitivity. The bigger the number is, the bigger the global temperature rise and the bigger all the other impacts.” Sherwood said the study had effectively ruled out climate sensitivity being below 2.5C, but the higher end of the temperature ranges were harder to be confident about. “If climate sensitivity is at the higher end, then you have almost lost any chance of meeting the Paris agreement and you would need to go into overdrive to avoid catastrophe.” Gabi Hegerl, a professor at the University of Edinburgh who has been involved in past studies of climate sensitivity, said the latest papers went further than any before in bringing together different sets of evidence. Some help to rule out higher estimates, others lower. “They tell us more together than they do individually. We can never completely eradicate uncertainty, but this is as rigorous as we can be,” she said. “Climate sensitivity is a theoretical concept but it narrows our decision space. What actually happens is up to our actions. In some way, I hope we never learn exactly who is right. I don’t want to go up to warming we expect from doubled CO2.” This confluence of sources has allowed scientists to estimate with a 90% level of probability that climate sensitivity is between 2.3C and 4.7C. The most likely level of climate sensitivity has nudged slightly above 3C. Hausfather says a figure below 2C is extremely unlikely. Above 5C remains possible, though the study lowers that likelihood to 10%. Earlier this year, a handful of climate models, including some of the world’s most advanced, suggested climate sensitivity could be above 5C, prompting alarm. These high figures were not included in the this week’s study, but many climate scientists regard the recent higher numbers as outliers that should not be taken out of the broader context. “Don’t panic!”, Gavin Schmidt, the director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, tweeted earlier this year with a link to a blogpost that noted: “Claims that climate sensitivity is much higher, or that worst cases scenarios need to be revised upwards, are premature.“"
"BARCELONA, Spain  —   President Trump’s travel ban disrupted the plans of hundreds of people around the globe, but perhaps none more vulnerable than Sham Aldaher, a Syrian refugee girl, and her family. Sham, now 1½, was born without an eye and with a seriously disfigured face. Following two complex operations at a Barcelona hospital, Sham is due to receive an eye prosthesis next Wednesday. Her family had then planned to resettle in the United States. They had already completed the required interviews and cleared all security checks before the plans were blocked by  Mr. Trump’s  executive order to bar citizens from Syria and six other   countries seen as threatening to America’s safety. “They were   and they are now barred,” said Jayne Fleming, the head of the human rights team at Reed Smith, an American law firm that has been helping Sham and her family. Ms. Fleming and her team are now scrambling to see whether Britain, Germany or another country could instead welcome the family. “They’re distressed over not knowing what the future holds for them. ” The Aldahers’ story is a nomadic tragedy, telling of the accumulated hardships that have been piled on many Syrian refugees. It is also a small but striking example of the broader crisis highlighted in a United Nations report issued on Tuesday showing that the children most in need of emergency international assistance come from five of the seven countries covered by Mr. Trump’s order. Sham’s parents left Syria and their jobs as teachers in 2013. They traveled with their three children to Lebanon and then Egypt. But their arrival coincided with the unrest and military coup that removed Mohamed Morsi as Egypt’s president. “We left our home to find safety, but in Egypt there were bombings in the night and the children were very afraid,” said Ali Aldaher, Sham’s father. So the family packed up again to join thousands of other Syrian refugees in Jordan. Sham was born there in July 2015, on the day of the Muslim holiday of Eid  . The coincidence was seen as a blessing by her parents, but it complicated Sham’s birth, as most local hospital workers were on vacation and the family could not find a doctor. Even though a midwife eventually assisted in the birth, Sham’s mother “did not receive the health care she needed and I’m sure all the stress hurt,” Mr. Aldaher recounted. When Sham was born, her father tried to calm his wife by pretending Sham was keeping one eye shut, even though he could see that she had no eyelid and a misshaped face. “Before the birth of Sham, my worries were how would I support my family, without any work in Jordan and without money,” Mr. Aldaher said. “After she was born, we forgot about food, our problems, ourselves and even our other children to start our new journey of suffering for Sham, to see how we could possibly care for this child. ” Sham’s family received assistance from different nongovernmental organizations, including Doctors Without Borders. Lawyers from Reed Smith started searching for a hospital capable of undertaking such advanced surgery, while helping the family apply for resettlement in the United States. The lawyers then delayed the move to America because they could not simultaneously find an American hospital ready to treat Sham at no cost. Instead, the Sant Joan de Déu hospital in Barcelona agreed to help. Entering Spain, however, also proved a struggle. In June 2016, the Spanish government granted Sham’s family permission to travel to Barcelona, shortly after The New York Times published an article about the infant’s plight and Spain’s refusal to grant visas to the whole family. Even before Mr. Trump’s executive order to bar citizens of some countries from entering the United States, on security grounds, many European governments were dragging their feet in meeting their own commitments to welcome more refugees, following a European Union agreement reached in September 2015. By the end of 2016, about 900 refugees had resettled in Spain, out of the quota of 17, 377 agreed on by Spain’s government. Sham underwent two major facial surgeries in Barcelona. In August, doctors reset her facial bones, also to make room for an eye orbit. In December, they fissured her skin into an eyelid and implanted fat taken from Sham’s bottom into the artificial orbit, which was then   with a curved plastic shell. Sham is due to receive her eye prosthesis next Wednesday. Dr. Joan Prat, the chief ophthalmologist at the Sant Joan de Déu hospital, said he used a unique technique to “invent a cavity from zero. ” The eye surgery was not only difficult but also urgent, because Sham’s face will soon reach a level of development that would make the disfigurement permanent. “Either we did something now or it was game over,” Dr. Prat said. The kind of disorder suffered by Sham, known as anophthalmia, occurs “only every few years,” he added. The surgery was a success, but Dr. Prat said Sham should remain under close monitoring, not only because of her face but also because of other health concerns, including her failure to put on weight. Further surgery will be required to correct facial asymmetries as she grows, while her eye prothesis will also need replacement. Sham and her family were granted residency in Spain until late December. They have been housed in a   apartment, a stone’s throw from the Sagrada Família, Barcelona’s emblematic basilica. Ms. Fleming said that the family wanted to live in the United States in large part because Sham could get excellent   medical care there. She acknowledged that the family was now concerned about a backlash against Muslims in America and that “they are distressed by rhetoric that brands them as terrorists. ” In Barcelona, Sham’s family has received support from the city, as well as Caritas and other nongovernmental organizations. Sham’s siblings have joined a local school. On a bookshelf, the family keeps a small Quran that is among the few items that traveled with them from Syria. A prayer mat is also pinned to the wall, but the family normally goes to a Barcelona mosque for Friday Prayer. When the girl was born, her mother gave her an ancient name for Syria, Sham. Wherever the family finally ends up living, she said, “one day Sham will ask me what is the meaning of her name and I will at least be able to tell her that it is your country, it is Syria. ”"

According to Enrique Krauze, Mexico’s prominent classical‐​liberal intellectual, new “winds of authoritarianism” are sweeping across Latin America, characterized by all‐​mighty __caudillo_ s_ who ascend to political power via democratic means, but who then seek to concentrate control over a tightly knit polity of order and moral virtue.



Mexico is beginning to stand out as a prospective victim of this rising tide of illiberal populism. Andrés Manuel López Obrador (popularly known by his initials, AMLO) won a landslide electoral victory on July 1, 2018, and assumed the presidency of Mexico on December 1, 2018. From the outset, while still president‐​elect, López Obrador launched a crusade against “the long neoliberal nightmare” that, by his account, had left the country in ruin. Instead, he has promised a “Fourth Transformation,” (according to López Obrador, the first three transformations are the Independence of 1810; the Reform of 1861, which achieved the separation of church and state; and the Revolution of 1910), which he defines as a revolutionary movement to wipe out all corruption, erase income disparities, and secure national self‐​sufficiency.



So far, López Obrador’s own wind of authoritarianism reflects an adherence to toxic policy proposals, a disdain for independent checks and balances, and an intolerance to any view that is inconsistent with his preconceived notion of a virtuous society. Mexico is on the brink of a recession, with less than 1 percent growth expected for 2019, along with a slew of credit downgrades and a sudden stop of productive investment. Carlos Urzúa, López Obrador’s first minister of finance, tendered his resignation just seven months after assuming the post. His rationale: López Obrador was making policy decisions based on whim and patronage, oblivious to cost‐​benefit analysis. Urzúa was, predictably, branded as a neo‐​liberal traitor.



But Urzúa arguably understated his assessment. López Obrador’s decisionmaking process represents a dangerous admixture of ignorance, intolerance, and resentment. This rhetoric heralds the possible resurgence of a hegemonic regime, much like the “perfect dictatorship” that enabled the old Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) to remain in power for more than seven decades in the 20th century. The hallmarks of this system are using handouts to forge constituencies, making cozy arrangements with special interests, and reorganizing the federal bureaucracy with civil servants whose loyalty to the leader is all that counts. In short, López Obrador is confirming the worst fears of mainstream wisdom: that he is more akin to the irrational populism of Hugo Chávez than he is to more moderate progressive left‐​wing governments.



He still commands a 65 percent approval rating. There is no dispute on the reasons his Movimiento Regeneración Nacional (Morena) party won an overwhelming triumph in 2018. The party clearly benefited electorally from the unstoppable wave of violence; cases of corruption, cronyism, and impunity; and the chronically mediocre growth rates that saddled Enrique Peña Nieto’s administration with the lowest approval rating in Mexico’s modern history. López Obrador was able to position himself as savior, promising to bring a swift end to corruption and corporatism. In the words of Francis Fukuyama, he was able to exploit the “politics of resentment” among angry citizens exhausted by perceived injustices imposed by an uncaring elite. He embellished his case by promising to restore popular dignity via a “moral constitution.”



Under the López Obrador paradigm, the authentic role of government is to allocate funds to targeted social groups, not to create the conditions for greater investment. The program of distributing direct handouts (almost $10 billion) constitutes vintage clientelism. As Mexican author Jesús Silva Herzog warns, behind the facade of “fiscal austerity … lies an autocratic conviction of patrimonialism,” where federal funds are shifted and redirected as if they were the sole property of the ruler in charge.



The fundamental challenge facing Mexico is whether López Obrador will wield the Fourth Transformation to deconstruct many hard‐​won market reforms that took place in the past quarter century. These include multilateral trade liberalization, the slow (if erratic) development of checks and balances, the advent of monetary stability under a regime of central bank independence, and the crucially important achievement in energy liberalization (the 2014 reform that opened the energy sector to private investment in all areas of the productive chain).



 **Vox Populi**



López Obrador has decreed the use of “popular consultations,” or referendums, to decide the outcome of major initiatives. These have included halting the construction of the new airport in Mexico City and a new oil refinery in his home state of Tabasco. The referendums that have taken place so far are a sham: they are based on less than 1 percent of registered voters, are predominantly in areas controlled by Morena, and are framed with questions embodying a flagrant bias toward the result López Obrador wants. This strategy has enabled him to conflate his own personal popularity with policy decisions purportedly legitimized by popular mandate. The real outcomes have dealt a serious blow to investment confidence and lend credence to the view that policy is being made in a mix of ignorance, intolerance, and resentment:



The obsession to base policy decision‐​making on ideology, rather than cost‐​benefit criteria, reflects López Obrador’s contempt for modern technocrats. As his National Development Plan states, the Fourth Transformation seeks a “paradigm shift where planning now emanates from the will of the people, instead of dictates imposed by the Washington consensus.”



A classical liberal may share the disdain for preconceived solutions imposed from the lofty reaches of the International Monetary Fund, Davos, or the latest fashion in mainstream thought. But López Obrador has simply substituted one conceit for another — the messianic leader who knows better, the paterfamilias who will take care of his lot in accordance with a preconceived notion of social virtue. López Obrador has proudly announced the “end of the neo‐​liberal nightmare.” A consequence of this way of rigging the debate is that anyone who questions the will of the leader is declared an agent of “theft, against the national interest, and anti‐​popular.” Not surprisingly, public discourse and debate have suffered an acute polarization.



 **Checks and Balances**



In 2006, López Obrador famously denounced electoral tribunals for stealing presidential elections and declared “to hell with institutions.” This ominous threat has now turned into a full‐​scale onslaught against Mexico’s checks and balances, including nascent autonomous institutions, such as energy regulatory agencies, the federal electoral institute, and even the Supreme Court. Naturally, media and freedom of expression have become recurrent targets of scorn and denunciation.



The practice of demonizing opposition has even been applied to banks and multilateral agencies. These organizations predict a sharp slowdown of economic growth due to negative signals in investor confidence. López Obrador rejects such revisions and insists that Mexico will reach 2 percent growth in 2019 and 4 percent by the end of his six‐​year term. Why? No evidence is offered, beyond his claims that outside methodologies are flawed, and that “yo tengo otros datos” (I have other facts). At other times, he has changed the terms of the debate, saying that growth is a statistical obsession of neoliberal technocrats and that what matters instead is wealth redistribution because “our final goal is to make people happier.” López Obrador seems to take reality as a personal insult. He has demanded apologies from the International Monetary Fund, the Financial Times, and even the king of Spain, arguing that none have the moral authority to issue judgments about Mexico’s development. One Morena legislator even suggested expelling Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s from the country.



An important aspect of the destruction of checks and balances is that López Obrador could be tempted to do the same with monetary policy — and thereby undermine the very idea of independent central banks. The independence of the Banco de México is one of the country’s most successful reforms of the past quarter century. It laid the basis for a transition from a scenario characterized by runaway inflation and sharp exchange rate volatility to a climate of stability. In the pre‐​stability era, Mexicans were required to take steps to avoid the erosion of their purchasing power, usually by shifting earnings to dollars, or by using durable goods as a store of value. Now, concerns about exchange‐​rate shifts or spikes in inflation are secondary. The assessment of risk focuses on real cost reduction, market competitiveness, and mitigation of high transaction costs (e.g., overregulation, security, contract enforcement, and the like). The new climate of stability allowed for the emergence of long‐​term mortgage markets, as well as placement of private debt at lower rates and longer terms — in local denominations.



The loss of this hard‐​won transformation would be catastrophic. But this cannot be ruled out. López Obrador has, thus far, respected central bank autonomy (even while he has pushed for reduction of interest rates) and he is sensitive to sharp variations in the exchange rate. This is encouraging, but the onslaught against autonomous institutions cuts against extending the benefit of the doubt to him.



 **An Uncertain Future**



In theory, risk aversion should act as a deterrent against poor public policy choices. Mexico’s main economic driver, along with monetary stability, is foreign trade; a quarter century of aggressive trade liberalization has generated tightly integrated supply chains, a diversification of exports, and massive growth of Mexico’s external sector. Although its success remains intimately tied to the North American cycle, the diversification of tradable goods has reduced the risk of overreliance on natural resources. The vast majority of exports (87 percent) are destined to the U.S. market. In addition, Mexican consumers spend a great deal on imports: more than $400 billion per annum, 90 percent of which originate from the United States.



Mexico’s extensive trade relationships suggest that the economy will follow the course of a globally integrated economy. And the López Obrador government supports the revised United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA), which has already been ratified by Mexico’s Senate. This, too, is a positive outcome.



However, failure to correct toxic policies means that Mexico’s economy will face the inexorable pain of market discipline. The cancellation of the new airport showed the investment world that the new president can do whatever he wants. Fear and uncertainty in the investment climate are a natural result of such caprices, and with it, the paralysis of productive investment and economic growth. To be sure, López Obrador could opt for a more pragmatic approach. But the aforementioned mix of intolerance, ignorance, and resentment suggests that the new government is unlikely to rethink unfortunate policy decisions that have undermined investor confidence. A reversal of the decision to cancel the new airport, with the stamp of the new regime, would go a significant way toward reestablishing credibility in the investment climate. So would the abandonment of a misplaced nostalgia for the false glory of oil nationalism, and with it, a revival of energy auctions to capital investment. López Obrador can take a more flexible policy stance without giving up his Fourth Transformation rhetoric.



For now, however, Mexico’s prospects for the near future are not encouraging. Despite visible progress during the past quarter century in areas including sound money and open trade, formidable challenges remain, particularly in such areas as public security and well‐​defined property rights. López Obrador’s chief of staff, Alfonso Romo, a prominent figure in the business community, continually (if unpersuasively) reassures investors that respect for property as a right of individuals constitutes a fundamental tenet of the Fourth Transformation. He asserts that this position is, in fact, inspired by the famous saying of López Obrador’s own hero, Benito Juárez — “el respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz” (respect for the rights of others is peace). Genuinely adopting this view would require a change in focus to securing the conditions for prosperity, especially in this era of trade integration and hyperrapid capital flows, and would mean market‐​oriented human capital formation and predictability in Mexico’s institutional arrangements.



This, however, presupposes a willingness to listen, and a tolerance to criticism. So far, López Obrador has managed to perfect intolerance into an artform. Octavio Paz, Mexico’s great 20th‐​century liberal, warned that government behaves more like a “philanthropic ogre,” often trampling its citizens, depending on the caprice of the day. And this is perhaps the most worrisome aspect of López Obrador’s leadership, beyond toxic policy decisions: the fatal conceit that only he has access to the “real” truth about the course of the country. This could transform the winds of authoritarianism into a typhoon, rendering an open society in Mexico a distant hope for tomorrow.

Sometimes, you just have to laugh. Doing a Google search for Michael E. Mann to find his CV to respond to this comment, I came across this odd presentation from Google. In it, Michael E. Mann gains hair, and I lose it. I blame “climate disruption” and the “Hair Club for Climatologists”. 

https://www.google.com/search?q=Michael+Mann+education&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&channel=sb
And in case you didn’t notice, the photos aren’t of Mann or myself at all. The silly mix-up is likely an artifact of other prominent people with the same names. At least it got the other guys right.

"When even Boris Johnson, the UK’s Conservative prime minister, interprets severe flooding as a probable consequence of climate change, it’s a sign that everyone is recognising that the weather is becoming weird. It’s hard not to – the recent UK floods were prompted when the average rainfall for the entire month of November fell in South Yorkshire and north Derbyshire in 24 hours.  The damage from the floods is still being assessed, but roads and rail lines were closed, people were stranded, hundreds of properties were inundated, and one woman lost her life. With the promise of more periods of intense rainfall in years to come, what needs to be done to protect communities from more flooding in future? Johnson stressed that the UK government is already investing in more flood defences. But while such investment is undoubtedly needed, it should not solely be directed to flood defence. Such strategies are focused on protecting high value property, and hence tend to neglect poorer communities. Flood defences – flood walls, barriers, overflow flood channels, and the like – protect particular localities against rising flood waters. As residents from Doncaster rightly argued in relation to new defences in Sheffield, flood defences protect one location by channelling water and flow towards another.   So while flood defences are important and useful for protecting the assets we value most, it is important to consider their wider consequences. A comprehensive approach to flood risk involves a different form of investment – focusing on slowing the flow and protecting at-risk properties from water.  Whereas flood defence will only help particular communities, investments that reduce the extent of flooding by slowing the flow can help everyone downstream. Over the past ten years, huge changes have been made in relation to the understanding and use of natural flood management. In the past we have tended to regard uplands as wasted land, in need of drainage so that they can be used for agriculture, for example. But uplands are now recognised to have an important function in holding the water back.   Drainage ditches and other features enabling agricultural use can be removed and replaced by small dams and other natural flood risk management measures to enrich our naturally wet upland ecosystems and to slow the flow. But for now, this is only happening in select few places and needs to be more widespread. And by re-wetting uplands we also increase the extent of peatlands, hence helping carbon storage too. It is also important to slow the flow in urban areas. Councils are increasingly recognising that they can use parts of parks to do so. Sections of road or pavement can also be reclaimed for flood storage, and sometimes for infiltrating flood waters to the ground. Of course, this means that land currently used in one way must be partially or completely given up for other uses – a football field might be sacrificed for occasional flood storage; parking spots lost for a new rain garden.  We can also make private choices that help to slow the flow. Is your roof water channelled into a rain-barrel, for example, and does this overflow into a wet part of your garden, or into the sewer? Though no single householder can make a big difference to the total flow, all householders acting together can make a difference. There are many beneficiaries of such changes – councils, water companies who treat the sewage and downstream residents. But at present it is nobody’s responsibility to look at these benefits together and incentivise changes to water management on private land.  As the climate changes it is going to be even harder to avoid floods, so it’s also crucial that those who live in flood-prone places prepare. There is often great demand for local councils to supply sandbags at times of flooding, but sandbags are actually relatively ineffective compared to flood gates and other simple flood resilience measures that can be crucial in protecting homes from small floods. Careful interior design also reduces the harm caused by floods. Plug sockets can be placed halfway up the wall, for example, and it can be ensured that ground floors are made of materials that easily washed down, such as concrete or tiles, rather than fitted carpets or wood that will need to be thrown out. People living in locations at risk of flooding should also sign up for flood warnings, and each household should have a flood plan – a clear idea about what needs to done if there is a flood warning and limited time available to protect your family and your possessions. One of the difficulties of making these changes happen is that it means a new sort of water management, concerned not only with managing water but also partnering with the public. Engineers who predict floods and build defences are still needed, but to stimulate change in the practices of landowners, businesses and households, new listening, communication and coordination skills are paramount. It’s not yet clear how society can be stimulated to better manage flooding, and councils, water companies and the Environment Agency need to invest in new skills to lead this process of learning.    In order to help such collaboration, my team is currently undertaking research to look at how mobilisation in relation to water is organised. Of course, all of this is will be of limited comfort to the poor people of Fishlake and other Yorkshire towns returning to their flood-ravaged homes. Flood vulnerable locations are often occupied by less wealthy members of our society. Evidence from Hull and other locations flooded in 2007 indicate that it will take many months if not years for people’s lives to return to normal, and that for some, the floods will take a significant toll on their mental and physical health.   The flood authorities cannot promise to protect everyone from flooding. But the recent floods make it crystal clear that more must be done to address flood risks, both by improving natural flood defences and slowing the flow, and by catalysing and supporting everyone in flood risk zones to protect their homes. Because Johnson is right in saying that such floods will only become more common, and the government’s current approach simply isn’t good enough. This article was edited on November 12 to clarify the relationship between flood defences and wealth."

Guest essay by Dr. Tim Ball
“Liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people, who have a right, from the frame of their nature, to knowledge, as their great Creator, who does nothing in vain, has given them understandings, and a desire to know; but besides this, they have a right, an indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge; I mean, of the characters and conduct of their rulers.” — John Adams, Dissertation on Canon and Feudal Law, 1765
The 2001 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report included evidence in the form of a “hockey stick” graph, showing that the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) did not exist. Less prominent, but just as wrong, was erasure of the Little Ice Age (LIA). Proponents of the IPCC hypothesis that human CO2 is causing global warming were mainly connected with the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia. Leaked CRU emails, beginning with 1000 in late 2009, exposed the corruption of climate science of the IPCC. CRU people controlled critical portions of IPCC Working Group I. They set up procedures to control the peer-review process, control data, and attack any who challenged, especially if it was with contradictory evidence.

This was necessary because they deliberately thwarted the scientific method by presenting an hypothesis and blocking normal and essential skepticism. They determined to prove rather than disprove the hypothesis. As Richard Lindzen correctly observed decades ago, the consensus was reached before the research had even begun. Evidence emerged, despite their efforts, so they created pseudoscientific vehicles to counterattack.
One vehicle was William Connolley’s control of over 500 Wikipedia articles.
Connolley took control of all things climate in the most used information source the world has ever known – Wikipedia. Starting in February 2003, just when opposition to the claims of the band members were beginning to gel, Connolley set to work on the Wikipedia site. He rewrote Wikipedia’s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug.11, the Medieval Warm Period.
The web site, RealClimate, was another major vehicle created by Michael Mann and Gavin Schmidt, who invented the name.
A group of scientists established themselves as the palace guard for the gang at the CRU. Mann and Schmidt led and quickly earned reputations for aggressive, assertive, replies to challenges. They saw them as threats rather than contributions. It was the attitude that if you are not with me you must be against me. On December 10, 2004 Schmidt set the tone when he wrote,
Colleagues, No doubt some of you share our frustration with the current state of media reporting on the climate change issue. Far too often we see agenda-driven “commentary” on the Internet and in the opinion columns of newspapers crowding out careful analysis. Many of us work hard on educating the public and journalists through lectures, interviews and letters to the editor, but this is often a thankless task. In order to be a little bit more pro-active, a group of us (see below) have recently got together to build a new ‘climate blog’ website: RealClimate.org which will be launched over the next few days:
It sounds innocent but was used in a very different manner. Schmidt’ phraseology is revealing.
The idea is that we working climate scientists should have a place where we can mount a rapid response to supposedly ‘bombshell’ papers that are doing the rounds and give more context to climate related stories or events.
The phrase “working climate scientists” was used frequently as a put down, such as by Andrew Weaver in his public attacks against me. Unless you are one, you have no credibility or right to an opinion. It reflected concern about the growing group of qualified, but older climate experts, speaking out about what the IPCC was doing. It was a deliberate attempt to marginalize.
What is a “bombshell” paper? Invariably, it was one that contradicted their claims. Normally, these were ones that showed current climate is well within natural variability and not linked to human activity. The fundamental objective of the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) hypothesis is to show human behavior and particularly industrial development is unnatural and creating unnatural changes. This illusion allows them to point to any natural event and imply it is unnatural. Skeptical evidence consistently showed it was not, but most people didn’t know, so, sadly, it was effective.
Examples of Spin
Temperature range in the Antarctic ice core record (Figure 1) is approximately 12°C and the three previous Interglacials were warmer than today. Both facts were effectively ignored by diverting attention to the apparent relationship with CO2. Within five years it was shown to be opposite to the assumption in the hypothesis because temperature changed before CO2.

Figure 1
The Holocene Optimum, formerly called the Hypsithermal and/or the Climatic Optimum, was a warm period during which most of ice from the last Ice Age phase melted. Several have written effectively about AGW claims for this period, including Steve McIntyre and. Anthony Watts. Michael Mann’s comment was an attempt to deflect the evidence.
This [Holocene Climatic Optimum] is a somewhat outdated term used to refer to a sub-interval of the Holocene period from 5000-7000 years ago during which it was once thought that the earth was warmer than today. We now know that conditions at this time were probably warmer than today, but only in summer and only in the extratropics of the Northern Hemisphere.
Mann is incorrect because most of the last 10,000 years was warmer than today as the Greenland ice core shows.

Figure 2; Composite PowerPoint slide. Source: The Author
Two indicators of the temperature range are the Greenland ice cores and the global sea level increase. Figure 2 is a slide linking R. B. Alley’s temperature plot with a photograph of a fossilized 4940-year-old White Pine located 100 km north of the current tree line. Graph temperature range is approximately 4°C.
Sea level rise is compiled in Figure 3 and shows most occurred between 15,000 and 7,000 years ago. It is not a sub-interval as Mann claims.

Figure 3
Determination to rewrite history and “prove” the claim that current climate is unnaturally warmer than ever, really became focused after the 1990 IPCC Report.
It contained the illustration 7 (c) that showed the MWP and the LIA (Figure 4) and contradicted the IPCC hypothesis.

Figure 4
My discussions with Lamb about the graph involved the beginning and ending points of both the MWP and the LIA. It was crucial because my period of study potentially covered the end of the MWP and the onset of the LIA. Those questions didn’t concern the IPCC because for them they didn’t exist. He said the graph was of temperatures for the Northern Hemisphere and the dotted line represented the average temperature of the 20th century. Lamb defined them by the dotted line on the graph, as the labeling indicates.
It was also in a region, central Canada, were transition was important because it covers the annual shift of the Circumpolar Vortex (CV). The average latitude changes in mid continent seasonally from approximately 30° to 65°, but these latitudes change as global climate changes. The latitude shift in the CV was captured in my analysis of wind directions, among other variables. This was included in my doctoral thesis (1982) and peer-reviewed papers.
Figure 5 shows changing percentages of southerly winds at York Factory for two decades: 1721 -31 was within the LIA and 1841 – 1851 apparently not.

Harington, National Museums of Canada, 1985, Vol. 55, pp. 219-229.
Fewer than 10 percent were southerly winds in the decade 1721 -1731 but they were more than 10 percent between 1841-1851.
The IPCC claimed the MWP and LIA did not exist. This allowed them to avoid the real issue, which is not whether the warmer and cooler periods occurred, but when they began and ended. That question requires an explanation of the mechanism of change. Consider the debate going on today about the changes in the Circumpolar Vortex. Saying they don’t exist eliminated the need to consider evidence of solar causes of changing CV latitude and the shift of patterns between Zonal and Meridional Flow. This, by default, narrows the focus on human production of CO2 as the cause of change.
A general synopsis of Lamb’s views on the MWP and LIA from our discussions is that they both occurred and were global. Dates of onset and termination varied, often significantly, depending on dominant factors in different regions. He identified land – water juxtapositions and topography as two major factors with these being of greater import in Polar Regions.
The IPCC set up a system to prove the anthropogenic global warming hypothesis. They created a false imagery, supposedly verified by computer models, orchestrated to produce predetermined results. They made valiant efforts to control the entire climate research area, from funding through peer review and publications. Despite these efforts, evidence kept emerging that disproved the hypothesis. Instead of accepting and accommodating, they set up agencies to counter and hopefully negate them. This paralleled their practice of changing names from global warming to climate change, when temperatures leveled after 1998, while CO2 continued to rise. They effectively blocked advances in climate research for 30 years. They had sufficient success to fool the world into unnecessary energy and economic policies that have cost billions so far and it is not over yet, as the Obama administration attacks on coal illustrate.

Robin Pittwood at the New Zealand Kiwi Thinker here has posted an update on the climate bet for charity that NoTricksZone and its readers entered with a gaggle of global warming cultists, among them Dana Nuccitelli and Rob Honeycutt.
So far we are 4.5 years into the current decade and Robin tells us that it is running cooler using RSS and UAH satellite data, which Messieurs Honeycutt and Nuccitelli agreed to use.

Awhile back in comic fashion devout anthropogenic global warming believer William Connelly even demanded the terms of the bet be changed. So clearly we see panic setting in.

At his latest July 18 Saturday Summary here, Joe Bastardi presented the latest NCEP global temperature chart for the past 10 years, and here more confirmation that the globe has cooled off a bit.

Image cropped from Weatherbell Analytics Saturday Summary.
It really is tough to find warming anywhere outside of models. Joe, as polite as he is, is unable to hold back his ridicule of the warming claims.
Of course this year is an El Niño year and so we are going to see the gap close somewhat, or perhaps even see the current decade become a bit warmer than the last – for a little while. But as many readers here are familiar, cool La Niñas typically follow El Niños. Moreover the North Atlantic has turned cool and that will make the battle that much tougher for those betting on a warmer current decade.
Even if the warmists somehow did manage to pull it off, the trend would end up being far below what the models predicted and so it would be a very hollow victory that we could all live with.

"**In the last weekend of August, when Emma Heathcote-James had been looking forward to a relaxing bank-holiday break, she instead found herself fighting to save her company's reputation.**
She had just discovered the Instagram page for her beauty-product business, which she had spent 12 years building up, had been cloned.
""For some reason the scammers tagged me in one of the photos, which seems like it was probably a mistake,"" she says.
And this alerted her to the cloned page, where the only discernible difference from the legitimate Little Soap Co's page was an extra ""o"" at the end of the name.
As well as making a carbon copy of the page, the scammers were intent on making some money.
""The account went private and we discovered that they spent the entire evening on bank-holiday Monday contacting hundreds of our followers, who had entered our latest competition, saying they had won and asking for PayPal details,"" Emma says.
At least one of her customers responded but she does not know how many more were affected or who lost money.
And trying to persuade Instagram to remove the fake page proved frustrating.
""It was impossible to speak to a human at Instagram,"" Emma tells BBC News.
""They make it so hard.
""We couldn't log it as a business-impersonation account as the form to fill in takes you on a loop with nothing at the end, instead you are back to square one.
""It is like they don't want to be contacted.
""It sent me demented.""
Facebook owns Instagram.
And Emma finally told a person or a software bot - she is not sure which - on Facebook Messenger about what she regarded as trademark infringements.
""I got an email back saying it wasn't an infringement but that it breached the terms and conditions of the community guidelines,"" she says.
""And the account was taken down.""
But it was a ""cursory"" email, devoid of any personal touch.
""It was like Facebook was saying, 'Done - next,'"" Emma says.
By then the issue had also been logged with the police, who told Emma such cloning was ""rife"".
""We were very fortunate how speedily it was taken down,"" she says.
""But we had three of us working on it.
""Not all businesses have this resource.""
And she remains angry about the way it was dealt with.
""Every other digital platform we pay to use has good customer service, whereas Facebook, which is a good shop window for many businesses, is very different,"" Emma says.
""It feels like an iron fortress.
""It's very hard to speak to anyone.
""And the chatbots aren't yet intelligent enough to help.""
Facebook told BBC News: ""We have removed the accounts brought to our attention for inauthentic behaviour.
""We're continuously investing in our teams and technology to identify and remove fraudulent activity, and have donated Â£3m to Citizens Advice to deliver a UK scam action programme, which spreads the word on how to avoid scams and offers support to people who have been affected.""
Every day, Facebook's detection technology blocks millions of attempts to create fake accounts.
But account cloning remains a problem for both Facebook and Instagram, with individuals targeted alongside businesses.
Twitter and LinkedIn have to tackle similar scams.
Cloning is remarkably easy to do.
In a blog, security specialist at anti-virus company ESET Jake Moore explains how he copied his own Instagram account in an afternoon - and, with a sob story about being locked out of his bank account as well as social media, persuaded one of his followers to send him money
He had the following advice:
Emma is certainly planning on keeping a very close eye on any suspicious activity around her brand and has since found another cloned account and two cloned versions of her personal Instagram page - all now removed.
""The whole thing is slightly sinister,"" she says"

=================================
The development of the Antarctic Sea ice before the satellite era in 1979
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning, Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
[Translated/edited by P Gosselin]
Antarctic sea ice has truly surprised science. Contradicting the models, it has continuously grown since 1979 during a time that the climate models were only able to find scenarios of receding ice.
Today we would like to take a look back before the satellite time. How did the South Pole develop during the time when satellites were unable to continuously and completely monitor sea ice movement?
Information can be gathered for example from old satellite photos made during the pioneering phases of satellites. On 29 August 2014 the University of Colorado Boulder reported on an amazing discovery of old Nimbus photos:
“And the Antarctic blew us away,” he said. In 1964, sea ice extent in the Antarctic was the largest ever recorded, according to Nimbus image analysis. Two years later, there was a record low for sea ice in the Antarctic, and in 1969 Nimbus imagery, sea ice appears to have reached its maximum extent earliest on record.”
In 1964 Antarctic sea ice was hugely expanded, while to the contrary in 1966 it retreated massively. And in 1969 the sea ice had returned once again close to record high levels. This is an enormous amount of natural variability.

A team of scientists led by Tingting Fan used the premise of growing sea ice since 1979 as a reason for investigating the climatic conditions in the southern ocean. Here scientists found that the oceans had cooled over the previous 35 years, which fits well with the notion of expanding sea ice. During the 1950-1978 period, on the other hand, the southern ocean warmed up. This was the basis for a long-term ice retreat during that phase. The paper appeared in the April 2014 Geophysical Research Letters. The abstract writes:
Recent Antarctic sea ice trends in the context of Southern Ocean surface climate variations since 1950
This study compares the distribution of surface climate trends over the Southern Ocean in austral summer between 1979–2011 and 1950–1978, using a wide variety of data sets including uninterpolated gridded marine archives, land station data, reanalysis, and satellite products. Apart from the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent regions, sea surface temperatures and surface air temperatures decreased during 1979–2011, consistent with the expansion of Antarctic sea ice. In contrast, the Southern Ocean and coastal Antarctica warmed during 1950–1978. Sea level pressure (SLP) and zonal wind trends provide additional evidence for a sign reversal between the two periods, with cooling (warming) accompanied by stronger (weaker) westerlies and lower (higher) SLP at polar latitudes in the early (late) period. Such physically consistent trends across a range of independently measured parameters provide robust evidence for multidecadal climate variability over the Southern Ocean and place the recent Antarctic sea ice trends into a broader context.”
Already in November 2013 a group led by Loïc Barbara published a reconstruction of the sea ice in the area of Antarctic Peninsula in the journal of Quaternary Science Reviews. Between 1935-1950 the ice receded, and after that there is no recognizable trend. Instead the sea ice fluctuated back and forth over years and decades. The paper’s abstract follows:
Diatoms and biomarkers evidence for major changes in sea ice conditions prior the instrumental period in Antarctic Peninsula
The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) has been identified as one of the most rapidly warming region on Earth. Satellite monitoring currently allows for a detailed understanding of the relationship between sea ice extent and duration and atmospheric and oceanic circulations in this region. However, our knowledge on ocean–ice–atmosphere interactions is still relatively poor for the period extending beyond the last 30 years. Here, we describe environmental conditions in Northwestern and Northeastern Antarctic Peninsula areas over the last century using diatom census counts and diatom specific biomarkers (HBIs) in two marine sediment multicores (MTC-38C and -18A, respectively). Diatom census counts and HBIs show abrupt changes between 1935 and 1950, marked by ocean warming and sea ice retreat in both sides of the AP. Since 1950, inferred environmental conditions do not provide evidence for any trend related to the recent warming but demonstrate a pronounced variability on pluri-annual to decadal time scale. We propose that multi-decadal sea ice variations over the last century are forced by the recent warming, while the annual-to-decadal variability is mainly governed by synoptic and regional wind fields in relation with the position and intensity of the atmospheric low-pressure trough around the AP. However, the positive shift of the SAM since the last two decades cannot explain the regional trend observed in this study, probably due to the effect of local processes on the response of our biological proxies.”
In May 2014 a team led by Kate Sinclair published a reconstruction of sea ice from the Ross Sea in the Geophysical Research Letters. Between 1880 and 1950 the ice was apparently stable. From 1950-1990 the ice receded, varied beginning in 1993, but took on an increasing trend, which continues today. The abstract:
Twentieth century sea-ice trends in the Ross Sea from a high-resolution, coastal ice-core record
We present the first proxy record of sea-ice area (SIA) in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, from a 130 year coastal ice-core record. High-resolution deuterium excess data show prevailing stable SIA from the 1880s until the 1950s, a 2–5% reduction from the mid-1950s to the early-1990s, and a 5% increase after 1993. Additional support for this reconstruction is derived from ice-core methanesulphonic acid concentrations and whaling records. While SIA has continued to decline around much of the West Antarctic coastline since the 1950s, concurrent with increasing air and ocean temperatures, the underlying trend is masked in the Ross Sea by a switch to positive SIA anomalies since the early-1990s. This increase is associated with a strengthening of southerly winds and the enhanced northward advection of sea ice.”
We conclude our look at the Antarctic sea ice with an anecdote that appeared in the December 2014 in the Geophysical Research Letters. In the paper authors Jeff Ridley and Helene Hewett claimed that the sea ice trend in the Anatarctic indeed would be irreversible as a result of climate warming. That would of course mean that the increase of the last 35 years would never be reversed. Yet, to the contrary, Arctic sea ice trends are supposed to be reversible. Apparently the authors are anticipating an increase in north polar sea ice. Absolutely curious. Here’s the abstract of the paper:
A mechanism for lack of sea ice reversibility in the Southern Ocean
We find evidence that ocean processes during global warming may result in irreversible changes to the Antarctic sea ice, whereas the Arctic sea ice changes appear to be reversible. Increased forcing gives rise to strong heat uptake in the Southern Ocean, and existing pathways provide an increased transport of heat to the Weddell Sea. As atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are returned to preindustrial levels, the Antarctic ice extent at first recovers, but a rapid change in the position of the an ocean front in the South Atlantic maintains the heat transport into the Weddell Sea. A cooling surface initiates deep convection, accessing the stored heat, resulting in a substantial loss of sea ice, which has not recovered after a further 150 years at preindustrial CO2.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpring in Germany arriving later and later every year. Also forsythia blossoms in Hamburg arriving later and later
By Josef Kowatsch und Stefan Kämpfe
[Translated/edited by P Gosselin]
This is an addendum to our earlier article on delayed spring blossoms here (and here at NTZ).
In our previous article linked above we showed that mean temperatures for the months of January, February and March have been cooling for almost the past three decades, this according to the German DWD National Weather Service. And this is the result without applying any urban heat island adjustments to the measured temperatures.
As a result we are seeing increasingly delayed spring starts – especially spring blossoms in open areas where the cooling is even more pronounced. We confirmed this with our own vegetation observations in the article, e.g. the blossoming of winter aconites out in the open.

Some readers from the over 100 comments left cast doubt on our observations, and pointed out that the official authorities such as the State Office for Environmental Protection in Karlsruhe or the DWD claimed the opposite was in fact occurring, i.e. spring was arriving earlier and earlier. However these readers failed to provide any measured data from these officials.

We took the time to look more deeply into the matter and found something astonishing. The State Environment Office in Karlsruhe itself does not even keep any such long-term observations. Instead it gets the results from the DWD. And the DWD appears to have the habit of regularly citing forsythia blossoms in the City of Hamburg as an example of spring arriving earlier. The blossoms are earlier and earlier, the DWD claims, at least those that the DWD always likes to invoke. This claimed early blossoming indeed must be evidence of climate warming, a few of the readers believed.

Well, a former DWD employee recently provided us with the following diagram of the forsythia blossoming data for the Hamburg Lombard Bridge from the DWD itself. The surprise is great:

Fig. 1 The left side vertical axis depicts the number of days after the start of the year. The higher the number, the later the start of forsythia blossoms. The chart shows they are arriving almost 20 days later than 25 years earlier.
Although the observation series were recorded right in the middle of heat island Hamburg, and thus did not even fulfill the conditions for an objective observation, the start of blossoms turns out to be precisely as those in the completely open exposed areas that we looked at in our previous article: Since 1988 spring has been arriving later and later. The start of springtime forsythia blossoms is also arriving later and later in the large urban heat island of Hamburg.
Result: Also the data on the City of Hamburg show that forsythia blossom have been arriving considerably later and later since 1988, indicating a increasingly delayed start of spring.
The constant claims that forsythia blossoms are coming earlier and earlier are false.
Another phenologist located in Seesen also sent us his observation data of forsythia blossoms, and these are shown in the following chart:

Fig. 2. Forsythia blossoms have been arriving later and later also in Seesen for the past 28 years. The observations are consistent with the data from the DWD in Hamburg.” Data source: Phenologist Georg v. Petersdorff-Campen
Result: Spring in Germany is beginning later and later. All March blossoms are delayed. We trace this back to the months of January, February and March becoming colder and colder over the past 28 years.

Dr. Patrick Moore takes issue with NGOs over climate, genetically modified organisms and the “truth” about carbon. He says we were literally running out of carbon before we started to pump it back into the atmosphere. “CO2 has been declining to where it is getting close to the end of plant life, and in another 1.8 million years, life would begin to die on planet Earth for lack of CO2.” 



According to Moore, it is life itself that has been consuming carbon and storing it in carbonaceous rocks. He goes on to say, “Billions of tons of carbonaceous rock represent carbon dioxide pulled out of the atmosphere, and because the Earth has cooled over the millennia, nature is no longer putting CO2 into the atmosphere to offset this.”

"Have you ever had moment of supermarket paralysis, stood with an organic vegetable in hand and the moral part of your brain urging you to put it in your shopping basket, while your brain’s financial overseer stubbornly resists? For a moment, the two logics fiercely compete, before one wins out. Later, at the supermarket till there can be a jarring feeling of cognitive dissonance to see a mixed basket of conventional and organic items.  Surely, we should either stick to our moral compass and buy everything organic, or we should remain financially savvy and purchase all conventional? Mixing half and half seems like the worst of all worlds. Yet it turns out that not all organic foods are equal. A group of scientists, led by Laurence Smith of Cranfield University, have now quantified the greenhouse gases produced from farming different types of grain, vegetable and livestock using both conventional and organic methods. Their results are published in the journal Nature Communications.  Organic farming is a way of growing food which uses less artificial chemical inputs such as synthetic fertilisers or pesticides. This means it generally has a lower environmental impact per field.  But because yields tend to be lower, organic farming means more land is needed to produce the same amount of crops or livestock. That’s why Smith and colleagues used a “life-cycle assessment”, a technique to assess the environmental impacts associated with all the stages of a product’s life, from production to final consumption. In doing so, they broadened the lens from just looking at the emissions produced during the farming process to also include emissions from inputs, such as production of synthetic fertiliser for conventional crops. They found that, over the full life cycle, some organic crops such as beans, potato, oats and spring barley produce higher greenhouse gas emissions per tonne than on conventional farms, while others such as oilseed rape, rye, winter barley and wheat were more efficient under organic production. In terms of livestock, pigs, beef and sheep were more environmentally friendly under organic production, but poultry was not. So, in order to achieve its new target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, perhaps the UK should promote organic production of selected foods?  This appears to make sense. However, in a novel twist, Smith and colleagues suggest that, if all the people in the England and Wales switched to buying organic food, they could not grow enough to feed even their own countries. They would need to import more food from overseas, which means more emissions from boats, lorries and planes, while in another unintended consequence, grasslands that store carbon would be converted to grow crops, effectively causing further emissions.  They estimate feeding England and Wales alone would require more than 7m hectares of land overseas, nearly five times the area currently used. Under medium land-use conversion scenarios this could lead to 70% more greenhouse gas emissions from people all eating organic food compared to conventional. The “systems thinking” approach used in this study is very worthwhile – too often we take a blinkered approach to problems and miss the bigger picture. Yet we can broaden the lens even further and ask what other factors might change at the same time. People are becoming increasingly aware of the scale of food waste, for instance, and diets may be changing away from emissions-intensive foods such as red meat. If we reduced food waste and improved diets, while further improving the yield efficiency of organic farming, there would be less need to import from overseas. We also need to use long-term thinking to understand what will happen if the UK continues with conventional farming. We know that these intensive farming methods lead to loss of biodiversity, reduced water quality, and reduced soil health, which ultimately makes food production more vulnerable. Ultimately, farmers risk degrading the environment so much that some countries, including the UK, would rely on other countries for food anyway. So where does that lead us on the question of organic food? Each of us has the power to inflict damage or to heal the environment with our purchases, and if we can afford to we should choose wisely. It turns out it is ok to have a mixed shopping basket, as some organic products are better for the environment than others. However, it’s hard to make such choices as food labels aren’t clear enough about their emissions and other environmental impacts.  With new “big data” approaches for tracking product sources and impacts, information for consumers is improving. In the meantime, one way might be to try to buy seasonal and local organic food where possible. Then you can be sure to reduce overseas emissions from transport and land conversion, and there is the added bonus that it will help restore your local farmed landscape.

President Donald Trump recently said that he will “almost … definitely” resort to emergency powers to build a wall on the Mexican border if Congress does not give in to his demands. That might be his way out of this government shutdown if Democrats, unmoved so far by his televised address Saturday, continue to hold the line. But it should not get him that wall.



In order to build it, Trump would need not only funds but also the power to seize property from unwilling owners through the use of eminent domain. Allowing him to do so would set a dangerous precedent and threaten the property rights of thousands of Americans.



Poorly drafted laws give the president a wide range of easily abused emergency powers. Even if he can declare a “national emergency,” however, that does not mean he can use it to pay for and build a wall.





Trump wants to divert military funds and take private property without congressional authorization. That’s a dangerous precedent for future presidents.



Some point to 10 U.S.C. 2808 and 33 U.S.C. 2293 as possible justifications. But Section 2808 states that, during a “national emergency” that “requires the use of the armed forces,” the president can reallocate defense funds to “undertake military construction projects … that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.” No threat posed by undocumented immigration “requires the use of the armed forces,” and it is hard to see why a wall is “necessary to support such use.”



In fact, as Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman explains, longstanding laws bar the use of troops for domestic law enforcement (including enforcing immigration law).



Section 2293 also only applies to a war or emergency that “requires or may require use of the armed forces.” Another federal law allows the military to condemn property for various purposes, such as “fortifications.” But that only extends to projects for which funding has been appropriated by Congress.



Arguments that Trump can use disaster relief funds to build the wall are even more implausible.



The outcome of a legal battle over emergency powers is hard to predict. Clever administration lawyers may come up with creative new legal arguments. Too often, courts give presidents undue deference on security and immigration issues. But judges should keep in mind the importance of rigorously enforcing legal constraints on dangerous exercises of emergency powers.



Even if the president can use emergency powers to get funds, that does not mean he can seize property by eminent domain. The Supreme Court has long held that the use of eminent domain must be expressly authorized by law. No emergency law expressly permit the use of eminent domain for border walls not otherwise authorized by Congress.



Building Trump’s wall requires using eminent domain on a massive scale. A third of the needed land is owned by the federal government. The rest would have to be taken from private owners, Native American tribes and state governments, many of whom are unlikely to sell voluntarily.



The result would be one of the largest federal condemnations in modern U.S. history. In Texas alone, there are almost 5,000 privately owned lots in the likely path of the wall. Securing the land and building on it is likely to be costly and time‐​consuming. Construction and legal battles over compensation can drag on for years.



This reality underscores the absurdity of claiming that a wall is needed to combat an “emergency.” Emergency powers are intended to address immediate threats that cannot be dealt with by slow‐​moving legislative processes. If the supposed emergency can be fixed by a wall that takes years to build, this means it was not an emergency in the first place. In reality, there is no genuine crisis that a wall could fix. It would not even meaningfully reduce undocumented immigration.



Far from alleviating a crisis, building the wall through eminent domain would actually create one by imperiling the property rights of thousands of landowners along the border. The Department of Homeland Security has a terrible record of violating procedural rights and undercompensating property owners in earlier takings for smaller border barriers. Such abuses would likely be repeated on a much larger scale if we try to build Trump’s wall.



If Trump succeeds in using emergency powers to build the wall and seize property through eminent domain, future presidents could exploit this dangerous precedent. They, too, could declare a “national emergency,” and then divert military funds and take private property without congressional authorization.



Republicans who cheer Trump now will regret it if the next Democratic president uses the same powers to declare that climate change is a “national emergency” and then allocate funds and take land for the gigantic “Green New Deal” program many progressives advocate. Climate change is a more plausible menace to national security than undocumented immigration.



If Trump succeeds, presidents could use the same ploy almost any time they want funds or seek to condemn private property for purposes Congress has not authorized, so long as there is some vague security pretext. To their credit, conservative commentators Philip Klein and David French have highlighted the risks of going down this very slippery slope. No one person, whether Democrat or Republican, can be trusted with such sweeping power.

"As someone who has researched the prominence of climate and ecological breakdown in David Attenborough’s documentaries, I was disappointed by the first episode of the legendary filmmaker’s latest series, Seven Worlds, One Planet. Although I was enthralled by nail-biting scenes of uncertain survival, like his previous work it betrays the natural world by showing it as mostly untouched by human impacts. His last documentary, the Netflix production Our Planet, had taken a small step forward in this regard. Along with colleagues from Newcastle, Bangor, and Oxford, I analysed scripts from Attenborough’s last four documentary series, and we found that Our Planet discussed both conservation threats and successes more often than his previous work. Nearly 15% of the total word count of the Our Planet scripts focused on what is not well with the natural world. While this was only slightly more than Blue Planet II at 12%, talk of human impacts was woven into every episode rather than being the subject of a dedicated final episode. Our Planet also shared conservation successes in every episode. While Blue Planet II devoted slightly more of its overall script length to such issues, again this was mostly concentrated in the final episode and not incorporated throughout the series. However, while Our Planet contained a few visually shocking scenes (walruses spring to mind) that prompted discussion of climate breakdown in the media, the series – like those before it – was almost bereft of scenes that directly showed the abundant ways in which humanity has devastated the natural world. The first episode of Seven Worlds, One Planet showed visually breathtaking scenes of the harshness of Antarctic life, but yet again for the most part nature appeared devoid of human influence. Admittedly, it is more difficult to directly depict the effects of humans on a continent where no humans actually live, and hopefully later episodes will be bolder. But even in this episode, melting ice and calving glaciers were mentioned only briefly, and these changes to the climate were rarely explicitly highlighted as caused by human actions. The exception was a vignette in which we were shown an abandoned whaling station, and told how humans caused whale numbers to crash, before their recovery following a whaling ban. This reflected a common theme of success stories in the episode – scenes capturing the struggle of albatrosses and penguins against the effects of climate breakdown also ended in triumph. This is not a bad thing – optimism can be a useful tool in driving engagement and positive change. But to be effective, it needs to be accompanied with a sense of how individuals can contribute to keeping to the good news going. For example, the whaling section ignored the role of social movements in pressuring governments to institute the whaling ban. Seeing smelly, seasick cameraman Rolf fighting tears when ruminating on the perilous future of the penguins he filmed was perhaps the most powerful scene of the show. In connecting human guilt and sorrow to the penguins’ plight, it  intertwined humanity and nature in a way not managed by the rest of the episode. But again, the segment left no sense of how we all can help. Nature documentaries have great potential to be a force for good. They can increase willingness among viewers to make personal lifestyle changes, increase supportfor conservation organisations, and generate positive attitudes towards an issue, which may in turn make policy change more likely.

      Do David Attenborough documentaries help the natural world? New research gives cause for hope


 But the way they’re framed is important. Attenborough’s position is that presenting a doom and gloom picture of the living world could be “alarmist” and a “turn-off”, and prefers to focus on the marvels of nature to inspire connection. But the one major exception to his usual approach had major social impacts. Almost 40% of Blue Planet II’s final episode was dedicated to human threats to the natural world, and homed in on plastic pollution. This focus helped spark a public movement against single-use plastics. Within a year, the UK government announced its intention to ban the sale of plastic straws and drink stirrers, and corporations such as Starbucks and McDonalds decided to stop stocking plastic straws. A box set of the series accompanied by a letter from Attenborough was gifted to Chinese president Xi Jinping during his 2018 visit to the UK – which concluded with the announcement of a joint plan to tackle plastic pollution. We need more research to pin down exactly how the portrayal of nature in documentaries affects our willingness to help save it. But I’d bet that it would be a lot harder to ignore the link between high-consumption lifestyles and desolation of the natural world if the pervasiveness of commercial agriculture, mining and transport infrastructure in natural landscapes were more visible. Instead of brief references to climate change and cute chicks fighting to survive against the odds, we need to be confronted with the stark reality of the destruction resulting from humanity’s actions. I believe that Attenborough and the production teams behind Seven Worlds One Planet are truly passionate about the environment. It is brilliant that they are bringing the beauty of the living world to our screens, but it is time to go beyond inspiration. Show us what we have done wrong, show us how it is affecting us, and then tell us how we can help. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

While we watch Iceland’s unpronounceable volcano, on the other side of the world, in Papua New Guinea, Mount Tavurvur is already causing damage and threatening lives as well as disrupting some international air travel.
Mount Tavurvur erupts in Papua New Guinea on Friday, August 29th, 2014. Image from Roberto Lopez via Twitter
Mount Tavurvur, is part of the larger Rabaul caldera, seen here:
At center, an ash plume rises from Tavurvur Volcano (part of the Rabaul Volcanic Complex) on November 19, 1999. NASA/USGS Landsat 7.
Tavurvur is an active stratovolcano that lies near Rabaul in Papua New Guinea. It is a sub-vent of the Rabaul caldera and lies on the eastern rim of the larger feature. An eruption of the volcano largely destroyed the nearby town of Rabaul in 1994. (Wikiedia description)
The eruption on Friday shot volcanic ash into the stratosphere and it was reported that Qantas Airlines rerouted some flights to avoid flying through the ash cloud.
Here is amateur video of the eruption:

"**""For every influencer we've heard of, there's 100,000 people out there trying to do exactly the same thing and getting less than 10 views.""**
That feeling of getting a like or a comment on your first-class selfie gives you validation. It gets the brain excited and the buzz only gets better the more attention you get.
But when does that desire for a dopamine hit turn into desperationâ¦ or worse?
""Everyone has that moment where they're oblivious to how thirsty they're being,"" says Eugene Kotlyarenko, director of new movie Spree.
His thriller takes on a darker side of social media culture - which he says captures ""something horrifying about people constantly looking for love and attention"".
Kurt Kunkle (played by Stranger Things' Joe Keery) is a Los Angeles taxi driver so desperate for online fame he's willing to do the very worst to get it. He livestreams a murder spree.
It's a satire on social media which plays out entirely through screens - phone footage, body cams, CCTV and dash cams.
But it's also something we've witnessed in real life - when 51 worshippers were killed during attacks on two mosques in New Zealand in March 2019.
Eugene says he wanted the film to be a ""takedown"" of people who use violence to gain attention.
""When we see violence in films it becomes sensational in a way that could be emulated. And I think in this film, no-one would want to be Kurt Kunkle. He is definitely a loser and definitely cringy to watch. So I did have a kind of brutal approach to satirising him,"" he says.
Kurt's character spends years trying to get internet-famous with his 'Kurtsworld96' channel - where he aimlessly posts boring reviews and gaming vlogs.
Eugene and Joe Keery watched loads of online videos and vlogs, specifically of people with little or no followings but who offer tutorials on how to get a following.
""The irony of that and the fact it's lost on these people is really funny,"" the director tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.
The movie also stars former SNL cast member Sasheer Vamata as stand-up comedian Jessie, who crosses paths with Kurt when she gets in the back of his rideshare as a passenger.
Her character is also obsessed with followers and as part of her research, Sasheer watched loads of Insta-famous comics who were always streaming or talking into their phone to learn how they engaged with their online audiences.
In the film, there's a running joke about how Kurt is desperate for others to tag him, something Sasheer still gets in real life on a regular basis,
""People get free advertising or a free connection if you tag them. They're craving popularity or fame and I can't really fault them for that. That's what these apps are made for. You want to promote yourself consistently.""
Recently, Sasheer has taken a step back from social media and only tries to use it for ""promotional purposes"".
""I've tried to unfollow lots of people,"" she says. ""It clears my timeline and I keep most of my personal life off social media too. There's a safety aspect too which is highlighted in Spree.""
Drake is the film's executive producer and someone who ""understands social media really well"", according to Eugene.
""He got that I've tried to critique and make fun of something that's really scary. I'm proud to say that he's not only a fan of the film but also the producer.""
The film is one of the first in months to get a physical release in UK cinemas, following their extended closure during lockdown.
Many studios are pushing the release dates of their films back or moving them to streaming services, like Disney's Mulan \- but director Eugene hopes his movie might entice people back (with social distancing).
""The communal nature of viewing is really important because that shared experience lets you know you're part of the human race,"" he says.
The film was recently shown at a drive-in event, where Eugene says hearing a whole group of people ""laughing at the same time"" was a ""great experience"".
""You're in the midst of this claustrophobic, funny nightmare.""
