UPDATE 2: The names of two of the resigning scientists are known: Mr “Honest Broker” Hans von Storch and German Weather Service VP Paul Becker.
The print edition of Der Spiegel this week has a short article that tells us what every sober person in Germany already knows: coping with climate change here will not pose any difficult challenges.

Spiegel writes: German Academy of Sciences and Engineering calls off the climate catastrophe.
In fact we know this to be the case for the rest of the world, unless of course the climate veers into another ice age like situation. The above conclusion was reached by the German Academy of Sciences and Engineering (Acatech) in a study commissioned by the German Federal government. According to Acatech President Reinhard Hüttl:
No climate conditions are going to occur here that already do not exist on the globe elsewhere and that we cannot cope with.”
Worse for the climate alarmists, the report goes on to say that warming will even bring benefits along with it, such as longer growing seasons and reduced wintertime heating costs. Readers should note that typical Germans heat their homes about 8 months per year.

Now we know that for some people bedwetting is a tough habit to break, and so we hope this latest news will help put some of the less chronic among us on the path to recovery.
Concerning rising sea levels, the scientists say that this ought to be an important concern, but “the scientists reject horror scenarios”. The scientists add:
A climate-related mass migration to Germany appears improbable.”
Four alarmist scientists walk out in protest of the good news
People of normal psychological balance would of course be relieved to hear this good news. But in catastrophe-obsessed Germany, this is unfortunately not the norm, rather it’s the exception. A number of scientists, bent on spreading fear, are angered by this good-news conclusion. Spiegel writes:
There was a dispute about the reliability of climate prognoses. Because of the involvement of RWE Innogy supervisory board chairman Fritz Vahrenholt (Social Democrat Party), four scientists resigned from the Committee. The former Senator of Environment of Hamburg accused established climate science of exaggerating man’s share in causing climate change.”
Fritz Vahrenholt is a professor of chemistry and co-author of the controversial skeptic book Die kalte Sonne. The names of the four scientists who resigned are still not known. It’s tough when people no longer want to play along with the alarmist hoax.

"In an effort to suppress federal climate research, the Trump administration will direct state agencies to no longer consider worst-case scenarios of global warming. Climate modelers working for federal agencies will only be permitted to forecast to 2040, decades before the as-much-as 8C degrees of global warming that could take place by 2100 if we continue on our current path. William Happer – most recently famous for complaining that the “demonization” of carbon dioxide “really differs little from the Nazi persecution of the Jews” – will lead a team charged with reviewing the science produced by government researchers, no doubt hunting for references to the disastrous sea-level rise, crop failures and health impacts continued warming stands to create.  The irony in all of this is that Trump, Happer and company may have a firmer grasp on the epic scope of these climate projections than many Democrats. As Naomi Klein argues, even the right’s fervent conspiracy theorists tend to understand at some level how profound the implications of this crisis are for business as usual, which has distributed its profits among elites of both parties. “Members of Trump’s cabinet,” Klein has written, “with their desperate need to deny the reality of global warming, or belittle its implications”, nonetheless “understand something that is fundamentally true. To avert climate chaos, we need to challenge the free-market fundamentalism that has conquered the world since the 1980s.” For all their bluster and junk science, Republican decision-makers have a clear sense for their own self-interest – and just how much is at stake for them and the rest of the 1%. Consider Happer himself, a retired physicist who has spent his post-academy days hopping between various climate-denying thinktanks, a good many of them funded by the fossil fuel industry. In 2015, Greenpeace activists duped Happer into agreeing to write a report on the benefits of carbon dioxide for a fictional oil company. The (real) coal company Peabody Energy has paid him to deliver testimony at a state hearing in Minnesota, and Happer has joined hands with groups like the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute – all recipients of ample industry funding – to bolster Trump’s agenda and cast doubt on the scientific consensus. As the New York Times reported in its article on the White House’s new climate plans, both Happer and John Bolton – who tapped him for the administration – have received generous support from the Mercers, the rightwing family credited with both spreading climate denial and helping fuel the opioid epidemic. We can’t know whether Happer genuinely believes the nonsense he’s spouting, or is just being paid well enough to sound like he does. The answer doesn’t really matter. Any clear-eyed assessment of what the science is telling us spells out who the winners and losers of rapid decarbonization would be. To cap warming at around 2C – a threshold many already dealing with climate impacts argue is too high – about three-quarters of known fossil fuel reserves will need to be kept underground, a reality that if realized as public policy would crater the stock price of energy companies. Climate scientist Kevin Anderson has estimated that if the top 10% of greenhouse gas emitters were to live like the average European – an improvement even for many of us in the United States – global emissions could decline by a third. It is “possible with the laws of chemistry and physics”, according to IPCC scientists, to limit warming to the boldly ambitious target of 1.5C. The problem is our politics, and how much of a stranglehold the fossil fuel executives with the most to lose from decarbonization have over them. Establishment Democrats, meanwhile, are asleep at the wheel. The pitch for taking on the climate challenge is a compelling one for reasons well beyond the fact that it could prevent runaway catastrophe. The Green New Deal promises a well-paid job for everyone who wants one, a real mass transit system, clean and affordable energy and universal healthcare – a necessity as people leave their jobs to find new work in the transition away from fossil fuels. While several Democratic primary contenders have embraced the Green New Deal and begun proposing their own plans, the frontrunner in that race, Joe Biden, and the Democrats’ congressional leadership have been cooler toward it, offering neither a decarbonization plan nor a compelling reason for voters to get behind them come 2020. That’s a dead end for the planet, but also for the party’s political prospects. With Donald Trump at their helm, Republicans will keep denying climate change because it represents a dire threat to their fossil fuel donors’ bottom lines. Democratic leadership would do well to follow the lead of their party’s insurgent progressive wing, and take the climate threat as seriously."
"The head of Scotland’s nature conservation agency has warned the country faces an “apocalyse” of flooded towns, dead forests and polluted rivers unless urgent action is taken to cut CO2 emissions. Francesca Osowska, chief executive of Scottish Natural Heritage, said the world had barely a decade to shift to a low carbon economy before the effects of global heating were irreversible and catastrophic. She said there were very clear threats facing Scotland, and by implication the rest of the UK, unless radical action was taken by 2030.  “Imagine an apocalypse – polluted waters; drained and eroding peatlands; coastal towns and villages deserted in the wake of rising sea level and coastal erosion; massive areas of forestry afflicted by disease; a dearth of people in rural areas; and no birdsong,” she told the Royal Society of Edinburgh on Thursday evening. “All of this is possible, and there are parts of the world we can point to where inaction has given rise to one or more of these nightmare landscapes.” Osowska said current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere meant global heating of 1.5C was almost inevitable, requiring adaptation in the way people lived. To prevent even more heating, there had to be sweeping changes to the way land and seas were exploited for food, towards much more sustainable food production; a marked shift towards sustainable transport systems; increased green spaces in urban areas; and significant reform of the economy, to promote greater equality. Likening the relationship between the Earth’s climate and its biodiversity to a marriage, she said there had been major shifts in climate and nature before. “But the rate of the current shift is both unprecedented and phenomenal,” she said. “In the space of geological seconds – possibly milliseconds – we have crashed the marriage. Our actions threaten to disrupt the harmony that has existed over the last 10,000-15,000 years. We are entering a climate which may not be capable of sustaining the planet’s billions of people and nature as we know it.” She cited goals set out in a recent report from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), a government body that advises the UK and devolved governments on climate policy, which has called on the UK to adopt a target of net zero emissions by 2050. The UK government has so far failed to endorse that. That required converting 20% of agricultural land to forestry, biomass for energy, or expanding carbon-rich peatlands; a switch to electrically powered transport; increasing renewable energy production by 50%; and heavy investment in carbon capture and storage, to pipe the CO2 still being produced underground. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  The CCC said Scotland could achieve net zero – a figure that allows some CO2 emissions as long as that carbon is absorbed by other measures – by 2045 because it has greater scope for new forestry and renewable energy production. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has adopted that goal but her government has yet to set out how it will be achieved. MSPs at Holyrood are resisting proposals for mandatory 20mph zones in urban areas and taxing workplace parking to help cut transport emissions."
"I’m taking part on Friday because adults, and especially politicians, have not done enough to save our future. We have to get them to listen to us and believe what scientists have to say. I’m participating in a strike located in Tampere. We will get together on Sori Square (Sorin Aukio) and march to the central marketplace (Keskustori). I think the earth needs this climate strike movement. And we need it too, because it’s our future that is in danger. I’m so happy to see the youth rise and demand back a planet where we can live. Elina, 14, Finland  I don’t want to see the world struggle; the world dying because we are not doing anything about it. We are making more disaster by not changing bad habits to help the climate crisis such as fossil fuels, cars, palm oil, plastic and ruining animal habitats. I feel responsible to do something and take action especially as I love animals and according to the science many can disappear in my lifetime. I am half Balinese and the climate crisis affects places like Bali and it mainly hurts the poor people there as they don’t live in houses that can stand the dramatic changes in the weather. So I want to try to help the world become a better place. How can we stop climate change if we don’t know what to do? I feel that we should learn more about this at school and specialised people should come and talk to us. We need more people’s ideas about what to do and how they think we should help. Nia, nine, Kent, England I find the movement inspiring, powerful and making change. In Iowa, I’ve been on strike for the past 10 weeks. In those weeks, there has been historic flooding in western and eastern Iowa. But this flooding is nothing compared to the cyclones that hit Mozambique. We must act now. I believe there is a climate emergency, so we are marching to the city hall to call on our council to declare a climate emergency and update their climate action plan to meet IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] standards. There are no more excuses. Massimo, 14, Iowa, US I’ve always been somewhat aware of the climate crisis but until recently I didn’t realise how bad it actually was, and I didn’t feel like there was much I could do about it anyway. I thought I was the only young person who actually cared about this, and all I could do was recycle. Then, last November, I found out about Greta Thunberg and the school strike movement and I thought: “Wow, this is something I can do!” At first I was hesitant about starting my own strike; as I am home-educated the idea of asking other young people to strike sounded a bit odd. But on 15 March I went to the Cambridge strike and I was absolutely astounded by the amount of other kids there! It was amazing when I realised that so many other people care about this. After that I decided to stop messing around and decided that the climate crisis was more important than a fear of whether other kids would listen. Eva, 12, Suffolk, England I will be taking part on Friday because I am scared for mine and other children’s futures. Our planet was handed to us broken and destroyed from previous generations and it is seriously unfair that we should be hit with its full effects. There was Hurricane Sandy and there were floods but I moved to New York in 2014 and live pretty high up so I don’t get hit as hard as people in Redhook or the Rockaways might. I feel both empowered and scared. It is awesome that we have come this far and that kids have taken notice of our world’s faults but it’s frightening that we have to. If adults had taken action before it escalated to this point, we would have had a lot more time to help piece Earth back together. To the kids, keep working hard and we will eventually force adults to take action, this is our future we are protesting for, they can’t take it away. To the adults who aren’t doing anything, you have let it get this far, when will climate change have killed enough people for you to take notice? To adults who are trying to help, thank you. We need more people like you to get this job done. Every person counts. To everyone, think when you go to a cafe, do I really need this plastic bag or straw? Remember to refuse. Zola, 11, New York, US"

Share this...FacebookTwitterDie Welt blogger and science journalist Ulli Kulke writes here about how another scare story (melting permafrost) is a load of “imbecility”.

In the above paper, permafrost expert Georg Delisle shows that permafrost scare is irrational bedwetting. Source: Poster Bad Honnef.
Some alarmist scientists claim melting permafrost could lead to a dangerous “tipping point” as methane and CO2 released would act to enhance global warming further, which in turn would cause more permafrost to melt, thus accelerating global warming until it careens out of control.
Just in time for Doha, this disaster scenario has once again been hyped up, with Kevin Schaefer of the National Snow and Ice Data Center recently sounding the alarms. So has UNEP.
Kulke writes, however, that the permafrost is much more stable than claimed and that studies have been conducted on permafrost – since decades. Kulke writes:
I remember a seminar in Bad Honnef in the spring of 2008 where geoscientist and permafrost expert Georg Delisle from Hanover presented his research.

He studied time periods from the last 10,000 years when the global temperature was warmer than today for several thousand years by as much as 6°C. Ice cores that had been extracted from Antarctica and Greenland provide exact information about the composition of the atmosphere during the these warm periods. His conclusion: ‘The ice cores from both Greenland and Antarctica provide no indication of any elevated release of greenhouse gases at any time even though back then a deep thawing of the permafrost when compared to today would have been the case.’  This was clear to see on the poster he used for his presentation. Obviously CO2 and methane are much more stable in the ground also when it thaws, Poster Bad Honnef.”
Delisle is an expert on permafrost. What does he think about the claims being made that there’s a risk it will thaw out and release lots of climate-shattering gas? Kulke tells us what Delisle said emphasis added:
‘…it is utter imbecility to suppose that the entire permafrost could thaw out by the end of the century. It would take thousands of years.‘ His study ‘Near-surface permafrost degradation: How severe during the 21st century?’ was the basis for his presentation. It had been peer reviewed and has not to my knowledge been refuted to this day. 2007GL029323.”
Kulke writes that it would be nice if the IPCC took such research into account, the same applies for the sun as a factor as well.
By the way, the Poster Bad Honnef concludes:
• Permafrost in the Arctic will remain mostly intact in the 21st century.
• When making a comparison to other earlier warm periods, the massive release of greenhouse gases from disintegrating permafrost is considered improbable.
Another global warming myth debunked. Now bring on the “melting ice caps”.

Low carb living. (Image source: http://www.psychicdonut.com/wp)
First they tell us we’re too fat and lazy, and that we need to be more active instead. But now that too turns out to be undesirable because according to a Max Planck Institute scientist, you end up breathing harder, thus emitting more CO2 and making the climate worse as a result. I kid you not!
The scientifically moronic Handelsblatt today here has the latest idiotic piece titled: Climate Killer From The Lungs. A reader asks the Düsseldorf-based financial daily how much CO2 a human emits. Every week the Handelsblatt answers such stupid questions as part of its Klima-Orakel – in an effort inform (lol) its readers on climate change.
To answer that question, the Handelsblatt consults Matthias Heil of the Max Planck Institute for heart and lung research, who says that fit, muscular people breath out more CO2 than unfit people do, and that things get really bad when we become physically active. According to Heil:

During rest, about 4 litres of air pass through the lungs per minute. But that jumps to over 50 litres during physical activity. Over an entire year it comes out to 2100 cubic meters of air, or 168 kg of CO2, when at rest and 25,500 cubic meters of air, or 2040 kg of CO2, when at constant physical activity.”
Of course nobody is physically active constantly over the course of a year (especially me). We could say say that each human breathes out roughly 1/4 ton of CO2 per year, and thus that adds up to a couple billion tons. Heil concludes (emphasis added):
The figures foremost show one thing: Individual lifestyle has an enormous impact on our CO2 emission. From that standpoint, a small non-athletic person who never moves and spends the whole day on the sofa has the optimum climate result.”
Boy, I feel a lot less guilty already. Damn! I’m really doing my part.
Are there any guys out there whose wives would believe this crap? “Sorry honey, but fixing up the house is gonna make me breathe harder and that’s bad for the climate.”
Sounds like a good way to get assaulted by the rolling pin.

"I have mentioned this before, but the mystery persists. Matt Canavan, the federal resources minister, has an economics degree, graduating from the University of Queensland with first class honours. Canavan also worked at the Productivity Commission prior to entering politics, first as a staffer for Barnaby Joyce and then as a senator for Queensland.  His professional background would point to a basic level of respect for facts and evidence – unless Canavan was the only staffer ever to work at the Productivity Commission overheard insisting stoutly in the tea room that everything needed to remain just the same, forever. It would also suggest a degree of fluency with the concept of industry transformation, a minor speciality of the commission. It is possible, of course, that Canavan departed the technocracy and sought refuge in political life in order to enact a state of being called the permanent present, but in any case, let’s not sweat the mystery, because we need to review the latest thinking of the resources minister. In an interview with The Australian, Canavan – normally a great champion of the resources sector – shared a few words of rebuke. If I’ve understood him correctly, the resources minister expressed objection to “loud” Australians getting all mouthy about climate change, in the process (somehow) encouraging resources companies (timid characters that they are) to advocate carbon pricing and discouraging banks (also notoriously timid corporate players) from lending to new coal projects. “Loud” Australians, he said, were skewing the debate. It’s not entirely clear who these “loud and undemocratic voices within our community” are. Perhaps Canavan meant the Reserve Bank deputy governor, Guy Debelle, who in March warned climate change poses risks to Australia’s financial stability, and, in the process, noted policymakers needed to consider warming as a trend and not a cyclical event. Perhaps he meant the banking regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. In March Apra flagged an intention to increase scrutiny of how banks, insurers and superannuation trustees are managing the financial risks of climate change to their businesses. The Apra executive board member Geoff Summerhayes noted earlier this year the drive towards decarbonisation was being driven not by noisy undemocratic interests but “by the decisions of governments, business leaders, investors and consumers”. The regulator surveyed 38 large banks, insurers and superannuation trustees in 2018 to assess their views and practices on climate-related financial risks, and that survey found a third of respondents believed climate change was a material financial risk to their businesses right now, and half believed it would be in the future. Half of the insurers surveyed said they were already feeling the effects of climate change. “Companies that fail to respond to these forces risk being left behind,” Summerhayes said. Perhaps Canavan meant the corporate regulator Asic. Last year that regulator said climate change was “a foreseeable risk facing many listed companies in the Australian market in a range of different industries” and warned directors and management of listed companies “to understand and continually reassess existing and emerging risks including climate risk that may affect the company’s business”. In that report, 17% of listed companies in the Asic sample identified climate risk as a material risk in their operating and financial reviews. Just in case this isn’t obvious, this isn’t wild, activist talk fomenting in the organic groceries of Brunswick, a revolution cooked up between the kale and the quinoa. This is hard-headed analysis by regulators with serious governance responsibilities. This is an inconvenience, I suspect, for Australia’s resources minister but basic facts don’t change courtesy of an election result. Governments don’t mandate reality, even when they win elections they didn’t expect to win. Basic facts remain the same. Canavan reasons these companies need to desist with their current dispositions on climate change, carbon risk and lending because the voters have spoken. Well, which voters? Because when it comes to this issue, voters expressed different views in different parts of the country. Which voters are we heeding? Here’s another basic fact. It is profoundly obvious to anyone taking the time to absorb what resources companies are saying about carbon pricing that this is not some weak-kneed capitulation to abstract activism (although obviously these companies are attentive to the views of their shareholders, who are increasingly attentive to carbon risk). The persistent call is actually a cry for help. Fiona Wild, the head of sustainability at BHP, told the Australian Financial Review last year carbon pricing was both a thing, but also a proxy for something that’s been missing from climate and energy policy in Australia for the best part of a decade. Sanity. “I think in the Australian context what we’d really like to see is a really well integrated climate and energy policy which looks at affordability, reliability and emissions reductions and that’s what we’re aiming for,” Wild said last October. Big corporations can’t operate in a world that remains tethered to the permanent present of Canavan’s imagining, they have to plan for the future, and the future is carbon constraint. That will either happen in a managed fashion, where governments tell Australians the truth about what needs to happen, and try to smooth the transformation, or it will happen chaotically, with maximum cost and maximum mayhem. Rather than wagging his finger at banks and resources companies, which operate in the real world and make rational decisions, Canavan would be better placed thinking about his core responsibilities as a policy maker, including what the resources industries of the future might look like, and how to create economic opportunity for the blue collar workers he purports to represent.

Last week my wife and I spent a few days in Berlin, and we visited the German Historical Museum.
Part of Germany’s very early history involves the Roman Empire, which never succeeded in taming the unruly tribes east of the Rhine.

Climate change during the Roman Empire days, when CO2 was below 300 ppm.
One of the exhibits there was accompanied by a piece of interesting text, which I photographed (without a flash), see above. The Roman empire collapsed in part due to climate change back then.
I thought the climate was gentle when atmospheric CO2 concentration was below 300 ppm – steady, unvariable and associated with few weather extremes. That’s what fraudster warmist climatologists tried to have us believe with an assortment a various hockey stick charts.
Someone needs to tell the German Historical Museum that.

This is a short extension to my last article on Why The Earth Is Cooling. When I first began exploring Modtran, the numbers it produced for downward radiation at the surface seemed to make no sense. It nearly always produced the same number, and I thought that part of the program was broken. On reflection, it became clear that the numbers were correct and that I had fallen into the warmist trap of believing that CO2 really does something to the Greenhouse effect. When the numbers in the very low humidities were charted, all became clear.
Here is what Modtran says about downward or “back” radiation at the Earth’s surface for values of humidity from 0 to 90% and CO2 from 0 to 1000 ppm.

You should notice that the legend cites six traces, but you see only four. That is because the 10, 50, and 90% humidity traces are superimposed. There is very little change in the downward radiation for any humidity from 10% and above and for any CO2 concentration from zero to 1000 ppm, or indeed for any concentration of CO2 up to 10,000 ppm.
Here are the Excel numbers copied from Modtran used to draw the above table:

As you can see, only in the driest desert on Earth will increasing CO2 increase the “back” radiation. Water vapor is by far the strongest greenhouse gas, but it is nearly saturated at 10% humidity. At 10% humidity and above, no amount of CO2 does anything. Most of the humidity on Earth is in that area on the right where doubling CO2 will do nothing to increase the long-wave radiation from the sky. Yet another warmist fail.
Unless the entire planet very soon goes to zero-percent relative humidity, we can go ahead and shut down the global warming hoax industry. If it’s happening, it is hardly because of CO2.

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran German journalist Ulli Kulke at his website writes about the Arctic ice melt: Never Say “Like Never Before“. German media have fallen all over themselves ringing the alarms over the “new record” – as if we have an Arctic Fukushima on our hands.

USS Skate at the North Pole in September, 1958. (US Navy photo)
Thankfully, however, there are still a few sane journalists left among us. Kulke is among that very small group and reminds us: “Is the ice melt at the North Pole really unprecendented? There are indications that show otherwise.”
Kulke labels claims of Arctic ice melt reaching “unprecedented” levels “gross nonsense” and reminds us that “during changeovers between warm and cold periods there have been already completely ice-free Arctics on multiple occasions.”
Kulke also quotes Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) physicist Rüdiger Gerdes (in Bremerhaven, Germany) who says the high Arctic temperatures are not only because of man-made greenhouse gases, but also because of natural periodic fluctuations with a rhythm of 60 to 70 years. Kulke quotes Gerdes:
Right now we are in a warm phase.“

Kulke explains, citing NSIDC Director Mark Serreze, “…the summer of 2012 was not especially warm at the higher latitudes” and that the sea ice development was unusual this year. Kulke writes that in March 2012, sea ice area was greater than at any time in the last 5 years and ice melt proceeded normally during almost the entire melt season until early August when a huge storm caused the sea ice area curve to turn sharply downwards to a level never seen – in at least 30 years, that is.
Kulke tells his readers that there’s a lot more to the Arctic than just temperature. Over the years scientists are finding out that it is a lot more complex and involves ocean currents, drifting, precipitation, freezing and thawing cycles. he adds:
That’s why serious scientists refrain from making statements such as ‘like never before’ when discussing the ice situation in the Arctic. Statements about the Arctic during times before satellites are made only with great reservations. About 50 to 70 years ago – a time when there was no systematic measurement and evaluation of temperature and sea ice area – we are finding a growing number of newspaper reports about dramatic disappearances of ice all around the North Pole, and could have been worse than today. The Franz-Josef-Land islands, which can be reached by boat only a few weeks a year, could be reached for 8 months in some years. Especially interesting, during one trip underneath the Arctic ice in the summer of 1958, the US submarine ‘Skate’ was able to emerge in open water 9 times – with one of those directly at the North Pole. At the end of the 1930s, Soviet scientists observed along the Arctic coast that it was 6°C warmer for an extended time than it was during the times of the Nansen ice drift  – somewhat warmer than today. The time period corresponds to the rhythm that AWI scientist Gerdes mentions.”
And Kulke cites Steven Goddard’s blog:
At the website www.real-science.com/arctic“ there’s an entire series of international newspaper article facsimiles from various years that document a number of profound Arctic climate fluctuaions earlier. The tenor of those articles, like today: The sea ice at the North Pole threatens to disappear”.
After a years-long spell where climate catastrophe alarmism had to go without without new record data, it can now enjoy a warm shower with Arctic sea ice. But on whether we are dealing with a record that goes way back, that is however very much in question.”

Indications a cold winter lies ahead for Europe.
Axel Bojanowski of Der Spiegel here also writes that two climate scientists, Hans Graf of the University of Cambridge and Davide Zanchettin of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, have developed a rule of thumb for predicting if it’s going to be cold or mild for the entire winter. How is this possible? Spiegel writes:
Graf and Zanchettin have discovered a weather kitchen that is mainly responsible for cooking up the winter for Central Europe. That kitchen is located on the other side of the planet in the Pacific the two climatologists report in a study in the “Journal of Geophysical Research”, which they submitted in the summer of 2011.”
They say it depends on the El Niño Southern Oscillation, which impacts weather globally.
According to Graf und Zanchettin: “After an El Niño over the Central Pacific, there’s a frosty winter in Europe – temperatures are on average 3 to 4°C lower than during other winters. Winters after El Niños are the coldest in Germany.”

Spiegel summarizes the rule of thumb the scientists use:
In Germany there’s a frosty, snowy winter when the following three conditions are fulfilled:
1.) For months there’s been an El Niño, meaning the ocean water surface is markedly warmer than usual.
2.) If the warm water spreads eastwards all the way to the coast of South America, then the chances for a cold winter in Central Europe drop off.
3.) There’s been no major volcano eruption – which would disrupt weather patterns.”
Leading climatologists Mojib Latif of the Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Kiel and Eduardo Zorita of the Helmholtz Center for Coastal Research, both in Germany, found the study to be of great interest. So once again Mr. Co2 warming Latif agrees that other factors drive the climate. An alarmist one day, and a scientist the next.
We’ll find out soon enough if Graf’s and Zanchettin’s rule will work for this coming winter.

"Tomorrow, schoolchildren and students will be out on the streets again, in huge numbers, in 150 countries, at over 4,000 events, demanding that governments immediately provide a safe pathway to stay within 1.5C of global heating. We spent weeks and months preparing for this day. We spent uncountable hours organising and mobilising when we could have just hung out with our friends or studied for school.  We don’t feel like we have a choice: it’s been years of talking, countless negotiations, empty deals on climate change and fossil fuel companies being given free rides to drill beneath our soils and burn away our futures for their profit. Politicians have known about climate change for decades. They have willingly handed over their responsibility for our future to profiteers whose search for quick cash threatens our very existence. We have learned that if we don’t start acting for our future, nobody else will make the first move. We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. Once again our voices are being heard on the streets, but it is not just up to us. We feel a lot of adults haven’t quite understood that we young people won’t hold off the climate crisis ourselves. Sorry if this is inconvenient for you. But this is not a single-generation job. It’s humanity’s job. We young people can contribute to a larger fight and that can make a huge difference. So this is our invitation. Starting on Friday 20 September we will kickstart a week of climate action with a worldwide strike for the climate. We’re asking adults to step up alongside us. There are many different plans under way in different parts of the world for adults to join together and step up and out of your comfort zone for our climate. Let’s all join together, with your neighbours, co-workers, friends, family and go out on to the streets to make your voices heard and make this a turning point in our history. This is about crossing lines – it’s about rebelling wherever one can rebel. It’s not about saying “Yeah, what the kids do is great, if I was young I would have totally joined in.” It doesn’t help, but everyone can and must help. During the French revolution mothers flooded the streets for their children. Today we children are fighting for ourselves, but so many of our parents are busy discussing whether our grades are good, or a new diet or what happened in the Game of Thrones finale – while the planet burns. This moment has to happen. Last year’s UN intergovernmental panel on climate change’s special report on global warming was clear about the unprecedented dangers of going beyond 1.5C of global heating. Emissions must drop rapidly – so that by the time we are in our mid- and late-20s we are living in a completely transformed world. But to change everything, we need everyone. It is time for all of us to unleash mass resistance – we have shown that collective action does work. We need to escalate the pressure to make sure that change happens, and we must escalate together. So this is our chance – join us on climate strike this September. People have risen up before to demand action and make change; if we do so in numbers we have a chance. If we care, we must do more than say we do. We must act. This won’t be the last day we need to take to the streets, but it will be a new beginning. We’re counting on you. • Greta Thunberg, Kyra Gantois, Luisa Neubauer, Eslem Demirel, Vanessa Nakate, Noga Levy-Rappoport, Isra Hirsi, Zhang Tingwei, Angela Valenzuela, Martial Breton, Nurul Fitrah Marican, Asees Kandhari, Jessica Dewhurst, Alexandria Villasenor, Jonas Kampus, George Bond, Lena Bühler, Kallan Benson, Linus Dolder, Beth Irving, Zel Whiting, Marenthe Middelhoff, Lubna Wasim, Radhika Castle, Parvez Patel, Wu Chun-Hei, Anjali Pant, Tristan Vanoni, Luca Salis, Brian Wallang, Anisha George, Hiroto Inoue, Haven Coleman, Maddy Fernands, Bhavreen Malhotra Kandhari, Feliquan Charlemagne, Salomée Levy, Karla Stephan, Anya Sastry, Claudio Ramirez Betancourt, Vicente Gamboa Soto, Julia Weder, Lilly Platt, Balder Claassen, Kassel Hingee, Maria Astefanoaei and Pavol Mulinka are youth activists for Fridays for Future"
"An inadequate public charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in the UK is forcing drivers to take risks by opting for highly dangerous alternatives at home, an electrical safety charity has warned. Three-quarters of those who resort to charging from their home mains supply using a domestic extension lead even admit to risky “daisy-chaining” – using multiple extension leads plugged into one another – to reach their car, according to a survey by Electrical Safety First.  It is urging the government to expand the national network of public charging points as its findings reveal the growth rate of licensed plug-in vehicles is outstripping the number of charging points available. Analysis of data from the Department for Transport (DfT) and Zap-Map has revealed the growth rate of licensed plug-in vehicles to be almost six times faster over the last five years than that of public charging-point locations in the UK. In its survey of 1,500 electric vehicle owners – including both all-electric and hybrids – 74% of respondents said the shortage of public charging points near their home had led them to use domestic multi-socket extension leads, not suitable for outdoor use, to charge from the mains in their home. This is despite almost nine out of 10 respondents admitting they were aware these should not be used outdoors. Over half of electric vehicle users who charge using an extension lead, meanwhile, said they had left cables running to their vehicle in the rain. In addition, 75% of those who charge with a domestic extension lead admit daisy-chaining to reach their vehicle, despite it being advised against in all circumstances due to the risk of electrocution and fire. The latest figures reveal the number of charging point locations ranges from 147 per 100km2 in London (and 2.6 per 10,000 residents) to 1.55 per 100km2 (1.03 per 10,000 residents) in Wales. Electric vehicles are seen as key to government plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. It says it wants all cars to be effectively zero emission by 2040. Electrical Safety First urges consumers to take advantage of government grants to help fund the cost of a specially designed home charging point, which is safer than charging from the mains. Councils play an important role in providing charging infrastructure, while other charging points are provided by supermarkets or shopping centres. But earlier this year the Guardian revealed at least a quarter of local authorities in England and Wales had put a brake on the expansion of charging networks for electric vehicles, largely because of budget cuts. A DfT spokesperson said: “Drivers should be able to charge their electric vehicles on a network that is accessible, reliable, affordable and safe, and almost 1,000 public connectors have been installed in the last 30 days alone. “Nearly 120,000 charge points have been installed across the UK to date and we are continuing to accelerate the growth of infrastructure through a range of initiatives, including up to £500 off the upfront cost of residential installations.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMake no mistake about it – they’re coming for it – the world’s private pension money. The greens used to tell us that green energy could be profitable and would not burden our economy – in fact they even claimed it would lead to an economic boom and prosperity.
But now that the first building blocks of the green energy grid are in place, they too realize this is going to cost a lot of money – HUGE MONEY! Reports say it’s going to cost $1 trillion dollars a year for the rest of the century. Where should this kind of money come from?
Prof. Hans Joachim Schellhnhuber, Director of the ultra-climate-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Chairman of the anti-democratic WBGU (German Advisory Council on Global Change) has the answer: Raid the global private pension and retirement funds…and steal the money we worked our entire lives for.
WBGU BLUEPRINT TO THE GREAT PRIVATE PENSION HEIST HERE
And let’s not kid ourselves about who is going to make out on this. The leftist online DIE ZEIT daily here reports:
In the fight against global warming, the top environmental advisers of the German government, according to information from Die Zeit, want to tap a new source of funding – the private pensions of savers.”
Some thieving bastards will stop at nothing, won’t they? Now governments are using science to legitimize the widescale plunder of private pension funds. “Sorry people, but we have to steal your savings to save the planet.”
Globally, there’s lots of hard-earned “private” money tucked away for the retirement years of many citizens. But the greens are now thinking: “You didn’t save that.” They’re salivating over it, scheming to get there sticky, grubby hands on it. Die Zeit writes:

Insurances and pension funds alone have 50,000 trillion dollars at their disposal, which has to be securely invested over the long-term, says an expert report of the scientific advisory council of the German government for global environmental issues (WBGU). This capital could be mobilized for the Energiewende (energy transformation), like for revamping the power grid.”
The WBGU just released that “expert” report on how the greatest heist of all-time is to be executed, and it will be submitted today to Germany’s Minister of Environment Peter Altmaier. For example on page 20 it states:

Despite the fact that private capital is, in principle, available, general willingness to invest in or finance the transformation of energy systems towards sustainability falls short of what is required.”

Now we know the sad state of green energy’s ability to compete or to be profitable. The energy only becomes viable (and that only over the midterm) if there’s a state-ordered mass-scale plunder of the world’s private retirement accounts. It cannot survive with anything less. This is unprecedented in scale when it comes to a lack of feasibility.
Personally, my wife and I, are looking at retirement in about 10 years. I’d say it would be wise to start making plans to take “our money” and running fast and far.
Finally, I don’t know where the “intellectual” Die Zeit or the WBGU got this “50,000 trillion” figure. That’s over 3000 times the US debt -or $7 million per person globally! That’s way out of the park and obviously wrong. It shows that lefties have no idea when it comes to scales of money.
The world needs Paul Ryan, fast!

"Europe’s Greens, big winners in Sunday’s European elections, will use their newfound leverage in a fractured parliament to push an agenda of urgent climate action, social justice and civil liberties, the movement’s leaders say. “This was a great outcome for us – but we now also have a great responsibility, because voters have given us their trust,” Bas Eickhout, a Dutch MEP and the Greens’ co-lead candidate for commission president, told the Guardian.  “Our voters, especially the younger generation, for many of whom we are now their first choice, are deeply concerned about the climate crisis, and they are pro-European – but they feel the EU is not delivering. They want us to change the course of Europe.” Riding a surge of public concern over the climate crisis, Greens achieved double-digit scores in several countries, finishing second in Germany – where they doubled their previous score – and Finland and third in Luxembourg and France. With their tally of MEPs surging to 70 from 51 in the last parliament, the Greens group will have roughly the same clout in the 751-seat assembly as the far-right populists led by Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini – and a much better chance of using it. The parliament’s shrinking centre-right and centre-left groups lost their longstanding joint majority in the election, meaning that along with liberal MEPs, Greens could prove critical to achieving broad pro-EU majorities to pass European legislation. The big parties are certainly ready to talk. Manfred Weber, the conservative European People’s party’s lead candidate for commission president, said on Monday that the Greens were clearly “a possible partner. We should sit down together and draft a mandate for the next five years.” But the Greens will have a price. “We will need to see much more serious climate action, a real change of attitude: a price on C02, properly tackling aviation, the greening of agriculture,” Eickhout said. Under the 2015 Paris deal to limit global warming to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, the 28-nation EU has pledged by 2030 to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% below the levels in 1990. But scientists and activists say Europe and all other major economies must sharply raise their ambitions. The UN Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change warned in October that warming is currently on track towards a catastrophic 3C or 4C rise. “We will also want real progress on social protection and reducing inequality in Europe,” Eickhout added. “And we will demand far more vigorous action on the rule of law – no more playing politics. So those are the topics. We’ll talk to all who are interested in addressing them.” Sven Giegold, a senior German MEP, confirmed the party would “insist on negotiating substance first. We aim to negotiate a pro-EU agenda in which climate change policy is front and centre – and no longer just symbolic, but concrete.” Any cross-party agreement with Green backing would also need to include an EU policy on investment and social cohesion, Giegold said, plus an absolute commitment to tackling civil rights backsliding in EU states including Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Malta. “We think these election results give us a higher legitimacy to make these demands,” Giegold said. “Parliament now needs to have the time to sit down and discuss all this. We need to see more EU democracy come from this, not less.” Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green MEP and leader of the Greens’ group in the European parliament, also warned that the party would not enter into alliances unless the contain concrete measures. “Without verifiable change for EU citizens, we will not go there,” he said. The Green’s strong performance on Sunday has already prompted centre-right and centre-left parties around Europe to promise they have heard the call for more urgent climate action and would heed it. France’s prime minister, Édouard Philippe, acknowledged the “message about the ecological emergency”, Markus Söder, who heads Merkel’s Bavarian sister-party, the CSU, said the Greens were now its main competitor, and Udo Bullmann, leader of the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (SPD) in the European parliament, said it had underestimated climate change as an issue. “It’s a very clear message from the public that they want us to do more,” said Leo Varadkar, the prime minister of Ireland, where a Green party candidate finished first in Dublin with 17.5% of the vote. National Green leaders were delighted. “Voters have sent a clear signal that they want the environment at the heart of politics,” said Yannick Jadot, leader of the Europe Ecologie-Les Verts party in France. “The environment cannot just be a promise you make before elections,” he said. Britain’s Greens, boosted partly by their clear-anti-Brexit stance, beat the ruling Conservatives into fifth place with a score of 12.5%. The party’s sole Westminster MP, Caroline Lucas, welcomed a “response to the accelerating climate crisis that was the same in the UK and right across Europe.” Giegold described the German party’s performance as “a Sunday for Future” – a nod to the Fridays for Future school strikes led by the 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. The Green wave was not Europe-wide, however. Green parties won only a couple of seats in central Europe and none in eastern Europe, where there are few strong green parties and environmental concerns are usually taken up by other liberal parties. In southern Europe, Portugal’s People-Animals-Nature (Pan) party won its first European parliament seat, but the breakthrough was not replicated across the border in Spain, where Green parties have struggled to make headway on their own."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn this American Thinker piece by Clarice Feldman, the parallels to Steve McIntyre just jumped right out at me.
The German press is trying to make it look like the Democrats are thrilled about Ryan being the running mate, (predictably) painting Ryan as a “huge target” and a “radical conservative”, just because he believes in responsible spending (a concept that is foreign to many in Europe, e.g. Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, France – to name a few).
But Europe’s reaction reminds me of Michael Mann’s initial reaction to the first enquiries he received from a once obscure mining consultant and statistical expert from Toronto. Today we know that Michael Mann and his hockey stick team ended up learning respect for the power of mathematics and the scientific method – the hard way. McIntyre dissected, organ by organ, the suspiciously flawed curve and left the hockey team forever humiliated.
While climatologist cheats tried to fabricate a statistical hockey stick from tree-ring data, the DC finance hockey league (yes, it is an entire corrupt league) is trying to do the opposite: they are trying to take a grotesque hockey stick and make it look flat by using tricks – thus postponing the towering blade onto the next generation. Like McIntyre, Paul Ryan is poised to dissect the phony straight line curves DC is trying to fool us with.
First, Feldman quotes the Iowahawk:
“Paul Ryan represent[s] Obama’s most horrifying nightmare: math.”
And then adds:

Let me remind you how nightmarish Ryan is to Obama. Here’s a six-minute take down of Obamacare by Congressman Ryan.
Watch the vacant look in Obama’s eyes as it becomes clear he has no idea how to respond to the facts Ryan raises, to the math which demonstrates the utter  unsustainability of Obama’s legislative scheme.”
We can all recall the climate hockey team’s similar reaction. Andrew Montford wrote a whole book on it. First they tried to hide the numbers, claiming they were lost. Then they said the numbers were out there and anyone could see them. When the numbers were exposed, they had other “experts” bogusly confirm that they were right. And when these were shown to be flawed, they made up new phony curves. In the end, it was all about hiding an ugly truth. Today, except for the fabricators themselves, nobody believes the climate hockey stick curves anymore.
Paul Ryan is poised to be the floodlight that is about to illuminate Washington corrupt practices, which are taking the USA to Greece in a hand-basket.
Romney’s message is clear: We’re going to expose the mathematics (truth) of the numbers. Irresponsible spending and the looming debt crisis are going to be in the spotlight over the remainder of the campaign. You can run from Ryan all you want, but you won’t be able to hide from him.
Just ask Michael Mann.

"I am a great admirer of Greta Thunberg and a committed participant in Extinction Rebellion (XR), but I have doubts about her call for adults to join a worldwide strike for the climate in September (Young people are fighting for our future. But we need help, 24 May). UK law protects participants in industrial action against dismissal by their employers only if they are members of unions complying with strict procedures and taking the action as part of a trade dispute with employers. Climate strikers will not be protected, which is likely to deter (quite reasonably) many otherwise supportive workers and skew the demographic profile of participants in favour of those in secure, flexible employment and the self-employed.  This risks encouraging the impression that action on climate change is both less widely supported than it really is, and in any case only a liberal, middle-class concern rather than a non-party-political global emergency. Such impressions play into the hands of climate sceptics and the powerful interests behind them. XR’s international rebellion in April was sustained by participants who came when they were able, using annual leave and turning out in the biggest numbers during the weekends and bank holidays. We were discouraged from risking arrest unless we could afford the consequences; most participants could not and so contributed in other ways. By contrast, calling a general climate strike creates a dilemma for many workers between showing their support for climate action and risking jobs that they can ill afford to lose. The youth strikers are principled and courageous, but their strikes are not likely to cost them their livelihoods. The urgency of the need for action on climate change and ecosystem collapse calls for desperate measures. But I fear that calling a general strike in September will weaken the cause, not strengthen it.Tom SinclairOxford • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"The death of thousands of tufted puffins in the Bering Sea may have been partly caused by the climate breakdown, according to a study. Between 3,150 and 8,500 seabirds died over a four-month period from October 2016, with hundreds of severely emaciated carcasses washed up on the beaches of the Pribilofs Islands in the southern Bering Sea, 300 miles (480km) west of the Alaskan mainland. Researchers believe the birds died of starvation partly caused by a loss of energy-rich prey species, which was triggered by increased sea and atmospheric temperatures, as well as reductions in winter sea ice recorded since 2014. Tufted puffins breeding in the Bering Sea feed on fish and other marine invertebrates, which in turn feed on plankton. The loss of nutritious prey species caused by the climate crisis is also affecting populations of the Atlantic puffin around Britain and Iceland. Researchers in the journal Plos One documented the Bering Sea “wreck”, or mass die-off, with the help of a citizen science programme in which tribal and community members on St Paul Island recovered more than 350 carcasses of adult birds in the process of moulting, a vulnerable moment in the bird’s lifecycle when they require plentiful food. According to the study, by Timothy Jones of the citizen science Coasst programme, at the University of Washington, and Lauren Divine, from the Aleut community of St Paul Island’s ecosystem conservation office, puffins typically made up fewer than 1% of recovered carcasses in the region in previous years. In this die-off, 87% of carcasses were puffins, with the remainder being the crested auklet, another North American seabird. Increased sea temperatures have reduced food resources for puffins in the southern Bering Sea, as some marine species shift further north. Puffins spend much of their lives at sea, only returning to land to breed each spring. Similar reductions in food supplies close to traditional breeding grounds are also pushing Atlantic puffins further north. It is predicted Atlantic puffins are unlikely to be seen south of the northernmost islands of Scotland by the second half of this century. A seabird wreck along the Atlantic coasts of Britain, Ireland and Spain after the storms of 2013-14 resulted in the deaths of at least 54,000 birds, of which 55% were Atlantic puffins. The long-term impact of such events is not well understood but fewer than 60% of 2013’s breeding adults returned to the small Welsh island of Skomer the following year. Divine said the documentation of the Bering Sea die-off would not have been possible without the carcasses and observations collected by the citizen science group, which has been surveying seabirds for 17 years. “Island residents collected high-quality data in real time and provided Coasst with a detailed context for their analysis,” she said. “Without the positive and mutually beneficial relationship built over years of collaboration, this massive die-off of tufted puffins would have gone unreported in the scientific community.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt seems that parts of the German mainstream media are becoming more cautious with the information warmist scientists feed them.
For example Axel Bojanowski of Der Spiegel here writes a report about Richard Muller’s “CALL me a converted skeptic” opinion piece that appeared in the “New York Times”, which the German and international warmist media gleefully pounced upon.

But Bojanowski took a deeper look at Muller and discovered that all is not well with the “converted skeptic”, writing:
However, looking more closely, the showstopper turned out to be a fake: Namely, with Muller, it turns out he is not in any way a former skeptic who just changed his mind. Already in 2003 he wrote in ‘Technology Review’, that his opinion was that ‘carbon dioxide as a gas emitted from fossil fuels is the biggest polluter in the history of man.’ It is likely that CO2 will ‘have severe and detrimental effects on global climate’.”
Bojanowski then brings up Muller’s BEST study and his claims that global surface temperatures have risen 1°C over the last 50 years and that if CO2 continues to rise in China unhindered, the climate could warm another 1°C in the next 20 years. To this Bojanowski adds:
Climate scientist Judith Curry of Georgia Institute of Technology in the USA however wanted nothing to do with this conclusion and refused to have her name as one of the authors of the Best-Project. Curry has made a name for herself as a ‘climate realist’ – she is fighting against the polarization of climate science by ‘skeptics’ and ‘alarmists’.
When influential media outlets like Spiegel start taking a second look, you can pretty much guess what’s in the pipeline for the months and years ahead. Indeed the global warming scare has its best days behind it.
In a way, this is Der Spiegel indirectly slapping down the New York Times.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHooray, Spiegel reports on the Antarctic sea ice record! Though, the piece was pretty much buried in the back pages. Yet, thanks to science reporter Axel Bojanowski, Spiegel at least mentions that the South Pole did set a sea ice record last month, and even presented the following NSIDC chart:

September sea ice extent at the South Pole keeps growing. Chart source: National Snow and Ice Data Center, USA
Spiegel reports:
While sea ice at the north pole this summer disappeared like never before since satellite measurements began in the 1970s, sea ice at the south pole set a counter record: Never has so much ice surrounding Antarctica covered such a large area at this time of the year since satellite measurements began in the late 1970s.”
Isn’t it nice pushing it right back into the faces of warmists?
Of course, we are told that the loss of the north polar sea ice is due to warming. So would it not be logical to blame the sea ice increase at the south pole on cooling? No! says the NSIDC. Spiegel writes:

For the Arctic, it’s global warming. But for the Antarctic, it’s local phenomena! And if we hold our horses for just little while longer, surely the spinsters at the NSIDC will even find a scientific explanation blaming the southern sea ice increase on global warming.

"Madrid may be about to become the first European city to scrap a major urban low-emissions zone after regional polls left a rightwing politician who views 3am traffic jams as part of the city’s cultural identity on the cusp of power. Isabel Díaz Ayuso, who is expected to become the new Popular party (PP) president of the Madrid region, believes night-time congestion makes the city special and has pledged to reverse a project known as Madrid Central, which has dramatically cut urban pollution. The PP’s mayor-in-waiting, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, under whose remit the scheme falls, vowed that his first action would be to “address” Madrid Central. “It was one of the pillars of our campaign,” he said. The PP would instead prioritise street cleanliness and conservation, he added. During the election campaign, Ayuso told El Pais: “I do not think [traffic jams] are a reason for enjoyment but it is a sign [of the] identity of our city, that the street is always alive.” Congestion is “part of the life in Madrid”, she said, adding that the city’s nightlife “goes hand in hand with traffic jams”. A reversal of the popular Madrid Central system would mark the first time a major European city had turned the clock back on clean air reform. The scheme has attracted the ire of conservatives as a totem of the outgoing Mas Madrid movement and its leftwing leader, Manuela Carmena.  Greeting the election result on Sunday, Javier Ortega Smith, the secretary-general of Vox, the PP’s prospective far-right coalition partner, said: “Starting tomorrow, Madrid Central is over.” An estimated 30,000 Spaniards die each year due to air pollution, according to the European Environment Agency. Within a month of its launch last November, Madrid Central had cut urban traffic by up to 24% and nitrogen oxide (NOx) levels by 38%. CO2 emissions also fell by 14%. Pollution tests around the city’s central Plaza del Carmen station last month found that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels had plunged by almost 50% compared to 2018, reaching their lowest point since 2012. Nuria Blázquez-Sánchez, a spokeswoman for the Ecologists in Action campaign group, said: “Madrid Central has improved air quality even more than expected. City centre residents are happy with the LEZ [low-emissions zone] and voted massively for Manuela Carmena. “Reversing such a successful project will have severe consequences for public health, particularly the health of vulnerable people like children, pregnant women and the elderly.” Carmena is a popular figure and Mas Madrid emerged the largest single party from the polls, but without a governing majority. The centre-right Ciudadanos says it will not talk to Vox, but is thought likely to join a de facto coalition if an accommodation between the extreme right party and the PP emerges from post-election haggling. Even then, dismantling Madrid Central may be a complicated affair, with environmentalists mounting a rearguard defence of the pollution measure in the city council and courts of law. The LEZ was introduced after the European commission threatened Spain with legal action unless it complied with the air quality directive."

"As the Australian election approached, the UK parliament declared a national climate emergency. Perhaps, with a different electoral outcome, Australia would have followed suit. Instead, at least for the next three years, we will ignore the emergency while chasing the mirage of coalmines promising to create thousands of jobs. That mirage began to fade almost immediately with the announcement that the China Stone project, right next to Adani’s Carmichael mine project in the Galilee Basin, had suspended its bid for mining leases. Other projects in the basin have been on hold for years. The prospects for the Carmichael mine are not much better, at least in the absence of a large injection of public money (which may now be on the cards). Adani announced in November that it would provide $2bn of its own money to fund the project. Gautam Adani could afford to spend this much if he chose to do so, but has so far shown no sign of willingness to pour such a large proportion of his personal wealth into an obvious dud. Such announcements have been made before and nothing has happened. The coal boom of the last decade will fade away, whatever Australian governments do. By contrast, the climate emergency is not going away and will force itself on our attention sooner or later. When it does, we will face the need to reduce our emissions rapidly and to levels well below the very soft target the current government has set itself. To match the commitments of comparable countries, Australia would need to cut emissions in 2030 by at least 40% relative to 2005. Moreover, a central point of the Paris agreement in 2015 was recognition that these initial commitments were inadequate and would need to be ratcheted up over subsequent rounds of negotiation. By the time we return our attention to the climate crisis, we will be facing a policy emergency. Emergencies are costly. Problems that could have been addressed efficiently at low cost over a number of years turn into crises that must be addressed immediately with whatever measures are available. A few examples illustrate the point. The first step in any serious program of emissions reduction is the transition away from coal-fired electricity generation. If we had implemented Kevin Rudd’s carbon pollution reduction scheme in 2012, or maintained the Gillard government’s carbon price, or even adopted the clean energy target proposed by the Finkel review in 2017 we would, like other developed countries, be on the road to coal-free electricity. The UK, which relied on coal for 50% of its electricity in the early 1990s, introduced emissions trading in 2002, and is now within a few years of eliminating coal-fired power altogether. As things stand, however, Australia will be faced with the necessity of making the same transition over a period of perhaps five to 10 years. That will entail massive investment in solar PV, storage and wind, totalling perhaps $100bn. Given the uncertain environment created by decades of policy reversals, governments will need either to undertake this investment directly or provide long-term guarantees. At the same time, the existing coal fleet will need to be closed down as rapidly as possible. Any investment in new or refurbished plants financed by the current government will be entirely wasted. The story is similar with respect to transport. In 2014 the Climate Change Authority (of which I was then a member) proposed a light vehicle fuel-efficiency standards which would have saved motorists money over the life of a vehicle, while substantially reducing emissions. More recently, the emergence of electric vehicles has provided new opportunities for decarbonisation. The current government rejected the fuel-efficiency scheme and has derided electric vehicles – supposedly it might have an electric vehicles policy by mid-2020. The result of this delay is that when we get serious about the climate emergency, we will have a large fleet of some of the world’s most fuel-inefficient cars, many of them nearly new. The efficient option of providing subsidies for electric vehicles, as Norway has done, will be too slow to achieve the necessary reduction in emissions. So we will be forced to adopt some form of “cash for clunkers” scheme, in which people are paid to scrap old, inefficient vehicles. This was a terrible idea when it was proposed by Julia Gillard as an alternative to the carbon price she had promised would never be introduced and was promptly scrapped once the 2010 election produced such a price. But by the time we start taking action, it will be one of the few options capable of producing the rapid shift we will need. Extending this analysis across the economy, it’s clear that emergency measures to reduce emissions will be very costly, compared with the efficient measures we could have adopted with a bipartisan commitment. That’s the bad news. The good news is that the cost of an emergency response, while large compared with an efficient policy, will be very small in relation to an economy with an annual output, by 2030, of $2tn a year or more. To see this, we can turn to the estimates prepared for the government’s election campaign by Brian Fisher of BAEconomics. These worst-case numbers, higher than the costs of the most radical emergency measures, amount to around $50bn a year, or 2.5% to 3% of national income. That’s a lot of money – like adding a new program on the scale of the NBN or the submarine contract every year for five to 10 years. At the same time, it’s small enough that it would barely be noticed against the background of the general fluctuations in the economy. The average household has lost far more from the wage stagnation of the last decade. As far as the government budget is concerned, the likely impact is comparable to that of increasing health expenditures arising from our increased life expectancy and the development of new treatments. More importantly, the cost of an emergency response to climate change is trivial compared with the benefits of stabilising the global climate at a level that is livable for humans and the natural environment. We are currently shirking our contribution to this global public good, and free riding on the efforts of others. But sooner or later we will have to pay our share. • John Quiggin is professor of economics at the University of Queensland.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you wonder why more and more among us are becoming skeptical of the claims made by the climate institutes, with some of us even believing they’ve long become crackpots and charlatans, then the following German ZDF public television video (in German) demonstrates why. H/t: kaltesonne.de/

When the Arctic set a record minimum sea ice extent this year, the media exploded with end-of-the world headlines claiming that man-made CO2 was driving the planet to the brink. But as the above video shows, the science changes completely when cold records are set. In the clip, ZDF television interviews scientists from the government-funded Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) to explain the Arctic record minimum and the Antarctic record maximum.
To ZDF’s credit they do say at the 1:40 mark that the 2007 Arctic minimum was due to a weeks-long high pressure system that pumped warm winds up into the Arctic, thus accelerating the melt. However, they then say that man had a hand in it. To support that, they interview Prof. Dr. Peter Lemke of the Alfred Wegener Institute at the 2:00 min mark.
There is no explanation for this other than the increase in man-made CO2.”
I’m not a professional reader of facial expressions, but to me he really does seem to have a hard time keeping a straight saying this, and it reminds me of an old great classic song by the Eagles.
At the 2:17 mark, Dr. Marcel Nicolaus describes this summer’s expedition to the Arctic with ice-breaking research ship Polarstern, saying:
We would have liked to have gone to the North Pole, but the ice was so thick that even the Polarstern could not manage it.”
The ZDF report then turns its attention to the Antarctic, saying at the 2:26 mark (my emphasis):
On the other side of the globe at the Antarctic, satellites have measured this the greatest ice extent since the start of observations. For the science, this is nothing unusual because the sea ice surrounding the South Pole has little to do with with climate events, and have much more to do with wind and weather.”
Prof. Dr. Peter Lemke explains how this all works:

When the wind gets stronger in the Antarctic, then the ice gets spread out, meaning the sea ice area expands, and in the spaces between the ice chunks it is cold enough for new ice to form.”
Like we are all going to buy that. Lemke doesn’t offer any words on increased albedo leading to more cooling, like the reverse is at play in the Arctic, or why the wind explanation works for the Antarctic, but not the Arctic.
At the 3:16 mark, the ZDF reports then warns us in a grave tone:
But global warming will soon make it’s mark also over the South Pole. Most scientists agree on that.”
Lemke then adds that Antarctica was once ice-free and sea levels 70 meters higher. But this time:
Now we are helping the sea level to rise 70 meters; it will of course take several thousand years before that happens. But then we will have to move all the coastal cities that we have built and move them.”
The ZDF adds one final, comical warning with more grave tones at the 3:53 mark:
Global warming is not only threatening nature, but also human civilization. At least as we know it.”
Oh brother.
My conclusion is borrowed from that Eagles song: “I’d thought you’d realize by now. There aint no way to hide your lying eyes.”
The science is just getting worse and worse, and is turning into a freak sideshow. Nobody can take this nonsense seriously anymore.

"Hundreds of thousands of children and young people are walking out of lessons around the world on Friday as the school strike movement continues to snowball. Climate strikes were planned in more than 1,400 cities in more than 110 countries. Organisers say the number of young people taking part is set to top the 1.4 million people who participated in the global day of strikes in March.  The global campaign – inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg – comes amid increasing concern about the unfolding climate crisis, especially among young people. Last year, the UN’s leading scientists warned that there were just 12 years to limit climate catastrophe. Earlier this month, another UN report warned that the widespread collapse of ecosystems was putting humanity itself at risk. And just last week it emerged that the Antarctic ice is melting much faster than previously feared and global atmospheric CO2 emissions reached a record level of 415ppm. The school strike movement started in August when Thunberg, then 15, held a solo protest outside the Swedish parliament. Since then hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren have taken part in strikes each week around the world from Australia to Canada, Ghana to Germany. In the UK, more than 100 school climate demonstrations have been planned and organisers say they will focus on the need for radical reform of the education system to address the ecological crisis. Noga Levy-Rapoport, of the UK Student Climate Network which helped organise the events, said climate breakdown posed “a grave threat to life on Earth”. “In order to properly address the crisis, we need our educational institutions to be hubs of sustainability that provide a space for learning and teaching to prepare today’s students to not only be those that lead a just transition, but to prepare for a changing world,” she said. Last month UK youth strikers and Thunberg met Westminster party leaders to highlight the scale and scope of the unfolding crisis. They have now written an open letter to the UK’s trade union movement asking it to get behind a transformative green new deal and support the climate strikes. In a piece in Friday’s Guardian, Thunberg and other strikers from around the world call on adults to join them in a general strike in September. Bhavreen Malhotra Kandhari, a school pupil who is due to take part in strikes in India, said: “We have learned that if we don’t start acting for our future, nobody else will make the first move. Once again our voices will be heard on the streets, but this is not just up to us.” In Australia Eloise Kieler, a school striker from Sydney, said she felt she had no choice but to walk out of lessons. “Despite watching the climate crisis unfold, despite knowing the facts, politicians don’t act, the fossil fuel industry keeps making huge profits,” she said. “This is our future: so we will walk out of school, quit our college lessons, and take to the streets to say enough is enough. Wouldn’t you go on strike too, if you thought doing so could help protect your own future?”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA sudden blast of cold polar air accompanied by heavy precipitation led to heavy snowfall in the Alps at levels below 1600 meters. Read here (in German).

Snow falls in August under 1600 meters elevation in southern Germany.
Up to 35 cm of snow fell at some locations. Wetter.24 reports:
Low pressure system “Christine” delivered heavy rains in southern Germany and even the first snow in the Alps. Some passes in the Alps had to be closed. After steady snowfall, several Swiss Alp passes had to be closed for traffic on Friday evening. Streets around the Gotthard range were hit especially hard by the snowfall.”
Imagine the surprise of German vacationers returning from Italy over the Alps and being told to turn back because of snow in the summertime! Wetter.24 continues:
The snow line dropped from the northwest and then a cold polar air mass was fed down to the Alps region (see Figure 3).

Snow line at times at 1600 meters. On Friday it was already snowing at 2000 meters and during the past night the snow line dropped to 1600 meters, and even less at some localities, thus many peaks are now covered with a blanket of snow.
A total of 21 cm of snow fell on Säntis from Friday morning to Saturday morning. On the Zugspitze 45 cm was reported, of which 35 cm fell during the last 24 hours. The rest fell during the night of Thursday to Friday (see Fig. 4). In the figure it can be seen that especially the north side is hit by the first snowfall. It is however not unusual that winter shows up for the first time in the Alps at the end of August.”
Oh, now I get it: snowfalls and skiing are “rare and a thing of the past” only in the dead of winter. But snows in August, on the other hand, are completely normal?
Gee, climate science is making more and more sense with every passing day.
Finally, I was just sent the following chart depicting Germany’s summertime temperatures for the last 16 years.

Runaway warming? Looks like it ran away for good 10 years ago – and it’s not coming back. (Chart from Josef Kowatsch).

Share this...FacebookTwitterMost of you may have seen this already, but it is always good as a reminder. Friedman schooling the hopeless ideologue Phil Donahue.

If you want to know where the masses are worse off, it is exactly in the kinds of societies where they depart from that. The record of history is absolutely crystal clear that there is no alternative way so far discovered of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by a free enterprise system.”
He comments futher on Donahue’s naiveness:
You know I think you’re taking a lot of things for granted. And just tell me where in the world do you find these angels who are going to organize society for us? I don’t even trust you to do that.”
Brilliant.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen the Arctic set a record sea ice minimum back in August, the European mainstream media and government funded climate institutes howled in a deafening, days-long chorus of “global” climate Armageddon.

In late September, Antarctic sea ice hit an all-time high, reaching the highest level since modern data-recording began. Chart source: National Snow and Ice Data Center.
Now fast forward one month to late September 2012 with the sea ice peaking at the opposite end of the planet, i.e. Antarctica. Knowing that the media has grown particularly sensitive to weather extremes, you’d think this current weather extreme around Antarctica would have set off a similar reaction. Any extreme, we are told, is proof of global warming.
All that extra ice beyond the 70°S latitude will reflect the sun’s precious heat back out into space, thus cooling the water even further, which means more ice will eventually develop, and thus there’s a real risk of reaching a dangerous and irreversible tipping point into unstoppable warming-induced cooling.
So why haven’t the media reacted? Well, there’s a limit to just how far the public and politicians, as gullible as they are, can be fooled. The media know where that line is: in Antarctica. When a cold, bitter and snowy winter strikes, only absolute morons actually believe that it is induced by global warming, and the media know that there are enough of them making up their readership. But when it comes to believing that global warming causes 19.5 million sq km of ice to form around Antarctica, even the media do not expect its dimwit readers to believe that. So they are keeping completely deaf and dumb about it. Informed readers, after all, are the last thing they want.

So not a peep of this has been mentioned anywhere in the German mainstream media.
If we google “Rekordeis” and limit the search to the last 7 days, we get thousands of reports of the Arctic melting, although it’s old news, but no reports of Antarctic sea ice setting a new all-time maximum.
Except for stories at German skeptic blogs EIKE and Science Skeptical, there’s nothing about this extraordinary event occurring at the South Pole in the major media outlets like German public television and radio, Spiegel, Bild, and at the major dailies. Also the main German climate institutes like the PIK, AWI and MPI are completely silent about it. They have no way of explaining this one.
So what can we conclude from this? The media saying absolutely nothing about this says a lot!
This is one genie they are not going to be able to keep bottled up.
ANTARCTIC SEA ICE HITS ALLTIME RECORD HIGH!
Get used to it.

"It was February 2000 and the Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen was sitting in a meeting room in Cuernavaca, Mexico, stewing quietly. Five years earlier, Crutzen and two colleagues had been awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry for proving that the ozone layer, which shields the planet from ultraviolet light, was thinning at the poles because of rising concentrations of industrial gas. Now he was attending a meeting of scientists who studied the planet’s oceans, land surfaces and atmosphere. As the scientists presented their findings, most of which described dramatic planetary changes, Crutzen shifted in his seat. “You could see he was getting agitated. He wasn’t happy,” Will Steffen, a chemist who organised the meeting, told me recently. What finally tipped Crutzen over the edge was a presentation by a group of scientists that focused on the Holocene, the geological epoch that began around 11,700 years ago and continues to the present day. After Crutzen heard the word Holocene for the umpteenth time, he lost it. “He stopped everybody and said: ‘Stop saying the Holocene! We’re not in the Holocene any more,’” Steffen recalled. But then Crutzen stalled. The outburst had not been premeditated, but now all eyes were on him. So he blurted out a name for a new epoch. A combination of anthropos, the Greek for “human”, and “-cene”, the suffix used in names of geological epochs, “Anthropocene” at least sounded academic. Steffen made a note.  A few months after the meeting, Crutzen and an American biologist, Eugene Stoermer, expanded on the idea in an article on the “Anthropocene”. We were entering an entirely new phase of planetary history, they argued, in which human beings had become the driving force. And without a major catastrophe, such as an asteroid impact or nuclear war, humankind would remain a major geological force for many millennia. The article appeared on page 17 of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme’s newsletter. At this point it did not seem likely the term would ever travel beyond the abstruse literature produced by institutions preoccupied with things like the nitrogen cycle. But the concept took flight. Environmental scientists latched on to what they saw as a useful catch-all term for the changes to the natural world – retreating sea ice, accelerating species extinction, bleached coral reefs – that they were already attributing to human activity. Academic articles began to appear with “Anthropocene” in the title, followed by entire journals dedicated to the topic. Soon the idea jumped to the humanities, then newspapers and magazines, and then to the arts, becoming a subject of photography, poetry, opera and a song by Nick Cave. “The proliferation of this concept can mainly be traced back to the fact that, under the guise of scientific neutrality, it conveys a message of almost unparalleled moral-political urgency,” wrote the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. There was just one place where the Anthropocene seemed not to be catching on: among the geologists who actually define these terms. Geologists are the guardians of the Earth’s timeline. By studying the Earth’s crust, they have carved up the planet’s 4.6bn years of history into phases and placed them in chronological order on a timescale called the International Chronostratigraphic Chart. That timescale is the backbone of geology. Modifying it is a slow and tortuous process, overseen by an official body, the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS). You can’t just make up a new epoch and give it a convincing name; the care taken over the timescale’s construction is precisely what gives it authority. To many geologists, accustomed to working with rocks that are hundreds of millions of years old, the notion that a species that has been around for the blink of an eye was now a genuine geological force seemed absurd. Few would deny we are in a period of climatic turmoil, but many feel that, compared with some of the truly apocalyptic events of the deep past – such as the period, 252m years ago, when temperatures rose 10C and 96% of marine species died – the change so far has not been especially severe. “Many geologists would say: it’s just a blip,” Philip Gibbard, the secretary-general of the ICS, told me. But as the idea of the Anthropocene spread, it became harder for geologists to ignore. At a meeting of the Geological Society of London, in 2006, a stratigrapher named Jan Zalasiewicz argued that it was time to look at the concept seriously. Stratigraphy is the branch of geology that studies rock layers, or strata, and it is stratigraphers who work on the timescale directly. To Zalasiewicz’s surprise, his colleagues agreed. In 2008, Gibbard asked if Zalasiewicz would be prepared to assemble and lead a team of experts to investigate the matter more deeply. If the group found evidence that the Anthropocene was “stratigraphically real”, they would need to submit a proposal to the ICS. If the proposal was approved, the result would be literally epoch-changing. A new chapter of Earth’s history would need to be written. With a mounting sense of apprehension, Zalasiewicz agreed to take on the task. He knew the undertaking would not only be difficult but divisive, risking the ire of colleagues who felt that all the chatter around the Anthropocene had more to do with politics and media hype than actual science. “All the things the Anthropocene implies that are beyond geology, particularly the social-political stuff, is new terrain for many geologists,” Zalasiewicz told me. “To have this word used by climate commissions and environmental organisations is unfamiliar and may feel dangerous.” What’s more, he had no funding, which meant he would have to find dozens of experts for the working group who would be willing to help him for free. Having spent much of his career absorbed in the classification of 400m-year-old fossils called graptolites, Zalasiewicz did not consider himself a natural people manager. “I found myself landed in this position,” he said. “My reaction was: goodness me, where do we go from here?” Working out the age of the planet has always been a fraught business. The Bible stated that God created everything in six days, but it wasn’t until the 17th century that scholars made a concerted effort to work out precisely when that week might have been. For some time, the estimate of one scholar, an Irish archbishop named James Ussher, held sway: the world began on 23 October 4004 BC. Then, in the late 18th century, a different theory emerged, one based on the close observation of the natural world. By studying the near-imperceptibly slow process of the weathering and forming of rocks, thinkers such as the Scottish landowner James Hutton argued that the Earth must be far, far older than previously thought. The invention of geology would go on to transform our sense of our place in existence, a revolution in self-perception similar to the discovery that the Earth is not at the centre of the universe. Human beings were suddenly an astonishingly recent phenomenon, a “parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity”, as James Joyce once wrote. During the almost inconceivable expanse of pre-human time, successive worlds had risen and collapsed. Each world had its own peculiar history, which was written in rock and waiting to be discovered. In the early 19th century, geologists began naming and organising different rock formations in a bid to impose some order on the endless discoveries they were making. They used clues within the rock layers, such as fossils, minerals, texture and colour, to tell when formations in different locations dated to the same time period. For instance, if two bands of limestone contained the same type of fossilised mollusc, alongside a certain quartz, it was likely they had been laid down at the same point in time, even if they were discovered miles apart. Geologists called the spans of time that the rock formations represented “units”. On the timescale today, units vary in size, from eons, which last for billions of years, to ages, which last for mere thousands. Units nestle inside each other, like Russian dolls. Officially, we live in the Meghalayan age (which began 4,200 years ago) of the Holocene epoch. The Holocene falls in the Quaternary period (2.6m years ago) of the Cenozoic era (66m) in the Phanerozoic eon (541m). Certain units attract more fanfare than others. Most people recognise the Jurassic. As geologists began dividing deep time into units, they came up against the difficult question of boundaries – defining precisely where one phase of history transitions into the next. In the late 19th century, it was recognised that if the field was to advance, global cooperation and coordination would be necessary. The International Commission on Nomenclature, the forerunner of the present-day ICS, was established during a congress in Bologna in 1881 with the mandate of creating an international language of geology, one that was to be enshrined in the timescale. The task of interpreting and classifying 4.6bn years of Earth history continues today. Geologists have barely begun to describe the Precambrian eon, which spans Earth’s first 4bn years. Meanwhile, well-studied units are revised as new evidence unsettles old assumptions. In 2004, the Quaternary period was unceremoniously jettisoned and the preceding period, the Neogene, extended to cover its 1.8m years. The move came as a surprise to many Quaternary geologists, who mounted an aggressive campaign to redeem their period. Eventually, in 2009, the ICS brought the Quaternary back and moved its boundary down by 800,000 years to the beginning of an ice age, a point considered more geologically significant. Having now “lost” millions of years, Neogene scientists were incandescent. “You might ask: who wasn’t upset by it?” Gibbard told me. Modifying the geological timescale is a bit like trying to pass a constitutional amendment, with rounds of proposal and scrutiny overseen by the ICS. “We have to be relatively conservative,” said Gibbard, “because anything we do is going to have a longer-term implication in terms of the science and literature.” First, a working group drafts a proposal which is submitted to an expert subcommission for review and vote. From the subcommission, the proposal advances to the voting members of the ICS (composed of the chairs of the subcommissions, plus the chair, vice-chair and general-secretary of the ICS). Once the ICS has voted in its favour, it passes to the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), geology’s highest body, to be ratified. Whether or not a new proposal successfully passes through all these rounds comes down to the quality of evidence that the working group can amass, as well as the individual predilections of the 50-or-so seasoned geologists who constitute the senior committees. This did not bode well for Zalasiewicz as he began to put together the Anthropocene working group. In fundamental ways, the idea of the Anthropocene is unlike anything geologists have considered before. The planet’s timekeepers have built their timescale from the physical records laid down in rocks long ago. Without due time to form, the “rocks” of the Anthropocene were little more than “two centimetres of unconsolidated organic matter”, as one geologist put it to me. “If we think about the Anthropocene in purely geological terms – and that’s the trouble, because we’re looking at it with that perspective – it’s an instant,” said Gibbard. Zalasiewicz grew up in the foothills of the Pennines in a house that contained his parents, sister and a growing collection of rocks. When he was 12, his sister brought home a nestful of starlings, which his mother, who loved animals, nursed to health. Soon neighbours started calling round with all manner of injured birds, and for several years Zalasiewicz shared his bedroom with a little owl and a kestrel. (Kestrels, he came to know, are “rather thick creatures”.) He started volunteering at the local museum in Ludlow in the summer, where he met people who were expert in the things he cared most about, such as where to find trilobites. By his mid-teens, he told me, “geology was it”. Now 64, Zalasiewicz is small and slight, with silver hair that sticks out like a scarecrow’s. He has worked in Leicester University’s geology department for 20 years, and presents himself as a quintessential geologist, a wearer of leather elbow patches and lover of graptolites. Yet among geologists, he is a known provocateur. His reputation stems from one of his papers, published in 2004, in which he argued that stratigraphy should throw out some of the terminology that has been in use since the discipline’s earliest days in favour of more modern terms. It was, to some, an audacious suggestion. When I emailed David Fastovsky, the former editor of the journal Geology, who had published the paper 15 years ago, he remembered it well. “The general feeling at the time,” he wrote, “was that it might be possible, but who would dare to take the first shot?” Over the years, Zalasiewicz has indulged in thought experiments that are, among geologists, peculiar. In 1998, he wrote an article for New Scientist in which he imagined what mark humans might leave on the Earth long after we are extinct. His ideas became a book, published 10 years later, called The Earth After Us. Geologists tend to have their minds trained on the deep past, and Zalasiewicz’s forward-thinking approach marked him out. When, in 2006, Zalasiewicz broached the subject of the Anthropocene at the Geological Society meeting, Gibbard recalled thinking: “Well, these two go together very well.” After he was appointed chair of the Anthropocene working group, Zalasiewicz needed to assemble his team. “At the time, it was simply a hypothetical and interesting question: can this thing be for real geologically?” Zalasiewicz told me when I visited him in Leicester last year. “It was arm-waving with very little specific detail. The diagrams were back-of-the-beer-mat things.” Stratigraphic working groups are, not surprisingly, usually composed of stratigraphers. But Zalasiewicz took a different approach. Alongside traditional geologists, he brought in Earth systems scientists, who study planet-wide processes such as the carbon cycle, as well as an archeologist and an environmental historian. Soon the group numbered 35. It was international in character, if overwhelmingly male and white, and included experts with specialisms in paleoecology, radiocarbon isotopes and the law of the sea. If the Anthropocene was, in fact, already upon us, the group would need to prove that the Holocene – an unusually stable epoch in which temperature, sea level and carbon dioxide levels have stayed relatively constant for nearly 12 millenia – had come to an end. They began by looking at the atmosphere. During the Holocene, the amount of CO2 in the air, measured in parts per million (ppm), was between 260 and 280. Data from 2005, the most recent year recorded when the working group started out, showed levels had climbed to 379 ppm. Since then, it has risen to 405 ppm. The group calculated that the last time there was this much CO2 in the air was during the Pliocene epoch 3m years ago. (Because the burning of fossil fuels in pursuit of the accumulation of capital in the west has been the predominant source of these emissions, some suggest “Capitalocene” is the more appropriate name.) Next they looked at what had happened to animals and plants. Past shifts in geological time have often been accompanied by mass extinctions, as species struggle to adapt to new environments. In 2011, research by Anthony Barnosky, a member of the group, suggested something similar was underway once again. Others investigated the ways humans have scrambled the biosphere, removing species from their natural habitat and releasing them into new ones. As humans have multiplied, we have also made the natural world more homogenous. The world’s most common vertebrate, the broiler chicken, of which there are 23bn alive at any one time, was created by humans to be eaten by humans. Then there was also the matter of all our stuff. Not only have humans modified the Earth’s surface by building mines, roads, towns and cities, we have created increasingly sophisticated materials and tools, from smartphones to ballpoint pens, fragments of which will become buried in sediment, forming part of the rocks of the future. One estimate puts the weight of everything humans have ever built and manufactured at 30tn tonnes. The working group argued that the remnants of our stuff, which they called “technofossils”, will survive in the rock record for millions of years, distinguishing our time from what came before. By 2016, most of the group was persuaded that what they were seeing amounted to more than a simple fluctuation. “All these changes are either complete novelties or they are just off the scale when it comes to anything Holocene,” Zalasiewicz told me. That year, 24 working group members co-authored an article, published in the journal Science, announcing that the Anthropocene was “functionally and stratigraphically distinct” from the Holocene. But the details were far from settled. The group needed to agree a start-date for the Anthropocene, yet there was nothing as clean as a colossal volcanic eruption or an asteroid strike to mark the point where it began. “From a geological point of view, that makes life very difficult,” said Gibbard, who is also a member of the working group. The group was split into opposed camps, largely according to their academic specialisation. Initially, when he first proposed the notion of the Anthropocene, Paul Crutzen, who is an atmospheric chemist, had suggested the industrial revolution as the start-date because that was when concentrations of CO2 and methane began accumulating significantly in the air. Lately the Earth system scientists had come to prefer the start of the so-called “great acceleration”, the years following the second world war when the collective actions of humans suddenly began to put much more strain on the natural world than ever before. Most stratigraphers were now siding with them – they believe that the activity of the 1950s will leave a sharper indentation on the geological record. This concerned the archaeologists, who felt that privileging a 1950 start-date dismissed the thousands of years of human impact that they study, from our early use of fire to the emergence of agriculture. “There is a feeling among the archaeologists that because the word ‘anthropo’ is in there, their science should be central,” one geologist complained to me privately. Agreeing the start-date, Gibbard warned, could be the Anthropocene’s “stumbling block”. At the tail end of last summer, members of the working group boarded flights to Frankfurt and then took a 45-minute train west, to Mainz. Over two days, they gathered at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry for the group’s annual meeting. Crutzen, now in his mid-80s, spent much of his career at the institute, and he was present both as a spectator and in the form of a bronze bust in the foyer. I asked him what he made of the progress of his idea. “It started with a few people and then it exploded,” he said. Under the glow of a projector in a darkened classroom, two dozen researchers shared their latest findings on topics such as organic isotope geochemistry and peat deposits. Things proceeded without a wrinkle until the second day, when a debate broke out about the start date, which then turned into a debate about whether it was OK for different intellectual communities to use the term “Anthropocene” to mean different things. Someone at the back suggested adding the word “epoch” for the strictly geological definition, so “Anthropocene” by itself could be used generally. “It’s just a personal view, but I think it would be confusing to have the same term having different meanings,” said a stratigrapher. “I don’t think it would be that confusing,” an environmental scientist countered. In the front row, Zalasiewicz watched with the air of an adjudicator. Eventually, he chimed in. “Certainly, in terms of our remit, we can only work from the geological term. We can’t police the word ‘Anthropocene’ beyond that,” he said. Throughout the meeting, Zalasiewicz seemed at pains to emphasise the Anthropocene’s geological legitimacy. He was aware that a number of influential geologists had taken against the idea, and he was worried about what might happen if the working group was seen to be straying too far from the discipline’s norms. One of the loudest critics of the Anthropocene is Stanley Finney, who as the secretary-general of the IUGS, the body that ratifies changes to the timescale, is perhaps the most powerful stratigrapher in the world. During the meeting in Mainz, I was told that Finney was both a “big phallus of the discipline” and “really vehemently anti-Anthropocene”. Zalasiewicz told me that Finney was an accomplished geologist, but one of a different temperament. “He sees me as someone who tries to bring in these crazy ideas by the backdoor,” he said. “I guess if you’re a geologist who spends your time in the past where you have these enormous vistas of time – the human-free zone, if you like – then to have something as fast, busy, crowded, as science-fiction-like, come into the steady, formalised, bureaucratised array of geological time, I can see it as something you might naturally take against.” When Finney first came across the term “Anthropocene”, in a paper written by Zalasiewicz in 2008, he thought little of it. To him, it just seemed like a big fuss over the human junk on the surface of the planet. Finney, who is 71 and a professor of geological sciences at California State University, Long Beach, has spent much of his career trying to picture what the planet was like 450m years ago, during the Ordovician period, when the continents were bunched together in the southern hemisphere and plants first colonised land. Over the years, he has worked his way up through stratigraphy’s hierarchy. By the time Zalasiewicz was appointed chair of the working group, Finney was chair of the ICS. The two scientists knew each other professionally. Zalasiewicz’s favourite fossils, graptolites, are found in Ordovician strata. But for some time the pair had not seen eye to eye. When Zalasiewicz published his 2004 paper arguing that stratigraphers should cast off their long-established terminology, Finney was affronted by this lack of respect for the discipline’s traditions. In an attempt to find a middle ground, the pair worked on a “compromise paper”. As the writing got underway, things turned sour. Finney began to feel that Zalasiewicz was not treating his suggested revisions seriously. “He would take my comments and he would make tiny little changes but still keep the whole thing,” Finney told me. “When I saw the final draft that was ready to be accepted [by a journal], I said: ‘Take my name off, I’m not happy with this. Just take my name off.’” From then on, their relations assumed a cool distance. Finney only decided to look at the Anthropocene in detail after he began getting comments from people who thought it was now an official part of the geological timescale. The more he looked, the less he liked the idea. “You can make the ‘big global changes’ issue out of it if you want, but as geologists we work with rocks, you know?” he told me. To Finney, a negligible amount of “stratigraphic content” has amassed since the 1950s. Geologists are used to working with strata several inches deep, and Finney thought it was excessively speculative to presume that humans’ impact will one day be legible in rock. As the Anthropocene working group gained momentum, he grew concerned that the ICS was being pressured into issuing a statement that at its heart had little to do with advancing stratigraphy, and more to do with politics. Academics both inside and outside geology have noted the Anthropocene’s political implications. In After Nature, the law professor Jedediah Purdy writes that using the term “Anthropocene” to describe a wide array of human-caused geological and ecological change is “an effort to meld them into a single situation, gathered under a single name”. To Purdy, the Anthropocene is an attempt to do what the concept of “the environment” did in the 1960s and 70s. It is pragmatic, a way to name the problem – and thus begin the process of solving it. Yet if a term becomes too broad, its meaning can become unhelpfully vague. “There is an impulse to want to put things in capital letters, in formal definitions, just to make them look like they’re nicely organised so you can put them on a shelf and they’ll behave,” said Bill Ruddiman, professor emeritus at the University of Virginia. A seasoned geologist, Ruddiman has written papers arguing against the stratigraphic definition of the Anthropocene on the grounds that any single start-date would be meaningless since humans have been gradually shaping the planet for at least 50,000 years. “What the working group is trying to say is everything pre-1950 is pre-Anthropocene, and that’s just absurd,” he told me. Ruddiman’s arguments have found wide support, even from a handful of members of the working group. Gibbard told me he had started out “agnostic” about the Anthropocene but lately he had decided it was too soon to tell whether or not it really was a new epoch. “As geologists, we’re used to looking backwards,” he said. “Things that we’re living through at the moment – we don’t know how significant they are. [The Anthropocene] appears significant but it would be far easier if we were 200 to 300, possibly 2,000 to 3,000, years in the future and then we could look back and say: yes, that was the right thing to do.” Yet for the majority of the working group, the stratigraphic evidence for the Anthropocene is compelling. “We realise the Anthropocene goes against the grain of geology in one sense, and other kinds of science, archaeology and anthropology, in another sense,” Zalasiewicz told me. “We try and deal honestly with their arguments. If they were to put out something that we couldn’t jump over, then we’d hold up our hands and say: OK, that’s a killer blow for the Anthropocene. But we haven’t seen one yet.” The day after the Mainz conference came to a close, a small number of working group members met at the central station and took a train to Frankfurt airport. As the train left the city it crossed the Rhine, a wide river the colour of tepid tea. Buildings became sparse, giving way to flat fields crossed by pylons and wires. For all the years of discussion, research and debate, after the meeting it was obvious that the Anthropocene working group was still a long way off submitting its proposal to the ICS. Zalasiewicz’s favourite joke, that geologists “work in geological time”, was starting to wear thin. Proposals to amend the timescale require evidence in the form of cores of sediment that have been extracted from the ground. Within the core there must be a clear sign of major environmental change marked by a chemical or biological trace in the strata, which acts as the physical evidence of where one unit stops and another begins. (This marker is often called the “golden spike” after the ceremonial gold spike that was used to join two railway tracks when they met in the middle of the US in 1869, forming the transcontinental railroad.) The core extraction and analysis process takes years and costs hundreds of thousands of pounds – money that, at that point, and despite grant applications, the group did not have. They discussed the problem on the train. “Beg, borrow and steal. That is the working group motto,” Zalasiewicz said, a little bitterly. But in the months that followed the meeting, their fortunes changed. First, they received €800,000 in funding from an unexpected source, the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, a state-funded cultural institute in Berlin that has been holding exhibitions about the Anthropocene for several years. The money would finally allow the group to begin the core-extraction work, moving the proposal beyond theoretical discussion and into a more hands-on, evidence-gathering stage. Then, in late April, the group decided to hold a vote that would settle, once and for all, the matter of the start-date. Working group members had one month to cast their votes; a supermajority of at least 60% would be needed for the vote to be binding. The results, announced on 21 May, were unequivocal. Twenty-nine members of the group, representing 88%, voted for the start of the Anthropocene to be in the mid-20th century. For Zalasiewicz, it was a step forward. “What we’ll do now is the technical work. We’ve now moved beyond the general, almost existential question of ‘is the Anthropocene geological?’” he said, when I called him. The important votes at the ICS were still to come, but he felt optimistic. In Mainz, after the train pulled into the airport, the group made for the departure zone. Among the chaos of wheelie suitcases and people hurrying about, suddenly a voice cried out: “Fossils!” Zalasiewicz was off to one side, eyes fixed on the polished limestone floor. “That’s a fossil, these are fossil shells,” he said, pointing to what looked like dark scratches. One was the shape of a horseshoe, and another looked like a wishbone. Zalasiewicz identified them as rudists, a type of mollusc that had thrived during the Cretaceous, the last period of the dinosaurs. Rudists were a hardy species, the main reef-builders of their time. One rudist reef ran the length of the North American coast from Mexico to Canada. Staring at the rudists encased in limestone slabs that had been dug out of the ground and transported many miles across land, it was strange to think of the unlikeliness of their arrival in the airport floor. The rudists beneath our feet had died out 66m years ago, in the same mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs. Scientists generally believe that the impact of an asteroid in Yucatan, Mexico, plunged the planet into a new phase of climatic instability in which many species perished. Geologists can see the moment of the impact in rocks as a thin layer of iridium, a metal that occurs in very low concentrations on Earth and was likely expelled by the asteroid and dispersed across the world in a cloud of pulverised rock that blotted out the sun. To stratigraphers, the iridium forms the “golden spike” between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods. Now that the working group has decided roughly when the Anthropocene began, their main task is picking the golden spike of our time. They are keeping their options open, assessing candidates from microplastics and heavy metals to fly ash. Even so, a favourite has emerged. From the pragmatic stratigraphic perspective, no marker is as distinct, or more globally synchronous, than the radioactive fallout from the use of nuclear weapons that began with the US army’s Trinity test in 1945. Since the early 1950s, this memento of humankind’s darkest self-destructive impulses has settled on the Earth’s surface like icing sugar on a sponge cake. Plotted on a graph, the radioactive fallout leaps up like an explosion. Zalasiewicz has taken to calling it the “bomb spike”. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here. • This article was amended on 30 May 2019.

"Even without missiles being test-fired into the sky by a hostile regime 35 miles to the north, airline executives might be a little tense next weekend. More than 1,000 of them will gather in the South Korean capital, Seoul, for the big event in the industry’s calendar, the International Air Transport Association’s general meeting.  Many Iata members have a degree of protection from turbulence thanks to deep pockets, airline alliances, sheer size, or national loyalty. But the big issues to be discussed in Seoul may still keep some jet-lagged executives awake at night.  Globally, the industry is still turning a profit. It is on course for a 10th straight year of positive returns, after racking up losses in the financial crisis. Jet fuel is still far cheaper than the $120-plus per barrel airlines had to pay until 2013 but, bar a sharp plunge in late 2018, the price is heading upwards. European carriers in particular are looking shaky, with a combined loss in early 2019 ten times worse than last year’s first quarter – although the collapse of smaller airlines may allow survivors to increase fares. Behind the low yield from passengers is another statistic that might spook the industry: a tailing-off in demand for air freight. If the Trump trade war escalates, storm clouds could appear. More than once this decade, Iata has proudly reported the safest year on record for aviation. Drilling down into the statistics to separate out old turboprops from international commercial flights, the organisation has spoken of “zero western-built passenger jet hull losses”. These modern planes, conventional wisdom had it, did not fall out of the skies. Now the two Boeing 737 Max crashes, with 346 fatalities, have shaken that complacency. The repercussions for an industry that has ordered hundreds more 737 Max aircraft, expecting to retire its older planes and fly further and cheaper, are not clear. Some fear passengers will refuse to fly on 737 Max planes if and when regulatory approval is restored, with a breakdown in trust in the whole process of certification. Back in the days when Britain was a key part of Europe, even international airlines were clamouring for access to Heathrow: tearing down the opposition to a third runway became a key objective. With that one in the bag, the discussion has largely moved on from airports – although Mexico’s decision to scrap plans for a new international hub at the capital has provoked some airline consternation. The new “infrastructure” issue is airspace: airlines see the highways in the skies, in Europe in particular, getting clogged, and the traffic lights malfunctioning due to a lack of staff and strike-happy controllers. Plans for an efficient, pan-European traffic control system, which could both straighten flight paths to save fuel and dampen the impact of local industrial action, have stagnated. As growing protests declare a climate emergency, and other sectors clean up their act, transport looks ever more the problem. And within the sector, aviation has yet to identify even the potential solutions that land-based transport can envisage. “Only a highly [greenhouse gas] emitting volatile fuel has the weight-to-power density that allows you to fly,” says aviation consultant Andrew Charlton. Airlines have clung to a “sustainable roadmap” that looks an ever weaker response to the climate emergency, largely reliant on carbon offsetting. The main plank of that, the Corsia scheme agreed in 2018 via the UN, whereby international airlines will voluntarily report and offset emissions above current levels, has started but not been secured. And, says Charlton, “what seemed like a clever idea is now … looking a pretty relaxed timetable. The airlines think it’s a fantastic win, so you can guess from that it’s not very demanding.” A technological breakthrough will be sorely needed for aviation to continue as is. But schemes to produce clean fuels or electric planes for the mass market are, at best, in their infancy. An eyecatching conference highlight is the presentation of Iata’s diversity and inclusion awards – sponsored by Qatar Airways. Rather than a satirical attempt to rival Henry Kissinger’s Nobel peace prize, insiders stress that this is a serious attempt at redemption after Qatar’s colourful chief executive, Akbar al-Baker, last year stole conference headlines by insisting that only a man could do his job. Only two women, including Flybe’s Christine Ourmières-Widener, sit on the Iata governing board of 31 – but even that figure is better than the ratio of female chief executives, or even pilots, at major airlines."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe following video makes it clear why Peter Elliott Shumlin is one of the dumbest, if not the dumbest, governors in America. That’s a pretty tough accomplishment with states like Oregon, California and Maryland in the field.

Video of what the wind industry is doing to my home state. Sheffield and Lowell Mountain are only a few miles from my hometown. Climate activists in Vermont, once big proponents of wind, are now shocked and aghast. Video source: http://vermontenergyoptions.org/
Shumlin thinks that reducing Vermont’s fossil energy consumption (which is not even measurable on a global scale) by a couple of percentage points will lead to a gentle climate for his state and prevent flooding there (2:25). Watch the video! I don’t know if he’s a swindler, or a complete moron.
So radical Shumlin is when it comes to protecting the climate with windmills that he has become an environmental Jim Jones who is ready to lead the state to commit mass environmental suicide.
And like the followers of Jim Jones, many Vermonters believed, and they all lined up behind the Jim Jones Shumlin’s wind energy movement – cheering on the army of wind turbine builders that would soon invade the state and disfigure it permanently – thinking it would bring them salvation. Today they are shocked and horrified. They now realise the punch is spiked with death.
The video above interviews an entire series of opponents, many are kooky environmentalists, some openly admitting they had been duped by the windpower pipe-dream (e.g. see 7:45 mark). They were all conned by Al Gore’s AIT film. They were all suckered by the “consensus” science that never was. They were manipulated by the media and politicians. And in a state of panic, they all thought something had to be done quickly.

Although many have since woken up to the true horror of the wind energy punch brewed by Shumlin, most are still convinced of man-made climate change. This is because they have been too lazy (or too damn stupid) to actually take a look at the hard data of historical climate.
How can people get so nutty? That’s the question that we often ask about Nazi Germany, isn’t it? It has to do with group-think reaching a certain tipping point. Eventually madness loses its brakes and turns into a runaway train that can’t be stopped. That’s what happened in Vermont.
Let’s recall that Vermont gave Obama something like 68% of the vote in 2008 (the greatest of all 50 states). So when that level of political onesidedness (cluelessness) grips a state, it’s little wonder that really dumb things like Shumlin can happen. The state lost its brakes. The state didn’t used to be that way. Things started to get especially bad after I left 30+ years ago.
Today the tiny state of Vermont is busy permanently altering and industrialising 200 miles of mountain ridgelines with 500-foot wind turbines – thinking this will rescue the planet. This, if allowed to continue, will turn the state into an environmental catastrophe of Soviet dimensions. What will Vermonters gain from it all the sacrifice? A theoretical cooling of the global climate by 0.0000000000041°C over the next 100 years. They’ll still have to buy flood insurance.
Fortunately, it is not only in Vermont that people are sobering up from their drugged green stupor and are starting to focus on the consequences of their runaway collective madness: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/9597461/Soviet-style-wind-farm-subsidies-to-face-the-axe.html

It’s another unusually cold winter striking the continent. Last year, hundreds froze to death. The same occurred in the winter of 2010.

Cold 7-day forecast for South America. Source: http://wxmaps.org/pix/temp8.html
The English-language I Love Chile news site has a report on the cold now gripping vast parts of South America. At least 14 people have died in Chile due to cold over the past few days. According to I Love Chile:

Overall, eight people have died due to cold weather in Santiago, in addition to six others who perished in other the Central and Southern regions of the country. The cold front has caused temperatures throughout Chile to drop well below freezing. Some parts of Santiago reported temperatures as low as -4 degrees Celsius, causing homeless residents throughout the capital to face the cold without proper accommodations.”
According to www.news.de here, the cold is also gripping Bolivia and Peru, where the mercury has dropped to -23°C.
The low temperatures will continue in the days ahead as cold is expected to grip much of South America for the next week, see chart above.
Last week in Argentina, serious frosts led to a declaration of an agricultural emergency and disaster, read here.
The extreme cold is not isolated to South America. In Tasmania night-time temperatures in the South and Liawenee posted the coldest June day in almost 30 years. “Temperatures in some areas fell to almost 10 degrees below average between June 20 and June 28. Fingal and Ross had their coldest June night in 15 years on June 27 with bone-chilling lows of -6.7C and -6.5C recorded respectively.” Hat-tip: http://globalfreeze.wordpress.com/.

"Javier Larragoiti was 18 when his father was diagnosed with diabetes. The teenager had just started a degree in chemical engineering in Mexico City. So he dedicated his studies to a side project: creating an acceptable alternative to help his father and millions of Mexicans like him avoid sugar. “It’s only when you know someone with this sickness that you realise how common it is and how sugar intake plays a huge role,” he says. “My dad tried to use stevia and sucralose, just hated the taste, and kept cheating on his diet.” The young chemist started dabbling with xylitol, a sweet-tasting alcohol commonly extracted from birch wood and used in products such as chewing gum. “It has so many good properties for human health, and the same flavour as sugar, but the problem was that producing it was so expensive,” he says. “So I decided to start working on a cheaper process to make it accessible to everyone.” Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com Ten years later, Larragoiti has patented a fermentation-based process to turn wasted corn cobs from Mexico’s 27.5m-tonne annual crop into xylitol. It is thereby solving a second problem: what to do with all that agricultural waste that otherwise might be burned, adding greenhouse gases to the overladen atmosphere. His business, Xilinat (pronounced Hill-Ee-Natt), buys waste from 13 local farmers, producing 1 tonne of the product a year. This month his invention was awarded a prestigious $310,000 Chivas Venture prize award, which will enable him to industrialise production and scale up production tenfold. Obesity is one of the fastest-growing global health problems. One in seven people are obese and about 10% have type 2 diabetes. Since 1980 the rate of obesity has doubled in more than 70 countries. Larragoiti says that sugary diets are a real problem in Coca-Cola-loving Mexico, which has the world’s second-highest rate of obesity and has successfully taxed sugary drinks to try to combat a main source of the issue. Paradoxically, another corn byproduct – fructose – is part of the problem, used to make corn syrup that has been linked to increasing obesity in the US. “It’s kind of ironic,” Larragoiti says. “High fructose corn syrup is just a bomb of carbs and concentrated sugar that makes a high peak of insulin. It’s many times sweeter than regular glucose. Companies use and pay less and that’s the issue.” Reusing agricultural waste is rapidly emerging as a promising sector for social entrepreneurs keen to tackle global heating and make useful things at the same time. “One corn stalk has 70% to 80% waste by weight when you get down to it,” says Stefan Mühlbauer, of Cormo USA Inc. His company has a pilot plant in Alsace, France, and is building another in Indiana, US, to turn corn waste into a peat moss substitute and a super-absorbent foam for filters or soil. “Farmers are excited as it gives them something that extends their harvest season and they see another source of revenue,” he adds. In Mexico, agricultural waste is often burned, releasing greenhouse gases and creating one of the country’s highest sources of dioxin emissions. “Burning the residue is cheap and quick and may suppress pests and diseases,” says Dr Wolter Elbersen, a crop production expert at Wageningen University & Research. “The disadvantages such as air pollution, loss of organic matter and nutrients are less appreciated apparently. Removing the material for feed or compost, or added value products such as paper pulp or fuels is often not cost-effective, or no labour is available to do all the work in a short window of time.” But thinking in a different way about “waste products” is essential if we are going to conserve scarce resources and feed a growing population, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. “We need to think about the principles in the past, where we had to do much with little, and at the same time apply the technology we have at hand nowadays to succeed in the challenge of feeding the world,” says Clementine Schouteden, who leads the global initiative on the circular economy for food at the campaigning organisation. “There’s definitely a sense of urgency in making sure that we farm in a way that is regenerative, preventing waste but also [creating value from] the waste that is currently not edible, with a food industry making the right options for consumers and for the planet.” Xilinat’s idea has huge potential, according to Sonal Shah, the founding executive director of the Beeck Center for Social Impact + Innovation at Georgetown University, and a Chivas Venture judge. “It’s not just that he’s building a sugar substitute that tastes like sugar but that it’s going to become scalable so every company that uses sugar in its food has the opportunity to rethink what kind of substitute they use,” she said.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans von Storch’s Klimazwiebel here posted an insightful essay by University of Bielefeld sociologist Prof. Peter Weingart titled (roughly translated): “The Limits of Science Advising Policy – Forget About the Opportunities“. Weingart cautions us against allowing an elite class of scientists to shape our public policy.The essay first appeared in Gegenworte – Hefte für den Disput über Wissen (Counterword – Magazine for the Dispute over Science).
What role should scientists have in setting policy for societies? Weingart reminds us that if “2 heads are better than one” then millions of heads are certainly better than a small group of heads. The will of the masses may not produce optimum results, but history shows us, profoundly, that societies run by a few elitists are far worse.
Today, worldwide, and especially in Germany, a handful of cocksure climate scientists, believing to be all-knowing, are attempting to tell society what behaviour is acceptable and insist their recommendations are “without alternative, that there are no other choices”. We’ve heard that before in history, too – and with tragic consequences.
“The democratic system has to do what it is told, and if it doesn’t, then the people are too stupid or just not educated enough,” Weingart sums up the attitude of these climate scientists, who purport to have a “masterplan” that will lead us to paradise-like conditions.
In Weingart’s view, climate science has abused its position in going far beyond policy advising. They now insist that the rest of the world dance to its tune. Weingart cites examples of humans already being forced to alter their behaviour: carbon trading, changing light bulbs, basing purchasing decisions on climate impact, to name a few.
If you can read German, then the essay is worth reading. I’ve translated HIS SUMMARY:
The lesson is quite clear. Science-based politics, or ‘society advising’ is ambivalent. Premature claims of absolute knowledge or political consequences that are without alternative, stemming from scientific insights and findings, are not scientifically justifiable and belong in the category of political propaganda. Scientists cannot be denied their civic right to be politically active, but when they do it in the name of science, then they abuse their credibility and the authority that it is based on. The credibility of science is neither based on exaggerated catastrophe warnings, nor on the promises of paradise-like futures. Rather it is based more on the demonstration of the difficulty of acquiring knowledge, the discussion of conflicting theories, and the interpretation of observations and the disclosure of uncertainties. Therein lie the possibilities, as well as the limitations of their power to convince society and politicians. Above all in democratic societies, scientists are especially challenged not to succumb to the temptation of assuming that their special knowledge sufficiently legitimises them exercising political influence.”
And my summary: Prof. Weingart should be advising politicians.
Quite entertaining is the hissy reaction of a warmist (Georg Hoffmann) in the reader comments, who unwittingly confirms why it is not a good idea to allow scientists (like himself) to have a disproportionate say in shaping public society.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German mainstream media has always acted as Obama’s lawyers, carefully sanitizing and grooming the message to the public to ensure it delivers the right effect.
UPDATE: europe-us-debate4
But I guess there’s no way of spinning what went down yesterday, and so the major dailies have declared victory for Romney.

Before the debate, the German public for the most part had been fooled into thinking that Obama had done a great job so far, and that his re-election should be a shoe-in.
But they also knew that Romney is within striking distance and were told by the media that with Americans you just don’t know what stupid things can happen. And plus they are told there’s a lot of racism in primitive America. If Obama loses, then it’ll probably be because of angry, male, gun-toting racists turning out at the polls.
I haven’t seen the debate yet, but have just scanned a few German headlines:

DIE WELT: First Round goes to Romney
The FAZ: Romney scores in TV duel, but Election is still not decided.
FOCUS: Disaster for the President – Obama was way off his role.
Other leftwing dailies like the TAZ and DIE ZEIT have nothing so far, which leads us to believe they haven’t been able to bring themselves to write about it, or they still haven’t figured out how to spin the event.

"Paul Brown is spot-on in his criticism of how weather forecasts and presenters ignore the continuing drought (Weatherwatch, 28 May). It is as if they are in a parallel universe where the climate emergency does not exist. Wildlife, gardeners, farmers and all who care about the environment are desperate for proper rainfall, especially in central and southern England. Having complained about this on numerous occasions to the BBC, I have given up as nothing changes. Presenters continue to welcome hot and dry weather, and often refer disparagingly to “the risk of rain”. Most forecasts give the impression that broadcasters do not understand the climate emergency, or they don’t care. How about taking on board messages from experts like David Attenborough in their own programmes and reflecting the reality of drought conditions in many parts of England? Presenters cannot change the weather, but their lack of coverage of the urgent need for rainfall goes beyond irritating – it is a dereliction of duty.Linda LennardSt Albans  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"The former Liberal Democrat cabinet minister Ed Davey launched his bid for the party leadership on Thursday, pledging to fight a no-deal Brexit by working with remainers in parliament to make revoking article 50 the legal default if no agreement on leaving the EU is reached by October. Davey, the former secretary of state for energy and climate change, said he would make stopping Brexit the cornerstone of his leadership, but also said the party must broaden its appeal and that he would do so by focusing on the environment. The MP, who regained his Kingston and Surbiton seat at the 2017 general election, is likely to be in a two-horse race with the party’s deputy leader, Jo Swinson, to replace Vince Cable when he steps down in mid-July. Swinson is expected to announce her candidacy later this week. Davey said he would not wait for the results of the leadership contest to begin work with other remain MPs on finding a legal route to stopping no-deal – a prospect boosted by comments made by the Speaker, John Bercow, who made it clear on Wednesday he did not believe no-deal could occur without MPs’ consent. “We want to pass a law that if you got to the cliff edge that the default would be revocation, not crashing out,” Davey said. “People who realise no-deal is a disaster ought to vote for that legislation – I include people in the current cabinet.” The MP said he saw another radical route to stopping no-deal – a vote of no confidence in the government and the formation of a unity government to deliver a second referendum. “I would not go for a general election immediately – the Queen has to first determine if anyone else can form a government,” he said. “She would probably go to Jeremy Corbyn first but I can see MPs across parties, like Tom Watson, Hilary Benn, the SNP, Plaid [Cymru] and Tory remainers, possibly even Tory cabinet ministers, could make it clear publicly that they would form a temporary government with the sole purpose to allow a people’s vote. In those circumstances, we should do that. We have to stop no-deal.” Davey said he could not envisage any future formal coalitions with the Conservatives or Labour in their current forms, because of the Tory position on delivering Brexit and because it would be “deeply unattractive” for the Lib Dems to enter a formal coalition with Jeremy Corbyn. “He has no credibility on this issue,” Davey said. That does not mean the Lib Dems are afraid of entering government again, he said: “I just look at the current bunch and I don’t want to go anywhere near them.” The Liberal Democrat leader is chosen by party members in a postal ballot. To become a candidate, an MP must secure nominations from at least 10% of the Liberal Democrat MPs in parliament, and from at least 200 members from more than 20 local parties. The ballot is usually carried out using the single transferable vote system. Voters rank their choice of leader in preference. After the first preference votes are counted, if no candidate has over 50% of the vote, then the second preference votes of those who cast their vote for the least popular candidate are reallocated, and so on, until somebody has a majority. In the 2019 race however, only Jo Swinson and Ed Davey are running, so the ballot will be a straight head-to-head contest. The leadership contenders are likely to face intense questioning from party members who saw botched attempts to form pacts with other remain parties such as Change UK and the Greens fail. Davey said he felt the successes for the party in the most recent elections put it “in a very different place” now in those discussions, hinting that he could prefer defections from Change UK MPs rather than pacts. “I can understand why a year ago they thought we were not doing well,” he said. “Change UK may have had that view, but they have been proven totally wrong. I would like to see now big players from the major parties having the courage to leave, but not to come to Change but to come to us.” Swinson has previously said the Lib Dems must “own the failures” of coalition, citing some deep cuts to public services, the introduction of the hostile environment and the bedroom tax. However, Davey said he will “never say the coalition was a bad thing” and that the Lib Dems’ difficult reputation in coalition had only been down to their PR. “We played the politics wrong, but we did look after the people who needed looking after and we stopped the Tories cutting far deeper and more dramatically,” he said. “We got the blame for the bad things and no credit for the good things.” Davey intends to draw on his former climate brief to give the Lib Dems another key policy to champion. “Why we haven’t prospered for quite a period, in my view, is that people forgot what the Lib Dems stand for – apart from stopping Brexit. We’ve had success on the back of ‘events, dear boy’, like the Iraq war and Brexit, but that comes and goes – and then what?” Davey said the climate crisis was “the issue” of the next generation. “The science is showing it far worse than we thought when I was in government,” he said. He intends to launch a policy putting tighter restrictions on investment in fossil fuels in the City of London."
"Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, has accused police of stepping out of line by announcing plans to push for the prosecution of more than 1,100 Extinction Rebellion protesters. Deputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor said on Friday that the Metropolitan police had a team of 30 officers preparing cases against those arrested during the protests over Easter, and that he anticipated putting “all of those [cases] to the Crown Prosecution Service for decisions”. Chakrabarti said: “The deputy assistant commissioner would be wise to remember his constitutional role, which is not that of prosecutor, judge or commentator. “The police perform a vital role in preserving the law and keeping the peace, which includes safeguarding the rights of peaceful protesters. The next Labour government will review the statute book to ensure that the right to peaceful protest is robustly protected.” During the protests last month, Extinction Rebellion’s tactics included causing maximum disruption with roadblocks at Parliament Square, Waterloo Bridge, Oxford Circus and Marble Arch held by hundreds of activists willing to get arrested for blocking the streets. Others glued themselves to trains and buildings in a campaign of civil disobedience aimed at raising awareness of the climate and biodiversity crisis that scientists say will have disastrous implications for life on Earth. They managed to block the four key locations for almost a week before police officers began opening roads again. The Olympic gold medal-winning canoeist Etienne Stott was among the 1,130 people arrested. So far, more than 70 activists have been charged over the demonstrations, which police say cost £7.5m and forced them to deploy 10,000 officers on the streets of London. Scotland Yard’s hardline approach comes after Cressida Dick, the Met commissioner, was questioned by representatives on the London assembly’s police and crime committee last week over why her force was not able to clear the streets more quickly. She said the Met had been caught off guard by the scale and tactics of the protest. Protesters’ passivity and non-violence had meant commanders could not send in riot police to clear the streets by force, she said. An Extinction Rebellion spokesman said that any hardline approach by police could play into the hands of the campaign, which seeks to highlight the sacrifices its activists are willing to make for their cause in order to inspire others. “We have seen doctors, we have seen XR youth – kids with their parents’ permission – doing civil disobedience,” Ronan McNern said. “If the Met plan is to take those people and put them through the court system, in a way it serves the purpose of Extinction Rebellion. More people will know who these people are protesting. Either way, we win. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam “If the Met decide to do this it’s them who are going to be adding to legal time, and that’s their decision. On the one hand, they seem to be arguing we are wasting lots of police time. But if they are going to put more costs on the legal system, then that’s their choice.” Further environmental protests, along with US president Donald Trump’s visit in June and demonstrations over the ongoing Brexit debate, are likely to stretch police resources over the summer. Taylor said the Met was equipped to deal with any upcoming actions and said officers from other forces would be called into action if needed. He said Scotland Yard was in discussions with the Home Office to review the current public order legislation – amid fears Extinction Rebellion’s tactics could be adopted by other groups – and called for a stronger punishment of those who break the law."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe EU is clearly frustrated by the lack of progress in advancing the (bogus) climate change issue.

Prof Hans von Storch on EU climate issue: “more as an opportunity to do social experiments”. (Photo source: wikimedia.org/wikipedia)
Rainer Grundmann writes about it at Prof. Hans von Storch’s klimazwiebel blog here and quotes the BBC:
The European Commission believes that policies to cut greenhouse gases will only work if individuals share the vision of a low-carbon society. ‘It’s perhaps been a bit too much doom and gloom in the past on climate,’ one official told the BBC at the launch in London. ‘We are now emphasising the need to inspire people.'”
Too much gloom and doom? Well then they ought to revamp the IPCC 5th Assessment Report so that it inpires readers, and not send them off scurrying under the bed pretrified of Mother Nature’s wrath. All indications are that it will be gloomier and doomier than ever.

Indeed, the issue has been so misused against the public that it has actually backfired in places like Great Britain. According to the BBC:

One of her officials admitted that the UK was suffering from something of a media backlash against climate policies because previously there had been media “overkill” on climate.”

Interestingly, Hans von Storch has an unkind assessment of the EU’s approach. In a reader comment he writes:
If this report is accurate, it describes a sad inability of European elites to take climate change seriously. The issue seems more as an opportunity to do social experiments – such as mass mobilization, steps towards a truly global governance – than dealing with efficiently limiting climate change and protecting society against ‘non-mitigatable’ climate change.”
Moreover, von Storch doubts that fixing the”gloom and doom” practice by using the educational approach of “‘inspiring people’ – without recognizing that the gloom & doom practice caused damage in the trust in policymakers, media and science…” will work at all. He suspects: “…it seems that the EU officials consider the media as culprits.”
It’s the media’s fault! Climate science and EU policy – what a circus.

How many German readers here at NTZ will disagree? Not many I suspect. Hat-tip Science Skeptical.
Germany — Insane Or Just Plain Stupid?
We usually give the Germans credit for being rational, but this coal plant will emit over one million times more carbon this year than all of their nuclear plants would have over the next 20 years, and cost over twice as much to run as any one of the them. Germany’s present strategy will absolutely not allow them to reduce their carbon emissions anywhere near their goal of 40% by 2020.
Unless the German people give up the nice parts of their lifestyle and become insanely efficient, they most likely will not reduce their emissions at all by 2020.

No one thought Germany would be insane enough to shut down their nuclear plants, without a reason and without backup….” Continue reading…
That’s because nobody knew how drugged-up-on-green the Germans have become over the last 20 years. Even the conservatives are marching to the beat of fundamentalist green – in a zombie state, all thinking they are going to get 70 virgins in climate paradise later on.
To James Conca: never under-estimate Germany’s power of collective thinking, and it’s potential to send the entire nation through a phase of insanity.
Yes, I’m sorry to say, and likely violating the rules of being a good guest here, the German leadership did indeed become scientifically, collectively insane – all led on and duped by an elitist class of crackpot scientists, journalists and activists. The proof is in the reality, as so vividly exposed by James Conca.
Now, finally, the conservatives, it seems, prodded along by the Free Democrats, are beginning to recognize their folly and are quietly going back to what really works.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf the science and consensus were solid, then we wouldn’t be having the endless string of failed climate conferences we’ve seen year after year over the last 2 decades. Obviously policymakers have stopped viewing the science as being credible enough on which to base policy.
Clearly policymakers no longer view climate change as threatening. The real threats are indeed economic and financial.
Today Spiegel here writes that there is “little hope of a global worldwide climate treaty” being reached in Doha, Qatar, three weeks from now and that “the chief economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Ottmar Edenhofer, sees negotiations at a dead-end“.
Over the years there have been plenty of non-binding declarations and empty commitments, and Ottmar Edenhofer doesn’t see anything different happening in Doha: “It looks as if not much is going to come out of Doha. The outlook for a climate treaty at the moment is unfortuately not especially good”.
Spiegel adds:
Economics and climate scientists are especially placing their hopes on ‘linking the emissions trading systems’ in the short term between Europe and Australia, and over long term probably also with China.”
That’s it? Only Europe and Australia are willing to “tackle climate change”? Already Doha is dead even before arrival.
According to Spiegel, Edenhofer also adds that “a reform of the German Feed-in Act is necessary”. “The Energy Feed-In Act cost transfer to consumers is not sustainable over the long-term,” said Edenhofer, and that the current system offers “too little competition to lower the prices and to find the best locations.”
In summary, Edenhofer admits that the German Feed-in Act has been a failure. Finally a step in the right direction.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline German daily Die Welt here published a surprisingly anti-alarmist article written by Prof Wolfgang Behringer, a science historian at the University of Saarbrücken.
His conclusion: climate change and ice cap melting (and freezing) are nothing new and that man ought to be grateful it’s warmer, and not be hysterical about it.
Indeed this is the first time in human history where some among us are cursing the warmth. He writes: “The ice at the poles is supposedly melting faster than ever before – but that has occurred many times before. That it’s getting warmer on the planet is good news for man.” (Actually, it hasn’t warmed in over 10 years, but we will go along with Behringer’s overall statement).
Behringer says that so many climate predictions have been shown to be wrong, e.g. more hurricanes because of warming, that climate scientists have adopted a new pattern of argumentation: “The prognosis was wrong, but we are still right.”
Behringer writes that all the horror stories about melting Arctic every August are convenient for journalists for filling in the slow news cycle that is typical during vacation month of August. Warm periods are hardly foreign to the planet. Behringer reminds us: “In the nomenclature of geology, a ‘warm period’ is defined by completely ice-free poles. According to this terminology, we’ve been living in an ice age for a few million years now.”

The warm period of the Holocene over the last 10,000 years (70% of which has been warmer than it is today) has been a blessing for mankind, facilitating the development of agriculture. Behringer cites numerous examples and reminds us that life during the Little Ice Age, let alone the ice age itself, is not anything we would want to go back to.
Behringer then says that the role of the Arctic is minor:

The entire Arctic plays hardly a role. 90 percent of the ice and 70 percent of the world’s fresh water are stockpiled in the Antarctic ice sheet, and it is disputed on whether or not it is growing. At 82.5°C below zero at the top of Antarctic, the risk of melting would appear to be relatively small for even the laymen among us.
As long as it keeps getting warmer, it’s good news. When the Holocene comes to an end, as it was once believed in the 1960s after a few cold years, then we could really be in for the blues. […] With all the consensus on global warming, we are obviously treading on thin ice when it comes to its interpretation.”

Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Behringer teaches at the University of Saarbrücken and is the author of A Cultural History of Climate.

Meteorologist, European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)
(Translated with permission, edited by P Gosselin)
Climate model trends have been providing prognoses (scenarios) for temperatures for the various atmospheric layers for about 2 decades: near the ground surface, troposphere and stratosphere.
According to the CO2 hypothesis, the atmosphere from ground level to the upper troposphere is supposed to warm up while the stratosphere is supposed to cool. However, meteorological measurements show that just opposite is occurring!
Institutes close to the IPCC have been conveying temperature prognoses (scenarios) in the media of spectacular and supposedly dramatic warming trends for surface temperatures for about three decades. However, the atmosphere can not be simply reduced to this relatively thin lower layer, and thus it has to be taken into account as a whole.
Figure 1, above, shows the levels of the atmosphere (image source K.E. Puls).
One atmospheric interaction is that when it gets warmer in the troposphere, it gets colder in the stratosphere – and vice versa.
For this reason there are also considerations and claims by the climate models on how the temperature at various altitudes is supposed to develop according to the AGW CO2 hypothesis.
These involve mainly:
– the lower troposphere
– the upper troposphere (hot spot)
– the stratosphere
1) The Lower Troposphere Model Failure
According to the climate models, global temperatures near the surface are supposed to increase about 3°C during the 21st century: “For the next two decades…a warming of 0.2°C per decade is projected” [1].
But since 1998 there’s been no trace of warming. There hasn’t been any warming in 14 years, despite steadily increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Yet, this did not prevent the IPCC from making the absurd claim:
Progress in modelling…has allowed the specification of very narrow ranges of uncertainty for projected warming….”
But the most recent evaluation of the HADLEY Institute (CRU) up to July 2012 shows that precisely the opposite is true. There’s been a slight cooling over the last 14 years, what many refer to as a temperature plateau:

Figure 2: Global temperature 1850-2012 (Source: http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/nh+sh/)
The contradiction becomes even more stark when IPCC prognoses are directly compared to measured temperatures:

Figure 3: IPCC prognosis vs. NASA sat. data (Source: http://wattsupwiththat.com).
2) Upper Troposphere Model Failure
According to the climate models, the upper troposphere is supposed to show a distinct warming, a so-called “hot spot”:
“Theory states that the hot spot is supposed to be created by additional evaporation, and the additional evaporation transports warmer and wetter air to altitudes where cooler and drier air masses once prevailed.” (read here).
But weather balloons have been unable to confirm this, and in fact show that precisely the opposite has occurred!

Figure 4, left: From data from millions of weather balloons, right: what the models predicted. Source: http://wattsupwiththat.com.
This also means that all models with a temperature prognosis over 1°C or more because of the “sure” water vapour amplification are falsified. According to the Die kalte Sonne website (www.kaltesonne.de/?p=4803):
Only a few people in the climate discussion are aware that CO2 is not the main driver, and that most of the warming is assigned to the dubious amplification mechanism. CO2 by itself only has a warming potential of 1.1°C per atmospheric concentration doubling. It is only through the theoretical assumption of the up-to-now poorly understood amplification mechanism that the warming gets catapulted by the IPCC to  2.0-4.5°C per CO2 doubling, mainly through water vapour and clouds.”
And:
A coupling between CO2 and water vapour is at this time not detectable.”
3) The Stratosphere Model Failure
The developments and effects of ozone, CO2, and the temperature in the stratosphere have long since been well illustrated by the German Weather Service (DWD) in one of its ozone bulletins [2]. There it is stated:
In the stratosphere…the absorption of sunlight by the plentiful ozone trace gas is the main source of heat. …Naturally the absorbed radiative energy must be given off once again. In the stratosphere this occurs…for the most part through heat radiation into space by CO2 molecules. Therefore CO2 in the atmosphere has a cooling effect, ozone a warming effect!”
And also cited there:
While CO2 in in the atmosphere has increased over the last decades, and ozone in the upper stratosphere (40 km) has reduced by almost 20% since the 1970s, (see Bulletin No. 103), …therefore it has to be expected that the CO2-cooling in the stratosphere would have had to increase over the last years, while ozone warming should have reduced. That means the upper stratosphere should have gotten colder over the last decades! Indeed almost every chemical-climate model, e.g. within the scope of the CCMVAL project (http://www.pa.op.dlr.de/CCMVal/) foresaw a cooling of about 1°C per decade for the upper stratosphere at 40 km .”
The actual measurements in the stratosphere between 1980 and 2008 yield completely different results, and are shown in in Figure 5:

 
The German Weather Service explicitly writes:
While the models show a steady and gradual cooling, the measurements at all stations show an entirely different development: A cooling was indeed the case until the end of the 1980s. Over the last 20 years all the temperatures at practically all the stations have remained more or less steady (exception data from Table-Mountain Lidars).”
According to Figure 5) The DWD writes:
…the gradual cooling of the upper stratosphere computed by the models did not occur over the last 20 years…. Therefore there had to have been changes that have compensated for the expected cooling since 1985, and which were not reproduced by the models.”
Summary
The projected temperature changes forecast by the climate models for the various layers of the atmosphere are all wrong!

"On 20 August 2018, Greta Thunberg, then aged 15, did not attend her first day back at school after the summer holidays. Instead, she made a sign that read “School strike for climate change” and stood in front of the Swedish parliament in Stockholm, demanding the government reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the Paris climate agreement. Her protest sparked the international movement Fridays for Future, in which schoolchildren around the world skip class to insist their governments take urgent action to halt the ongoing climate crisis. Since then, Thunberg has given a TED talk on the subject, been named one of the world’s most influential teens by Time magazine, and been nominated for the Nobel peace prize. After she addressed the Houses of Parliament in April, MPs endorsed Jeremy Corbyn’s call to declare a climate emergency, aiming to “set off a wave of action from parliaments and governments around the globe”. Thunberg first became concerned with the climate crisis aged eight after learning about it in school. By the age of 11, she had fallen into a state of severe depression about the world, which led her to stop talking and eating. She has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, OCD and selective mutism, and has said that being on the spectrum has been in some ways an advantage, “as almost everything is black or white”. Thunberg has taken part in protests around the world and to save on carbon emissions she does not travel by plane, doing most of her travelling by train; she is also a vegan. On 30 May, Penguin will publish No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference, the collected speeches of Thunberg, and later in the year will publish Scenes from the Heart, the story of the Thunberg family (all earnings will be donated to charity). On 7 July, the Observer New Review will publish an interview with Thunberg in which readers ask the questions. Submit your questions in the comments section below, email us at review@observer.co.uk or tweet @ObsNewReview by 4pm on Thursday 6 June.

The Climate Team has always claimed that a doubling of CO2 would add 3.7 Watts/m2 to the global climate budget and thus this would fry us all. This fate is their religion’s version of Hell, except we will all suffer this rather than just the “sinners,” thus giving them leverage to force us to do their will. Many bloggers, and some others, notably even BEST, have pointed out that there are many locations that are cooling rather than warming. The warmists would have us believe that these cooling stations are just due to local phenomenon, such as albedo change, land use, site moves, or other changes, and that the warming stations are not due to UHI.
Last year, Willis Eschenbach took a look at Modtran. Modtran is a program that was initially developed by the US Air Force in the late 1980’s that does a line-by-line analysis of the IR spectrum transmitted by the atmosphere. An on-line version is available at the University of Chicago, here. Willis noted that none of the latitude selections would give a CO2 doubling figure higher than 3.2 Watts/m2. He didn’t notice that the default settings in the program include a setting for water vapor at a pressure setting of 1. Any water vapor in the spectrum will lower the CO2 doubling figure.
Here is the result of calculating the outbound long-wave radiation (OLR) or as it is labeled in Modtran, I out. The settings used were: CH4 – 1.8 pmm, Tropical Ozone 800 ppb, Strat. Ozone 1, Ground T offset – 15°C, hold water vapor – Relative Humidity, Water Vapor Scale – at 0, 10, 50, and 90 percent, Locality – 1976 U. S. Standard Atmosphere, No Clouds or Rain, Sensor altitude 100 km, Looking Down. These values were the best available to represent a global average. This produced the following table and chart for various CO2 and water vapor values.
 
 Table 1 is TOA OLR for CO2 values from 0 to 1000 ppm and RH at 0, 10, 50, and 90%.
 
Figure 1 is a chart of Modtran output for 0, 10, 50, and 90% humidity, and CO2 from 0 to 1000 ppm. The radiation (vertical) scale has been inverted so that increasing greenhouse warming is upward. Note that both CO2 and water vapor forcing are logarithmic; increasing amounts have decreasing effect.

With humidity set to zero, the doubling of CO2 figure actually goes to 4.7 W/m2. Any reasonable humidity value drops that number drastically. At 50% humidity, and our current CO2 value, we get a tiny 0.188 W/m2, far, far below the IPCC favored value. Of course humidity doesn’t stay constant. In the tropics, 90% is more typical. In that case, doubling CO2 gets us 0.125 W/m2. This is all before the additional factors of clouds and rain, which will drop the value even further, into the negative territory that Willis noticed here. The blue triangle in the chart and the blue value in the table are the current values with today’s CO2 and global average humidity.
Given the data, Modtran can compute the real outbound radiation over time. The humidity at 600 mbars and the Mauna Loa CO2 values were applied through Modtran to result in Figure 2. This is a “zoom in” on the blue triangle in figure 1, adding the time dimension. The 600 mbar level for humidity seemed a good compromise, as only one humidity figure could be entered.

Figure 2 is a chart of the outbound radiation increase since 1948. There has been a more than 1 Watt/m2 increase in outbound radiation in that interval, despite rising CO2.
Humidity has been decreasing in the upper atmosphere over the last 60 years. That offsets the rising CO2. We saw the cooling in the 70’s but increased solar radiation along with ocean cycles held off the cooling over the last 20 years. That period has now come to an end.
Mother Earth has an excellent thermostat system. Even if somehow average humidity should increase to 50% and CO2 goes to 1000 ppm, only about 2 Watts/m2 will be added. This is unlikely in the extreme, and would add a small fraction of a degree to warming. No one would notice.
My question is: Why have the professional “climatologists” not done the simple work that I did on a lazy Saturday afternoon with my laptop? They must know that water vapor nearly wipes out CO2 in warming the Earth, and that clouds and albedo do the rest. What’s their excuse for this massive “oversight”?

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe all know that Romney is wishy-washy when it comes climate change science, and that us so-called skeptics were not at ease with that. Well, now you can cast your worries aside.
Over the last hours there’s been a lot of buzz out in the media that Paul Ryan has been chosen as Romney’s running mate. Confirmation of that is still pending. If true, that means we have a VP candidate who is a pretty solid skeptic when it comes to catastrophic manmade global warming. Romney is obviously comfortable with that and is using Ryan to reposition himself on the issue of global warming and energy.
What is Ryan’s position on climate science? Here’s what Paul Ryan wrote less than 3 years ago:
To the detriment of the American people, environmental issues have fallen victim to the hyper-politicization of science. The Journal Times editorial board sensibly cautioned both sides of the political divide against this unfortunate trend (“Science must trump spin,” The Journal Times, 12/3/09). At issue in the Journal Times’ recent editorial and on the minds of many Copenhagen observers are published e-mail exchanges from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit (CRU). These e-mails from leading climatologists make clear efforts to use statistical tricks to distort their findings and intentionally mislead the public on the issue of climate change. The CRU e-mail scandal reveals a perversion of the scientific method, where data were manipulated to support a predetermined conclusion. The e-mail scandal has not only forced the resignation of a number of discredited scientists, but it also marks a major step back on the need to preserve the integrity of the scientific community. While interests on both sides of the issue will debate the relevance of the manipulated or otherwise omitted data, these revelations undermine confidence in the scientific data driving the climate change debates.”
Here’s a list of Ryan’s other climate and energy accomplishments:
– voted to eliminate EPA Limits On Greenhouse Gases. [Roll Call 249, 4/7/11].
– voted to block the USDA from implementing its climate raindance. [Roll Call 448, 6/16/11].

– voted to eliminate ARPA-E. [Roll Call 55, 2/17/11].
– voted to eliminate the ban of incandescent light bulbs. [Roll Call 563, 7/12/11]
– voted for Keystone XL. In 2011, Ryan voted for the construction and operation of the Keystone XL pipeline. [Roll Call 650, 7/26/11]
– Paul Ryan’sFY 2013 budget resolution retained a decade’s worth of oil tax breaks worth $40 billion, while slashing subsidies in alternative energy research. The plan called for a $3 billion cut in energy programs in FY 2013 alone. [CAP, 3/20/12].
You can read how Ryan voted on every energy and environment issue here. Expect the debate on climate to gain traction in the campaign in the weeks ahead. We welcome it!

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf there ever was a sign that the issue of climate change is struggling with irrelevance in Europe, and thus has lost its global leadership force, it can be found in this candid (frustrated) view expressed in the Austrian STANDARD: “Disinterest in Climate Change” by Eric Frey.
“Despite Sandy, global warming is a fringe issue in the USA – unfortunately also for Europe.”
In the aftermath of hurricane Sandy, Europeans were quick to scorn America for its lack of interest in protecting the climate. Many blamed the storm on CO2 emissions. Europeans were angered by and indignant at the fact that the issue had not been worth mentioning once during the presidential campaign.
But as Eric Frey of the Austrian Standard writes: Europeans ought to first look at home before criticizing others abroad.
He writes:
Before Europeans express too much outrage over the Americans, they should look at what’s going on at their own doorstep instead. Also here interest in climate protection has gone lame. Euro-crisis, recession, unemployment – with such a terrible economic situation, n one is protesting on behalf of the environment. […]  Emissions trading has no teeth, as certificates cost next to nothing.
Climate protection has no lobby. Even the greens no longer consider it a core issue. […] Thus the upcoming climate conference in Qatar will achieve no progress. The price will be paid by millions of people on all continents – in New Jersey as in Africa. […] The only hope lies in a surprsing technological breakthrough. Ironically, the best news for climate protection comes from the USA: The increasing production of shale gas is replacing dirty coal and is allowing America’s CO2 emissions to fall. That may bring some relief, but it is certainly not a solution.”
There’s nothing else to add.

"Emissions from fossil fuels and volcanoes can explain nearly all of the changes in Earth’s surface temperatures over the past 140 years, a new study has found. The research refutes the popular climate denial myth that recent global warming is merely a result of natural cycles.  Those arguments have always suffered a key physical flaw, namely that cycles are cyclical. For example, El Niño events, which temporarily raise global surface temperatures by bringing warm water up to the shallow ocean layer, are offset by La Niña events, which have the opposite effect. While a given decade might have more El Niño or La Niña events, resulting in a short-term surface warming or cooling, over the long term their effects cancel out. However, climate scientists have had a difficult time explaining exactly what caused a warming event in the early 20th century, between about 1910 and 1945. The average of the climate model runs incorporated in the last IPCC report only accounted for about half of the measured global surface warming trend during that period, and a study published last year suggested the other half could be due to natural cycles. Contrarian scientists like Judith Curry, who is frequently invited by Republicans to testify before US Congress, have often used this discrepancy to cast doubt on the expert consensus on human-caused global warming, arguing that “until we can explain the early 20th century warming, I have little confidence IPCC and [National Climate Assessment] attribution statements regarding the cause of the recent warming.” The new study, published in the Journal of Climate, tackles the discrepancy in part by addressing an issue with ocean temperature data during the second world war, when measurements were more often made from warmer engine room intakes than from buckets lowered over the side of ships. This has resulted in a bias, inflating estimated surface temperatures in the early-to-mid 1940s. The new study removed this bias by focusing on temperatures along continental and island coastlines. Arctic temperature data has also long been problematic. There are relatively few temperature monitoring stations in the region due to its remoteness, but due largely to disappearing sea ice decreasing the region’s reflectivity, the Arctic is the fastest-warming part of the planet. Two of the co-authors of the new study, Kevin Cowtan and Robert Way, previously made strides in addressing these coverage gaps by using improved statistical interpolation methods. The new study goes further, by incorporating Met Office Hadley Centre Arctic sea ice data.  Accounting for the area of Arctic ocean covered by sea ice is an important factor, as lead author Karsten Haustein explains: “If sea ice is treated as ocean, the temperature cannot go below zero (per definition). If it is treated as land, the temperature can fall as low as -50C in winter given there is virtually no interaction with the ocean water anymore. Since warming trends over the Arctic are higher than anywhere else, overall land warming trends will be higher too if sea ice is treated as land. This is by virtue of winter temperatures not falling as low as they used to anymore.” The authors then compared the improved global surface temperature data to climate model runs incorporating influences from human greenhouse gas and aerosol pollution, volcanic eruptions, and changes in solar activity. Overall they were able to explain more than 90% of the temperature variation over the 140-year record. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  They found that the 0.4C warming from 1910 to 1945 could be accounted for by 0.2C warming from human greenhouse gases offset by 0.08C cooling from human aerosol pollution, 0.2C warming from natural factors (mostly a quiet period for volcanic activity plus a small contribution from increased solar activity), and a bit of natural variability plus some remaining uncertainty in the data. Since 1950, the authors found that the 0.8C temperature rise is due to 1.2C warming from greenhouse gases offset by 0.3C cooling from human aerosol pollution and 0.1C cooling from volcanoes and the sun. These findings are important because they improve global surface temperature estimates, explain the causes of the early-20th century warming, and reaffirm that as the IPCC concluded in 2013, humans are responsible for all of the rapid global heating since 1950."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Dutch province of North Holland has realised that windparks are a complete and useless eyesore that blight the landscape, and they save very little CO2. Therefore, the province has decided to forbid their construction. Hat-tip Science Skeptical here.
The North Holland region would seem to be ideally situated to take advantage of the windy North Sea. Indeed it would be difficult to find a more suitable spot for windmills. So if windparks there don’t make sense, what does that tells us about other places? Read here (in Dutch).
As a result, 20 planned windparks have been recently forbidden. Only a single planned token windpark in the Wieringermeer may be built.
The senselessness of the wild construction of weather-dependent windparks is revealed by a Dutch study here. Science Skeptical writes that experts “found out that the real fuel savings, and thus the reduction in CO2 output, is a whole 1.6% of the windpark’s rated capacity.”
Adding it all up, one must conclude that under the present conditions in the Netherlands a 100 MW (Megawatt) ‘name plate’ capacity wind development produces on average 23 MW because of the capacity factor. 4,6 MW (20%) of this has to be subtracted from the final net result because of initial energy investments. From the actual Statline production figures we know that 27% of this 23 MW = 6,17 MW represents the actual fossil fuel and CO2 savings. But from this figure we need to subtract the amount of energy invested in the construction works: 4,6 MW. The net total of fuel saving electricity provided by our wind turbines therefore is 6.17 – 4.6 = 1.57 MW on average over the year. That is ~ 1.6% of the installed capacity. It makes wind developments a mega money pit with virtually no merit in terms of the intended goal of CO2 emission reduction or fossil fuel saving.
This conclusion needs to be made known to anyone thinking about installing a windpark.
Are you listening, Renewables Guy?

"Recycling steel could provide a much-needed lifeline for the UK’s troubled steel industry, a new study has found, and have the added benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Two-thirds of the steel currently used is made from primary production, and most of the remainder comes from off-cuts of the steel-making process, rather than recycled goods. The UK does not currently use all the scrap steel produced in the country, but global stocks of recyclable steel are expected to rise sharply in the coming decades.  A new report predicts that the potential for recycling steel is such that the need for primary production could diminish to near zero in the next 30 years. That would save vast quantities of carbon, in part because electric arc furnaces – used for recycling steel – are much more energy efficient than blast furnaces, which produce new steel from iron ore. Prof Julian Allwood, professor of engineering and the environment at the University of Cambridge, and author of the report, said: “We must move our UK steel-making industry away from primary production towards recycled steel, made with sustainable power. “This green steel model is the only future compatible with our goals for zero emissions. The UK, with its strong climate policy, mature stocks of steel, and great history of innovation in materials science and processing, is perfectly placed to be world-leading with a sustainable steel industry.” Steel goods last an average of 35 to 40 years before they are scrapped, and the UK generates about 10m tonnes of scrap a year. Currently, about 80% of this is exported for processing to other countries, chiefly Turkey and China. The US, by contrast, meets about half of its demand for steel by recycling. Steel production in the UK is about 7m tonnes a year, or less than half of current demand. Recycling steel could make the UK self-sufficient in steel, as well as providing a new industry, the report says. It also calls for an export tariff on scrap steel to encourage the recycling of steel within the UK, as well as better waste management which would allow for improved collection rates and the separation and recycling of steel scrap products. Government support is likely to be needed, but the regenerated steel industry would soon pay for itself, the report found. The steel industry is responsible for about 5% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, making it one of the highest-emitting industrial sectors, alongside concrete. In the UK, emissions from steel were about 17m tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2012, the most recent year for which figures are available in the report. If steel imports were included, that figure would rise to about 26m tonnes of carbon dioxide. Those emissions could be reduced by about three-quarters by employing recycling technology, the report found, but the way in which the government accounts for carbon emissions currently means recyclers are penalised compared with primary steel producers. The report also calls for more research and development into steel recycling and scrap metal, which could help to ensure the metals are turned into high-value components rather than simply melted down into cheap ingots for export. Impurities in recycled steel can prevent this, but better manufacturing and recycling methods would allow for impurities to be removed, and the resulting steel put to higher-value uses. Allwood said such a restructuring would create long-term green jobs and lead to exportable skills and technology, as well as creating a new value for products that are currently undervalued or unvalued. “We can do this with less than half the emissions of making steel with iron ore, and with more renewable energy this could drop much further. This will not happen overnight, but the process has already begun. With private investment and government support, our steel-making industry can once again lead the world and thrive.”"

The following report appeared at the “Die kalte Sonne” site a couple days back. It looks at two views of the IPCC from two renown scientists of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK): Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber and Ottmar Edenhofer. Here it is in English:
===========================
Do we still need the IPCC? Hans Schellnhuber thinks we don’t
By Sebastian Lüning / Fritz Vahrenholt
Ottmar Edenhofer thinks the IPCC is just fine. For him it is completely okay that climate scientists are closely linked to policymakers and that the boundaries between science and politics are completely blurred away. For Edenhofer, the IPCC is absolutely essential.
Hans Joachim Schellnhuber has a completely different opinion and expresses concrete criticism on the IPCC:
The IPCC has to rethink its reason for existence and possibly face serious consequences. The IPCC is a unique mixture of science and politics. For example, the global community of relevant scientists does not select the lead authors of the IPCC report. Rather this is ultimately done by the involved countries. In the end. it is not the lead authors who decide the wording of the summary report, rather it is the representatives of the governments. And it is only this summary that gets really considered by decision-makers worldwide. Therefore, politics crowds out the science. This is not because governments are malicious: They are (as a rule) not so,because it is purely their functional logic to assert short term national interests. […] Because the boundaries between politics and science are completely blurred in the structure of the IPCC, it makes itself unnecessarily vulnerable to attacks. As one possibility from many, why doesn’t the InterAcademy Council (IAC) select the lead authors, i.e. the alliance of national science academies? Up to now the cumbersome regional proportional representation in the composition of the team of authors, foremost the exaggerated demand for completeness concerning the content of the IPCC reports, has led to a watering down of scientific substance.”
In June 2012, Schellnhuber received an honorary doctorate from the Technical University of Berlin. Die Welt wrote:
In 1991, Schellnhuber founded the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and has led it since 1993. He is also professor ot theoretical physics at the University of Potsdam. The Bavarian-born climate scientist was also honored for his political advising.”
===================================
In summary, Edenhofer loves the IPCC just the way it is, but Schellnhuber thinks that politics has ruined it. Schellnhuber of course advocates scientists having the say on how society should be shaped.

Hans von Storch: Policymakers and society must decide, not science
Interestingly, Hans von Storch here thinks science should just lay out the facts, but stay out of politics and let the political process decide what to do next. Scientists should not be deciding policy. What follows is what he said in a recent interview with klimaretter.de. (Klimaretter questions are in bold print, von Storch’s answers in italics):
Is adaptation more a question for science or for politics?
The entire climate issue is a political question. In the past in a false manner, it has been suggested by publcity-loving scientists that certain political decisions should follow certain scientific results. This misunderstanding produced an infinite amount of conflict surrounding scientific details […] The job of science is not to say what the solutions are supposed to look like – it must show which consequences the solution options would have. This assures that in a democratic process a solution is chosen that corresponds to the mix of values of society.
Politicians seem to think its okay to shirk their responsibilities: When it comes to unpopular measures, they say that science forces certain things.
Science was stupid to give in to this temptation and to make itself more important than what is deserves to be…
Science only stakes out the framework conditions. What follows from that and what concrete actions are to be taken must be weighed by society based on its preferences and values.”
I agree with von Storch. Edenhofer is clearly disconnected from reality if he thinks the IPCC is fine the way it is. Schellnhuber thinking the scientific community has to run the show to me is appalling.
Whatever you may think, it’s clear there’s no consensus among the warmists.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSheesh! This is like a Normandy invasion – this one by the climate science skeptics. The Americans have landed on one beach, and now the Canadians are following on another.
First it was Prof Fred Singer of the USA, then the evil Heartland Institute, and now it’s veteran investigative journalist Donna Laframboise of Toronto, Canada.
Donna’s hard-hitting, unflattering book exposing the corruption rampant within the IPCC has been translated in German and is now being launched in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Luxembourg – i.e. the heart of the climate catastrophe regime in Europe.
Note that the skeptics only wish to openly talk about the subject of climate science and to have a little public debate. Why are the warmists so afraid of a little open dialogue? Is their science so weak? Fear is hardly a sign of confidence.
If the German alarmists thought Fred Singer and the Heartland Institute were trouble, wait until they see Donna’s book about the IPCC. Expect a massive smear campaign by the alarmists soon. Hope you’ve got a thick skin, Donna.
So Donna, tell us who is really funding you? What about your ties to Koch Industries and to Big Oil? Surely you’re hiding them. And who is paying you all that money? Are you a climate scientist? Why do you spend so much time hanging out with all those deniers and attending their climate conspiracy conferences? Vee hav vays of finding these things out!
You’ve got a lot of explaining to do, young lady.

And expect friendly e-mails from “investigative” journalists at Die Zeit, or German Public Radio, asking for cordial interviews.

Donna’s climate dissent now spreading in German in Europe.
Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s Die kalte Sonne website here and the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here both have a small write-up on Donna’s book, The Delinquent Teenager Who Was Mistaken for the World’s Top Climate Expert, now being launched in German. They write:
On December 5, 2012, Candian IPCC critic Donna Laframboise is making a presentation at 7 p.m. in Berlin. The topic: just exactly how objective is the IPCC, which was formed to act as a climate referee? The presentation is taking place at the Albrechtstr. 11 in the ‘Haus der Zukunft’ (1st floor). It’s open to the public and entrance is free. Space, however, is limited so it is best to be there early.
Donna Laframboise summarized her IPCC criticism in her book “The Delinquent Teenager Who Was Mistaken for the World’s Top Climate Expert”, appearing in 2011. It is strongly recommended. The book is now available in German at a price of € 19.90 at TvR media publishers: buch@tvrgroup.de.“
Reaction to this book is not going to be pretty.

Some commenters on my previous articles using MODTRAN, here and here, have called into question the validity of using it to investigate the physics behind the CAGW theory. Of course in the 24 year history of MODTRAN, the US Air Force and many other organizations, including climate scientists, have validated the software for their own purposes. The best way to prove that it is valid for the purposes of my articles, is to show comparable spectra from other sources. One commenter claimed the humidity settings were not interpreted correctly. The interface labels do not appear the same in the version used as in his example. His advice was attempted, and the software would not run a fractional entry. The examples below illustrate that my interpretation is correct.
Infrared astronomers are quite familiar with the problem of atmospheric IR. IR astronomy is not easily done on the earth’s surface because the lower atmosphere is nearly opaque to IR. Consequently IR astronomy is done at high altitudes or at very dry locations, or both. The Atacama Desert in Chile, the top of Mauna Kea in Hawaii, the south pole, airborne observatories, or satellites are the favored locations.
The web was searched for any image of the back radiation spectrum. None were found for any temperate or tropical zone. The only spectra found are from the Arctic at -10°C, and the south pole at -30°C. From the spectral shape, it appears that the Arctic data was taken at Summit Camp on the Greenland ice sheet. Those are the next figures with the MODTRAN version for comparison.

Figure 2a and b. The 2a is from Petty (2006), found at skepticalscience here. 2b is from MODTRAN. The scaling is slightly different, the resolution is not as high, the shape is very nearly the same.

Figure 3a and b. Figure 3a from South Pole station here. Figure 3b is from MODTRAN. At sea level, with a clear sky, temperature at 15°C, 50% humidity, and 400 ppm CO2, the spectrum of downward IR, the “back” radiation, looks like this.

"The Liberal MP Warren Entsch has launched a crusade against single-use plastics as part of his new role as special envoy for the Great Barrier Reef. Entsch told Guardian Australia he was inspired by the 10-year-old campaigner Molly Steer – who convinced Cairns to phase out single-use plastics – comparing her example favourably with activists who he accused of “frightening the living Jesus out of kids” to recruit school students to climate strikes.  Entsch said anti-Adani and Save the Reef activists had targeted his office for 18 months, accusing “the anti-fossil fuel brigade of throwing around a distorted and dishonest picture” of the reef’s health that has had a profoundly negative impact on the economy of his region. “We don’t need to save the reef – it’s still going – we need to manage it and manage it well and we’re the best reef managers in the world,” he said. Entsch represents the vast northern Queensland seat of Leichhardt, including Cairns, and has proved an influential backbencher – lobbying for the legislation of marriage equality in the Liberal party. Entsch said a white picket cricket ground fence in Port Douglas made from recycled plastics inspired him to go to re-elected prime minister Scott Morrison on 20 May to ask for a role in reducing plastic waste. Morrison “loved the idea”, he said. “I’m committed in my last term in government to develop a national policy on plastics, micro and nano plastics, to remove them from our beaches.” The policy should cover use, recovery and conversion of plastics and include consideration of a ban on single-use plastics. “I want to see single-use [plastics] out, but it’s much broader than that, and I’ll defer to experts on how we do it.” Entsch said reducing plastic waste is an example of “solutions not slogans” that can make a practical difference to the environment. Entsch suggested that student climate strikers had been “influenced by teachers, academics at university and activists” who presented “a distorted, one-sided” view of the reef’s health. Entsch recounted his experience inviting a group of climate striking students to attend his office to get an alternative view point from a marine biologist and a tourist operator. “What alarmed me when the kids came in – all they could do is talk in slogans: ‘save the reef’, ‘stop Adani’, ‘100% renewables by 2030’. “One young girl was so distraught – she thought the reef would disappear in 10 years. “These kids were well and truly brainwashed … that was disturbing to me.” In 2017, Unesco opted not to list the reef as in danger after reviewing the government’s Reef 2050 plan, a decision it will reassess in 2020. The Australian Institute of Marine Science reported in 2017-18 that trends in coral cover in the north, central and south reef showed steep decline that “has not been observed in the historical record”. The coral reef scientist Prof Terry Hughes’s most recent paper found that the production of baby coral on the reef had fallen by 89% after the climate change-induced mass bleaching of 2016 and 2017. Entsch suggested coral bleaching was primarily caused by warm currents from the northern hemisphere which Australia “can’t stop from coming down” and therefore needs to find “innovative ways to counter”. “It’s the same for plastics – the bulk of it on our seas comes down from our northern neighbours. If we can create world’s best practice and get them to clean up their own backyard then we will reduce the volumes that come down to us.” Entsch says education will be important to encourage people to “minimise the amount they throw out”. He will create a parliamentary friends of the Great Barrier Reef group, and has recruited Qantas, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Asked whether he will have input into the spending of $443m controversially given to the foundation in 2018, Entsch said he will express views but “leave it up to the scientists”. “I am not interested in having a chequebook, I am interested in developing legislation.” Entsch will work with Sussan Ley, the environment minister, and Trevor Evans, the assistant environment minister, who were also appointed in Sunday’s reshuffle."
"It’s no longer possible to deny or ignore: we are in a climate crisis. The truth of the emergency announces itself regularly in our papers, on our phones, tablets and TVs. A headline about the world’s leading scientists declares millions will suffer drought, floods and be plunged into deeper poverty if carbon emissions aren’t halved by 2030 and global heating remains within 1.5C. Another reports that climate breakdown will likely increase the destructive power of storms like Cyclone Idai, which devastated Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe earlier this year – 2 million people were affected by what, according to the UN, may be the southern hemisphere’s worst weather-related disaster. And yet another reveals the destruction of coral reefs while calculating that 1 million species already face extinction. The silver lining, however tarnished, is that now we can do away with the noxious denial that has brought us to the edge of this precipice.  This week the Labour party has announced that it will make the climate crisis a compulsory element of education from primary onwards. It is one example of how our leaders can be proactive in the face of catastrophe. It is the kind of forward thinking that acknowledges the energy young people have brought to our streets. A generation frustrated with umming and ahing from those who really should know better but refuse to accept the woods are burning around them (literally in some cases), have begun to act for themselves. They came to the conclusion that the adults running the show would continue to drag their feet. And who could blame them? In the same week the UK experienced its hottest ever winter day, only a handful of MPs bothered to attend a Commons debate on climate breakdown, one inspired by the thousands of schoolchildren who had gone on strike to protest about the climate crisis weeks earlier. Labour’s policy highlights how little credit we have given the young thus far. An emergency that threatens their futures is not as readily taught as the history of the Tudors. In the yawning silence, young people like the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, and an estimated 1.4 million students across 150 countries who lead the school strike movement, have created momentum. Their resilience and resourcefulness has made the argument a simple one: human activity is choking our planet. In place of the deep inertia that has lead us here, the young have created an inventive rebellion. By moving to make study of the climate crisis compulsory, Labour positions itself as a party invested in the young. It is a policy highlighting the empty paternalism of our current government, which assumes children haven’t the right to know the science of how we got here. Or, for that matter, what history and geography can teach about how the most vulnerable countries are those least responsible for our climate breakdown – countries that are disproportionately communities of colour. Why are our maths teachers not encouraged to relate the subject to this very real world problem? Students themselves have already worked out that the 12-year deadline for action is too late for many countries on the frontline of our emergency. A good education should provide students with the knowledge and skills to navigate a future they will become adults within. By proposing to make the crisis required teaching, Labour acknowledges that silence, thus far, pretends the young are unable to pay attention to the betrayal of their futures. Today I will be marching with my children as part of the #YouthStrike4Climate. I will be doing so because I know that it is a topic of which they are already aware. Maybe it is snatched references to air pollution, or snippets of dire warnings that arrive via news headlines, but it’s been impossible to shield them from the reality even if I wanted to. The young across the world, baffled by how to get attention, have chosen to strike in order to prove they have agency. Told for so long by parents and teachers alike to be responsible, they have, like the children in Toni Morrison’s 1993 Nobel prize lecture, turned around to ask: “What could that possibly mean in the catastrophe this world has become?” Going on to demand: “How dare you talk to us of duty when we stand waist-deep in the toxins of your past?” When, invariably, today’s protest will be dismissed as of far less importance than Theresa May’s resignation, it will be another sign that an older political class are simply blind to a catastrophe already with us. “Each generation must, out of relative obscurity, discover its mission, fulfil it or betray it,” wrote Frantz Fanon, in his seminal work on the trauma of colonisation, The Wretched of the Earth. The irony is that the climate strikes, led by the young, display a conscientious respect for the planet, grounded in the sense of duty and responsibility their elders have been so desperate to abandon. • Lola Okolosie is an English teacher and Guardian columnist"

It’s time for a break from blogging.
I’ve gotten a hefty amount of work to do and the deadlines are really tight. There’s no way I will be able to blog regularly for the next two weeks. I may be able to post a short item or two here and there, but not more.
It’s a bit strange – in Europe normally business is slow in August. But not this year.
If readers would like to post as a guest, you are welcome to do so – just send in what you have by e-mail. Keep it short and not more than 3 graphics.
Comments will remain open, but I will not have time to go through the spam to rescue legitimate comments. So it’s possible that your comment may get thrown out now and then.
This is the first time in over 2 years that I have taken a break from blogging.
I should be back at it in about 15 days.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMichael Krüger at German blogsite Readers Edition uncovers how one of Stefan Rahmstorf’s scariest prophecies of climate doom has just been RESOUNDINGLY refuted by hard data from a new European study.

Gulf Stream is not weakening, a new European study says. Photo source: NASA (public domain image).
Krüger writes:
In 1999 German scientist Stefan Rahmstorf was awarded the one-million dollar “prize of the century” by the American James S McDonnel Foundation for his work on calculating climate change through changes in the Golf Stream. Rahmstorf had postulated that already a really small warming of global temperatures leads to an altered flow or even a tipping of the ‘Gulf Stream climate machine’.”
Rahmstorf was also quoted in the year 1999 by the Süddeutsche Zeitung:
The Atlantic current will likely weaken noticeably in the coming decades – here the computer models of various institutes broadly agree on this.”
And recently Rahmstorf reacted to a report appearing on the subject in science magazine mare. Rahmstorf reaffirms:
Summa summarum one can conclude from these very broadly supported estimations that the risk of a tipping of the North Atlantic stream is being increasingly  pessimistically assessed among experts. That also corresponds to my assessment, which also has grown more pessimistic over the course of my work on the subject. […] According to the latest, the risk appears to be greater than what we saw 10 or 15 years ago.”
Let’s recall that at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Rahmstorf’s employer, the only good science there are prophecies of the end-of-world. Anything else is considered heresy at the PIK. If it’s not laced with doom and gloom, then it isn’t acceptable science.
So how is the Gulf Stream really doing? Is it weakening noticeably as Rahmstorf and a consensus of computer models prophesied 13 years ago?
A recent report on ARD German public television (see clip below) now tells us the answer: No. No. No.

Youtube excerpt of the ARD public television Tagesschau and Tagesthemen news from 24 September 2012.
The ARD news anchor-lady tells her many viewers that the Gulf Stream “remains stable” and “has not weakened”, citing a team of scientists from 9 European countries. “New studies show that it is going strong, and is unaffected by climate change.” At the 1:22 mark according to Detlef Quadfasel of the University of Hamburg:
It shows that it remains stable and that we will have a relatively weak warming in Europe and in the North Atlantic and that no catastrophe will occur in the next 10 years.”
The news reporter then adds:
That’s a small sensation! And a reaction to a false warning from 7 years ago when a new cold period had been prophesied. Back then, measurements had been taken from only a few locations.”
The reporter then adds that over the last 5 years, measurements have been taken from 3000 measuring probes and they show no signs of any weakening.
There you have it. Obviously Prof. Rahmstorf (and the computer models from the other institutes he cites) were FOS with their prophecy of a weakening Gulf Stream and climate tipping point. Now it’s clear they had no idea what they were talking about.
Do you think Prof. Rahmstorf will come out and admit his error? Don’t hold your breath. The PIK sees itself as the Vatican of climate science, i.e. as infallible.
I challenge anyone to find one piece of good climate news coming out of the PIK. You won’t find any. Good news there gets strung up every morning at sun-up and never sees the light of day.
When is the government going to wake up and close that science nuthouse down?
 PS: Stefan Rahmstorf is also one of the outlier scientists claiming sea levels will rise more than a meter this century, even though all the tide gauges show no acceleration at all. Do we see a trend when it comes to Rahmstorfian science?

Share this...FacebookTwitterFirst off, I’ve got a message for the blimp in NJ: FORGET MY VOTE IN 2016!
Sure Christie is not responsible for this disaster result, but he’ll do for starters. He represents what’s wrong with the GOP. No way I’m voting for that Benedict Arnold in 2016 (he’ll run). The GOP base needs to make it very clear to him on that.
If there ever was a lesson in polling, this is it. I just got up and looked at Fox News.
Hell, it’s not even close as far as EV are concerned. Looks like many of the polls underestimated Obama. I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn’t back in 2008.
What is it about candidates from Massachusetts being complete losers? Dukakis, Kerry and now Romney.
The European press (and I suspect Chavez, the idiot in Iran, Putin, etc.) are elated.
4 more years…
I guess the path to sanity will have to go through Greece after all.

"In 1791, a tall, good-looking ex-naval officer called Richard Brothers claimed to hear the voice of an angel predicting God’s imminent destruction of London. In the same year, William Bryan – a Bristolian with mellifluous voice and “clear and gentle” eyes – prophesied the overturn of global monarchies, followed a few years later by the “fall” of Bristol, and an earthquake in which London would “burn like an oven”. Their critics accused Brothers and Bryan of “enthusiasm”, of falsely believing they were acting under divine inspiration. Satirists aligned them with the bloodiest of French revolutionaries. They seemed to exhibit the same disrespect for established social hierarchies, the same untamed emotions, the same wild eyes, torn clothes and dangerously unkempt appearance. Judging by the criticism levelled at Greta Thunberg – the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who launched a Skolstrejk för klimatet (School strike for the climate) in August 2018 – many fear her as the Brothers or Bryan of our times. She has been accused of alarmism and fearmongering, with a “doomsday” prophecy of climate catastrophe, necessitating changes that will crash the global economy. Jeremy Corbyn’s brother Piers Corbyn has dismissed Thunberg as a “brainwashed child”, an inspired puppet of cynical adults. Spiked magazine’s Ella Whelan sees Thunberg’s school strike as an encapsulation of her entire method: a rejection of rationalism and education for “kneejerk, panicky responses” and wild, self-indulgent emotion. Thunberg is painfully aware that “people tell me that I’m retarded, a bitch and a terrorist, and many other things”. But her speeches – now collected and published under the title of her refrain, “no one is too small to make a difference” – give the lie to these caricatures. Yes, she reiterates, “I want you to panic … I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is.” But this is offset by dispassionate emphasis on bullet-pointed facts and figures, and the defence that emotion – even panic – is completely rational. Perhaps Thunberg is a prophet after all. Brothers and Bryan leaped to fame in the 1790s, when their visions of toppling hierarchies and ravaged cities gave shape to people’s inchoate hopes and fears about change and corruption after the French Revolution. Their prophecies confirmed the widespread sense that to live in 1790s Britain was to live in a time of profound, unsettling and not necessarily optimistic change. Thunberg speaks to a people acutely aware of living in a time of transition, on a knife-edge between possible futures Thunberg’s appeal to us now is slightly different. Her simple emotion and “black-and-white” rationalism suggest authenticity and trust to her audience, many of whom are wary of adult experts suspected of harbouring hidden agendas. But most of all, whereas Brothers and Bryan’s prophecies gave shape to public fears of catastrophe and collapse, Thunberg speaks to a people acutely aware of living in a time of transition, on a knife-edge between multiple possible futures. Her argument is not driven by a belief that we are all doomed, but is cut through with tentative hope. And as a small, isolated figure, with her pigtails and open face, poised bravely behind an enormous lectern, facing down a roomful of powerful, suited adults, she embodies what it’s like to be an individual who yearns for change, against a juggernaut of commercial and political interests defending the status quo. I wonder if many of us right now, across a multitude of political persuasions, see ourselves in Thunberg, in the fragility of our political and environmental hopes, and our sense of personal impotence. As she says: “I’m too young to do this. We children shouldn’t have to do this.” A greater readiness to involve ourselves in collective action would go a long way towards lessening not just Thunberg’s vulnerability, but our own. • No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference by Greta Thunberg is published by Penguin (£2.99).

Share this...FacebookTwitterThough this is a climate and energy blog, I’ve decided to meander off into pure politics this one time. It’s a slow day.
In 2009 I asked a friend of mine, who I’ll call Norm, to predict where we would be under Obama’s leadership by 2012. Norm is a flaming liberal and ultra-Obama fan. Needless to say Norm thought Obama was going to heal the planet and deliver the world’s population to socialist prosperity. Below are three predictions he made in April 2009, with reality in brackets. Do you see the difference?
– Unemployment rate 4.5% [8.3%]
– Federal deficit: balanced [about -1.5 trillion$]
– Price for a gallon of gas: $4.50  [$3.82]
Now you’d think Norm would be disappointed with Obama’s performance and change his vote this time around. Even gasoline was nowhere near as expensive as he had hoped. But he won’t. Some people live their lives denying reality. The excuse of course is that Obama had inherited a problem that was much greater than any of us could have imagined, but he’ll surely fix it in the next 4 years, if given the chance. No matter what the stats say, we are better off today, they insist.
On Facebook someone posted the following table. Are we really better off today?

If these numbers aren’t enough to convince all the Norms out there, then nothing will. Some people are unable to cope with reality.

Things are just going like clockwork for Romney. It’s increasingly clear the Democrats are propping up a knocked-out feather-weight fighter, insisting he’s still conscious when in fact he’s out cold.
Romney’s momentum continues and now looks unstoppable. Expect it to carry through election day. The Democrats are more demoralized than ever.
When one looks at the polls closely, say what you want about them, we see that a voter tsunami developing for Romney:
1. Florida is all but locked up.
2. Pennsylvania is going to Romney, and with it Ohio.

3. Michael Barone predicts blowout.
4. Romney leads unexpectedly in early voting, Obama underperforming.
5. Huge crowds turning out for Romney.
6. Obama’s enthusiasm is gone, and young voters are turned off.
7. Dead-heat polls ignore dead-beat Obama voters.
8. Obama voters are defecting in droves.
You think I’m overly optimistic? The trends are unmistakable.

"Around 250 environmental activists have laid down among the dinosaurs at the Queensland Museum on Sunday, in the first large Extinction Rebellion event in Brisbane. Protesters, many dressed as endangered animals, laid on the floor of the museum’s Lost Creatures exhibit amid fossils and dinosaur reconstructions, including the state’s famous Muttaburrasaurus.  “This is a symbolic action to show that if we continue killing the planet we will die as well,” Alice Wicks from Extinction Rebellion said. “Scientists are telling us we only have within this next decade to act.” After spending 15 minutes inside, the protesters took their “die-in” to the museum’s famous Whale Mall outside. Craig and Claire Walsh brought their three daughters to the event, inspired by the actions of the teenage Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. “She was 16 and doing something about it, so we took it on as a passion project for the family to get involved,” Claire Walsh said. Annabelle, 10, said it was important for kids’ voices like hers to be heard. “If we don’t change anything we’re doing and try to help save the world, then there won’t be a world to live on soon.” Her sister Josie, eight, said her greatest concern was diminishing bee populations. “They pollinate flowers and that’s how we have cucumbers and all the things in salad we need to keep us healthy.” Extinction Rebellion events have been held around the world as part of a global climate change movement, with rallies staged in Melbourne and Sydney in recent days. The movement is calling for zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 in order to stop the 6th Mass Extinction Event. Wicks said the local chapter was planning more and bigger actions in coming months, particularly focusing on the controversial Adani coalmine in central Queensland. Last week the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, welcomed a series of approval dates for the Adani mine, released by the state’s coordinator general, including a black-throated finch management plan by 31 May and a groundwater dependent ecosystem management plan by 13 June. “It’s been really dodgy the way they’re trying to push this mine ahead,” Wicks said. “We need to save the Great Barrier Reef, we need to save everything.” Meanwhile another Extinction Rebellion protester was briefly arrested before the “die-in” began. Tom Howell, 29, was picked up by police for a breach of bail over a protest on 20 April, in which he suspended himself 10 metres off a railway bridge at Annerley used to transport coal. A Chuffed.org campaign has already raised the $1,500 Howell needs to pay his fines. He was released around 1.30pm on Sunday once the protest had wrapped up."

"Hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren across the world have gone on strike in protest at the escalating climate crisis.  Students from 1,800 towns and cities in more than 110 countries stretching from India to Australia and the UK to South Africa, walked out of lessons on Friday, the organisers of the action said.  This is the latest school climate strike, inspired by teenager Greta Thunberg, who has become a global figurehead since protesting outside Sweden’s parliament in 2018. The young people are demanding politicians take urgent action to avoid catastrophic ecological breakdown. In London, thousands gathered in the sunshine in Parliament Square chanting, “Where the fuck is the government”, and “This is what democracy looks like”, before staging a sit-down protest outside the department of education. Ivy, 14, from Surrey, said: “I am here because I believe there is no point having an education if there is no future … I am so frustrated the only people who really care about this are the ones who can’t vote.” Her friend, Arissa, added: “It is not us that did this – we are only 14 – but no one else is doing anything about it and it’s our future, so what choice do we have?” There were similar demonstrations in cities across the UK with organisers reporting record numbers in several places. In Glasgow, Nancy Baijonauth, 16, declared the protest the biggest so far in the city. “It’s really great. It felt like at the start people were hesitant, maybe because they felt nervous and that they couldn’t make a change, but now more people are joining in.” In Cambridge about 2,000 school students demonstrated and there were big protests in cities from Leeds to Bristol, Manchester to Cardiff. Globally, organisers said that hundreds of protests also took place in the US. The school protests come amid growing evidence of the scale of the climate crisis. Last year, the UN’s leading scientists warned that there were just 12 years to limit climate catastrophe. Earlier this month, another UN report warned that the widespread collapse of ecosystems was putting humanity itself at risk. And just last week it emerged that the Antarctic ice is melting much faster than previously feared and global atmospheric CO2 emissions reached a record level of 415ppm. The school strike movement started last August whenThunberg, then 15, held her solo protest in Stockholm. Since then it has snowballed to be one of the most significant climate movements in history. On Friday Thunberg, and leading youth strikers across the world, called for all adults to join the protests and stage a global general strike on 20 September. Writing in the Guardian they said: “We’re asking adults to step up alongside us … today, so many of our parents are busy discussing whether our grades are good, or a new diet or the Game of Thrones finale – whilst the planet burns,” they write. “But to change everything, we need everyone. It is time for all of us to unleash mass resistance … if we [demand change] in numbers we have a chance.” Before Friday’s strikes, organisers said the number of young people taking part would top the 1.4 million people who participated in the last global day of strikes in March. "
"The Guardian’s decision to alter its style guide to better convey the environmental crises unfolding around the world has prompted some other media outlets to reconsider the terms they use in their own coverage. After the Guardian announced it would now routinely use the words “climate emergency, crisis or breakdown” instead of “climate change”, a memo was sent by the standards editor of CBC, Canada’s national public broadcaster, to staff acknowledging that a “recent shift in style at the British newspaper the Guardian has prompted requests to review the language we use in global warming coverage”. Senior CBC management told staff they were able to use the terms “climate crisis” and “climate emergency” when covering the wide-ranging impacts of temperature rises around the world. “Neutrality is an important principle in our journalism,” said Paul Hambleton, standards editor of CBC News. “We recognise that ‘climate crisis’ and ‘climate emergency’ are increasingly common expressions in debates over what to do about global warming. “‘Climate change’ and ‘global warming’ offer a neutral starting point for that debate, but as with all our journalistic decisions, context matters.” Along with the revised use of “climate change”, the Guardian’s style guide also now favours “global heating” instead of “global warming”. Meanwhile, the term “biodiversity” is discouraged in certain instances to instead emphasise “wildlife”. “We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue,” said the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. “The phrase ‘climate change’, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.” Newsrooms around the globe have been digesting the changes, with journalists at several UK and US media outlets reporting internal conversations about the language used around climate. Laura Helmuth, the health, science and environment editor at the Washington Post, said there were no new guidelines at the newspaper as yet, but she had “circulated the Guardian story about your guidelines to our reporters and copy desk for inspiration”. The Los Angeles Times still uses “climate change” and “global warming” but that may soon change. “We are also reviewing our style guide in light of the recent report from the United Nations,” said Scott Kraft, the managing editor of the LA Times, in reference to a stark report last year that found humanity must cut its planet-heating emissions by nearly half by 2030 to avoid severely escalating climate-driven disasters such as flooding, wildfires and drought. Others are being more circumspect. “We use various terms, ‘climate change’ being the most frequent, and we strive to define what that means in the context of our stories,” said a spokeswoman for the New York Times. The Guardian’s new language around the environment is aimed at better illustrating a rapid breakdown in the natural processes that drive the planet’s climate and the society-wide danger that represents.  Without urgent intervention, global heating will reach a point where hundreds of millions of people are displaced by flooding, food insecurity and unrest, while the degradation of landscapes has led to the potential loss of 1m species and the unravelling of ecosystems that support human life. Whether a change in media tone will help address these problems remains an open question given the general lack of focus on the topic. A report this week found the major US TV networks spent far more news time on the birth of Archie, the new British royal baby, than a report warning of 1m species extinctions. One network, ABC, covered Archie for longer in one week than it spent in the whole of 2018 on the climate crisis. “For better or worse, I think climate change and global warming are likely to remain the primary names for the phenomenon,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale programme on climate change communication. Leiserowitz said the media could help elevate the climate issue by using images that showed the impact on people, rather than remote depictions of melting ice and forlorn polar bears. “I don’t mind terms like climate disruption, climate chaos, climate crisis, which can help a little. But I view them more as seasoning than entrée,” he said."

Hat-tip: Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt.
Here’s the press release issued by the FDP Free Democratic Party:
=========================
Visit of the German Weather Service / Greilich: climate debate must be factual and conducted without horror scenarios
“It is of fundamental importance to understand which climate risks (mid-term and long-term) represent a possible danger for our state. It is the duty of politicians to be informed about the current facts concerning climate change so that the appropriate measures can be implemented to weaken the risks from natural catastrophes for the good of the public,“ explained Wolfgang Greilich, Chairman of the FDP faction of the state parliament in Hesse during a visit to the German Weather Service in Offenbach.
“We put a lot of value on drawing conclusions for measures against climate change by using facts instead of myths,“ René Rock, vice faction chairman and climate political spokesman of the state parliament in Hesse. Prof. Dr. Gerhard Adrian, President of the German Weather Service, extensively informed the FDP politicians during over the latest findings concerning weather and climate research during their visit. He reminded that it is necessary to return to the facts and emphasized the importance of scientifically addressing the highly complex issues surrounding weather and climate. The statistics of the German Weather Service show climate fluctuations and their impacts going far back into the last century. One of many examples is the blossom of apple trees, which is currently almost 14 days earlier. Deriving a climate catastrophe from this is, however, false,” said Prof. Dr. Adrian in a discussion with the FDP delegation. After all, strong fluctuations have been shown to always exist. It has been shown that there have always been warm periods with high CO2 concentrations. “Some arguments by climate skeptics are superficial and easy to dismiss,“ explained Dr. Becker.

Another point of discussion was the various methods of measurement that scientific meteorology employs. “Political circles using climate and weather storms to fan the fears of people are foolishly putting their own credibility at stake. An active climate and environmental protection is the task at hand. Necessary for this are valid facts and data for example like those collected and scientifically assessed by the German Weather Service,“ Greilich concluded.

Getting getting back to the facts and away from hysteria is a good idea. But then they go on about “protecting the climate”, which is utter nonsense. How does one protect the temperature? The humidity? What does a psychiatrist do? Does he protect the behaviour of his patient? When someone talks about protecting the climate, then it’s a sure sign he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
Dr. Becker then says, “Some arguments by climate skeptics are superficial and easy to dismiss.” Maybe some, but there are many that still need to be answered and we’ve been waiting a long time: 1) Storms are not increasing. 2) The 800-year CO2 lag behind temperature 3) 15 years without global warming. 4) Antarctic sea ice increasing in size. 5) Weather events following the cycles of the sun. 6) A host of questions on the failures of the climate models, just to name a few.
Overall, though, the direction of the visit was correct.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday website Die kalte Sonne tells us there’s a new paper appearing in the Geophysical Research Letters on the relationship of CO2 and temperature.

Al Gore teaching science to a gullible audience. (Image from film: An Inconvenient Truth)
Let’s recall how Al Gore in his Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth proudly stood before the CO2-temperature curve of the last several hundred thousand years and fooled his gullible audience into thinking that CO2 drove global temperature in the past, and not vice versa.
Too bad Gore didn’t take a closer look at the curves. If he had, he would have noticed that temperature rose first with CO2 following, and so CO2 could not possibly have been the main driver. What really happened is that a warming Earth warmed the oceans, which in turn released CO2 into the atmosphere. That’s the real inconvenient truth.
Now there’s a new study by Jinho Ahn et al of Seoul National University. His team has taken another look at the temperature fluctuations 39,000 years ago. What did they find? Did CO2 lead temperature, or was it the other way around.
The data don’t lie, but obviously Gore does.  The results were clear: In the abstract the authors write (emphasis added):

This rise in CO2 was synchronous with, or slightly later than, a rapid increase of Antarctic temperature inferred from stable isotopes.”
Morover, it was thought that atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature in Antarctica varied on millennial time scales and that these changes were gradual. But the authors of the paper write:
In a detailed analysis of one event we now find that approximately half of the CO2 increase that occurred during the 1500-year cold period between Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events 8 and 9 happened rapidly, over less than two centuries.”
Lüning and Vahrenholt at Die kalte Sonne find this interesting. They write:
…about half of the total CO2 increase took place within just 200 years. This brings up important questions. The authors point out that the models based on the CO2 cycle are unable to to reproduce the rapid changes in CO2 condentrations.”
Back to the drawing board for climate modellers. But this time they really ought to put the horse before the cart.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUpdate: I hear they may not have yet added in the FL vote tally….if so, what I said below may have to be adjusted some.
We kept hearing that the Republicans were enthused, would turn out in huge numbers, and that Obama voters would stay home, or even vote for Romney, and so the GOP had a good shot at taking the White House. It turns out that only one of the above actually happened in reality – lots of Democrats stayed home.
So why did Romney lose? Because also too many Republicans didn’t bother to go out and vote, the numbers suggest.
The final results are still not in, but it appears most are (ca. 90%), and they tell a sad story: too many Republican voters sat on their butts and thus gave this one away:
Obama 2008: 69,456,897 votes
 Obama 2012: 59,000,000
McCain 2008: 59,934,814
 Romney 2008: 57,000,000

Like I said, there are still more votes to be counted, and the GOP tally probably will surpass 08’s, though not by much, if at all. The numbers already suggest that enthusiasm was lacking.
All that talk about an “energized party” appears to have been lots of hot air.
The numbers also tell us just how valuable Palin was in energizing the GOP in 2008. Although people were tired of the GOP, she mobilized GOP voters – as many as what we saw yesterday. If Palin had not been the VP candidate in 2008 and had made her debut yesterday, we’d be saying “President-elect” Romney today.
I’m not taking anything away from Paul Ryan. But we have to admit that the ticket was a bit bland this time around.
The GOP really knows how to pick ’em. Is there a Ronald Reagan in sight for 2016?

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I present to you the latest wonderful example of tolerance and open-mindedness from fundamentalist warmist site klimabedwetter.de here in green nutsy Germany.
Nowadays it’s hard to tell what the alarmists are more petrified of: the global climate catastrophe or the skeptic invasion in Europe.  They are angry and panicked that the skeptics have succeeded in getting the public in Europe to question the dubious climate science.
It helps to recall that the klimaretter website is run by devout climate catastrophe alarmists who absolutely can’t live without the imminent threat of the end of the world. Don’t take my word for it, all you have to do is read their site. Of course, you may ask how anyone could possibly get so psychologically obsessed with and insistent about the end of the world? I’m afraid you’ll have to ask a psychiatrist that question.
You can be pretty sure that when December 21 passes many of the disappointed Mayan calender kooks are going to be hitching their wagons to the next best thing: the coming global climate catastrophe. But don’t try to tell them that it’s just another hoax. Good news on climate is like holy water to the devil.
I witnessed this first hand at a press conference when a klimabedwetter went into emotional seizures when Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning introduced their book Die kalte Sonne telling us that there wasn’t going to be a climate catastrophe after all. “Sorry – now go home and do something worthwhile for a living.” That good news was simply too much for the warmists in the audience to take.
So without further ado, here’s the latest spread-the-hate piece by klimabedwetter.de.  It’s about the drive-by journalism hit on skeptics by weekly Die Zeit:
The unscrupulous schemes used by certain circles of business and politics to manipulate public opinion on climate change and renewable energies are revealed by a report by Die Zeit: “The Climate Warriors”. It exposes the crusade of these ideologically blinded deniers in horrifying detail. It is really shocking how professional PR strategists, with the help of lots of money and self-anointed climate experts, are hounding renowned scientists. It is of great worry that these well-paid ‘experts’ have in the meantime gotten gotten attention in Europen. Their crude claims have not only been picked up by the major dailies and talk shows, but also by the German parliament.

It is essential for us all to take a stand against these demagogues and to publicly denounce their unscrupulous schemes.
Die Zeit performed an exemplary service here. I really would like to see more of such detailed researched articles.”
What does this tell us about the warmists in Germany? Gandhi says it the best in a nutshell: First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, and then you win.
The skeptics in Europe have made it to step 3 in almost record time. I suspect step 4 will the accomplished even more quickly.
And, appropriately, here are Ghandi’s seven sins: 
Wealth without work. Pleasure without conscience. Knowledge without character. Commerce without morality. Science without humility. Worship without sacrifice. Politics without principle.
Sin has always led to downfall. It won’t be any different this time.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you think things are now horrendous for the Northeast US, just wait few more days. Hell in New Jersey and New York could turn into Super Hell, especially if they don’t get power and real help soon.

 Chart from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) of the US National Weather Service indicates massive snowfall across the Northeast, with up to 25 inches of snow in Massachusetts and Vermont in the days ahead. 
More often than not, computer forecasts 5 days out are not that far off. If the latest 5-day forecast has any degree of accuracy, then it bodes very very ill for the Northeast USA – a region already battered and down on its knees after the body blow delivered by Sandy. Mother Nature has no mercy.
The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) models show a massive winter storm brewing, one that is poised to deliver icy temperatures and heavy snow in an area that is already fully exposed and vulnerable.
On Twitter I’ve been following Dr. Ryan Maue and Joe Bastardi, who have been watching the ECMWF models developing. It appears Mother Nature is preparing to deliver no. 2 of the old one-two punch.
Meteorologist Joe Bastardi‘s reaction at Twitter looking at the models:
ecmwf delivers classic noreaster with m-id north atlantic gale to storm forces winds on coast, heavy snows n va to ny/ne. wow!”
Mateorologist Dr. Ryan Maue adds:
Actual snowfall, of which some may melt, 20-25” maximum for W. Mass. Still 5-6 days away to gas up snowblower.”

Maue also brings our attention to projections of a Canadian model:

Canadian model projection for 8 November looks a little less threatening, yet has lots of potential for real danger.
I really do hope people, the media, and especially disaster management officials take this seriously. There are lots of people with no power and other essential services who are fully exposed. Sure the weather is much nicer out in sunny Nevada, but Obama should really get his parka out and get back East and prepare the area.
The forecast is a good 5 days out, and so the accuracy is still somewhat iffy. The picture will definitely become much clearer in the next 24 hours.
Meanwhile, Maue warns that winter is about to break (early) in full earnest out West.
Colorado Low means major winter storm for Montana + Dakotas.  Winter.”
Global warming is causing early winters, the warmists will soon be telling us.

"Environmentalists have warned that sections of the European commission may be “deliberately harming climate action” after a report into the climate impact of the common agricultural policy (CAP) was quietly published the day after the EU elections. The study for the EU’s agriculture department was finished almost a year ago but remained unpublished while debate on the CAP’s future rumbled on, leading the environmental group WWF to lodge a freedom of information request for its release.  Imke Lübbeke, the climate and energy chief at WWF’s European policy office, said: “You couldn’t make it up. The EU commission has been talking about ‘climate urgency’ while sitting on a report which shows how little farming policy is doing for the climate – and how much more it could and should do. “At best it is a case of one hand not knowing what the other is doing. At worst, it is deliberately harming climate action and our commitment to keep the temperature rise to 1.5C, as the Paris agreement says.” Agriculture is responsible for about 10% of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions but a lack of “strong external drivers” from the commission is hampering the fight to reduce them, according to the official EU paper. The study questions the effectiveness of current CAP subsidy rules that allow farmers to farm on wetlands and peatlands and plough up “permanent grasslands”, releasing large volumes of carbon dioxide as they do so. Because the CAP does not require states to record how many grasslands are ploughed, the paper can only estimate the cost of emissions reductions under the policy at €274 per tonne of CO2 equivalent – more than 10 times the price for industry. Marco Contiero, Greenpeace’s EU agriculture policy director, said the CAP was “locking Europe further into factory farming and a pathway to climate disaster”. He said: “This study shows once and for all that the CAP is failing to tackle agriculture’s contribution to climate breakdown. In particular it has proved unable to address the detrimental role that meat and dairy farming and consumption play.” The analysis, which will feed into an EU policy paper this summer, also calls for careful consideration of whether legislative moves to encourage more sustainable diets are “feasible and desirable”."
"After polls closed last Saturday night, volunteers from the activist group GetUp gathered at a bar on Brisbane’s southside and watched the election results roll in. For months, an army of some 1,500 volunteers had been engaged in a bitter and expensive campaign to unseat the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, from the marginal Queensland seat of Dickson on the city’s northside.  But as the ABC’s Antony Green sifted through the early numbers on a big screen, the volunteers, many of them still decked out in the orange shirts they had worn throughout a months-long campaign, quickly realised it was not going to be the night they had hoped for. While their comrades in Sydney celebrated the unseating of former prime minister Tony Abbott, the swing in Dickson was decidedly not on. In fact, the needle was moving in the other direction. Dutton had not only survived, he had prospered, picking up a 2.6% two-party-preferred swing in his favour. The campaign, one of GetUp’s most ambitious, had come to naught, and by the time volunteer Gordon Melvin arrived at the pub some time after 7pm, the mood was already desultory. “Things were pretty flat. There was a positive little burst when we found out Abbott hadn’t won, but after that people started to drift away,” Melvin told Guardian Australia this week. “It wasn’t bleak and despondent, but it was certainly, ‘Oh dear … ’” Since the Coalition’s shock victory on Saturday GetUp has faced an avalanche of criticism from both sides of politics, staring down the wrath of a re-elected, re-energised Coalition and a Labor party struggling to come to terms with how it lost an election most pundits assumed would see them cruise to government. Dutton accused GetUp of “deceptive”, “undemocratic” and “unrepresentative” conduct during the campaign that backfired with voters in his electorate, while Labor figures in Queensland including former Gillard and Rudd government minister Craig Emerson suggested the group’s presence in Dickson may have hurt the party. “In a state like Queensland, if people perceive that groups from other states have come to tell them what to do or how to live they will react very badly to that,” he told Guardian Australia. “That’s not an attack on GetUp, maybe 100% of their volunteers who were on the booths campaigning were Queenslanders, but if there is a perception they were outsiders, Queensland is such a parochial state that it would go down very badly.” The government in particular is spoiling for a fight. Despite Abbott being the only one to lose his seat out of the six MPs targeted by GetUp on its so-called campaign “hit list”, senior Coalition figures have wasted no time pursuing a group it has loathed and envied since its foundation as an activist bulwark against the Howard government in 2005. Dutton said after the election that he would back “parliamentary processes” to limit the group’s campaigning power, and this week the Australian reported senior figures within the Coalition were considering curtailing the group’s power by introducing rules to restrict volunteers outside polling booths to those attached to registered parties and independent candidates. Attempts by the Coalition to limit GetUp’s influence are nothing new. Opponents such as conservative senator Eric Abetz have long accused the group of being affiliated with the Labor party, and at the behest of Coalition figures the Australian Electoral Commission has reviewed GetUp’s campaign status three times – in 2005, 2010 and last year. Each time the AEC found the group acted as an independent third-party campaigner and did not need to register as an associated entity, a designation which would likely hurt its appeal to politically unaligned supporters. But in the wake of the election some on the left of politics are questioning the effectiveness of the group’s campaigning, because while it celebrated Zali Steggall’s victory against Abbott in Warringah, other target seats remained firmly in the Coalition’s control. In Victoria, the health minister Greg Hunt in Flinders suffered only a 1.5% two-party-preferred swing against him, while former Abbott loyalist Kevin Andrews in Menzies got a small bump in his favour. In the seat of Boothby in South Australia Nicolle Flint suffered a small swing, while the attorney general Christian Porter picked up a 3.5% swing in his seat of Pearce in Western Australia. Paul Oosting, GetUp’s national director, admitted the group “hadn’t achieved what we set out to achieve” but said that came in a context where a predicted nationwide swing against the government failed to materialise. He said the group had helped stunt the move to the Coalition in seats where it campaigned. “If you look at the places GetUp was active you’ll find much smaller swings to the Coalition – that was certainly the case in seats like Boothby, Flinders and Dickson so I think our work has in many respects been successful,” he told Guardian Australia. “Unseating a former PM and by far the leading climate denier in the Australian parliament, someone who’s done untold damage with cuts to the renewable energy target is a huge achievement and something we and our members are really proud of. “Definitely we aimed to achieve more though, so we need to go back as a movement and reflect on what did and didn’t work and be real about that.” That’s a feeling shared across the left of politics in Australia following the result, fuelled by a sense that traditional blue-collar voters didn’t buy into the more stridently progressive aspects of Labor’s campaign. In the days after the election, Labor’s presumptive new leader Anthony Albanese has pledged to move the party back to the centre, while right-faction figures such as New South Wales MP Joel Fitzgibbon, who saw a huge swing towards One Nation in his coal-dominated Hunter Valley seat, demanded the party “reconnect” with blue-collar and regional voters. Amanda Tattersall, one of the original co-founders of GetUp and a researcher at the University of Sydney, believes there was a disconnect between climate and inequality messaging from the progressive movement during the campaign. While the trade union movement talked about wage stagnation and the economy, groups such as GetUp talked about climate change. The result, she believes, was an incohesive narrative that the Coalition was able to exploit by stoking fears about employment and cost-of-living concerns. “I think that disconnect wasn’t as big a problem in places that weren’t feeling those deep inequality problems that are very real other parts of the country,” Tattersall said. “That’s why you saw such different results in say Warringah compared to say parts of western Sydney and parts of Queensland.” She said progressive groups including GetUp needed to come up with new ways to speak to those communities, and pointed to the Green New Deal in the US and Lock the Gate in Australia as examples of how. “I think for GetUp this is going to be a moment for both celebrating a tremendous campaign with some victories but also sitting down and doing some serious reflecting and learning about how to create the kind of innovative campaigns that will be required to transition our economy and our democracy,” she said. “Because it’s not enough to win Warringah when the communities that are suffering in terms of inequality mostly turned away from a progressive agenda.” That theory is played out by the experiences of GetUp volunteers on the ground. Mosman resident Judith O’Neill, who door-knocked for GetUp in Warringah, said the climate change-focused sales pitch there was largely well-received by residents. “When we introduced ourselves we made it quite clear that our concern as Australians was about climate change and that we were concerned that our local member didn’t believe in climate change and basically wondered if they would like to have a conversation about that,” she said. “Most of the time it was really pretty positive I have to say. There were some very funny moments. There was one young woman who came out and said ‘Look my husband is inside and I don’t want him to hear me but I’m not going to vote for Tony Abbott because he doesn’t believe in climate change.’” But in Dickson, a patchwork electorate, carved from commuter-belt suburbs, industrial areas and rural villages in Brisbane’s north and north-west, GetUp’s pitch had to overcome not only Dutton but also an electorate without a unifying touchstone issue. As a result, GetUp’s campaign was less focused on a single issue and instead about finding out what was exercising voters. “It was really about finding out what they wanted from their politicians, and then reflecting on where Peter Dutton stood on the things they cared about,” volunteer Rob Keniger from Brisbane said. “Obviously we were trying to influence people not to vote for him, but it was about listening to what people’s concerns were and then relaying how we felt and why we felt Peter Dutton wasn’t the right choice.” Keniger said often the challenge in the seat was that the people he spoke to were “just disenfranchised with politics generally”. “A lot of people were just done with the shenanigans in Canberra and had just disengaged. I think often they were concerned mostly about local issues and Peter Dutton has been there a long time and a lot of people know who he is,” he said. The Greens candidate in Dickson, Benedict Coyne, echoed that sentiment, saying the issue that got most cut-through for him was the Greens support for a national anti-corruption body and “stopping the revolving door between lobbyists and parliament”. “There’s that real level of cynicism, and some people wanting earnestly to hope that change could happen but also a lot of people sort of saying ‘yeah good luck with that’,” he said. While he was disappointed with the result, Keniger said he felt as though GetUp had done all it could to swing the seat. Others are less certain, however. Gordon Melvin, 71, who spent the last two weeks of the campaign driving around the electorate in a Tarago kitted out with GetUP’s anti-LNP slogans, said he wondered if the campaign had been too personal. Melvin joined the campaign because of his opposition to the Coalition’s refugee policy, a topic GetUp mostly steered clear of during the campaign because it was seen as too divisive in the suburban sprawl of Brisbane’s northside. He said he understood the reticence to lean too heavily on the issue, but wonders if the campaign went too far the other way in response – making too much of its focus about removing Dutton himself. “From my point of view I joined GetUp’s campaign because they were campaigning against Dutton, I got into it for that reason so I was happy to do it,” he said. “But on reflection I’m not sure we did it in the right way. I was a little disappointed [because] I have no idea what would have happened if we talked less about Dutton himself and more about the things he did. If we’d beat up the policy, instead of the person. “Hindsight is a wonderful thing of course, but I do wonder whether that only galvanised some of his support.” Coyne, the Greens candidate, agreed, saying Dutton had been effective in making himself the underdog. “At the risk of generalising, there is a sense that Dutton was able to play the victim card, you know, ‘GetUp and all these outsiders are coming here to do this to me’, and that certainly speaks to his base to come and defend him whether it’s true or not,” he said. “That really garnered, you know, a huge battalion of volunteers and a hell of a lot of money.” Oosting concedes that combatting the notion of GetUp as “outsiders” in a state like Queensland was “definitely a challenge that we are going to have to reflect on”, but also points to the outside forces that impacted on the campaign in Dickson. “The fact is that our campaign in Dickson was led by local people there who are really fed up with Peter Dutton and wanted change,” he said. “But unlike the 2016 election, this campaign we faced a massive smear campaign. There were billboards, radio advertisements and robocalls directly attacking our movement, some of them highly defamatory and untrue which is something we haven’t faced before. “That’s our challenge, to make sure the public are aware GetUp members are just people like themselves – local people who are passionate about the issues in their electorate.” While people like Craig Emerson believe it’s possible GetUp’s presence may have alienated voters in Dickson, others such as Labor party president and former treasurer Wayne Swan said the group had simply failed to make an impact. “I don’t think when you look at it that the impact of GetUp was all that favourable in terms of what they were trying to achieve,” Swan told ABC radio this week. “I’m not aware of their strategy but if I was GetUp I’d be doing what the Labor party is going to do [and] go and have a good hard look at the effectiveness of what we were doing.” Similarly the former Queensland state Labor MP John Mickel told Guardian Australia that while a “vote Dutton out” message might resonate in cities like Melbourne or Sydney, Dickson was a “jealously guarded area” that may not have appreciated the pitch. Now an associate adjunct professor at the Queensland University of Technology, Mickel said without a single rallying cry it was possible voters reverted to what they knew. “Within his own electorate Dutton’s seen as someone who’s delivered for the various sports clubs, the community organisations, so they’d have a completely different view of him to people attuned to who he is as a minister,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterRudolf Kipp at Science Skeptical reports on Director of the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany brings us this glittering example of how arrogant and detached from reality the scientific elite among us can be.
How the Fraunhofer Director saves energy in his vacation home in California
By Rudolf Kipp
Professor Eicke R. Weber, Director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Freiburg, Germany, recently expressed his opinion in a commentary appearing in the daily Badischen Zeitung. It bothers him that German companies simply are not acknowledging the huge potential of photovoltaics. They simply lack faith, he claims.
Completely unimpressed by the the wave of bankruptcies that has rippled through Germany due to low-priced competition from China, and despite all the generous subsidies pampering the industry, Weber is still convinced that photovoltaic systems will undergo a boom in the future.
Lack of faith as a reason for bankruptcies?
It’s not really clear if the Professor Weber really means solar companies in Germany are going bankrupt one after another because they lack the faith that he himself demands. That seems to be the least of the problems for German manufacturers. They all believe their products are better than those from China, and that the only way to a sustainable future is if more and more customers buy more and more of their solar modules.
Indeed faith can move mouintains, but it cannot pay a single bill from a supplier or employee wages. And because this is the reality, we are currently experiencing a die-off of an entire industry. The problem is not a lack of faith – it’s the lack of profitability.

Rising electricity prices are no problem for the professor
Another thing that agitates the professor from Freiburg is “the myth that German pensioners with their electricity bills are financing rich property owners who own buildings covered with solar panels and Chinese industrial bosses”. But it is indeed true that in Germany mainly land and homeowners are the ones profiting the most, along with Chinese solar panel manufacturers, while low income earners with no possibility to invest wind up footing the bill. Weber makes no attempt to refute this.
Instead, he simply recommends that low wage earners consume less power. And to ensure that they really do this, incentives need to be created. Here the professor, who resides in Germany, prefers a graduated price structure. He explains how this would work:
My electricity bill in my vacation home in California is structured as follows: 13 cents/kwh for base consumption, 29 cents/kwh for up to 200 percent of the base consumption and much more for households with large consumption.”
When you read this, it becomes clear why Professor Weber is not afraid of rising power costs. The man can obviously afford it. Clearly he has enough money to fly to his vacation home in California multiple times a year – emitting huge quantities of CO2 as he does so.
Moreover, the professor has the chutzpah to expect other people, who can only dream of having the professor’s lifestyle and who emit only a fraction of his CO2, to limit their energy consumption in order to rescue the planet. To reach this target, he considers it absolutely necessary to make energy so expensive that the “little man” is no longer able to afford it.
If at some time rising energy prices should lead to unrest, then I would recommend that Professor Weber remains at his California vacation home instead of staying in Germany. In earlier revolutions such arrogant elitists ended up facing angry mobs armed with pitchforks and torches.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOver the last months, Steve Goddard has dug up a number of clippings from old newspapers showing stories of catastrophic climate change going to the early 20th century.
Here’s one I found from 1947, 30 years before the satellite measurements showed a massively frozen Arctic and the media bedwetted about “global cooling”.

Townsville Daily Bulletin, 31 May 1947. Source: http://trove.nla.gov.au/ 
It’s possible Mr Goddard has already posted this one. If so, then it doesn’t hurt to remind people of what nature does on it’s own and that today’s Arctic condition is nothing new. Note how the language is the same as what we hear from the media and climate institutes today. Like today, it was surely effective fund-raising back then as well.

"After the shocking – for some – results of the federal election were revealed on Saturday night, it didn’t take long for hashtags such as #Quexit and #MakeThemLeave to start trending on social media, calling for Queensland to be kicked out of Australia. Whether people were rooting for Labor for climate-related reasons or otherwise, many unleashed their anger on regional electorates that delivered huge swings away from Labor, and that are home to some of Australia’s largest coalmines.  But while it is easy to dismiss these voters as ill-informed, coal-addicted bogans who don’t care about the climate crisis, the reality behind the political and economic priorities of Australia’s coal communities is more complex. I have spent the past five years working in coal regions across Australia, from the Latrobe Valley and the Hunter region to the heart of Adani country in central and northern Queensland, helping people understand what a transition from fossil fuels to a zero-emissions economy looks like. To be clear, a just transition does not mean a direct shift from coal to renewable energy jobs. This is about taking advantage of the new job creation and investment opportunities in shifting to low-carbon solutions across all sectors – energy, land use and agriculture, construction, transport, waste and manufacturing. My experience shows that the biggest myth that needs busting is the notion that coal communities aren’t interested in or aware of this transition. This is simply not true: everywhere we have worked, people have been interested in and even enthusiastic about the transition and its potential to create new jobs and attract investment. People know that regional economies need to become more diversified and resilient in the face of increasingly urgent pressures ranging from ageing populations to the impact of the “gig economy” and more frequent natural disasters. They see large-scale renewable energy projects being rolled out across their regions, and they are curious about how the new low-carbon economy can deliver for regional Australia. But – and there is always a “but” – virtually every coal-dependent community faces the same challenges that are stopping many decision-makers from publicly backing the transition, even when they believe that more action is needed. First, regions have been doing it tough economically for the last decade. They are understandably reluctant to sacrifice existing industries that have jobs available in the here and now in favour of investing in new projects they are unsure of. Second, in the polarised and politicised debates around coal and energy, people are scared to come out in support of a transition beyond fossil fuels, to the point that some fear their jobs are on the line if they speak up for something other than coal. This isn’t helped by the failure by all to acknowledge the contribution coal has made to our economy. Instead of moving to the future with a sense of respect and pride for what they have contributed to the nation, the rush to renewables has left some workers feeling disrespected and under attack by “outsiders”. Finally, people tell me they feel abandoned by the government and don’t trust the main parties to hold fast to their promises. For an untrusting electorate, it makes more sense to stay with what you know than take a risk on the unknown. Some local governments have tried to push past these challenges and take the concept of transition planning further, but they are constrained by tight budgets and political divisions. External funding is also scarce because too many philanthropists are happy to leave regional economic development to governments, instead preferring to fund high-profile campaigns like Stop Adani. Frontline action is undoubtedly important, but everyone loses when we ignore the effort to build positive alternatives and when we sideline the people at the forefront of the transition. The good news is that the transition is not just inevitable, it is already happening. All around the country, state and local governments and industry are backing and building renewable energy projects. Even more exciting are the community energy projects that are proliferating across the country, keeping profits within the regions. New waste and transport initiatives that will lower our emissions are being explored out of necessity. And where coal closures are already starting to happen, we are seeing a swathe of new economic initiatives popping up like the SEA Electric plan to build an electric vehicle factory in the Latrobe Valley Authority. So how do we turn things around for coal communities that are still struggling to transition? The only way we’re going to effectively deliver the two seemingly competing objectives of strong climate action and secure livelihoods is to deepen our engagement with regional communities – not just coal workers, but also farmers, local business owners and First Nations groups. Advocates need to work with communities to tease out the complexities of a just transition, and co-create the constructive solutions that we urgently need. Philanthropists and impact investors need to consider funding more solutions-focused, regional initiatives, and governments need to step up on allocating the resources needed to make the concept of a just transition a reality. And as for the rest of us? Let’s save our anger for the vested interests who block meaningful climate action, renewable energy uptake, and who perpetuate harmful, polarising untruths in the media – not the ordinary Australians who, like most of us, are just trying to do the best they can for their families.

Heavy snows have also hit China, hitting Peking with full force, according to German online Bild daily, which writes:
Snow Alarm in China! The capital Peking has been paralyzed by a winterstorm. […] The situation is worse in the countryside regions of North China. In the Yanqing region 47 cm of snow fell in just a few hours, entire villages have been cut off, thousands are without power and heat. […] A group of Japanese tourists got caught in drifting snow while on the Great Wall; three women froze to death.”
Winter also paid an early visit last weekend in England, reports the Daily Mail, with snow falling in the South and West Country, including in Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire and Devon. The Mail writes that “the snowfall was England’s fifth in nine days  amid an early winter”. and that “temperatures plunged to -5.6C last night at Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, with -4.3C Redesdale Camp, Northumberland, and -0.9C at Brize. The Weather Service says temperatures are up to 5°C below normal.
Snow was also reported in Gloucestershire and Dorset, with “up to six inches in Somerset in Bath, Frome, Midsomer Norton and the Mendip Hills” The Mail quotes. Charlie Powell, forecaster at the Met Office:

It has been incredibly cold recently and the snow was caused by an area of low pressure coming in from the North West.”
And adds:
More snow is due on higher ground in the North by Friday, with mainly below-average temperatures expected for the whole of November.”
Britain’s early winter is being enhanced by a mid-Atlantic high pressure preventing mild south-westerly winds from reaching Britain, and is pumping in Arctic air from Greenland. 
So much for snow being a thing of the past at the middle latitudes. Indeed winter is making early appearances not only locally, but globally.  Odd signs of warming, wouldn’t you say?

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt saddens us to report that prominent Austrian climatologist Reinhard Böhm has died unexpectedly, Der Spiegel reports. He was 64.

News of his death was made public by the Central Office for Meteorology and Geodynamics in Vienna (ZAMG).
Spiegel calls him the “father of Austrian climate science” and that he was one of the most important worldwide.
‘The personal and professional loss can hardly be expressed by words,’ says Michael Staudinger, Director of the ZAMG.”
Böhm was an independent thinker, and he advised his students to be critical and to not accept anything at face value. He worked at the ZAMG since 1973 and authored or co-authored more than 150 papers about climate in the Alps and glaciers.

For Böhm, the key to science was to always be skeptical and critical. Spiegel quotes Böhm:
‘Don’t let anyone tell you we know enough,’ he told laypersons. ‘Always question the science, be skeptical, and check everything that I claim,’ said Böhm.”
According to Spiegel, he bristled at the notion of politicians rescuing the planet and detested the politicization of climate science, refusing to participate in political debates, saying: “I don’t know the first thing about rescuing the planet. For that I am not an expert”.
Spiegel adds:
His critical view often contradicted the modern opinion on environmental topics. The renowned scientist never backed down, always distrusting every ideological, pre-concluded science.”
Last May I wrote about a study which he had authored where he found that weather extremes in the Alps had not increased.
Another great one has left us. Rest in peace.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe main pillar of the global warming, climate change theory is the claim that trace gas CO2 is the single major player impacting climate today. To maintain this, alarmist scientists and climate modelers have been forced to blow up the effects of CO2 by one order of magnitude in their models and to neglect a series of other factors (like the sun!).
Not surprisingly, we see from observations today that the assumed CO2 impacts have indeed been massively overblown. Now the scientists are left to fudge and falsify past climate data to force it to fit their crumbling models.
Ed Caryl’s two recent posts on the subject point out that the Modtran model of the US Air Force, who are forced to rely on real data for successful operations, also shows that CO2 has little impact on warming. Read here and here.
Now there’s a new paper by Martin Hertzberg titled: The night-time radiative transport between the Earth’s surface, its atmosphere, and free space, which is to be published by Energy & Environment (Vol. 23, No. 5, 2012), hat-tip Marc Morano of Climate Depot.
The paper concludes:
In addition, since the recent increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations have a trivial effect on the atmosphere’s total emissivity, the effect of those recent CO2 increases on the overall infrared radiative flux balance is insignificant.
The entire abstract is available here.
