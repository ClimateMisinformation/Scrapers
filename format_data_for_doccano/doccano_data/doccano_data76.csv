"Donald Trump’s energy agenda – which includes pledges of “complete energy independence”, making coal great again and ditching the Paris climate deal – is drawing bipartisan fire from industry analysts, former members of Congress, and even one coal mogul. All of them, to varying degrees, fault the billionaire’s basic premises and call his promises farfetched and at times contradictory.   They say the Republican presidential candidate uses faulty math to tout his vision of America’s energy independence, fails to understand energy economics in his pledge to revive the coal industry, and is peddling a big myth by claiming that global warming is a hoax. Some energy analysts also observe that Trump’s energy prescriptions, including big regulatory cutbacks that have long been industry wishes, are politically expedient and unrealistic. In making his promise to “save the coal industry”, for instance, Trump has backed slashing environmental rules, taking that message to West Virginia earlier this year, when he pledged that the state’s miners, as well as those in Ohio and Pennsylvania, “are going to start to work again, believe me”. But Charles Ebinger, a senior fellow at Brookings for energy security and climate issues, told the Guardian that “coal jobs aren’t coming back and for Mr Trump to say they’re coming back is erroneous and fanciful”. Noting that cheap natural gas has been the primary driver behind years of decline for the coal industry, Ebinger added that Trump seems to be “pandering to coal miners”. Other analysts concur. “Donald Trump’s promise to revive the US coal sector can only be realized by reining in hydraulic fracking,” said Jerry Taylor, the president of libertarian thinktank the Niskanen Center.  “That’s because low-cost natural gas (courtesy of fracking) has done far more to shut down coal-fired power plants and, correspondingly, reduce demand for US coal than has EPA regulations. Given that he promises exactly the opposite – moving heaven and earth to increase US natural gas production – Trump’s promises are empty.” Even Trump backer and coal mogul Bob Murray, who runs Murray Energy, which has given $100,000 to a pro-Trump Super Pac, says that the coal industry won’t ever be great again. “I don’t think it will be a thriving industry ever again,” Murray told an energy publication this year. “The coal mines cannot come back to where they were or anywhere near it.”  Likewise, Trump used dubious data when he spoke at an energy event in May in North Dakota arranged by fracking billionaire Harold Hamm, a key Trump policy adviser who has been mentioned as a possible energy secretary and recently hosted a big campaign fundraiser. Echoing some of Hamm’s priorities, Trump pledged to lift moratoriums on energy production in federal areas, to revoke policies that limit new drilling technologies and to “cancel” the Paris agreement. Trump also promised “complete energy independence”, a bullish commitment since about a quarter of US energy needs are met by imports, and one that relied on flawed projections of proven oil reserves. Trump stated that the US had 1.5 times the oil of all Opec countries combined. But at the end of 2014, the US had proven reserves of just under 40bn barrels, while Saudi Arabia alone had proven reserves of 268bn barrels. Similarly, Trump claimed that constructing the Keystone XL pipeline – which, unlike Hillary Clinton, he backs – would create and support 42,000 jobs. But industry projections suggest that building the pipeline would yield about 6,000 jobs directly, and another 7,000 jobs indirectly. Ex-Conoco Phillips lobbyist Don Duncan compared Trump’s energy proposals to those of an “old snake oil salesman”, saying: “Trump’s energy cures are based on a lot of numbers that clash with energy industry data and scientific studies.” Trump’s penchant for ignoring facts and hard evidence is also underscored by his attacks on global warming and the Paris accords. Trump famously tweeted in 2012 that the “concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing less competitive”. Taylor called this “risible”.  “Not one scintilla of evidence exists to back the charge up,” he said. “It’s another example of his willingness to say anything at all – no matter how ridiculous or dishonest – to justify the know-nothingism of his base.” Trump denied during Monday’s presidential debate having said such a thing, but in a speech last December he referred to global warming as a “hoax” three times in one sentence.  Former US congressman Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican who runs a group promoting free enterprise climate change ideas, said Trump’s global warming views were dangerous. “People who presume to be leaders by offering false hope and inflaming passions are disqualifying themselves for leadership.”"
"Eyebrows would be raised if American crocodiles, found on the southern tip of Florida, decided to relocate to New York’s Fifth Avenue or Moroccan camels suddenly joined the tourist throng outside Buckingham Palace in London. Yet this is the scale of species shift that appears to be under way in Alaska. In July, researchers in Cape Krusenstern national monument on the north-west coast of Alaska were startled to discover a nest containing Caspian terns on the gravelly beach of a lagoon. The birds were an incredible 1,000 miles further north than the species had been previously recorded. “There was plenty of shock, it is a very unusual situation,” said Dr Martin Robards, Arctic program director at the Wildlife Conservation Society, which found the nest. “We checked with Caspian tern experts and they were all very surprised they were this far north. We get Arctic terns here but these terns are much bigger, they really stand out.” The terns, usually found in Washington state, successfully bred and chicks have now flown the nest. While it remains to be seen whether Caspian terns will become ensconced long-term within the Arctic circle, the epic relocation is emblematic of how warming temperatures are causing a huge upheaval in the basic rhythms of Alaska’s environment. Next week, scientists will gather at the White House’s first ever Arctic science meeting to deliver the confronting news.  “I’ve been up here 25 years and the amount of change that has occurred in Alaska is shocking,” said Robards. “We’ve been focusing on things such as the temperature and sea ice here but now we are thinking ‘oh my God what is going on with the wildlife?’” Alaska is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the US, with the winter temperature 6F (3.3C) warmer than it was 60 years ago. Snow and ice has retreated, spring is coming earlier. The landscape is changing and so are its residents. “To be 1,000 miles further north attests to how much the globe has warmed,” said Terry Root, a biologist and senior fellow at Stanford University. “Birds follow their physiology, nothing else. If they think they should move, they move. Alaska has warmed so much that it is causing havoc to a lot of nature.” While most species aren’t able to move as far as terns, scientists are noticing shifts across Alaska. Moose and beavers have moved north of the Brooks Range and onto the Arctic plain, which increasingly offers suitable vegetation as the region warms up and greens.  Red foxes have moved in and have started to outcompete Arctic foxes. A similar thing may happen if the beefy Caspian terns start to push out their smaller cousins. The relationship between grizzly bears and polar bears may be a little more amicable – as their range starts to overlap there have been reports of a hybrid “pizzly” bears in the Arctic. But the situation for polar bears is otherwise grim – they are losing life-sustaining sea ice critical for hunting and breeding across the Arctic. They are being forced onto land, where they risk starvation. This desperate scenario is shared with walruses, which have already suffered a 50% drop since the 1980s. In recent years tens of thousands of the tusked beasts have had to crowd ashore, with many perishing in stampedes. The melting on land is just as stark. Over the past decade, Alaska has lost 850 gigatonnes of water from its shrinking glaciers, enough to raise the global sea level by 2.9mm. We are living through the fastest Arctic glacier decline in at least 6,000 years, according to Dr Martin Sharp, professor of Earth and atmospheric science at the University of Alberta. “If the warming trends continue then we expect to see continuous retreat,” Sharp said. “We are seeing the complete loss of glaciers, areas that had ice caps in the 1950s don’t have them now. That trend will probably increase.” Alaska is being locked into an unhappy cycle of events. As the declining glaciers lose albedo, or reflectivity from sunlight, they absorb more heat and therefore melt further.  The vegetation poking through thawing permafrost aids the spread of wildfire which in turn releases more carbon dioxide – flames have recently licked areas of Alaskan forest previously unburned for thousands of years. The amount of area burned each year in the state is expected to double by 2050 even if the world acts swiftly on climate change. Summer Arctic sea ice is forecast to winnow away completely by the 2030s, which will be a boon for tourism operators looking to traverse the opening north-west sea passage. The Crystal Serenity cruise ship, with passengers that paid up to $100,000 for a cabin, arrived safely in New York last week after a 32-day journey through this newly reliable corridor. But this decline threatens more traditional pursuits. Indigenous communities are finding the thinning ice too treacherous for fishing, while the 1,000-mile Iditarod dog sled race faces an uncertain future. After record winter warmth, Alaska baked as the season turned to spring – the temperature from January to April was an incredible 11.3F (6.2C) warmer than the long-term average taken from the 20th century. Still, Alaska and neighboring Canada may well prove a haven for overheated animal species in the future. The state will still be cooler than the lower 48 states and has plenty of wilderness.  “The Caspian tern is a success story in many ways,” said Root. “Unfortunately, many animals won’t be able to move. There’s only so far a salamander can crawl or a gopher tortoise can walk. We stand at the beginning of a mass extinction event.  “One of the most important wildlife corridors runs between Mexico and the US, so Donald Trump’s stupid wall could be a huge problem for nature. At least we won’t have a border like that with Canada, I guess.”"
"The world’s working coal mines and oil and gas fields contain enough carbon to push the world beyond the threshold for catastrophic climate change, according to a report released on Thursday. If all the existing fuel were to be burned, projects currently operating or under construction could be expected to release 942Gt CO2, said the report by US-based thinktank Oil Change International (OCI).  This exceeds the carbon limits that would most likely warm the world 1.5C and even over 2C above the pre-industrial average. These were limits agreed at last year’s climate conference in Paris. It has been established for some time that the enormous unworked reserves claimed by fossil fuel companies contain vastly too much carbon to ever be burned safely. But OCI said that this was the first time an analysis had been done of how much greenhouse gas is stored in projects already working or under construction. Founder of 350.org and climate campaign Bill McKibben said the report “change[d] our understanding of where we stand. Profoundly”. It means that even if not a single new coal mine, oil or gas field were opened up, the carbon budget would be at risk, said OCI’s executive director Stephen Kretzmann. Projected investment in new extraction sites and infrastructure over the next 20 years adds up to a staggering US$14tn, the report found. “Continued expansion of the fossil fuel industry is now quite clearly and quantifiably climate denial,” said Kretzmann. The OCI report said existing oil and gas fields alone would exceed the carbon budget for 1.5C – which is a limit some small island states say would finish them and scientists believe would wipe out most coral reefs. James Leaton, research director at the Carbon Tracker thinktank which did much to popularise the concept of “unburnable carbon”, said research by Carbon Tracker in 2015 showed coal demand was declining so quickly that current reserves would be enough. But the picture was less clear for oil and gas. “There is clearly no need for new coal mines to be developed if we are to stay within a 2C carbon budget,” said Leaton. “Because oil and gas production declines over time in any particular well, this may fall faster than the level of oil and gas demand in [a 2C scenario], in which case some new production would be needed. Depending on how much carbon budget you allocate to each fossil fuel, and the speed of the energy transition assumed, the window for new oil and gas will also start to close.” In the UK, the government has committed to opening its shale gas resources to fracking. Ken Cronin, chief executive of the industry body UK Onshore Oil and Gas, said: “This report needs to look more deeply into the use of gas in a modern energy mix, looking at areas such as reformation of methane into hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, particularly for heating systems and potentially transport. The simple fact is that the best way to combat climate change is to remove coal ASAP and to do that you need to replace much of the coal capacity with gas.” The OCI report did not take into account carbon capture and storage (CCS), which it argued is still at an “uncertain” stage of development. The International Energy Agency reported last week that CCS, which is fitted to emissions sources to trap carbon, was being rolled out at a rate of just one project every year. Study author Greg Muttitt said it was imperative for governments to focus on shutting down new mines and fields before a sod was turned. “Once an extraction operation is underway, it creates an incentive to continue so as to recoup investment and create profit, ensuring the product – the fossil fuels – are extracted and burned. These incentives are powerful, and the industry will do whatever it takes to protect their investments and keep drilling,” he said. There is new carbon math coming tomorrow that will change our understanding of where we stand. Profoundly. Ben Caldecott, director of the Sustainable Finance Programme at the University of Oxford Smith School said: “One direct implication of meeting climate targets are stranded upstream fossil fuel assets. These stranded assets need to be managed, particularly in terms of the communities that could be negatively impacted. Policymakers need to proactively manage these impacts to ensure a ‘just transition’.” The report expands on a call made by former Kiribati president Anote Tong last year to stop opening new coal mines. China, the US and Indonesia, the world’s largest, third- and fifth-largest coal producers, have banned any new coal mines. In the US, the moratorium is only on public land. But in Australia’s Galilee basin, there are nine proposed coal mines with a total lifetime emissions of 24Gt CO2. This includes the massive Adani Carmichael mine, which the Australian government has approved. The Australian Department of Environment would not comment on whether it had assessed the impact of the Carmichael mine on the global carbon budget."
"A top-secret US military project from the cold war and the toxic waste it conceals, thought to have been buried for ever beneath the Greenland icecap, are likely to be uncovered by rising temperatures within decades, scientists have said. The US army engineering corps excavated Camp Century in 1959 around 200km (124 miles) from the coast of Greenland, which was then a county of Denmark. Powered, remarkably, by the world’s first mobile nuclear generator and known as “the city under the ice”, the camp’s three-kilometre network of tunnels, eight metres beneath the ice, housed laboratories, a shop, a hospital, a cinema, a chapel and accommodation for as many as 200 soldiers. Its personnel were officially stationed there to test Arctic construction methods and carry out research. Scientists based at the camp did, indeed, drill the first ice core samples ever used to study the earth’s climate, obtaining data still cited today, according to William Colgan, a climate and glacier scientist from the Lassonde school of engineering at Toronto’s York University, and the lead author of the study. In reality, the camp served as cover for something altogether different - a project so immense and so secret that not even the Danish government was informed of its existence. “They thought it would never be exposed,” said Colgan. “Back then, in the 60s, the term global warming had not even been coined. But the climate is changing, and the question now is whether what’s down there is going to stay down there.” The study suggests it is not. Project Iceworm, presented to the US chiefs of staff in 1960, aimed to use Camp Century’s frozen tunnels to test the feasibility of a huge launch site under the ice, close enough to fire nuclear missiles directly at the Soviet Union. At the height of the cold war, as the US and the USSR were engaged in a terrifying standoff over the deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba, the US army was considering the construction of a vast subterranean extension of Camp Century. A system of about 4,000 kilometres of icy underground tunnels and chambers extending over an area around three times the size of Denmark were to have housed 600 ballistic missiles in clusters six kilometres apart, trained on Moscow and its satellites. Eventually the engineers realised Iceworm would not work. The constantly moving ice was too unstable and would have deformed and perhaps even collapsed the tunnels. From 1964 Camp Century was used only intermittently, and three years later it was abandoned altogether, the departing soldiers taking the reaction chamber of the nuclear generator with them. They left the rest of the camp’s infrastructure – and its biological, chemical and radioactive waste – where it was, on the assumption it would be “preserved for eternity” by the perpetually accumulating snow and ice. Thus far their assumption has proven correct. Up to 12 metres deep at the time it was abandoned, the ice covering Camp Century has since thickened to around 35 metres and will continue to deepen for a while yet. Climate change, however, looks certain to reverse that process, Colgan and his six-strong team from Canadian, US and European universities said in their report, which was published last month in Geophysical Research Letters. Greenland’s temperatures broke new records this spring and summer, hitting 24C (75F) in the capital, Nuuk, in June – a figure that shocked meteorologists so much they had to recheck their measurements. Between 2003 and 2010, the ice that covers much of the island melted twice as fast as during the whole of the 20th century. This year it began melting a month earlier than usual. The researchers studied US army documents and drawings to work out how deep the camp and its waste – estimated to include 200,000 litres of diesel fuel, similar quantities of waste water and unknown amounts of radioactive coolant and toxic organic pollutants such as PCBs – were buried. Then they ran regional and global climate change simulations to work out how much longer they would remain interred. Based on the “business as usual” climate change scenario, Colgan said, snowfall would continue to be greater than ice melt for a few more decades. “But after that, melt will be greater than snow. Every year, another layer of ice will be removed. Our estimate is that by 2090, the exposure will be irreversible. It could happen sooner if the magnitude of climate change accelerates.” Once that starts to happen, the question of who is responsible for the clear-up – already the subject of discussion – will become more pressing, the report said, presenting “an entirely new form of political dispute resulting from climate change”. With no established agreement on the question, the report says the “multinational, multi-generational” problem posed by Camp Century and its waste could become a source of tension between the US, Greenland and Denmark. Denmark allowed the US to build Camp Century and other bases on Greenland in a 1951 agreement, but it is not clear how much it was told about the work being done there or the waste left behind. Complicating matters further, Greenland became largely self-governing in 1979. Vittus Qujaukitsoq, Greenland’s foreign minister, said he was concerned about the camp’s future and determined to establish responsibility. His Danish counterpart, Kristian Jensen, has said the issue was being examined in close contact with Greenland. The Pentagon has said it “acknowledges the reality of climate change and the risk it poses” for Greenland, adding that the US government has pledged to “work with the Danish government and the Greenland authorities to settle questions of mutual security”."
"Miners seeking the green light to dig up Queensland’s Galilee basin should be stopped as a priority, according to a new report showing existing fossil fuels projects worldwide are enough to push global warming beyond 2C. The report by the research and advocacy group Oil Change International argues there is a compelling case for the six Galilee coalmining proposals in the hands of Australian regulators to be axed in line with a “managed decline” of global coal, oil and gas supplies already on tap.  It shows the embedded carbon emissions from operating fields and mines worldwide, if run to the end of their projected lifetimes, would drive warming beyond the 2C limit laid down by last year’s Paris agreement. Developed oil and gas reserves alone would take warming beyond the aspirational 1.5C target. The report shows that if Australia fully exploited its untapped coal reserves – the third largest in the world behind the US and Russia – the resulting emissions would blow almost a third of the world’s carbon budget for 1.5C. About a fifth of these emissions (24 gigatonnes) would come from the six Galilee mining hopefuls who have applied for permits. The largest is Adani’s Carmichael mine, which over its lifetime would contribute more than half of these emissions through 5 bn tonnes of coal. The China First mine proposal by Clive Palmer’s Waratah Coal, which like others in the Galilee appears to hinge on Adani paving the way with rail infrastructure, is the third largest at 1bn tonnes. The report singles out Australia and the Galilee as being on the “frontline of expansion” of the global coal industry and stopping this development “must be a priority”. “The consequence of our analysis is that no new extractive or facilitating infrastructure should be built anywhere in the world,” it says. Fellow coal giants China and Indonesia have enacted temporary bans on new coalmines and the US has a limited moratorium on new mines on public land. That leaves Australia as one of just “two countries that are currently proceeding with major coalmining development”, along with India, the report says. India, with its urgent need for economic uplift and relatively low contribution to historical emissions, could be given a “generous support package” funded by wealthy countries to pursue low-carbon development. But the “hard choices” by governments about phasing out existing projects should start in the developed countries such as Australia, the report says. Adani, an Indian conglomerate, has argued its Australian mine would be pivotal in helping the Indian electricity sector move towards making cheap energy available to the impoverished. The “energy poverty” argument is contested by Adani’s critics. The company, which has been embroiled in a long series of legal challenges in Queensland from traditional owners and conservationists, has reportedly downsized the first phase of its mine and put off an investment decision till the end of 2017. The mine would now cost $4bn to get off the ground and initially produce 25m tonnes a year, with 80% slated for its sister energy company Adani Power, the Australian Financial Review reported. Tim Buckley at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said Adani’s scaled-down plans remained “unbankable” for a company that held US$2.6bn net debt beside a market capitalisation of just US$1.2bn. Adani Power was in even worse “financial distress”, with net debts of more than US$7.3bn against market capitalisation of US$1.4bn, Buckley said. It was also yet to build most of the large power stations in western India which Carmichael would supply. “Lacking economies of scale, this low-quality thermal export coal proposal lacks strategic relevance in India where the installed cost of solar is now lower than that of imported thermal coal,” he said. This casts doubt on broader development prospects in the Galilee basin, which Buckley said was “still stranded 400km inland from the coast without any industrial-grade power, road, water, aviation or rail infrastructure in place”.  The report’s author, Greg Muttit, said there were “only three possibilities” to consider in the future of fossil fuels extraction. “We can manage the decline of our existing fields, shifting to clean energy and redeploying workers,” he said. “Or we continue to develop new reserves that then have to be shut down suddenly, stranding assets, costing investors, and causing havoc in fossil fuel extraction-dependent communities.  “Or we just carry on as we are – and wreak economic, ecological and human catastrophe on the world.”  Stephen Kretzmann, the executive director of Oil Change International, said: “If the world is serious about achieving the goals agreed in Paris, governments have to stop the expansion of the fossil fuel industry. “The industry has enough carbon in the pipeline – today – to break through the sky’s limit.” The report says the study was the first to examine the climate change implications of potential emissions from current oil, gas and coal operations in light of the Paris agreement. It draws on industry data from the oil and gas consultancy Rystad Energy and carbon budgets derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."
"Slowing down construction of coal-fired power stations will be vital to hit globally agreed climate change goals, the World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, said as he outlined a five-point plan to flesh out last year’s Paris agreement to reduce CO2 emissions. Speaking at a climate ministerial meeting in Washington during the bank’s annual meeting, he said there was no prospect of keeping global warming at or below 2C (3.6F) if current plans for coal-fired stations, especially those earmarked for Asia, were built. “Many countries want to move in the right direction. We can and should all help to find renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions that allow them to phase out coal,” Kim said.  The World Bank president said achieving the climate change target required action in five areas. In addition to slowing down growth in coal-fired power stations, Kim said climate ambition needed to be baked into development plans for every developing country. It was important that the $90bn (£72bn) of planned infrastructure spending over the next 15 years was for low-CO2 and climate-resilient investment. He called for the ramping up of energy-efficient appliances and less use of hydrofluorocarbons, which are used in air conditioning units. “Phasing down HFCs could prevent close to half a degree of global warming by the end of the century,” he said. Calls for the “greening” of finance by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, were also strongly backed by Kim who said the sector needed to be “fit for purpose to assess climate risks and opportunities”. Finally, Kim said poor countries needed help to adapt to climate change and to become more resilient. He added that without climate-driven development, climate change could force more than 100 million people into extreme poverty by 2030, and that unless low-income countries in many parts of Africa, south Asia and the Pacific islands were helped all the gains in poverty reduction risked being lost. Kim said countries needed more efficient water supply systems, climate-smart agriculture, early warning systems, better social protection and a reduction in disaster risk. He said: “It is our collective responsibility to see the Paris agreement through. We cannot afford to lose the momentum. With each passing day, the climate challenge grows. “The longest streak of record-warm months has now reached 16 - such heat has never persisted on the planet for so long. The reality is stark. We have a planet that is at serious risk, but our current response is not yet equal to the task.” Kim said the Paris climate agreement was a “victory for multilateral action and a powerful signal from all corners of the world that there can be no turning back”."
"A Senate committee will examine how best to close coal power stations to meet Australia’s climate change targets when the Greens and Labor combine to set up an inquiry on Wednesday. The Greens and Labor will move a motion to ask the Senate environment and communications references committee to report on mass closures of electricity generators, and expect sufficient crossbench support to set up the inquiry.  It will consider how the retirement of coal power plants can help meet the Paris climate target of limiting global warming to 2C and how to achieve it with “minimal community and individual impact from closures”. That will include ways to attract new investment and jobs to affected communities. The committee will also consider the increasing amount of electricity generated by renewables, future demand and the “maintenance of electricity supply, affordability and security”. The concern with energy security echoes the terms of reference of a review of the National Electricity Market by the chief scientist established last week after federal and state energy ministers met to discuss energy security after the South Australian blackout. The committee will provide an interim report by 28 November and a final report by 1 February. The Greens senator Larissa Waters, the chair of the committee, said: “We need a plan for the orderly phase-out of coal-fired power stations as we make the transition to clean energy.”  “Without a plan workers, communities and the future of our energy system will be left up to the chaos of the market.” Communities in central Queensland, the Hunter, the Latrobe valley and Collie in Western Australia would benefit from the inquiry, she said. Labor climate change and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said: “The ageing coal power station fleet, 20% of which is over 35 years old, will need replacement in coming years “Labor is committed to ensuring that closures happen at least cost, consistently with our climate change objectives and affected workers and communities are assisted to new industries and new jobs.” Butler accused the government of “ignoring reality” and refusing to develop a plan for inevitable coal plant closures. The government may consider coal power plant closures in its 2017 review of climate change policies. According to an Essential poll released on Tuesday, 60% of Australians said renewable energy was “the solution to our energy needs” compared with 16% who regarded it as “a threat to the energy supply” and 24% undecided. The poll also found 60% of those polled believe the South Australian blackout would have occurred “regardless of how the electricity was produced”, compared with 17% who blamed over-reliance on renewables and 24% undecided."
"Reykjavík used to be marketed as a place of “pure energy”, run on geothermal power – and now Iceland’s capital is trying to become the world’s first carbon neutral city. Last month, Iceland became one of the first countries to ratify the Paris climate deal with a unilateral parliamentary vote, shortly after Reykjavik announced its aim to be carbon neutral by 2040.  It wants to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from 2.8 tonnes per person in 2013 to zero – largely by changing the shape of the city to reverse urban sprawl and encouraging Icelanders out of their beloved cars to walk, cycle or use public transport. The city already has a head-start thanks to its reliance on geothermal energy. The US, for example, has a greenhouse gas footprint of 16.5 tonnes per person. The city, the world’s northernmost capital, has a population of just over 120,000, with 60% of Iceland’s population in its metropolitan area. A pull for increasing tourism – expected to make up a tenth of the country’s 2016 GDP – is Iceland’s amazing geothermal features. These resources also mean all Reykjavík’s houses have geothermal heating, plus 100% hydroelectricity. “Now we’re going to push it further and do it faster,” says Ólöf Örvarsdóttir, head of the environment and planning department. “We’re very lucky because we have our natural energy but it’s about taking a stand and educating people who live here.” “I think we can achieve it but our biggest challenge is transport,” says Örvarsdóttir. To solve that Reykjavík plans to keep investing in bike paths (it has a £3.3m budget for this year), install more electric car charging points, and work with six neighbouring municipalities on a new rapid bus or light rail system.  The city already has a bus system but it is only used by 4% of people – and it aims to treble public transport usage by 2030. It wants cycling to increase from 19% to more than 30%, and is encouraging electric car use in its own 9,000 public employees and others via free parking and lower taxes. Solving its “urban growth quandary” is key to reducing the transport-related 80% of emissions, says Þorsteinn Hermannsson, city director of transport and urban design. “Around 75% of all trips in the Reykjavík area are by car, so a low-hanging fruit is to get people to walk or bike or use more energy-efficient public transportation,” he says. “We tend to use our car as our overcoat instead of dressing up and walking 1km.” Hermannsson is embarking on a project to persuade residents to live in the city, not suburbs. “The Reykjavík area is quite sprawled, like an American city, and that’s reflected in the private car choice,” he says. “We have to grow inwards instead of outwards and people living closer to work and shops will mean they move differently.” City surveys suggest young people are keen to live in the city, and public transport expert Jarrett Walker – who ran executive workshops for the area last year – says the current sprawl is a real problem. “Carbon neutrality always comes down to urban form,” he says. “Outside the small historic centre Reykjavík is mostly high-density sprawl: apartment blocks oriented towards motorways or fast streets rather than to pedestrian infrastructure or logical public transport paths. Many people in these towers can’t even walk to a convenience store.” Developers are keen to exploit “brownfield” spaces. Þorvaldur Gissurarson, owner and chief executive of ÞGverk and Arcus companies, is building a Hafnartorg (“harbour city”) development of retail, offices and 80 apartments in prime downtown. “Downtown hasn’t had that high density we see in many countries due to city planning issues restricting the number of apartments, and prices. The city [authority] needed to change.” Companies are also on board. Last year, the Icelandic centre for corporate social responsibility, Festa, encouraged 104 company leaders to sign a pledge to measure and reduce waste and emissions. Managing director Ketill Magnússon believes there’s genuine will to change, as well as cash-saving motivations, and adds: “This is something capitals in the Nordic region are doing – there’s peer pressure between mayors.” One of those corporate leaders who signed the pledge was Erna Eiríksdóttir, senior manager of investor relations at Eimskip shipping. She said waste and energy reduction make business and environmental sense. Its long-distance ships cannot currently be electric powered (although Iceland is installing electric chargers for fishing vessels). “We should be able to do it if we motivate each other, but we may have to compromise between convenience and what it costs in time,” she says. As well as tourists, better green credentials could also increase the city’s attractiveness as an international conference location halfway across the Atlantic, says Áshildur Bragadóttir, director of Visit Reykjavík tourist body. “We have the geysers, great water pools, glaciers, volcanos – the landscape is constantly changing because of eruptions, earthquakes and climate change.In Reykjavík, I think we are more concerned about nature than perhaps other nations because we are so connected to our island, landscape and natural wonders.”"

"James Lovelock’s parting words last time we met were: “Enjoy life while you can. Because if you’re lucky, it’s going to be 20 years before it hits the fan.” It was early 2008, and the distinguished scientist was predicting imminent and irreversible global warming, which would soon make large parts of the planet uninhabitably hot or put them underwater. The fashionable hope that windfarms or recycling could prevent global famine and mass migration was, he assured me, a fantasy; it was too late for ethical consumption to save us. Before the end of this century, 80% of the world’s population would be wiped out. His predictions were not easy to forget or dismiss. Sometimes described as a futurist, Lovelock has been Britain’s leading independent scientist for more than 50 years. His Gaia hypothesis, which contends that the earth is a single, self-regulating organism, is now accepted as the founding principle of most climate science, and his invention of a device to detect CFCs helped identify the hole in the ozone layer. A defiant generalist in an era of increasingly specialised study, and a mischievous provocateur, Lovelock is regarded by many as a scientific genius. Eight years after our previous encounter, he appears to have aged not one bit. At 97, he’s conceived a beautifully illustrated book of essays described as a “tool kit for the future”, The Earth and I, and written the introduction and conclusion; he goes walking every day, his hearing is perfect, his focus forensic and his memory unimpaired. “Yes, why not? I’m writing a fiction book at the moment. It’s tremendous fun, you know.” He applies his holistic philosophy of science to his own health. “I’m a firm believer that if you don’t use it, you lose it – and if you do a lot of walking, and if you use your muscles quite a bit, your brain seems to work as well. You’ve got to look at the whole system, not just bits of it.” What has changed dramatically, however, is his position on climate change. He now says: “Anyone who tries to predict more than five to 10 years is a bit of an idiot, because so many things can change unexpectedly.” But isn’t that exactly what he did last time we met? “I know,” he grins teasingly. “But I’ve grown up a bit since then.” Lovelock now believes that “CO2 is going up, but nowhere near as fast as they thought it would. The computer models just weren’t reliable. In fact,” he goes on breezily, “I’m not sure the whole thing isn’t crazy, this climate change. You’ve only got to look at Singapore. It’s two-and-a-half times higher than the worst-case scenario for climate change, and it’s one of the most desirable cities in the world to live in.” There are various possible explanations for his change of heart. One is that Lovelock is right, and the models on which his former predictions were based were fatally flawed. Another is that his iconoclastic sensibility made revision irresistible. An incorrigible subversive, Lovelock was warning the world about climate change for decades before it began to pay attention, and just when the scientific consensus began to call for intervention to prevent it, he decided we were already too late. But there is a third explanation for why he has shifted his position again, and nowadays feels “laid back about climate change”. All things being equal – “and it’s only got to take one sizable volcano to erupt and all the models, everything else, is right off the board” – he expects that before the consequences of global warming can impact on us significantly, something else will have made our world unrecognisable, and threaten the human race. Lovelock maintains that, unlike most environmentalists, he is a rigorous empiricist, but it is manifestly clear that he enjoys maddening the green movement. “Well, it’s a religion, really, you see. It’s totally unscientific.” He was once invited to Buckingham Palace, where he told Princess Anne: “Your brother nearly killed me.” Having read that Prince Charles had installed grass-burning boilers at Highgrove, Lovelock had tried one in his house. “It’s supposed to smoulder and keep the place warm; but it doesn’t, because it goes out, and clouds and clouds of smoke come out.” He giggles. “Princess Anne thought this was hilariously funny.” Lovelock had been trying to heat his old mill in Devon, where he lived for more than 35 years, inventing contraptions in a workshop that resembled a Doctor Who set. He and his wife recently packed up his life’s work and downsized to a remote cottage on Chesil Beach in Dorset, after the bill to heat the mill for just six months hit £6,000. “I remember George Monbiot took me up on it and wrote that it was impossible, that I had to be lying. But I wasn’t lying, I’ve got the figures.” Monbiot doesn’t quite accuse him of lying, in fairness; just of “talking rubbish” and “making wild statements”. In any case, he says that in the US he found he could heat a house for six months, in temperatures of -20C (-4F), for just £60. As a result, he has withering contempt for environmentalists’ opposition to fracking. “You see, gas in America is incredibly cheap, because of fracking,” he says. But what about the risk of triggering earthquakes? He rolls his eyes. “Sure enough, that’s true, there will be an increase. But they’re tiny little tremors, they would be imperceptible. The only trouble is that you can detect them. The curse of my life has been that I’ve spent a lot of time inventing devices that are exceedingly sensitive. And the moment somebody can detect something, they’re going to attach a number to it, and then they make a fuss about it.” He chuckles, then pauses. “I’m not anti-green in the sense that I’m in favour of polluting the world with every damn thing we make. I think we’ve got to be careful. But I’m afraid, human nature being what it is, the thing gets exaggerated out of all proportion, and the greens have behaved deplorably instead of being reasonably sensible.” Even more heretical than his enthusiasm for fracking is Lovelock’s passionate support for nuclear power. But, like fracking, he says, it offers only “a stopgap” solution. “Because in the long term, they’ll use up all the uranium.” How long would that take? He pauses to do some quick mental arithmetic, as casually as I might tot up how many pints of milk to grab from Sainsburys. “Let’s see … I think uranium that is affordable to extract would last about 50 years, something in that range. It might be 100. When you’ve used all that up, you go to thorium, and that would last you three times as long as uranium – so, shall we say, about 200 years?” The most sensible energy solution would be to cover 100 sq miles of the Sahara in solar panels. “It would supply the whole of Europe with all the energy they needed,” but it won’t happen “because it would be so easy for terrorists to go and bugger it up”. So for now, nuclear energy is the only viable option. But all this, he clarifies cheerfully, is more or less academic. “Because quite soon – before we’ve reached the end of this century, even – I think that what people call robots will have taken over.” Robots will rule the world? “Well, yes. They’ll be in charge.” In charge of us? “Yes, if we’re still here. Whether they’ll have taken over peacefully or otherwise, I have no idea.” For robots, time happens a million times faster than it does for us. That’s rather wonderful in a way, isn’t it? He isn’t alone in this view: the influential philosopher Nick Bostrom has persuaded many people that artificial intelligence poses a real threat to the future of humanity; Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, among others, have called for urgent research to mitigate the risks. Still, when Lovelock outlines this vision, his tone is so matter-of-fact that for a moment I wonder if he’s joking. He isn’t. “We’re already happily letting computers design themselves. This has been going on for some time now, particularly with chips, and it’s not going to be long before that’s out of our hands, and we’ll be standing aside and saying, ‘Oh well, it’s doing a good job designing itself, let’s encourage it.’” Computers will develop independent volition and intuition (“To some extent, they already have”) and become capable of reproducing themselves, and of evolving. “Oh yes, that’s crucial. We’ll have a world where Darwin’s working.” Darwinism doesn’t work now? “Oh no, we’ve temporarily turned Darwinism backwards. I mean, we preserve the ones that would not have survived.” He pauses, and adds quickly: “Don’t let’s get dangerous on this one. I don’t want this appearing in the Guardian that he just wants all the dumb and the lowlifes wiped out.” Lovelock doesn’t sound the least bit troubled by the prospect of robots taking over, though, despite the possibility that they will destroy us. “Once they become at all established anywhere, that’s the end, because to robots time happens one million times faster – that’s a fairly exact figure – than it does to us. That’s rather wonderful in a way, isn’t it?” I ask him to explain. “Well, for a neuron to travel a foot takes a microsecond – which is fairly fast. But for electrons to go down a foot of wire takes a nanosecond. It’s a million times faster, as simple as that. So to a robot, once fully established in that new world, a second is a million seconds. Everything is happening so fast that they have on earth a million times longer to live, to grow up, to evolve, than we do.” It is possible, he goes on, that human beings may fuse with robots to become a blend of robotic and human tissue (“That’s one route”), but the likelier scenario will be pure robots. Why does he think we’ll go for all-out robots? He shoots me an amused look. “I don’t think we will. I think that they will – that’s the key thing here.” The implications for climate change are obvious. “The world that they’re going to be comfortable in is wildly different from the one that we feel comfortable in. So once they really get established, they will – with regret – start losing organic life.” Will they care about rising temperatures? “They won’t give a fourpenny fuck about the temperature, because to them the change will be slow, and they can stand quite a big change without any fuss. They could accommodate infinitely greater change through climate change than we can, before things get tricky for them. It’s what the world can stand that is the important thing. They’re going to have a safe platform to live in, so they don’t want Gaia messed about too much.” Notwithstanding his caveats about the dangers of predictions, his confidence in the robotic future he describes is “fairly high. Yes, all sorts of things can happen, but that’s the intuitive feeling I have”. As for our interaction with robots: “Well, it’s going to be very peculiar.” In the classic Frankenstein tradition, will humanity not understand what it has created until it’s too late? “Well, too late is the wrong word. Let’s say, until it has happened.” The phrase “too late”, he explains, implies regret – but whereas the robots might see no use for our continued existence, “maybe we’ve got some special property that they will appreciate. But then, don’t forget, their timescale is a million times different from ours. They’d have a lot of trouble talking to us.” In the same sense that we have trouble talking to ants? “Oh no, it’s much worse than that. It’s really more like us talking to a giant redwood tree. And you never know, they may feel about us the same way as we feel about trees.” They might even, I suggest, want to hug us? Lovelock’s face lights up in delight. “Yes, exactly! Exactly. That’s a good one.” Lovelock was no less bafflingly cheerful when he believed climate change was about to wipe out 80% of the world’s population. How can he now feel just as sanguine about a global takeover by robots? “One may say: ‘Well, of course, he’s so old he’s stopped having any feelings.’ Not true, I’ll say!” He would have been, he insists, just the same 50 years ago. “And I would hate to think it was an affectation.” He would rather not be called a maverick, because it makes him sound like someone who “makes gadgets in his garage”. “But everything in life to me is just: ‘Oh, isn’t that interesting?’” • The Earth and I by James Lovelock et al (Taschen, £24.99) is out now.

"When most of us think of slowing global warming, we think of reducing car exhaust and power plant emissions – limiting activities that involve combusting fossil fuels. But we rarely draw the connection between the production of energy and another important resource: water. Yet in California, 20% of the state’s electricity and 30% of the natural gas that isn’t used by power plants goes to the water system – from pumping it for delivery to disposing of wastewater. Could saving water play a significant role in addressing climate change? And, if so, could we achieve these savings without incurring significant costs?  A bill just signed by governor Jerry Brown will pave the way to answer those key questions. The Water-Energy Nexus Registry bill, or SB 1425, establishes a voluntary registry of greenhouse gas emissions for water utilities to account for the emissions generated from their energy use. It’s a radical departure of how California has been addressing climate change. In effect, SB 1425 moves the focus from fossil fuels to water. California has long been a leader in addressing global warming. In 2006, California enacted the Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32), which set out to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Since then, the state has implemented a flurry of programs to cut emissions, from subsidizing electric cars and solar panel purchases to mandating tailpipe emission reductions of cars and trucks. In September, the governor expanded the target by signing a bill requiring the state to cut the emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. These programs have been a great success: California is on target to meet its near-term 2020 goal. Reaching the 2030 goal will require new investments and innovation. The new registry for water-related emissions can play a key role in achieving that 2030 target. We haven’t been focusing on water primarily because our efforts have centered on reducing emissions from two of the biggest sources: burning fossil fuels to generate electricity and power vehicles. Then, the ongoing drought that first hit California five years ago put a spotlight on water consumption and its heavy reliance on the state’s electricity generation and distribution system. The drought led to mandatory water use reductions, sparked public anger at heavy water users such as farmers and big businesses and touched off fights over water rights. For example, Nestle drew public outcry for continuing to pump and bottle millions of gallons of water. I think many of us understand that driving less can significantly reduce emissions, but is that true for using less water? To investigate this issue, I challenged my research group in the Center for Water-Energy Efficiency at the University of California, Davis, to explore how much electricity is saved through aggressive water conservation measures. The results shocked us. Our analysis showed that the quantity of electricity saved statewide through reducing urban water use by 25% in 2015 was roughly equivalent to all of the electricity saved by all of the energy efficiency programs from the state’s four major investor-owned energy utilities in 2015. The conclusion: energy savings from water conservation are significant. Our research focused on the so-called cold water energy, which is used for pumping, treating, and delivering water and disposing of wastewater. The energy used in consuming water, such as heating it, is commonly referred to as hot water energy. To create effective water conservation programs, we will need good data to measure emission reductions associated with energy savings. SB 1425 will lay the groundwork for establishing a protocol to calculate energy-related emissions and create a registry for documenting and archiving them. Making a strong connection between energy and water savings will also help persuade policy makers to fund more water conservation efforts. This, in turn, will also nudge water utilities to share their data with the voluntary registry. Otherwise, water utilities will either raise water rates to fund those initiatives or absorb the expenses themselves. As a result, they can become reluctant to step up voluntary conservation efforts. To meet the 2015 state mandate to reduce urban water use by 25% over the 2013 levels, for example, water utilities had to pay, on average, $75 for every acre-foot saved. Instead of crafting new incentive programs, the state can use existing ones to fund water conservation efforts that also lower the state’s energy consumption. One of California’s most important climate change programs is the cap-and-trade system, which generates revenues for the state through the sale of permits that major polluters must buy to cover their emissions. The cap-and-trade program currently funds a variety of emissions-reducing efforts, including rebates for more energy- efficient water heaters. It doesn’t subsidize any type of cold-water conservation, and it should. Just as we are encouraged to diversify our retirement accounts to ensure resiliency and make a profit, we must do the same in our strategies to lower the state’s emissions. Water utilities need to see conservation as an activity that does not threaten their fiscal stability, and we need their help to tackle climate change. In my view, energy utilities need to be even more aggressive investing in energy efficiency through water conservation, and California needs to expand its climate change programs to invest aggressively in both hot and cold water conservation. SB 1425 will help to get this done.

"The fossil fuel industry’s emissions of a powerful greenhouse gas are dramatically higher than previously thought. Researchers who pulled together the biggest database yet of worldwide methane emissions found that, after natural sources were discounted, emissions from gas, oil and coal production were 20-60% greater than existing estimates. Methane makes up just 16% of global greenhouse gases and is shorter-lived than the CO2 which accounts for three quarters, but has a much more powerful warming effect.  The extra methane estimated by the study is 300 times larger than the amount leaked in California’s Aliso Canyon last year, which was the worst gas leak in US history. While bad news for efforts to tackle climate change, the new study published in Nature also found that methane emissions had fallen as a fraction of industry’s production. Lead author Stefan Schwietzke, of the University of Colorado and US science agency Noaa, said that methane from fossil fuels had played a significant role in global warming, but the gas’s short lifetime meant acting on it now could pay quick dividends. “The good news is that reducing methane emissions now will reduce climate forcing in only a few years – it takes much longer for CO2. And since fossil fuel methane emissions are higher than previously thought, the potential to reduce climate forcing from this specific source is also greater,” he told the Guardian. Experts said the study meant scientists should reconsider their climate models. “Emissions scenarios currently used for climate prediction need to be reassessed taking into account revised values for anthropogenic methane emissions,” wrote Dr Grant Allen of the University of Manchester in a commentary in Nature. Other studies have suggested the huge growth in the US shale gas industry is to blame for a spike in methane emissions since the mid-noughties. But the new work found methane emissions from natural gas production had declined as a fraction of production from 8% in the mid-1980s to around 2% in the late 2000s and early 2010s. “There has been anecdotal evidence for a while that the oil and gas industry improved their efficiency. Our data confirms this anecdotal evidence on a global scale,” said Schwietzke. Methane emissions have been rising since the industrial revolution but paused between 1996 and 2006 – believed by some to be because of decreased fossil fuel emissions in former Soviet Union countries – before marching upwards again. Most is from natural sources, such as wetlands and geological seepage, but humanity’s share is estimated to account for 30-45% of the total. The study published on Wednesday examined the isotopic “fingerprints” of methane sources, compiling thousands of measurements from public sources and peer-reviewed papers. Allen said it was the largest database of its kind. Schwietzke said that such models on methane were very sensitive to the data that informed them. “A key message is that the number and comprehensiveness of measurements matter.”"
"A loose coalition of more than 100 countries, including the US and European nations, is pushing for an early phase-out of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a powerful greenhouse gas that if left unchecked is set to add a potentially disastrous 0.5C to global temperatures by the end of the century.  At a meeting in New York on Thursday, world leaders called for an “ambitious phase-down schedule” for HFCs, which are commonly used in refrigerators and air conditioning systems, and pledged adaptation money for developing nations where HFC use is rapidly increasing. “The growth in some HFCs is extraordinarily fast right now so it’s critical that we have an ambitious agreement,” a White House official told the Guardian. “This is an extraordinarily important opportunity.” Concerns over the gaping ozone hole over Antarctica spurred countries to agree to phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), an ozone-depleting gas found in fridges and aerosols, in the 1987 Montreal Protocol.  While this proved successful – scientists recently forecast the ozone layer may well be completely healed by the middle of the century – CFCs have been routinely replaced by HFCs, which trap thousands of times more heat in the Earth’s atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Their growing use in developing countries could mean they account for nearly 20% of all emissions by 2050. The replacement of HFCs could prove crucial if the world is to avoid dangerous runaway climate change, driven by a temperature rise of 2C or more. The new coalition of nations, which will push for an early phase-out of HFCs at a gathering in Rwanda next month, includes the US, all 28 European Union nations, all 54 countries in Africa and South American nations including Argentina and Colombia. The US is proposing that growth in HFC use be “frozen” at 2021 levels and then scaled down so that it is largely eliminated by 2050. China wants a later peaking date, at 2025, but is still considered part of an early drawdown group when compared to other Asian nations. India is the most reluctant, having pushed for a 2031 date. A group of 16 countries, including the US, UK, Japan, Germany and Australia, has agreed to provide $27m next year to help support an early end to HFCs. Private philanthropists have pitched in even more, pledging $53m to efforts to promote energy efficient alternatives. “This effort to reduce potent greenhouse gases known as hydrofluorocarbons while cutting energy waste and costs is a great example of the critical role innovation can play in addressing climate change while prioritizing international development,” said the Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, one of the donors.  “This initiative is a great opportunity for the public and private sectors to work together to solve a critical problem.” Jamshyd Godrej, chairman of Indian multinational form Godrej & Boyce, said a phase-out of HFCs would provide India with “significant energy and financial savings for consumers, industry and government”. The growing use of air conditioning and refrigeration risks undermining international efforts to cut emissions to avoid dangerous heatwaves, extreme weather and sea level rise.  Worldwide power consumption for air conditioning alone is forecast to surge 33-fold by 2100 as developing world incomes rise and urbanization advances. By mid-century people will use more energy for cooling than heating. “Most people tend to think of energy in terms of heat and light and transport,” said Toby Peters, visiting professor of power and the cold economy at the University of Birmingham, last October. “But more and more, it’s going to be about cold. Demand for cold is already huge, it’s growing fast, and we’re meeting it in basically the same way we’ve been doing for a century.  “Cold is the Cinderella of the energy debate. If we don’t change the way we do it, the consequences are going to be dramatic.”"
"There is a lot to celebrate in international development. Despite what can sometimes feel like an overwhelming number of bad news stories, incredible progress has been made. Over the past quarter of a century, more than 1 billion people were lifted out of extreme poverty, 137 million additional children were enrolled in primary school, and in the last 15 years alone, some 59 million deaths from diseases like malaria and tuberculosis were averted.  The millennium development goals (MDGs) played a role in these achievements. Their successor, the sustainable development goals (SDGs), comprised of 17 goals and 169 targets, has the potential to accelerate progress across an even broader range of issues.  However, in order to reach the new goals by 2030, we need to act now. Without early action there is risk of leaving people behind and failing to achieve certain goals altogether. A closer look at trends across the range of issues – both globally and by region – reveals just how much more effort is needed.  Our research shows that without increased effort, none of the goals will be met for all people everywhere, although progress on some issues and for some people will inevitably move faster than others.  Globally, projections show that ending extreme poverty, sustaining economic growth in least-developed countries and halting deforestation will all get more than halfway toward selected targets by 2030 if current trends continue.  For Africa, strengthening domestic resource mobilisation is also set to do well. Asia will see additional likely progress in improving access to sanitation and expanding energy access. In Latin America, if present trends continue, reductions in inequality will count as some of the most impressive globally. A large number of other goals are heading in the right direction, yet they would need to speed up by several multiples of current rates in order to reach SDG targets. This includes the ‘unfinished business’ of the MDGs in areas such as hunger, health, education, sanitation and gender. Ambitious efforts are unquestionably needed here. Most worryingly, however, are a group of SDG targets that require outright reversals in their trajectories. Based on analysis we conducted, there are five targets needing complete turnaround: reducing inequality, limiting slum populations, reducing waste, combating climate change and protecting marine environments. Income inequality is set to worsen globally if current trends continue. Four out of five people live in countries where the bottom 40% has experienced slower growth than the average. Globally, since 2000, the bottom 40% has grown around half a percentage point slower than the average rate of growth annually. The number of people living in slums continues to rise, if the numbers follow their current course they are predicted to rise from 850 million today to over 1 billion people by 2030. The vast majority of this increase is due to take place in sub-Saharan Africa, where slum populations will almost double. Projections show that the total amount of solid waste generated globally will almost double from 3.5 million tonnes a day in 2010 to 6.1 million in 2025. Projected growth is mainly driven by emerging market economies in east and south Asia where waste generation is forecast to triple, and other developing countries where it is projected to double. This of course is on top of what is already quite a high level per capita in OECD countries. While this target does not refer to a quantifiable indicator, reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions is a useful proxy. Significant growth of greenhouse gases is projected to occur in emerging markets, on top of already high levels in OECD countries. These emissions need to be reduced in order for the world to be able to address climate change effectively. Projections show that 90% of reefs will be under threat by 2030, up from a starting point of 75% in 2007. While harmful coastal practices like overfishing are of current concern, part of the increased threat is due to anticipated thermal stress and acidification linked to carbon emissions. These turnaround targets, cutting across issues of inequality and environment, are central to the overall development agenda. They go beyond the traditional MDG focus on social sectors and remind us that SDG commitments demand a broader and more ambitious approach.  Moreover, developed countries are set to play a significant role in any success or failure to achieve gains in these areas. More attention is needed to these about-turns if there is any hope of attainment of the SDG agenda.  Susan Nicolai is head of Development Progress at the Overseas Development Institute.

"Rising sea levels could topple the proud status of some British mountains, reducing them to the status of mere hills. Those in greatest danger of demotion include a peak in the Yorkshire Dales that was only reclassified as a mountain a few weeks ago. The Ordnance Survey (OS) uses mean sea level as the starting point for measuring the absolute height of mountains, which must be a at least 609.6 metres (2,000ft) above sea level – but several peaks in England, Scotland and Wales are only a few centimetres taller than that.   Mean sea level, the halfway mark between high and low tides, is measured by a gauge at Newlyn in Cornwall. But the point used by the OS was established almost a century ago, and since then sea levels have risen and are continuing to rise at an accelerating rate, mainly through climate change. “We have to measure from a fixed point, and there are no immediate proposals for a change, but rising sea levels could obviously be a factor if there is a change in the future,” an OS spokesman said. “Clearly if the fixed point was taken from a higher level, the heights measured would drop by the same amount, and that certainly could affect many hills and mountains.” Calf Top in the Yorkshire Dales only achieved mountain status in September, after the OS determined its true height is a few centimetres taller than was concluded when it was last measured in 2010, putting it just over the required height for a mountain. Any change in the base point would knock it back down again. Myrddyn Phillips is an amateur surveyor who worked on Calf Top with Hill Data and Mountain Surveys, one of several amateur groups whose hours of unpaid work, out on the slopes in all weathers, has produced new data that has been accepted by the authorities.  Thack Moor in Cumbria also recently became a mountain through Phillips’s work with John Barnard and Graham Jackson, of G&J Surveys. Their measurements, repeated at the request of the OS, confirmed its true height was just 2cm over the 609.6-metre qualifier.  Phillips was enthusiastic about the possibility of change: “That would be fantastic, on the whole I like change. “It will be incredibly interesting if Ordnance Survey change their datum point as this will affect all known heights throughout Britain, and even if this change equates to only 40-45cm it will affect a multitude of hill and mountain classifications,” he said.  A change could affect the status of many sites cherished by walkers who like to tackle all the mountains in a group, including the Munros in Scotland, which are all over 914 metres (3,000ft), the slightly less challenging 762-metre (2,500ft) Corbetts, and the Hewitts, Nuttalls and Deweys in England and Wales. “In a general sense it does not matter whether a peak is classified as a hill, mountain, Munro or a Pedwar [a hill in Wales between 400-499 metres], but we do seem to have an inner need to categorise and this is as applicable to hills as any other form of commodity,” Phillips said.  “Certainly for the hill bagging community it is essential to get hill classifications correct, and it is also justifiable to say this in relation to the wider hill walking community as there are upwards of 6,000 people who have now completed the Munros and probably twice as many working their way through this list, and all of these people will want to know that they have completed each and every Munro that should be listed.” He acknowledged that many people would be upset if their cherished mountain view was downgraded but insisted it would be an exciting process. “As I am a person who is open to change this would also cause a lot of fun as there would be a Munro reclassified to Corbett status, a Corbett reclassified to Graham status, Simms would disappear, Hewitts and Nuttals would become Deweys, a Dewey would become a Pedwar and a number of Pedwarau would become 300m Twmpau hills.” "
"The issue of how climate change is affecting coffee production hit the headlines recently after the publication of a new report from the Climate Institute, which claims climate change will halve the area suitable for coffee production by 2050. While companies may once have diversified their suppliers in the face of supply risk, the systematic impact of climate change across coffee-growing regions requires a radical rethink of production models and sourcing relationships, according to Alejandro Litovsky, the founder and CEO of the Earth Security Group.  This inevitably affects the more than 120 million of the world’s poorest people who rely on the coffee supply chain for their livelihoods. With this in mind, we brought together four experts to debate how coffee, and those who produce it, can be supported. Here’s what you need to know: It is threatening the livelihoods of producers we work with. We see the impact, they are producing less. These are the words of Steven Macatonia, co-founder of Union Hand-Roasted Coffee, who said that changing weather patterns such as erratic rainfall, increased temperatures, and more pests and disease are having a negative effect on the volume and quality of coffee produced. Aaron Davis, senior research leader of plant resources at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said that while some of the more recently published work on coffee and climate change is probably too pessimistic, it is very clear that coffee farming worldwide is being negatively influenced by climate change. Climate change is happening already but its impacts will not be distributed equally. Emma Pinchbeck, head of climate and energy policy at WWF, said that as climate change worsens it is poor communities who bear the brunt of the impacts, especially if they’re dependent for their income on natural resources such as coffee. A quarter of Ethiopians make a living from growing coffee, for example. Pinchbeck also pointed out that the impact on coffee drinkers will be a useful reminder that climate change’s impacts won’t be restricted to developing countries. A useful first step is to understand your local and regional climate, in order to work out the level of risk  That’s the advice from Davis, who added this can be done by investing in simple climatic monitoring equipment, which can be used to assess the performance of each season’s crop in relation to climatic variables and the long-term climatic averages. This gives farmers a better understanding of where they are on the scale of risk, and what adaptation measures need to be implemented, said Davis.  The most obvious interventions are irrigation, shade management and mulching, but terracing also has clear benefits. Shifting to another coffee species (for example, from Arabica to Robusta), or using more drought resilient cultivars of existing species, may also be an option. Hugo Villela, regional agribusiness specialist at Oikocredit, pointed out that as well as the problem of smallholder coffee producers being exposed to increased price volatility as a result of climate change, there is also the issue of long-term investors withdrawing their investments if they deem coffee too risky. Fairtrade is one solution, said Villela, as the certification provides a minimum price which buffers some of the effects of price volatility caused by the impact of weather on crop supply. But only a small portion of coffee producers can access this benefit, he said, since not all coffee producers hold a Fairtrade certificate. The increased challenges faced by farmers requires them to improve their commercial skills in order to buffer the blows. For example, said Villela, they will need better stock control, improved price risk management incorporating more varied financing options, tighter controls over their business commitments, and to adopt more long-term, diversified approaches to their small-holdings. The technical ability to understand how climate change will influence each coffee growing area now exists, said Davis. Much of this work relies on modern technology, such as remote sensing – the use of satellite data – and advanced computer modelling. But not all farmers will be able to afford this technology, said Davis, and it is not a complete cure: It is clear that for many farmers even the most sophisticated adaptation interventions will not ensure resilience against climate change and climatic perturbations.

"Baby lobsters might not be able to survive in the ocean’s waters if the ocean continues to warm at the expected rate. That is the key finding of a study performed by scientists in Maine, the state most closely associated with lobster. The scientists, who are affiliated with the University of Maine Darling Marine Center and Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, said the discovery could mean bad news for the future of one of America’s most beloved seafood treats, as well as the industry lobsters support.  The scientists found that lobster larvae struggled to survive when they were reared in water five degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the temperatures that are currently typical of the western Gulf of Maine, a key lobster fishing area off of New England. Five degrees is how much the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change expects the Gulf of Maine’s temperature to warm by the year 2100. The paper appears this month in the scientific journal ICES Journal of Marine Science. It could serve as a wake-up call that the lobster fishery faces a looming climate crisis that is already visible in southern New England, said Jesica Waller, one of the study’s authors. “There has been a near total collapse in Rhode Island, the southern end of the fishery, and we know our waters are getting warmer,” Waller said. “We are hoping this research can be a jumping-off point for more research into how lobsters might do over the next century.” Right now, the country’s lobster catch is strong, prices are high and steady and the industry is opening up new markets in Asia, where a growing middle class is hungry for one of America’s seafood status symbols. US fishermen have topped 100m lbs of lobster for seven years in a row after having never previously reached that mark, and their catch topped a half billion dollars in value at the docks for the first time in 2014. But signs of the toll warming waters can take on the fishery are noticeable in its southern reaches, where scientists have said rising temperatures are contributing to the lobsters’ decline. The lobster catch south of Cape Cod fell to about 3.3m pounds in 2013, 16 years after it peaked at about 22mn in 1997. The study’s authors found higher temperatures caused baby lobsters to develop faster – something that could help them avoid predators in the wild – but few survived. They performed the work by raising more than 3,000 baby lobsters from the moment they hatched. The authors said the study was the first of its kind to focus on how American lobsters would be affected by warming waters and the increasing acidification of the ocean in tandem. The study found that acidification had almost no effect on young lobsters’ survival, Waller said. Michael Tlusty, an ocean scientist with the Anderson Cabot Center at the New England Aquarium, said the study was especially important because it considered both warming and changing ocean chemistry. “This is the type of work that really needs to be done,” said Tlusty, who was not affiliated with the study. “The oceans are not changing one parameter at a time.”"
"The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has thrown his weight behind the fledgling market in green investments to help cut carbon emissions and boost global economic growth. Carney used a speech in Berlin on Thursday to highlight green finance as an opportunity to boost financial stability while also tackling climate change.  He said more of the $100 tn (£76tn) held by big global investment firms could be channelled into green bonds to help finance initiatives such as water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions. Last year, $42bn of green bonds were sold worldwide.   Carney made no reference to the Bank’s stance on UK interest rates, which were cut to a record low last month to shore up the post-referendum economy. He did, however, discuss the global picture of low interest rates and how more investment in green technologies and projects to cut emissions could help raise them. “The Bank of England has long stressed that central bank policies are not the cause of low rates, but responses to them. We are actors in a play written by others,” Carney said. That was because the level at which interest rates must ultimately settle to ensure steady inflation – the “equilibrium” interest rate – was determined by fundamental factors driving savings and investment in the global economy, he said. Those factors included technology, demographics and inequality.  Reprising his recent comments and those of other central bankers, Carney stressed that monetary policy alone could not address the world’s economic problems. “Long-run prosperity was never in the gift of monetary policymakers. As the 10th anniversary of the start of the crisis approaches, a consensus is growing that escaping this low-growth low-inflation trap will require a rebalancing between monetary, fiscal and structural policies,” he said. Carney voiced his support for structural reforms that encourage more private investment. He welcomed the Paris agreement on cutting carbon emissions and limiting the rise in global average temperatures, and called for a comprehensive climate policy framework within which companies would have enough information and certainty to make green investments.  He conceded that to make green finance more mainstream would require “a sweeping reallocation of resources and a technological revolution”, but also saw potential benefits for global interest rates. “The International Energy Agency estimates that globally as much as €45tn [£39tn] of investment in total could be needed in power supply and end-use efficiency to meet the two-degree target agreed in Paris. “China alone is likely to require around €500bn a year from 2016 to 2020 to finance its national environmental goals. A substantial proportion of this is likely to be raised offshore, absorbing excess global savings, helping to push up global equilibrium interest rates and ultimately increasing global growth.” He called on the German government to take action when it assumes the presidency of the G20 group of countries next year. “The upcoming German presidency of the G20 now has a historic chance to mainstream climate finance and turn risk into opportunity,” he said. “The G20 – whose members account for around 85% of global emissions – has a unique responsibility. The German presidency could be decisive.” "
"Most of you are aware of a growing movement amongst persons of faith to bring more action on dealing with climate change. The argument is powerful for the faithful – the Earth is God’s gift to humanity. We should care for it accordingly. From within this movement, there are huge voices, widely respected by both the scientific and faith communities. Perhaps the best known is Dr. Katherine Hayhoe, a top climate scientist who is also an evangelist Christian. There are other persons and organizations who work similarly to connect these two world viewpoints in a powerful yet common-sense way.  Recently a book has been published by a faith-science duo. That duo is Paul Douglas, respected meteorologist, entrepreneur, Republican, and Christian, and his writing partner Mitch Hescox who leads the Evangelical Environmental Network (the largest evangelical group devoted to creation care). Their book, entitled Caring for Creation, provides a masterful balance of science, faith, and personal journey.  The style of the book is one I have not seen before. It is a side-by-side presentation of first science, then faith, then science, and back to faith. Interspersed within the main text are enlightening anecdotes mainly from weather forecasters across the country which show an informed lived experience of experts watching the climate change before their very eyes. Importantly the authors provide a list of concrete things that we all can do, starting right now to make a meaningful impact in reducing global warming. Within this book there is real science. Not just about what is happening now, but the history of climate science, how we’ve known since the 1800s that human emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide can warm the atmosphere. We also hear from Douglas about observed changes to the weather we all experience. This isn’t a problem for far-off times or far-away places. This is an issue that is being manifested now. Hescox articulates a message grounded in the proposition that the creation is a gift from God and there is a real responsibility to care for it. Not only for others distant in time and space that may suffer, but for our own good. In fact, he argues persuasively that caring for this creation can help strengthen one’s faith.  Hescox also argues from a pro-life position. Caring for creation is the ultimate pro-life stance. Squandering resources and gifts will not only cause real harm to people and our economy, but it will endanger the lives of many of the most vulnerable. Douglas provided a great summary: I am a scientist but I believe in absolutes – I believe in more than I can observe, measure and test. The book of Genesis tells us that God made us in his self image. He gave us big, beautiful brains and the ability to think, reason, solve problems, make smart decisions, and improve our lives. He also gave us the good sense not to foul our nest. Both of these intertwined stories of faith and science are woven together in a way that is easily accessible for non-scientists and people who are not of faith. We don’t need to be climate scientists or religious experts to get a lot out of the authors’ perspective.  There are a few quotes from the book that do a great job of encapsulating the central themes which I will share.  With respect to the science, Douglas reminds us that “no matter where you look – the oceans or atmosphere – the Earth is warming.” He later adds, this means we “embrace the reality of today and see the world, not as we think it should be, but as it really is – the world we’ve influenced by releasing a trillion tons of carbon in the geological blink of an eye.” Hescox states that, “It is almost incredulous that we meet God in creation but we haven’t made the connection that caring for creation nurtures our relationship with him.”  He later includes this excellent statement from Jonathan Koomey from Stanford. “What is conservative after all but one who conserves, one who is committed to protecting and holding close the things by which we live.”  And perhaps the best statement, which so clearly encapsulates this book and the movement, is provided in the text by Dr. Hayhoe. She states, “Christian values demand we take action. Climate change disproportionally affects the poor and vulnerable – the very people that Christians are called to care for and love.” I would only add this addendum. Climate change affects us all, wealthy or impoverished, Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern, young or old, peach or olive or brown skinned. Taking actions can be motivated just by pure selfishness, wanting to maintain a high standard of living, or by selflessness, or by faith. It doesn’t matter what the motivation is but with groups such as scientists and evangelists working together, the possibility is limitless."
"Sometimes, climate science deniers will tell you that we can’t predict global temperatures in the future. Sometimes, they’ll say we’re heading for an ice age. Occasionally, contrarians will say that no single weather event can prove human-caused global warming. But then they’ll point to somewhere that’s cold, claiming this disproves climate change.  Often, deniers will tell you that temperature records show that global warming stopped at some point around 1998. But also they’ll insist that those same temperature records can’t be relied on because Nasa and the Bureau of Meteorology are all communist corruption monkeys. Or something. Black is also white. Round is also flat. Wrong is also right?  A new research paper published in the journal Synthese has looked at several of these contradictory arguments that get thrown around the blogosphere, the Australian Senate and the opinion pages of the (mostly) conservative media. The paper comes with the fun and enticing title: “The Alice in Wonderland mechanics of the rejection of (climate) science: simulating coherence by conspiracism.” Why Alice? Because, as the White Queen admitted: “Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.” The three authors, including Dr John Cook, of the University of Queensland, look at both rhetorical and scientific arguments put by deniers.  One example is the popular theme that casts “sceptics” as “dissenting heroes” who bravely oppose “political persecution and fraud”. You know, like modern-day Galileos.  But the authors write that deniers will also try and convince the public that there is no consensus among scientists about the causes of climate change (there is and it’s us). They write: Either there is a pervasive scientific consensus in which case contrarians are indeed dissenters, or there is no consensus in which case contrarian opinions should have broad support within the scientific community and no fearless opposition to an establishment is necessary. The authors unleash similar jujitsu-style logic on other contradictory arguments and give examples of where the same individuals have apparently argued against themselves. One of the authors’ examples of incoherent logic comes from the Australian geologist and mining industry figure Prof Ian Plimer and his 2009 book, Heaven and Earth – a book favourably cited by the likes of the former prime minister Tony Abbott and Cardinal George Pell. On page 278, Plimer writes that “temperature and CO2 are not connected” but, on page 411, writes that “CO2 keeps our planet warm”. According to the authors, their examples of “incoherence” only hold together in the minds of the deniers if you apply types of glue known as “conspiracist ideation” and “identity-protective cognition”. So what’s that all about?  Conspiracist ideation, or conspiratorial thinking, is the tendency to entertain suggestions: for example that Nasa and the Bureau of Meteorology are conspiring to deliberately manipulate temperature data just to make global warming seem worse than it really is, rather than to correct for known issues. An example of “identity-protective cognition” in this case, the authors explain, is where people who advocate for small governments and “free markets” face a dilemma.  Accepting the scientific consensus would likely see increased levels of regulation, which challenges their identity as free-market advocates. So instead, the authors argue, the only options open are to either deny the consensus or try and discredit it. Because cutting GHG emissions requires interventions – such as regulation or increased taxation – that interfere with laissez-faire free-market economics, people whose identity and worldview centres around free markets are particularly challenged by the findings from climate science. Lead author Prof Stephan Lewandowsky, an expert in cognitive psychology at the University of Bristol, has written several research papers finding links between the rejection of science, “conspiracist ideation” and the belief in free market economic principles.  One argument that deniers may try with this Synthese paper is that climate scientists also contradict each other and have offered several explanations for the supposed global warming “pause” or “slowdown” (this was never really a thing).  Lewandowsky told me: Phenomena can have multiple explanations – so, for example, it is entirely conceivable that volcanic activity and heat exchange with the ocean though the La Niña phenomenon might have contributed to what has been called a “slowdown” in warming. Similarly, just because contemporary climate change is driven by CO2 does not mean that the sun could not have caused earlier episodes of climate change. The same phenomenon may have multiple causes – but the same cause cannot have contradictory consequences. For example, it would be ridiculous to say that the alleged ‘slowdown’ was driven by La Niña but that La Niña also causes warming. Equally, it cannot be the case that CO2 causes warming as well as cooling. But CO2 as well as La Niña may both contribute to global temperatures. Of course, Lewandowsky and his colleagues are by no means the first to see the many contradictory arguments from deniers. But does he think looking at them in such detail will make any difference?  I think that people who deny basic science will continue to do so, no matter how contradictory their arguments may be. However, these pervasive contradictions should caution the media against giving an airing to those opinions."
"Here’s one thing we don’t often want to admit: it is too late to stop many of the harshest and most destructive aspects of climate change from materialising. We’re out of time. Superstorms, droughts, floods, disappearing islands, coastlines and lost species are already here.  We need to face the fact that the climate crisis is upon us, and that the greenhouse gases we’ve already emitted have locked in even worse that’s yet to come. The mass deaths in Haiti and the evacuation of 1.5 million people from the Florida coast in the wake of Hurricane Matthew is just the kind of weather-related event that we can expect to happen more frequently in a warmer world. So what do we need to do? Run and cower in the corner? Accept futile half-measures? No, courage is what the movement fighting climate change and fossil fuels needs most now. Lack of courage by western governments is having devastating consequences, and in the case of America, one of them is fracking. This is the unacceptable “solution” to the climate crisis that the US has been pushing all across the world. The decision by the British government last week to overturn Lancashire’s rejection of fracking shows that the UK, too, seems to be falling for it. Our movement and our scientists, by contrast, do have the courage to identify what needs to be done. Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, estimates that we have 17 years to replace all fossil fuel infrastructure with renewable energy. That means no new fossil fuel projects. Period. We burn down what we have, and we build renewable energy sources as fast as we can. That means no new pipelines, no new fracking fields, no new offshore drilling, no new tar sands or coal mines. That would mean no new fracking in the US or the UK. You cannot be a climate leader and support fracking: it is a new form of climate denialism. One only has to look at the brave stand people all across the world are taking to fight fossil fuel developments to see the kind of courage our governments lack but that the future will demand. Britain has seen protests in Balcombe in West Sussex, and in Blackpool, while in the US we have had brave pipeline fighters in Nebraska and Standing Rock reservation, North Dakota. The neoliberal promise that we can both prevent catastrophic warming and allow energy companies to get rich extracting and burning more fossil fuels, including shale gas, is a fallacy. We can’t. Yet the US State Department’s shale gas initiative is seeking to expand fracking to other countries, even when their citizens don’t want it. The UK’s Institute of Gas Engineers and Managers, IGEM, cites it as a model for the world, and now Britain is seeking to import its own US-style fracking boom. The Lancashire decision will have to be fought off with passion, enthusiasm and courage. This means putting ourselves and, yes, sometimes our bodies on the line to stop this march of fossil fuel madness. Last week, even as superstorm Matthew bore down on America’s east coast, Barack Obama said at the premiere of Leonardo DiCaprio’s new climate change film that keeping fossil fuels in the ground isn’t practical, and that we have to accept fracking as a way to cut emissions because “we have to live in the real world”. The real world, I assume, is the one that science is describing – that says we cannot develop more fossil fuels. The world Obama is referring to is something else – a bubble – in which fossil fuel lobbyists obscure the will of the people under their superstorm of campaign cash and political influence. We can’t afford to dig up the fossil fuel deposits we’ve already developed, let alone develop new ones, especially shale gas. Some peer-reviewed research finds that shale gas is worse for the climate than coal or oil, because fracking and transporting it emits massive quantities of methane, which is over 80 times more powerful a warming agent than carbon dioxide over 20 years. Those are the same 20 years in which we must replace our fossil fuel infrastructure with renewables to have a fighting chance against catastrophic warming. I recently filmed activists in China risking their freedom to speak out against coal; indigenous people deep in the Amazon confronting the ravages of oil companies; Pacific Climate Warriors blockading coal tankers with canoes, chanting: “We are not drowning – we are fighting!” We all need their courage and inventiveness now. The climate movement can prevail against the odds if it has enough bravery, community resilience, creativity, awareness of rights, and love. Luckily these are the things climate can’t change."
"The car rental giant Enterprise says it has resigned its membership in the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), an anti-regulation lobby group that has pushed against climate change legislation, effective immediately. The announcement follows last month’s revelation by the Guardian of the publicly environmentally friendly company’s contributions to the group. Enterprise is the largest car rental company in the world and owns Enterprise Rent-A-Car, National and Alamo. It has sought recognition for its tree-planting programs, aimed at offsetting carbon emissions, and its increasingly large fleet of clean vehicles.   But association with Alec was too much for many consumers, who told the company on social media and in petitions that they would take their business elsewhere. A petition demanding the company withdraw its support from the lobbyist group had reached 89,000 signatures at the time of writing. A spokeswoman, Laura Bryant, said the company valued communication with its customers and that “[t]o that end, we have been carefully listening to those customers and partners who have expressed sincere concern about our ALEC membership. “In fact, after thoughtful consideration, we have decided to resign our membership,” she told the Guardian. The company’s membership in Alec, which has poured considerable resources into denying and minimizing scientific efforts to quantify climate change, was brought to the Guardian’s attention by the watchdog group the Center for Media and Democracy. Enterprise becomes the latest major corporation to quit the organisation. Ford left Alec after considerable consumer pressure in February; Royal Dutch Shell left the rightwing group in July 2015. Others, including BP and eBay, have done the same. The political group’s positions have met with harsh criticism – beyond distributing model legislation designed to benefit its members financially by allowing them to skirt regulations, the group also opposes minimum wage laws. Bryant said the company would “continue to integrate sustainable practices across our operations and seek new ways to minimize the environmental impact of our business”. “This is yet another example of a cooperation with brand sensitivity not wanting to be publicly associated with Alec,” said Nick Surgey, director of research at the Center for Media and Democracy. “Enterprise should have known better than be associated with such a toxic organization, but they should now be applauded for having done the right thing.” The Guardian has contacted Alec for comment."
"Major storms such as Hurricane Matthew, which has slammed into Haiti and is now headed towards the US, will grow in menace as the world warms and sea levels rise, scientists have warned.  Hurricane Matthew is already feared to have caused seven deaths after it hit Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Tuesday, bringing 145mph winds, pounding rain and storm surges to coastal communities. The category 4 storm, the strongest hurricane to hit Haiti in 50 years, is expected to surge northwards towards Florida’s east coast and up the south-eastern US coast by the weekend. It follows September’s Hurricane Hermine, which was the first hurricane to hit Florida in nearly 11 years.  While the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s prediction of a “near-normal” Atlantic hurricane season is still on track, scientists have pointed to Hurricane Matthew as the sort of fierce lashing that will become more common due to climate change. There was previously far more certainty among climate scientists over the increase of temperatures than trends in hurricanes, but government officials are now confident enough to say there has been a “substantial increase” in Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1980s, with the destruction set to ratchet up further as the world warms. “We expect to see more high-intensity events, category 4 and 5 events, that are around 13% of total hurricanes but do a disproportionate amount of damage,” said Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “The theory is robust and there are hints that we are already beginning to see it in nature.” Hurricanes draw their energy from the ocean, which is currently acting like a sponge for the extra heat accumulating in the atmosphere due to human activity. Warming is thereby supercharging hurricane wind speed, with increased moisture delivering buckets of extra rain to affected areas. Parts of Haiti are expected to get 3ft of rainfall from Hurricane Matthew. Some studies have found that while the number of hurricanes may dip slightly in the future, the most destructive events will actually increase. “There will be subtleties with hurricane frequency – it’s likely the most intense ones will increase, while it’s unclear what the weak or moderate ones will do,” said James Done, a project scientist and Willis fellow at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research. “The message is that hurricanes that do occur in the future, the major ones, will be stronger. Category four and five hurricanes could double or triple in the coming decades.” But while the wind speed may be climbing, it won’t, on its own, prove the greatest killer. The seas are rising at their fastest rate in 2,800 years, with water disproportionately piling up on the east coast of the US. Storm surges and flooding caused by hurricanes will be fueled by this heightened sea level, posing a growing threat to life and limb. “Storm surges and flooding are big killers, so this is a big worry,” Emanuel said. “If Hurricane Sandy occurred 100 years earlier it may not have flooded lower Manhattan because the sea was about 1ft lower in 1912.  “We expect another 3ft in sea level rise by the end of the century, so we should expect steadily increase damage. People moving to the coast really need to be aware of climate change.”"
"A new book by Michael Mann and Tom Toles takes a fresh look on the effects humans are having on our climate and the additional impacts on our politics. While there have been countless books about climate change over the past two decades, this one – entitled The Madhouse Effect - distinguishes itself by its clear and straightforward science mixed with clever and sometimes comedic presentation.  In approximately 150 pages, this books deals with the basic science and the denial industry, which has lost the battle in the scientific arena and is working feverishly to confuse the public. The authors also cover potential solutions to halt or slow our changing climate. Perhaps most importantly, this book gives individual guidance – what can we do, as individuals, to help the Earth heal from the real and present harm of climate change?  To start the book, the authors discuss how the scientific method works, the importance of the precautionary principle, and how delaying actions have caused us to lose precious time in this global race to halt climate change. And all of this done in only 13 pages! Next, the book dives briefly into the basic science of the greenhouse effect. Readers of this column know that the science of global warming is very well established with decades of research. But some people don’t realize that this research originated in the early 1800s with scientists such as Joseph Fourier. The book takes us on a short tour of history. Moving beyond these early works that focused exclusively on global temperatures, the authors come to expected impacts. They explain that a warming world, for instance, can be both drier and wetter!  This seeming paradox is a result of our expectation that areas which are currently wet will become wetter with an increase in the most-heavy downpours. A great example is the flooding this year in the Southeast United States. The reason for this is simple: a warmer atmosphere has more water vapor. In other areas – especially those already dry - it will become drier because evaporation will speed up. If there is no available moisture to enter into the atmosphere (i.e. an arid region), then the result is more drying. Using their candid, humorous, and clear language, the authors also discuss impacts on storms, hurricanes, rising oceans, and so on. With the basic science covered, the authors quickly move into reasons why readers should care. Many of the big risks climate change presents are covered. Included here are security, water availability, food production, land use and availability, human health, and risks to the world economies and ecosystems. Simply put, these are not future and abstract risks. They are current risks that are becoming more severe and will affect all of us. The chapter that was most interesting to me was the stages of climate denial. The first stage is “it’s not happening,” where outright denial of the reality of climate change was discussed. The authors use an example of this stage which came from the climate contrarians Roy Spencer and John Christy, who claimed that the Earth wasn’t warming.  Technically, Christy and Spencer claimed that a part of the Earth’s atmosphere was cooling – in contrast to mountains of contrary evidence from around the globe. It was discovered that these contrarians had made some elementary errors in their calculations. When those calculations were corrected, their results fell into line with other research. I’ve written many times about the many errors from contrarian scientists – certainly not limited to Christy and Spencer. Within the scientific community, the contrarians have made so many technical errors that their work is no longer taken seriously by many scientists. But this hasn’t stopped the denial industry from showcasing their work, even though it is discredited.  The next stages of denial involve admissions that climate change is happening but that it is natural, it will self-correct, or it will climate change will benefit us. The tale of mistakes made in the science underlying these arguments is told in the book, and would be humorous if not so serious. The tales involve cherry-picked data, resigning editors, and other mistakes. For readers who may be concerned about getting lost in the weeds, don’t worry. The authors do an excellent job hitting high points in an intelligible manner so that readers don’t need a PhD in climate science to see the patterns. Next, the book covers the denial industry including some of the key groups and persons who were responsible for a systematic rejection of the prevailing scientific view, or at least insidious questioning so that in the public’s mind there would be no consensus. This effort which not only denied the causes and effects of climate change, but also the health risks of tobacco was coupled with funding to scientists, “petitions” designed to appear as if they originated from the National Academy of Sciences, and an interconnected network of funded think tanks. One result of all of this is that actual scientists who spend their lives studying the Earth’s climate have been attacked. One of the authors of this book (Michael Mann) is perhaps in the world’s best position to tell this tale because he personally knows many of the scientists who have been attacked professionally and personally, including the late Stephen Schneider, Ben Santer, Naomi Oreskes, and himself.  I have had the fortune of knowing these scientists and I can attest that they (and others) go into this field because they have an intense curiosity. Scientists want to know how things work and why. A side benefit is our understanding can give us guidance about the future. I don’t know of a single scientist who went into this field either for money or ideology. It’s shocking to be attacked for wanting to know, or for doing our jobs and telling the public about the scientific implications of our actions. The book finishes by moving to the main political persons and groups that now populate the contrarian landscape. These groups and persons either continue the attacks on scientists, fund the denialist groups, or try to claim that taking action on climate change will do no good. The book finishes with the fallacy of geoengineering – which is seriously being considered and contrasts geoengineering with practical things individuals can do to make a difference.  What’s great about the ending is that often times, when the science becomes clear, people raise up their hands in submission, “what can I do about this problem?”. Well there are things we can do, either as individuals or as a community. Together, we can make a difference, bend the curve of emissions and create a better future for all of us."
"Australia’s education department paid Bjørn Lomborg’s Copenhagen Consensus Centre $640,000 to help produce a report that claimed limiting world temperature increases to 2C was a “poor” use of money. The $640,000 cost, incurred before the CCC’s controversial $4m Australian program was junked, is revealed in the 2016 incoming ministerial brief published under freedom of information laws.  An education department spokeswoman told Guardian Australia the $640,000 represented the Australian government contribution to the CCC for the Smarter UN Post-2015 Development Goals project. The project concluded that for every dollar spent on keeping global temperatures to the 2C target, less than $1 of social, economic or environmental benefit resulted, which it described as a “poor” result. Other spending with “poor” returns included cutting outdoor air pollution, increasing protected biodiversity areas, better disaster resilience for the poor and reducing child marriages. Projects with “phenomenal” returns included reducing world trade restrictions through the Doha trade round, which it said would produce $2,011 for every dollar spent, and universal access to contraception which would return $120 on the dollar. Some environmental projects rated as good investments, with “more energy research” rating an $11 return, and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies likely to yield $15 or more. The education department spokeswoman said the CCC had provided a comprehensive report on 169 funding possibilities across 22 core issues, which was published as the Nobel Laureates’ Guide to the Smartest Targets for the World, 2016-2030. The project explained its conclusions were “based on peer-reviewed analyses from 82 of the world’s top economists and 44 sector experts”. Its brochure notes financial support was provided by the Australian government. A spokesman for the CCC said the $640,000 was for costs incurred and that the intended work of the Australian Consensus Centre, which included the development goal project, was a matter of public record. In April 2015 Guardian Australia revealed the then Abbott government’s plan to spend $4m over four years to bring the Copenhagen Consensus Centre methodology to Australia at a new centre in the University of Western Australia’s business school. UWA rejected the funds after a public backlash leading to a search for a new home for the Australian Consensus Centre.  The project was axed later in 2015 when Malcolm Turnbull became prime minister, which the brief explains was caused by the government’s conclusion it was “unlikely to enjoy success and that the funds could be better utilised elsewhere”. The brief notes the centre’s Australian program was to cost $4m to provide “policy information and advice on smart, cost-effective solutions to national and international challenges” before it was dropped in mid 2015. “The department has negotiated a funding agreement which will provide a one-off payment to the CCC for a total of $640,000 to cover costs incurred in relation to the establishment of the Australian Consensus Centre prior to the decision to cancel this project,” it said. The shadow innovation, industry, science and research minister, Kim Carr, questioned why the government had “felt the need to keep [the $640,000] secret”. “The department of education needs to explain why in one document the secretary is told that this money was establishment costs around the centre, but now states that the $640,000 was for a specific research project,” he said. “When government research money is in such sort supply for Australia’s best and brightest scientists and researchers, the Liberals must explain their actions here.” Carr accused the Abbott and Turnbull governments of “using taxpayers’ money in an attempt to promote an anti-science conservative agenda”. An education department spokeswoman refuted the suggestion it had sought to hide the payment, and cited the fact the $640,000 grant was also disclosed in a log of education grants created on 2 July 2015 and made public on 22 April 2016."

"On the sunbaked salt flats of Gujarat, India, the vast, shimmering expanse of salt shines starkly in farmers’ eyes as they toil in the intense heat. India is the world’s third largest salt producer. More than 80,000 smallholder producer families harvest the salt in the Surendranagar district, its most prolific salt-producing region, in the dry months from October to May. The farmers, many of them women and teenage girls, pump dense, briny water up to the desert plains through handbuilt wells and rake it constantly to form salt crystals as the water evaporates in the blistering sun. This year, the temperature in Gujarat reached a record-breaking 48.4C, making working conditions even harsher on this ancient, desiccated seabed.  Scientists predict that climate change is also likely to increase rainfall in the region: “If the rain falls in intense, irregular downpours, with extended dry periods in between, this could introduce a level of unpredictability to the traditional salt farming season, potentially disrupting production,” says Dr Friederike Otto, senior researcher at Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute. Unseasonably heavy rains are already denting production, according to Reema Nanavaty, director of the Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), a trade union for smallholder female producers in India, with farmers losing up to a quarter, or 200 tonnes, of total production each season. Irregular monsoons can also cause delays to the season, and increased incidences of windy storms muddies the salt pans, compromising product quality and price. By the time the farmers have paid for diesel to fuel their pumps, and services such as transport and fresh water to supply their makeshift villages on the edge of the salt flats, it can cost them up to $1.55 to produce each tonne of salt.  This means there’s often little left of the money they receive from middlemen per tonne of salt - approximately $1.78. Middlemen sell on the salt for a market price of around $4.15 per tonne, despite little additional processing beyond some refining. But life for salt farmers is gradually changing. The Salt Workers Economic Empowerment Program (SWEEP), a joint initiative between the non-profit Global Fairness Initiative (GFI) and SEWA, is working to help female salt farmers in Gujarat gain the commercial and technical knowledge to farm salt more sustainably and profitably as the risk of erratic, extreme weather looms. Founded in 2012, the programme currently supports 2,500 farmers. It provides technical training to improve farming techniques and salt quality, covering aspects such as drilling boreholes, improving salt pan layout and managing pumps more efficiently. SWEEP also helps farmers collaborate to engage directly with more reliable buyers, such as the Indian government, to secure a better price for their salt. In this way, the women can achieve an average 64% increase in price (to $2.78 per tonne), according to Caleb Shreve, GFI’s executive director. However, to truly improve the farmers’ livelihoods, Shreve says, it is vital to cut input costs. With this in mind, SWEEP has been helping farmers replace their diesel pumps with solar-powered ones over the past two years to lower the cost of production. Although solar pumps have a high upfront cost of $3,750, the women save an average of 45% on running costs annually compared to diesel pumps by reducing maintenance and fuel costs, according to Shreve. Some 500 farmers have invested in the new pumps to date, taking a 90% loan from SEWA. The association provides the loans with interest rates of 14% and it is expected most farmers will repay the loan over four years, largely through diesel savings. India’s microfinance interest loan rates, in comparison, can exceed 26%. With their improved income, Surendranagar’s salt farmers often invest in more salt pans, as well as further equipment and transport to run their farms independently, without needing to rely as much on third parties. Many also invest in education for their children, as well as better housing, food and clothing.  “The beauty of this scheme is that it helps one of India’s poorest traditional communities have a better quality of life in the face of climate change, while simultaneously cutting carbon emissions,” says sustainability expert Martin Wright. Rosey Hurst, director of ethical trade consultancy Impactt, agrees that SWEEP is highly innovative, but cautions against writing off middlemen. “Solutions that combine technology and market access are terrific, but our experience shows that middlemen in India can add a degree of flexibility to informal supply chains. Despite their sometimes exploitative nature, they can access new markets and insulate producers from market instability. It’s important not to close off this avenue, particularly given that helping smallholders build their capabilities to access new markets is challenging.”"
"Toxic emissions from the power plant that made AGL Australia’s largest carbon polluter surged in the year the gas company acquired it, commonwealth figures reveal. Bayswater power station in New South Wales recorded double-digit rises in sulphur dioxide, hydrochloric acid, fine particle pollution and mercury output in 2014-15, according to the National Pollutant Inventory. The spike in toxic pollution raises questions about the public health risks posed by the ageing coal-fired plant, which was slated for a 50-year lifetime when acquired by AGL in September 2014.  The board of AGL will face its shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting on Wednesday.  While Bayswater generated 10% more power in 2014-15 than the previous 12 months, the intensity of toxic emissions per megawatt produced also rose. Intensity of emissions of sulphur dioxide were up 17%, hydrochloric acid up 78%, fine particulates 68% and mercury 4%. Overall emissions of sulphur dioxide rose by 28% to 76m kg, hydrochloric acid by 96% to 1.8m kg, fine particulates by 85% to 240,000 kg and mercury by 14% to 240 kg (a rise of 458% in three years). Josh Creaser, from climate advocacy group 350.org, said the figures were concerning and a “real question for the AGL board to answer about why on Earth the community that lives near that power station, the workers that work there, are seeing this already very toxic power station having such a massive increase in a range of toxins that are a risk to human health and the local environment”. Creaser said there were question marks over the age and efficiency of the plant, as well as the speed of AGL’s broader transition away from coal amid its public announcements of a climate-friendly shift in the business. Andrew Vesey, the chief executive of AGL, told Guardian Australia in February the company needed to be out of the “CO2 emissions business” to manage the financial risk of climate change. Vesey pledged last year the company would stop burning coal by 2050, then announcing in February it was pulling out of coal seam gas. AGL also owns Loy Yang power station in Victoria, which is the largest source of carbon pollution in Australia. Creaser said: “AGL’s own staff are on record saying the ideal lifespan for a power station is something like 20 to 30 years but they’re planning to run Bayswater until it’s 50 years old and Loy Yang until it’s 60 years old.” “Seeing the spike in pollution from Bayswater really points to the major risks that exist to the community and to people’s health and obviously the climate as well, as these power stations are run longer and longer. “AGL paints itself as this clean and green company but it really doesn’t add up when you start to look beneath that veneer at the facts and figures around where their energy is coming from and the impact it’s having.” A new poll of 1,007 power consumers by Essential Research, commissioned by another advocacy group Market Forces, found 21% were AGL customers. Of these, almost half (46%) said they were more likely to switch suppliers knowing AGL was the nation’s biggest carbon polluter.  Of non-AGL customers, 42% said they were less likely to switch to AGL knowing this. Creaser said AGL should be “employing absolute best practice right now to clean up the spike in toxic pollutants” at Bayswater. Beyond that, it needed an exit plan to shut down Bayswater, the nearby Liddell power station and Loy Yang and rehabilitate the sites without “leaving workers and those communities in the lurch”. A protest rally outside the AGL annual meeting in Sydney, organised by 350.org and Stop CSG Sydney, will call on the company to stop burning coal within a decade, instead of by 2050.  “AGL needs to get out of fossil fuels in 10 years because that’s what the climate science demands but they need to do that in a way that brings communities and workers into the picture,” Creaser said."
"The Queensland government is poised to declare Adani’s proposed Carmichael coal project “critical infrastructure”, a rare step that will elevate its status to an operation that is “essential to [the] state’s economic and community wellbeing”.  The Palazsczuk government appears to be bolstering its visible signs of support for the controversial and stalling coal export project. The state mines minister, Anthony Lynham, is reportedly due to accord it the highest priority development status on Monday.  Last invoked by the government to speed up the delivery of a new public water grid in a drought in 2008, the powers will give newfound importance to decisions around the project by the government’s top bureaucrat, the coordinator general, whose rulings cannot be challenged in court. It gives the mine, rail and port initiative the same weight in development terms as hospitals, power stations and telecommunications hubs that are deemed worthy of special protection in the event of terrorists attacks. Lynham told the Sunday Mail: “This is a critical project. The government is serious about seeing it happen. We have to get jobs happening for central and northern Queensland.” “We can see the end of the tunnel and now we are accelerating towards it.’’ He said in a statement on Sunday that the only key approvals at the state level yet to be secured by Adani were water licences, on which the company was “actively working” with the Department of Natural Resources and Mines. Adani has indicated it wants to begin construction on the $16bn mine, rail and port project next year, after staring down a string of legal challenges in court by conservation groups and traditional owners. It comes after the federal resources minister, Matt Canavan, flagged his keenness to revive a push to change federal environment protection laws to restrict legal challenges by conservation groups, some of which remain ongoing. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, last week said no one should doubt her government’s resolve to see the Galilee basin developed for coal exports. Palazczuk said the government was investing in the land court to speed up the outcome of legal challenges to mining proposals by conservationists. The One Nation senator for Queensland and former coalminer, Malcolm Roberts, said it was “time to stop cheap words and for the premier introduce legislation to start the mine”. “Jobs have been lost because of Labor inaction on the Adani mine, so Labor’s reaction is to hire more lawyers and let the Greens continue to hold these mines up in green tape,” Roberts said. The “critical infrastructure” declaration empowers the coordinator general to set deadlines on decisions by state agencies, government-owned corporations and councils around the project or else take over those decisions – and make rulings impervious to legal challenge. It is understood the declaration, which also enables existing public utility corridors to be set aside for “critical infrastructure easements”, applies to the rail and port sections of the project. It remains to be seen whether such a move will in fact give way to Adani fast-tracking its development, with some coal industry analysts still sceptical of the Indian parent company’s ability to gain full financial backing given its high debt and a soft coal export market. Climate change advocacy groups have argued Carmichael and other proposed mines in central Queensland’s Galilee basin are compelling examples of undeveloped fossil fuel reserves that must stay in the ground if the world is to limit global warming to below 2C. A PricewaterhouseCoopers report has claimed four years of “legal delays” of the Adani project had cost the Queensland economy $3.9bn and 2,665 jobs, with another year of delays to cost $1.2bn extra. But its projections were based on an original promise of 10,000 jobs, a figure which was discredited in land court evidence from Adani’s own economics expert, who ventured a total of 1,464 net jobs from the mine. The Queensland Resources Council’s outgoing chief executive, Michael Roche, told the Sunday Mail, the declaration of critical status was “another positive sign” the government wanted to see the Adani project to materialise. But Roche complained that new mine water licensing laws separately proposed by the government to apply to Carmichael could “give the activists a whole new avenue to appeal through the courts”. Critical infrastructure – ranging across energy, water, transport, communications and health sectors – broadly refers to “the infrastructure that provides goods and services essential to our state’s economic and community wellbeing”, according to the state government website."
"The harsh drought currently gripping California may appear trivial in the future as new research shows that the south-west US faces the looming threat of “megadroughts” that last for decades. California is in its sixth year of drought, which was barely dented by rains brought by the El Niño climate event and sparked a range of water restrictions in the state. But warming temperatures and uncertain rainfall mean that if more isn’t done to slow climate change, droughts lasting 35 years are likely to blight western states by the end of the century, according to the study, published in Science Advances.  Such a megadrought would impose “unprecedented stress on the limited water resources” of the parched US south-west, researchers found, bringing conditions similar to the 1930s dustbowl to California, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah – but over a lengthier period. Using a combination of temperature and precipitation models, the study predicts a 70% chance of a megadrought by the end of the century, should rainfall levels remain the same, with a 90% chance of an elongated drought should rainfall decrease, as most climate models forecast. “We can’t rule out there could be a 99.9% chance of a megadrought, which makes it virtually certain,” said Toby Ault, a scientist at Cornell University and lead author of the study.  “Imagine if the current drought in California lasted for another 30 years. There may be a few decent years of rain here and there, but that would be a megadrought and it would certainly change people’s attitude to water. Taking a long-term view, we need to change our expectations of water in the west.” Megadroughts of 35 years are currently rare and have led to severe upheaval in the past. There’s evidence that the Pueblo people of what is now the south-west US were forced to abandon settlements in the 13th century due to a lengthy drought. The Sahel drought in Africa that ran into the 1980s also fits the definition of a megadrought. The new report does proffer a crumb of hope – if greenhouse gas emissions are radically cut then the risk of megadrought will reduce by half, giving a roughly 50:50 chance that a multi-decade stretch of below-average rainfall would occur this century.  But the research found that the emissions cuts would have to be far steeper than those agreed to by nations in Paris last year, where a 2C limit on warming was pledged. “We would need a much more aggressive approach than proposed at Paris, it’s not too late to do this but the train is leaving the station as we speak,” Ault said. California is looking to tighten up regulations around groundwater use, which comes under strain during times of drought and has largely been left to the discretion of landowners until now. But further water conservation measures may be needed in a drought-affected future, as well as an awareness of the growing threat wildfires, driven by tinderbox vegetation, pose to life and property. The current California drought has already started to change the landscape of areas such as the Sierra Nevada, where an estimated 66m trees are estimated to have died since 2010. Mark Schwartz, professor of environmental science at the University of California, said Ault’s study, which he wasn’t involved in, was “very helpful” in highlighting some of the changes caused by long droughts. “We think that trees are fairly resilient, but if driven by fire and drought we might get a much faster realignment to a less forested area of the south-west US,” he said.  “Areas of the Sierras have burned a few times and the forests aren’t recruiting back, they are turning into grasslands and bush lands. Should that persist for a decade or more, we would see a lot more tree mortality. “Water availability is a deep issue for people living in the arid south-west. Megadroughts have the ability to dry up Lake Mead (which supplies water to Las Vegas) and hamper crops in southern California. We are doing a relatively poor job of allocating water efficiently. We need to get better at that.”"
"The Australian Energy Market Operator has pointed to South Australia’s extreme weather last week as the prime cause of “multiple transmission system faults” resulting in a statewide blackout. In a preliminary report the regulator cites severe weather as the factor triggering the transmission system failures “including, in the space of 12 seconds, the loss of three major 275kV transmission lines north of Adelaide.”  In addition to the transmission lines, Aemo notes in the late afternoon, after “multiple faults in a short period”, 315mW of wind generation disconnected, which affected the region north of Adelaide. It says that uncontrolled diminution in power generation “increased the flow on the main Victorian interconnector [Heywood] to make up the deficit, and resulted in the interconnector overloading”. The overload of the Heywood interconnector tripped the system, which caused the blackout.  The report also notes that in the lead-up to the statewide blackout, generation reduction occurred at six windfarms, while there was no reduction in thermal generation. Aemo says each reduction coincided with a drop in voltage observed at the windfarms’ connection points, but it says it is too soon to say why: “Additional analysis is required to determine the reasons for the reduction in generation and observed voltage levels before any conclusions can be drawn.” Energy economist Bruce Mountain told Guardian Australia the report, while preliminary, made it abundantly clear that the South Australian event was “a transmission failure, not a generation failure.” He said it was clear the primary event creating the sequence leading to the blackout was the failure of three major transmission lines. By the time the third transmission line went out, it was “game over”, he said. Mountain noted the report had identified localised issues with windfarms, possibly linked to lightning strikes during the storm, “but kind of ‘so what?’ This happens all the time in an electricity system.” He said there was nothing in the report to suggest wind was a more unreliable technology than any other technology in an electricity system: “The production or not from these windfarms would have made no difference to the ability to sustain supply in South Australia after those three 275kV lines had been dropped.” The Australian Energy Council’s chief executive, Matthew Warren, assessed the material differently. He said the report indicated governments and regulators “need to think differently about how we run a decarbonising electricity system, reflecting the significant differences between using conventional thermal generation compared to a mix with higher levels of intermittent renewables.” The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, last week linked the SA blackout explicitly to the state’s use of renewable energy, calling it a “wake-up call” for state leaders who were trying to hit “completely unrealistic” renewable targets. A special meeting of energy ministers has been convened in Canberra to discuss last week’s events. Speaking to reporters in Sydney on Wednesday, Turnbull said the cause of the blackout was “storms disrupting transmission lines”. He repeated the sequence identified by the Aemo report: transmission lines were knocked over, this disrupted the supply of power across the state, “including from renewable sources, including from the various windfarms, beyond Adelaide”. “And that then in turn put extra strain on the interconnector with Victoria, which caused it to shut down. So it was a cascading blackout – it happened very quickly – but this issue of energy security is one that we have to take very, very seriously,” Turnbull said. He continued to point the finger at South Australia. He said the state had the highest wholesale energy costs in the country, and that wasn’t good for jobs, or investment. He said the SA premier, Jay Weatherill, “has to answer for that”. The prime minister listed a hierarchy of priorities with energy. Turnbull said rule number one was “keep the lights on”. Rule number two was “we have to ensure energy is affordable”. The third priority he identified was emissions reduction “in accordance with our international obligations”. In Adelaide, Weatherill said the Aemo report pointed the finger squarely at extreme weather as the cause of the statewide blackouts, not the impact of renewables. “Malcolm Turnbull, our PM, took the first opportunity to lecture South Australians about the dangers of renewable energy, and for the Labor states in promoting unrealistic renewable energy targets,” the premier told reporters on Wednesday. Weatherill said Turnbull’s comments were “in contradiction of the oral advice that we were receiving from the Aemo”. “The PM was fearful that he would be blamed by the right wing of his party for pushing into renewable energy when he knows that he leads a party which is dominated by coal interests,” the premier said. “It’s deeply disappointing that we do not have the national leadership which is necessary to deal with this and other issues.” South Australia has also signalled that it will raise the idea of applying an emissions intensity trading system to the electricity market at Friday’s meeting – but the environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has already dead-batted that push. The ACT – which has a bipartisan renewable energy target of 100% renewables by 2020 – has urged the federal government to get its story straight on renewable energy. Deputy chief minister, Simon Corbell, says the former environment minister Greg Hunt, on the sidelines of global climate talks in Paris last December, had clearly urged the states to adopt reverse auctions, following the model developed successfully in the ACT to drive the uptake of renewable energy. Now, less than a year later, the government was blasting state renewable energy targets as being reckless and insufficiently attentive to energy security. “The inconsistency here is very clear,” Corbell told Guardian Australia on Tuesday."
"UN back-slapping for the record speed at which the Paris agreement on climate change has been ratified this week has been tempered by the reality that the new treaty will not stop catastrophic warming as it stands, and that the money so far pledged by rich countries is nowhere near enough to allow developing countries to adapt to expected sea level rises and more extreme weather. The agreement, which will come into force on 4 November, is hoped to hold temperatures to a maximum 2C rise, and for the first time commits both rich and poor countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.   But, say scientists, the historic measures pledged in Paris last year by the big greenhouse gas emitters like Europe, the US and China set the world on track to a temperature rise of about 3C over the next 50 years – enough to render many of the world’s poorest countries uninhabitable. The world’s 48 least developed countries (LDCs), which unanimously pressed for a global commitment to a 1.5C warmer world in Paris, said this week that they welcomed the ratification of the agreement, but warned that the rich must act urgently. “Now we need to now turn our words into action. Without action, the Paris agreement will just be a piece of paper,” said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands. “We need to see finance quickly flow to those who need it most so we can all implement our own ambitious plans to reduce emissions. Without [that] there is no way we will be able to stay within 1.5 degrees.” Abdallah Wafy, Niger’s ambassador to the UN, added: “Despite Africa’s insignificant contribution to the causes of climate change, it is suffering from drought, flooding, climate-induced displacement and other climate-related challenges. The international community should accelerate efforts to curb those negative effects.” Jan Eliasson, deputy secretary general of the UN, told a meeting of LDCs in New York that their ability to act on their commitments will be a challenge. “They need the support of international partners,” he said. Developing countries played a major role in Paris even though they have been barely responsible for historic global warming. China committed to peaking its emissions and obtaining 20% of all its energy from non-fossil sources by 2030, Brazil to cutting emissions by 37% and India plans to triple its renewable energy capacity by 2022.  The LDCs also committed to make major changes in the way they develop. Ethiopia and many other African countries said they planned to vastly expand wind, solar and hydro power, and to reforest large areas. But finding the money to allow them to meet their commitments will be hard, said the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED). In a report published at the climate summit, the institute calculated it would cost the 48 countries around $93bn (£73bn) a year, or close to $1tn in total to meet their commitments.  “Countries’ swift action in ratifying the Paris agreement should be celebrated, and means it will come into force at unprecedented speed. But for it to be effective and fair, developed countries must live up to and increase their commitments and prioritise raising and investing international climate finance within the least developed countries,” said the IIED’s director, Andrew Norton. A UN report calculated that the cost for all developing countries to adapt to climate change could go as high as $500bn a year by 2050 – four to five times higher than previous estimates. Where the money is going to come from is uncertain. Rich countries have agreed to “mobilise” $100bn a year from 2020 onwards but the details are still vague. Much of the money is expected to be channelled through the Green Climate Fund, which has been set up and has attracted nearly $10bn, but is said by developing countries to be bureaucratic, slow and inaccessible. “There is still a lot of hard work ahead. Small island states and developing countries know only too well the scale of the challenge. Families and communities are already feeling the devastating effects of climate change. Our fear is that extreme weather events like hurricane Matthew in the Caribbean will become the norm, not the exception,” said Patricia Scotland, secretary general of the Commonwealth as finance ministers met in Washington to discuss the funds required for climate mitigation and adaption on Thursday.  “All of us – governments, experts and civil society – need to work together, collaboratively, if we’re to make a true difference,” she added.  Rich countries have a bad record on meeting their climate pledges to the most vulnerable countries. Oxfam has estimated that in 2014 just 16% of total climate finance was channelled towards poorer countries.  “The Paris agreement’s credibility test starts today. Each and every country has pledged to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, but our world is still on track to warm up to 3C or more, much higher than the agreement’s stated goal of 1.5C. Countries will need to quickly and aggressively cut their greenhouse gas emissions further,” said an Oxfam spokeswoman. “Only a fraction of the money that rich countries are spending on climate change is reaching the most vulnerable communities that desperately need it most. Figuring out how to close this gap and strengthen the resilience of these communities should be high on the list of priorities ahead of next month’s UN climate change conference in Morocco.” Oxfam called on countries to target 35% of funding by 2020, and 50% by 2025. “The share is not only too low, it is also declining. It was 21% in 2013. No share or specific amount has been agreed for vulnerable countries in the Paris agreement,” the spokeswoman said."
"Miners could run afoul of Queensland’s environmental protection laws if the burning of their export coal overseas were shown to negatively impact global carbon pollution, the state’s highest court has ruled.  But the court of appeal has dismissed a challenge to Gina Rinehart’s Alpha mine because of an earlier land court finding that it would “not detrimentally affect global greenhouse gas emissions” because Asian power stations would simply buy coal elsewhere if the mine were blocked.  The decision on Tuesday lumped conservation group Coast and Country with legal costs after escalating their fight against the proposed 30m tonne-a-year mine in the Galilee basin in the wake of unsuccessful challenges in the land court and the supreme court. Coast and Country had applied for statutory review of the land court ruling upholding approval of an environmental authority for GVK Hancock. The appeal court president, Margaret McMurdo, in a published judgment found that the land court “must consider” so-called scope 3 emissions from transporting and burning coal overseas when weighing up a mine’s environmental authority. However the land court “made findings of fact that the proposed mining would not detrimentally affect global greenhouse gas emissions” and these were “not amenable to statutory review”, McMurdo said. Jo-Anne Bragg, chief executive of the Queensland Environmental Defenders Office, which ran the case for Coast and Country, said their clients were disappointed. “We all know that burning fossil fuels is contributing to global warming, extreme weather events and severe damage to our Great Barrier Reef. Every further approval locks in those impacts,” Bragg said. A GVK Hancock spokesman said the ruling brought “an end to four years of legal challenges from anti-mining protesters and allows us to continue developing a project that will create thousands of jobs for our state”. The miner in the land court had argued its contribution of 0.16% to global emissions through the burning of 30MT of coal a year was “negligible” but this was dismissed by the court. Alpha is one of six Galilee basin mining proposals singled out last week in a climate advocacy report arguing they must be stopped if global warming is to be kept to 1.5C, the aspirational target of the Paris Agreement. McMurdo said that under the “very broadly defined object of the Environmental Protection Act … environmental value and environmental harm are consistent with a desire to protect Queensland’s environment from development, including mining development, which would cause harmful global greenhouse gas emissions”. The land court was obliged to consider criteria “consistent with a concern about harmful global greenhouse gas emissions which would not ‘enhance individual and community wellbeing and welfare by following a path of economic development that safeguards the welfare of future generations’; would not ‘provide for equity within and between generations’; could damage ‘biological diversity’ and ‘essential ecological processes and life support systems’; or could raise ‘threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage’”, she said. Fellow appeal court justice Hugh Fraser noted “expert evidence” before the land court that power stations primarily in India and China would “burn the same amount of thermal coal and produce the same amount of greenhouse gases whether or not the proposed Alpha mine proceeded”.  “That was so because thermal coal was plentiful and cheaply available to the power stations from many sources,” Fraser said.  “It was the designed power generating capacity of the power stations, rather than the availability of coal, which determined the amount of coal which would be burned in the power stations.  “Accordingly, global scope 3 emissions would not fall if the mine did not proceed.” That followed a supreme court ruling last September that the land court’s consideration that “environmental harm that might be caused by another coal mine somewhere else in the world” was relevant under state environmental laws."
" Hopes that large amounts of planet-warming carbon dioxide could be buried in soils appear to be grossly misplaced, with new research finding that the ground will soak up far less carbon over the coming century than previously thought. Radiocarbon dating of soils, when combined with previous models of carbon uptake, has shown the widely assumed potential for carbon sequestration to combat climate change has been overestimated by as much as 40%.  Scientists from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) found that models used by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assume a much faster cycling of carbon through soils than is actually the case. Data taken from 157 soil samples taken from around the world show the average age of soil carbon is more than six times older than previously thought. This means it will take hundreds or even thousands of years for soils to soak up large amounts of the extra CO2 pumped into the atmosphere by human activity – far too long to be relied upon as a way to help the world avoid dangerous global warming this century.  “A substantial amount of the greenhouse gas that we thought was being taken up and stored in the soil is actually going to stay in the atmosphere,” said study co-author Steven Allison, UCI associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and Earth system science.  Soil is the largest land-based reservoir of carbon on Earth, absorbing it from trees and vegetation as they die and decay. The IPCC calculated that should the mass deforestation of recent centuries be completely reversed, around 40 parts per million (ppm) of CO2, from the current 400ppm levels, could be removed from the atmosphere. Other studies have shown large amounts of carbon could be soaked up with changes in agricultural practices. But the University of California work, published in the journal Science, went beyond the models to explicitly date radiocarbons, one of the two carbon isotopes.  “It will take a very long time for soil to soak up the carbon, there is a timescale mismatch in terms of climate change,” said Yujie He, a UCI postdoctoral scholar and lead author of the study. “The soil will eventually be a large carbon sink, but it won’t be present in the next century.” Nations have agreed to limit global temperature increase to 2C compared to pre-industrial times, in order to prevent a dangerous shift in the climate that will lead to more heatwaves, extreme weather and ruinous sea level rise as glaciers melt and seawater expands.  An international aspiration to cap the rise to 1.5C, seen as crucial to the viability of low-lying nations, already appears to be slipping out of reach. As-yet undeveloped technology, such as geo-engineering of landscapes, carbon capture from power plants or direct removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, may be required even if emissions are radically cut. But the prospect of adapting soils so they suck up more carbon is “unlikely”, especially in the short-term, according to He. “I don’t think we can increase that absorption ability, so we may want to make more proactive action to mitigate climate change, such as cuts to fossil fuel emissions, for example,” she said."

"The frequency of floods of the magnitude of Hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of New York City in 2012, is rising so sharply that they could become relatively normal, with a raft of new research laying bare the enormous upheavals already under way in the US due to climate change. These findings and two other fresh pieces of research have highlighted how the US is already in the grip of significant environmental changes driven by warming temperatures, albeit in different ways to the processes that are fueling hurricanes.  An analysis of past storms and models of future events as the planet warms has shown that Sandy-like floods have become three times more common in the New York area since 1800. This frequency is set to climb further, from once every 400 years to once every 90 years by 2100, due to the effects of sea level rise alone. Worse still, when the impact of future storm conditions, supercharged by the warming oceans and increased atmospheric moisture, is considered, New York could be swamped by Sandy-level flooding as frequently as once every 23 years by the end of the century, according to research led by Princeton University. The frequency of flood events such as Sandy, which caused a storm surge nearly 3m above high tide resulting in 159 deaths and $68bn in damage in the US north-east, has “increased significantly over the past two centuries and is very likely to increase more sharply over the 21st century, due to the compound effects of sea level rise and storm climatology change”, the Princeton study states.  Michael Mann, a climatologist at Penn State University, said that the studies deal with very different processes but are “examples of climate change impacts that are already threatening us here in the US and around the world, the devastating and unprecedented wildfires in Alberta last spring and the coastal flooding and massive loss of life from Hurricane Matthew being just the latest reminders, and which will only worsen if we do not act on climate”. There is a range of uncertainty around exactly how frequently major flooding events will occur, based on different rates of sea level rise and hurricane occurrence. But the research shows a multiplying of Sandy-like events under all scenarios. “There have been storms in the past that were probably as big as Sandy, such as in 1821, but you would be worried if these events become more frequent,” said Ning Lin, lead author and assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Princeton.  “Sandy was a wake-up call, and New York has been starting to do things, such as coastal defences and some mitigation. Many other places may not even realize the risk, which is worrisome.” The findings have been published in the wake of Hurricane Matthew, which tore up the east coast of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, causing at least 22 deaths in the US and leaving hundreds of thousands of other people with flooded homes or without electricity. Spring is now beginning earlier than the historical norm in 75% of 276 US national park properties studied by scientists. The research, which looked at the onset of spring at national parks from 1901 to 2012, found that leaves and blooming flowers are now appearing around a week earlier than the long-term average. Most of this change has occurred in the past 30 years, as global temperatures have sharply spiked.  “Things have already changed around us, which requires a new paradigm in terms of how we manage our national parks,” said Jake Weltzin, study co-author and ecologist at the US Geological Survey.  “What we’ll see in the future is parks increasingly under stress. They will look quite different to now. Scientists have lagged a bit in terms of knowing exactly what is going on, but we can now see a strong trend that things are changing. All of these things are connected. We are already in a new environment.”  Earlier springs can open the door to invasive species to establish themselves, as well as cause major problems for migrating animals and plants that need pollinating. At Shenandoah national park in Virginia, one of the sites studied by government scientists and academics, non-native plants such as garlic mustard and oriental bittersweet are already taking advantage of the warmer temperatures to displace native wildflowers. “We can see that climate change is already impacting our nation’s national parks,” said US interior secretary Sally Jewell. “It’s clear that one of the biggest challenges our national parks face in their second century will be adaptive management in the face of a changing climate.” The expansion of spring is also increasing wildfire risk by drying out vegetation. That is likely to exacerbate a trend where growing areas of the US west are being razed by fire. Human-induced climate change has doubled the area affected by forest fires in the US west over the past 30 years, according to new research. The study found that a temperature rise of around 2.5F (1.3C) has helped spread conflagrations across an additional 16,000 square miles than they otherwise would have – an area larger than Massachusetts and Connecticut combined. Fires in western forests began increasing in the 1980s in terms of area burned, number of large fires and length of the fire season. Researchers isolated climate change from other factors such as changes in vegetation due to fire fighting techniques by looking at various ratings for forest aridity. They then compared these to observations of actual fires and climate models of manmade warming. Fire is set to consume even greater tracts of the western US as the world warms further this century. Firefighting resources have already been stretched thin in California, where drought and disease are adding to the woes of the forests, and Canada, where the city of Fort McMurray, Alberta, was burned down in May. Fires are starting to spread to areas of tundra untouched by flames for thousands of years.  “No matter how hard we try, the fires are going to keep getting bigger, and the reason is really clear,” said study coauthor Park Williams, a bio climatologist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. “Climate is really running the show in terms of what burns. We should be getting ready for bigger fire years than those familiar to previous generations. “I’d expect increases to proceed exponentially for at least the next few decades. I’d definitely be worried about living in a forested area with only one road in and one road out.” The average temperature across the US has increased by 1.3F to 1.9F (0.7C to 1C) since 1895, with most of this warming occurring since 1970. The most recent decade was the nation’s warmest on record. Globally, 2016 is set to be the hottest year since records began, following a trend of warming that has pushed temperatures to their highest level in at least 115,000 years.  This warming has been driven by the burning of fossil fuels, which has caused the concentration of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to increase by more than 40% since the industrial revolution. The Sandy flooding study and the wildfire research have both been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, while the research into early spring outset has appeared in Ecosphere.

"Governments will address the law of unintended consequences when they meet this week to revise a global treaty and try to eliminate the use of a group of greenhouse gases used in fridges, inhalers and air conditioners. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were hailed as the answer to the hole in the ozone layer which appeared over Antarctica in the 1980s because they replaced hundreds of chemical substances widely used in aerosols which depleted the thin layer of ozone which protects the Earth from harmful rays of the sun.   One hundred and ninety-seven countries signed the historic 1987 agreement which phased out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and similar hydrochlorofluoro carbons (HCFCs) and has seen gradual closure of the two polar ozone holes.  But concern has been mounting at how their substitute is undermining the landmark Paris climate agreement and could hamper attempts to keep global warming below dangerous levels. “The use of hydrofluorocarbons is growing. Already, the HFCs used in refrigerators, air conditioners, inhalers ... are emitting a gigaton of CO2-equivalent pollution into the atmosphere annually. If that sounds like a lot; it is. It’s equivalent to the emissions from nearly 300 coal-fired power plants every single year,” the US secretary of state, John Kerry, told a UN meeting on the Montreal protocol  earlier this year. “An HFC phasedown amendment is a critical piece of the climate puzzle,” he added. HFC use is increasing rapidly, driven by sales of fridges and air conditioning especially in fast-growing developing countries.  Researchers at the US government’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have calculated that 700m air-conditioning units, all using HFCs, are likely to be installed worldwide by 2030 and 1.6bn by 2050, it says.  The UN’s climate change body, the IPCC, has projected that global air-conditioning energy demand will grow 33-fold from 300 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2000 to more than 10,000TWh in 2100, with most of the growth coming in developing economies. Countries meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, this week will be asked to approve an amendment to the Montreal protocol. This would cover HFCs and, over time, eliminate the manufacture of the chemicals and, potentially reduce global temperatures by an around 0.5C by 2100.  A fast phasedown of the factory-made HFCs could avoid the equivalent of as much as 200bn tonnes of CO2  by 2050, according to a study published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. But negotiations will be tough. Rich countries want the chemicals phased out within 5-10 years, but developing countries led by China and India have argued for a date closer to 2031 which, they say, will give their chemical industries time to adapt.  But because HFC alternatives, including natural refrigerants such as CO2, and hydrocarbons, already exist, there is no technical reason why HFC reductions cannot be achieved quickly and inexpensively, say scientists and environmentalists. G7 countries have committed to provide additional funding to help developing countries implement an HFC amendment and last month a group of philanthropists pledged $53m to help. “It is in everyone’s interests to phase out HFCs as soon as possible,” said Gaby Drinkwater, Christian Aid’s policy officer. “As people in developing countries seek more air conditioners and refrigerators, a heavy expansion of HFCs could deal a significant blow to the ambition of the Paris agreement and set back any progress made on keeping global warming to 2C.” However, environmentalists with a long memory say that governments could have easily avoided the release of tens of billions of tons of HFC chemicals if they had listened to scientists in the 1980s.  “HFCs were always known to have the potential to increase global warming. We solved the ozone problem of ozone but governments chose not to address the climate-changing potential of their substitutes even though they knew about it,” said Dr Robin Russell-Jones, former director of the skin tumour unit at the St John’s Institute of Dermatology in London. “If it takes over a quarter of a century to fix a simple technological problem, then what chance is there for the world community to solve global warming?” he added. In 1989, he wrote in one of Britain’s leading medical journals, the Lancet: “Most scientists want to see the Montreal protocol widened to include substitutes like HCFC22. If uncontrolled [they] will be adding 15% to the global warming effect of carbon dioxide by the year 2030.”"
"Huge spikes in wholesale electricity prices in South Australia in July show stable, nationally consistent climate policy must urgently replace “unmanageable uncertainty” for energy market investors, according to a new analysis by the Grattan Institute. When the short-term spot price of electricity spiked to its peak of $14,000 several times on 7 July, some commentators sought to blame the high share of wind power in the state. Energy experts argued the price spikes were a result of an abuse of market power, with a small handful of generators gaming the system.  But Tony Wood and his colleagues at the Grattan Institute argue both these claims were wrong. They say the spikes were not a sign the market was not working: “On the contrary, in July the electricity market did what it was designed to do,” the authors argue. With an increase in intermittent wind energy, there was a higher requirement for flexible energy sources to fill the gaps when the wind wasn’t blowing. “The market’s performance in South Australia in July indicates that it is doing what a market should do. High price volatility – on 50 occasions the spot price was above $150 a megawatt hour – encourages flexible generation in the form of gas.” “New flexible generation will need to earn revenue through volatility in the price. For new intermediate generation, prices will need to spike at regular intervals,” the authors say. This means that as the energy system transitions to renewables, there will be an inevitable increase in costs to pay for the shift. The thinktank argues politicians need to acknowledge and explain this to the public.  “These two messages – that a major transition is going to happen and there will be a cost – need to be accepted and explained. Setting alternative expectations will leave the public frustrated and disappointed,” they say. “Increased electricity costs when consumers are not expecting them could lead to a backlash that once again slows Australia’s response to climate change.” The authors argue one cause of the problem in South Australia was the lack of effective and stable climate change policy. That discourages investment in new generation, and could discourage dirty power stations from shutting, as they wait to see what the next policy is. “Neither the [emissions reduction fund] nor the safeguard mechanism provides an effective binding constraint on emissions in the power sector,” they say. But since Australia has committed to reducing emissions to at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2030, “the result is unmanageable uncertainty for investors.”  The authors also argue that having a renewable energy target without a broader climate change policy is distorting the market. “By separating climate change policy from energy policy, Australia has caused changes in South Australia that are not as economically efficient or as environmentally effective as they could be,” they write. Having a high renewable energy target, without a broader climate change policy, was driving a lot of extra capacity into the system and guaranteeing that energy was mostly wind, even if that wasn’t the most useful type of energy supply. Wood, the lead author, said the overall picture was simple. “We desperately need to get climate change policy right in this country and integrate it with energy policy and energy markets if we want to achieve low emissions without skyrocketing prices or blackouts,” he told Guardian Australia."
"A new report from the US Department of Energy paints a bright picture for our prospects to cut carbon pollution and prevent the most dangerous levels of climate change. The report looked at recent changes in costs and deployment of five key clean energy technologies: wind, residential solar, utility-scale solar, batteries, and LED bulbs. For each technology, costs fell between 41% and 94% from 2008 to 2015.  Many who understand the realities and dangers of human-caused global warming are afraid that we’ll fail to avoid catastrophic climate change. Among this group, even positive climate stories are often viewed through a lens of pessimism, and we often see stories about the likelihood that we’ll miss climate targets. However, it’s important to acknowledge the progress that’s being made, and retain a sense of hope and optimism that we can still avoid the worst climate consequences. This new DOE report highlights the fact that clean energy technology is quickly moving in the right direction, toward lower costs and higher deployment. The report finds that due to its low cost, US wind energy capacity has nearly tripled since 2008. Wind now supplies nearly 5% of total US electricity generation.  As a result, there are now nearly 90,000 U.S. manufacturing, construction, and wind operations jobs. Research has resulted in bigger turbines that can generate more electricity: a wind turbine installed today on average has 108% longer blades and is 48% taller than one installed in 1999. The longer blades allow each turbine to capture more energy, and taller towers allow access to the stronger and more consistent wind speeds that occur at higher altitudes in many parts of the country. Combined, these innovations allow each turbine to produce more electricity, reducing both the number of turbines needed to produce a given amount of electricity and the land area needed for their installation. Offshore wind also presents tremendous untapped potential, with the first such project set to begin generating power off the cost of Rhode Island this month. The DOE envisions wind generating 20% of the nation’s electricity by 2030 and 35% by 2050, with costs falling a further 35% by 2050. Utility-scale solar farm costs have fallen 64% since 2008, and distributed (mostly residential) solar costs by 54%. While solar still accounts for a relatively small percentage of overall US electricity generation, its deployment has been increasing rapidly as costs have dropped. Even the military is getting on board: For example in 2015 the Department of the Navy procured 210 MW of a utility-scale PV project to support fourteen Navy installations in California. In 2015, the solar sector employed about 220,000 Americans. The DOE envisions that solar power could supply 27% of US electricity generation by 2050. Solar deployment is surging in 2016, with around 10 gigawatts (GW) set to be installed this year – equal to all the solar capacity installed in the US through 2014. Solar panel leasing from companies like Solar City and Sungevity has revolutionized the distributed solar market, accounting for the majority of domestic residential system installed in leading state markets in 2015. This approach makes solar panels obtainable for households that can’t afford to purchase them. Distributed solar costs are expected to fall a further 16–33% by 2020. The best available LED bulbs use 85% less energy than incandescent bulbs. Although their high efficiency slashes electric bills, the bulbs’ high cost was initially a deterrent to many consumers. However, LED costs have plummeted 94% since 2008. From 2014 to 2015, LED installations in the US more than doubled, and already account for 6% of installed A-type lightbulbs, as well as 11% and 21% of directional bulbs and outdoor lighting fixtures, respectively.  By 2035, DOE anticipates that LEDs will account for 85% of American’s lighting installations, saving Americans nearly $630 billion in avoided energy costs. Electric vehicle (EV) sales in the US reached 115,000 in 2015, more than double the number sold in 2012. Overall US EV sales will surpass a half-million by the end of this year. As shown by a new paper and app from MIT, EVs reduce greenhouse gas emissions 58% compared to gasoline-powered cars, and often cost less on a per-mile basis. As low-carbon energy deployment increases, EVs will only become cleaner. The technology is advancing rapidly due to heavy research, with batteries produced at high-volume now costing 79% less than they did in 2009. Chevrolet and Tesla will soon release electric cars with 200 mile-per-charge range and before-rebate prices under $40,000, and Renault beat both automakers to the punch with the 250-mile, $28,000 Zoe. There are now more than 35,000 public and private EV charging outlets in the United States, and in the UK, EV charging stations will outnumber petrol stations by 2020. The MIT study showed that in order to meet climate targets, we need a transition to EV transportation fueled by low-carbon sources of electricity. The DOE report shows that this sort of high-tech clean future is entire plausible; we’re moving in the right direction with falling costs and rising deployment of the right technologies."
"Robert F Kennedy Jr, a long-time environmental advocate, took big business to task as he stood on stage at the SXSW Eco environment conference in Austin on Monday. As one would expect from an attorney who is deft at making strong arguments, Kennedy lobbed punchy attacks on the Koch brothers and companies for characterizing environmental protection as an unnecessary expense that hurts business. “You will hear a lot of times from big polluters, the Koch brothers, their indentured servants in Washington DC and the toadies on Fox News that we have to choose economic prosperity on one hand and environmental protection on the other,” Kennedy said. “Good environmental policy is good for economic prosperity.”  The president of Waterkeeper Alliance, a New York City-based clean water advocacy group that works in 38 countries, Kennedy’s keynote provided a good historical perspective on grassroots campaigns for clean water in the US and a reminder that corporations need to include environmental protection as part of doing business. A 2013 study showed that just 90 companies, including Exxon and BP, were responsible for two-thirds of the manmade emissions worldwide. As the US and the rest of the world take on the enormous challenge of fighting climate change, they will have to hold businesses accountable for generating emissions that are setting the stage for catastrophic consequences around the world, from prolonged droughts to mass extinction of species. While an increasing number of companies are realizing that investing in environmental stewardship is in fact good for their bottom lines, reining in global warming will require far greater efforts. Kennedy is an old hand at forcing companies to clean up their dirty practices. Speaking at SXSW Eco, Kennedy recounted the fights he and his nonprofit have waged for five decades against companies such as General Electric to force them to clean up their pollution, from the Hudson River in New York to the San Francisco Bay. He claimed to know his calling was in environmental protection when he was just a little boy, and at age 8, wrote a letter to his uncle and US president John F Kennedy to ask for a meeting. “He had me in the Oval Office. I brought him a salamander in a case,” Kennedy recalled, adding that the chlorinated water he used to hold the critter probably led to its demise. (“I was in denial about that.”) “We spent a lot of the meeting talking about the health of the salamander, and he said, ‘It doesn’t look well to me’,” Kennedy said, to chuckles from the audience. Throughout his talk, Kennedy reinforced the notion that fighting for clean water and air isn’t about pitting environmentalists against capitalists. He also criticized the government for putting corporate interest ahead of public interest.  “We don’t consider ourselves environmentalists but free marketeers. We catch the cheaters, the polluters, and we force you to internalize your costs, the same way you internalize your profits,” said Kennedy, who took night classes on environmental law at Pace University in the 1980s, at a time when law schools rarely offered environmental courses, in order to work for Riverkeeper. Riverkeeper was founded to fight polluters on the Hudson and later became part of Waterkeeper. His talk also highlighted some of the ongoing major clean air and water battles within the US, such as the oil pipeline project in North Dakota, and worries about a rollback of major environmental laws should Donald Trump become president. Trump supports the coal industry and vows to axe programs such as the Clean Power Plan, which forces electricity producers to cut emissions and is currently being contested in court. The North Dakota pipeline project, which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe contends will pollute their water supply and decimate their cultural heritage, exemplifies the effort by big business and investors to make it difficult for America to move away from fossil fuels, Kennedy said. “They lock our nation into a dinosaur form of fuel that stops us from transitioning into a more efficient form of energy,” he said, calling low-carbon energy like solar and wind “cheap, green, patriotic fuel from heaven”. One of the most poignant points made by Kennedy was that poor communities often suffer the most from environmental devastation, yet they are least equipped to fight it. This point has also been made by developing countries as they seek funding from first-world nations to address climate change. “Polluters always choose the soft target of poverty,” said Kennedy, who noted, as an example, that the highest concentration of toxic waste dumps in America resides in the south side of Chicago."
"One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts has said he will respectfully consider climate change evidence given to him by the CSIRO, but also accused the science agency of pushing the “de-industrialisation” of Australia. Roberts met the CSIRO on Monday after asking for a briefing for the agency to provide empirical evidence of global warming which he has said it has “never provided before”.  Roberts told Guardian Australia the meeting was very interesting and he would treat the CSIRO with respect by going through the material it provided him, which included information on climate change and vegetation levels. “The onus of proof is on the CSIRO, they are the tip of $1tn climate industry. They’ve pushed the de-industrialisation of Queensland and Australia,” he said.  “Normally this is shut down with name-calling and smears. This time we’re starting a debate.” Have just finished our meeting with the #CSIRO. Great to finally meet and start a discussion on the #science backing their claims. #auspol Roberts said he would consult with “people all over the world” about what he had heard and make further comment in a couple of weeks. He said policies to mitigate climate change – such as a carbon price – were important because “they impact on jobs, the cost of living, and are especially harsh on the poor”. “It’s anti-human,” he summarised. The meeting comes on the same day a survey by the Climate Institute found 65% of Australians want the country to lead the world in climate change solutions. The result is up from 59% in 2014-15 and 52% in 2010-12 when the “carbon tax” debate was front and centre in politics. The study also found 77% of Australians believe climate change is happening, up from 64% four years ago and 70% last year. Roberts has consistently rejected arguments that humans cause global warming, despite the overwhelming scientific consensus. He demanded evidence in his inaugural speech on Tuesday and in an appearance on the ABC’s Q&A, but when data was immediately produced on air, he said it had been corrupted by manipulation by Nasa and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The CSIRO publishes a wealth of such data on the Climate Change in Australia website. Roberts’s claims have already been the subject of extensive rebuttals, including by Steven Sherwood, director of the climate change research centre at the University of New South Wales."
"The global temperature has increased to a level not seen for 115,000 years, requiring daunting technological advances that will cost the coming generations hundreds of trillions of dollars, according to the scientist widely credited with bringing climate change to the public’s attention. A new paper submitted by James Hansen, a former senior Nasa climate scientist, and 11 other experts states that the 2016 temperature is likely to be 1.25C above pre-industrial times, following a warming trend where the world has heated up at a rate of 0.18C per decade over the past 45 years.  This rate of warming is bringing Earth in line with temperatures last seen in the Eemian period, an interglacial era ending 115,000 years ago when there was much less ice and the sea level was 6-9 meters (20-30ft) higher than today.  In order to meet targets set at last year’s Paris climate accord to avoid runaway climate change, “massive CO2 extraction” costing an eye-watering $104tn to $570tn will be required over the coming century with “large risks and uncertain feasibility” as to its success, the paper states. “There’s a misconception that we’ve begun to address the climate problem,” said Hansen, who brought climate change into the public arena through his testimony to the US congress in the 1980s. “This misapprehension is based on the Paris climate deal where governments clapped themselves on the back but when you look at the science it doesn’t compute, it’s not true. “Even with optimistic assumptions (future emissions reduction) will cost hundreds of trillions of dollars. It’s potentially putting young people in charge of a situation that is beyond their control. It’s not clear they will be able to take such actions.” The paper, submitted as a discussion paper to the Earth System Dynamics journal, is a departure from the usual scientific process as it has yet to be peer reviewed and has been launched to support a legal case waged by a group of young people against the US government. Last year, 21 youths aged between 8 and 19 years old filed a constitutional lawsuit against the Obama administration for failing to do enough to slow climate change. Hansen and his granddaughter are parties to legal challenge, which was filed in Oregon and asserts that the government has violated young people’s rights to life, liberty and property. Hansen, who has become increasingly outspoken on climate change since retiring from Nasa in 2013, said he recognized some scientists might object to publicizing the paper so soon but that “we are running out of time on this climate issue.” The courts need to step in to force governments to act on climate change because they are largely free of the corrupting influence of special interests, Hansen said. He repeated his call for a global tax to be placed upon carbon emissions and said that fossil fuel companies should be forced to pay for emissions extraction in the same way the tobacco industry has been sued over the health impact of cigarettes. “The science is crystal clear, we have to phase out emissions over the next few decades,” Hansen said. “That won’t happen without substantial actions by Congress and the executive branch and that’s not happening so we need the courts to apply pressure, as they did with civil rights.” Several recent studies have cast doubt over whether the world will stay with an aspirational target set in Paris of a 1.5C limit on the average global temperature rise. This guardrail, and even the 2C limit agreed by 195 nations, appears dependent on as-yet undeveloped technology that would remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Under this scenario, huge emissions cuts would be supplemented by a widespread conversion to biofuels that would be burned for energy. The emissions from this energy would then be buried underground. Some sort of futuristic technology that sucks CO2 directly from the atmosphere may also be required. Hansen said this is a “dubious” proposition because it requires a vast change in land use at a time where a growing global population will require more food. There are also major doubts whether technology to capture CO2 and lock it underground, often touted as a panacea by the fossil fuel industry, will be developed in time to help avoid the dangerous sea level rise, drought, heatwaves and disease spurred by warming temperatures. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that carbon dioxide levels will not drop below the symbolic 400 parts per million (ppm) mark in our lifetimes – the highest concentration of CO2 since the Pliocene era 3m years ago.  The environment of this time, where sea levels were around 65ft higher than today and trees were able to grow near the north pole due to a lack of ice, is a “bellwether for what future climate might be like,” according to Bruce Bauer, a scientist with NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. Michael Mann, a prominent climatologist at Penn State University, agreed that CO2 removal will be required if the world was to avoid 1.5C warming although the 2C limit “could likely be achieved without negative emissions, but it would require urgent action, as I have argued myself is necessary.”. Mann added that Hansen’s paper is “interesting” but tackles a huge range of topics and is unconventional in its use as a tool to support a legal case. “Along with the paper being publicized prior to peer review, this will certainly raise eyebrows about whether or not this breaches the firewall many feel should exist wherein policy agenda should not influence the way that science is done,” Mann told the Guardian via email. "
"It was a soil bacteria course in New Zealand that convinced Reggie Davis to change his farming methods. The fourth-generation Victorian dairy farmer had become increasingly concerned by the costs, chemicals and time involved in the use of nitrate fertilisers to maintain – what was considered to be – high-quality pasture for his dairy herd. “I’ve always regarded myself as a progressive farmer, open to new ideas,” he says. So when his dairy herd nutritionist mentioned that the US biological farming advocate Dr Arden Andersen was running a soil management course in New Zealand, Davis decided to go. He asked around to see if any neighbours might be interested. Within weeks, 40 other dairy farmers from Victoria’s south-west had signed up for Andersen’s course.  That collegiate interest in investigating new farming methods is reflected in figures published by the Australian Dairy Industry Council in its annual sustainability performance review. According to the 2015 report, 75% of Australia’s dairy farmers recycle water, 60% have sustainable farm management plans and 45% have invested in biodiversity management and conservation planning. Dairy farmers have also set a national target to reduce industry greenhouse emissions by 30% by 2020, and have already cut emissions by 15% – largely through energy audits of dairy machinery and farm equipment. The report says dairy farmers want to create “a carbon-confident industry” and various software has been created to help to calculate and reduce farm emissions. These include the dairy climate toolkit and the dairy greenhouse abatement strategies calculator. There are some industry leaders. Bega Cheese, one of Australia’s biggest dairy product manufacturers, launched a sustainability program in 2014, which led to a $50m investment in environmental initiatives. The company offers climate change adaptation advice for farmers, supporting programs to plant trees for shade and shelter.  Similarly Burra Foods, a dairy processor and exporter in Victoria’s south Gippsland region, has recovered 60m litres of water a year from the evaporating process used to produce powdered milk. It has also cut its town water consumption by 20% and expects to make a further 25% reduction by 2017. There are dozens of similar stories across Australia’s dairy industry, which is the country’s third biggest rural industry after beef and wheat. It’s a $13.8bn industry that employs more than 39,000 people on farms and in manufacturing, and an additional 100,000 in related occupations such as dairy research and veterinary services. So if dairy takes a hard hit, regional economies will certainly feel it. The current dairy crisis is taking its toll. In April the processing giants Murray Goulburn and Fonterra announced cuts to farmgate prices paid to dairy farmers for milk. Murray Goulburn announced the cuts would be retrospective, which meant famers will be forced to pay back about $200m over the next three years. For most farmers, that will average $300,000. Both the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission are investigating Murray Goulburn but many farmers face financial ruin or the possibility of years of debt. It seems a particularly cruel blow for an industry in which the majority of farmers have been prepared to commit to sustainable farming practices. Reggie Davis is a good example. One of the reasons he decided to take a closer look at biological farming methods was to avoid using chemical sprays to control pasture pests. He’d noticed the lush growth produced by nitrate fertilisers attracted insects such as red-legged earth mite. These are a devastating pest, and controlling an infestation is costly. As well as the price of sprays, and possibly hiring a professional spray crew, farmers may have to buy supplementary fodder for their cows while the affected pasture is treated. The CSIRO estimates the mites, which were introduced from South Africa in the early 1900s, cost Australia’s farmers more than $500m a year in lost production. The Davis family run 600 Friesian cows on their 570-hectare property near Camperdown in south-west Victoria. They’re one of five farming families in the region who have formed a group called the Green Pastures Movement to practice and promote sustainable farming. The famers worked with a local company, Camperdown Compost, to set up a system of compost rows to turn straw, sawdust and cow manure into natural farm fertiliser. It’s a big operation that requires a heavy-duty mechanical compost turner, towed by a tractor, to periodically turn the compost windrows. The Davis farm produces about 2,000 tonnes of compost each year, and this is applied to pasture in autumn at a rate of about one tonne to the acre (or half a hectare). “We’ve seen a lot of positive changes with our soil health and our cows,” Davis says. “And people tell us that our milk tastes better.” In November 2013, the group of farmers launched their own milk brand, Green Pastures, and negotiated a deal with Coles supermarkets to stock it. The group produces 22m litres of milk annually for the commercial market, and only 1.5m is used for its premium price brand.  “If we could get more sales, that figure would go up, but it’s a hard slog getting the milk on to the shelves,” says Davis. He says the impact of farmgate milk price cuts has been “devastating, just terrible” for farmers across his region, and has resulted in “hundreds of cows being killed as people are forced to destock”. “So the choice that people make when they are buying milk really does matter,” he says."

"Do they understand what they have signed? Plainly they do not. Governments such as ours, now ratifying the Paris agreement on climate change, haven’t the faintest idea what it means – either that or they have no intention of honouring it. For the first time we can see the numbers on which the agreement depends, and their logic is inescapable. Governments can either meet their international commitments or allow the prospecting and development of new fossil fuel reserves. They cannot do both.  The Paris agreement, struck by 200 nations in December, pledged to hold “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels”, and aspired to limit it to 1.5C. So what does this mean? Thanks to a report by Oil Change International, we can now answer this question with a degree of precision. Using the industry’s own figures, it shows that burning the oil, gas and coal in the fields and mines that is already either in production or being developed, is likely to take the global temperature rise beyond 2C. And even if all coal mining were to be shut down today, the oil and gas lined up so far would take it past 1.5C. The notion that we can open any new reserves, whether by fracking for gas, drilling for oil or digging for coal, without scuppering the Paris commitments is simply untenable. This is not an extreme precautionary case. Quite the opposite, in fact: the report uses the hazard assessment adopted by the United Nations. This means a 66% chance of preventing 2C of global warming and a 50% chance of preventing 1.5C – an assumption of risk that in any other field would be regarded as reckless. Even so, to prevent the odds from becoming any worse, a 2C target means that we can use only around 85% of the fossil fuel that’s currently good to go, while a 1.5C target means we can extract little more than a third (the figures are explained by the US environmentalist Bill McKibben in an article in New Republic). So what’s the point of developing new reserves if the Paris agreement precludes the full extraction of those already in production? The only means of reconciling governments’ climate change commitments with the opening of new coal mines, oilfields and fracking sites is carbon capture and storage: extracting carbon dioxide from the exhaust gases of power stations and burying it in geological strata. But despite vast efforts to demonstrate the technology, it has not been proved at scale, and appears to be going nowhere. Our energy policies rely on vapourware. As for the belief among some governments that they can overshoot the climate targets, then at a later date suck carbon dioxide out of the air: this depends on scenarios that would be no less realistic if they involved sorcery. The most popular proposal is to combine the capture and storage phantasm with biofuel plantations covering an area between one and three times the size of India, then harvesting the material they grow, burning it in power stations and burying the emissions. The use of a mere few hundred million hectares of fertile land would have to compete with all the other problems the biofuel wand is meant to magic away, such as the use of petroleum in cars and kerosene in planes, as well as the minor issue of feeding the world’s people. All this nonsense is a substitute for a simple proposition: stop digging. There is only one form of carbon capture and storage that is scientifically proven, and which can be deployed immediately: leaving fossil fuels in the ground. Not developing fossil fuel reserves is much easier than breaking them open then having to close them later. As the Oil Change report points out, shutting working mines and wellheads means confronting and compensating companies that have invested heavily in production, and retraining and re-employing the people who would lose work. Some of this will have to happen anyway, if governments are to honour their promise in Paris. But their effort should be to minimise pain, not to extend it. Their choices are as follows. First: a gradual, managed decline of existing production and its replacement with renewable energy and low-carbon infrastructure, which offer great potential for employment. Second: allowing fossil fuel production to continue at current rates for a while longer, followed by a sudden and severe termination of the sector, with dire consequences for both jobs and economies. Third: continuing to produce fossil fuels as we do today, followed by climate breakdown. Why is this a hard choice to make? Our governments seem determined to choose option three. Globally, some $14tr is being lined up for new fossil fuel extraction and freight over the next 20 years. Governments are intervening all right: to try to crush political opposition to these projects, while using public money to protect them from market forces. In Britain, for example, tax rebates for North Sea oil and gas companies are so generous that over the next five years the government is likely to give them around £5bn more than it receives in revenues. There are similar tax breaks for fracking companies – but not, of course, for renewable energy. While local people have been granted a special veto over wind turbines, the government has awarded itself special powers to override local decisions on fracking, to ensure that it goes ahead. And if brute power is insufficient, it is backed up by bribery: the prime minister, Theresa May, has offered local people cash payments of up to £10,000 per household from the tax revenues (if there are any) that fracking is meant to generate. There is no such entitlement to share the income from wind power: we wouldn’t want to encourage it. There’s a reason for this blatant asymmetry: fossil fuel companies are rich and powerful. Preventing climate breakdown means defending democracy from plutocrats. It’s their interests versus the rest of humanity’s. So when May announced at the UN last week that she was ratifying the Paris agreement, perhaps what she meant was that she was going to reverse her government’s suite of energy policies. Or maybe it wasn’t that. Perhaps she meant that she doesn’t intend to do anything except sign a piece of paper. Has she even considered the implications of this choice? I doubt it. After all, it’s only the future of life on Earth that’s at stake. "

"Barack Obama has said the Paris climate deal could prove a “turning point” in the effort to avoid dangerous global warming, after a flurry of commitments by nations pushed the agreement into force. The climate accord is set to be activated on 4 November after the European Union, Canada, Nepal and India all formally ratified the deal. The latest ratifications mean that 73 nations accounting for nearly 57% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions are fully committed to the process, meaning the two key thresholds to the agreement have now been met.  Obama said: “Today is a historic day in the fight to protect our planet for future generations. This gives us the best possible shot to save the one planet we got. With optimism and faith and hope, we are proving it is possible.” The US president said the Paris agreement will prove a “turning point” in the fight against climate change, should nations fully commit to cutting emissions. The US and China, the world’s two largest emitters, both ratified the agreement in September.  Obama said the deal, which commits countries to ensuring that the average global temperature doesn’t rise 2C above pre-industrial levels, will “open the floodgates for low-carbon innovation at a scale we haven’t seen before”. But he warned that emissions will need to be scaled back even further, along with mooted cutbacks in aviation and HFC pollution, if runaway climate change is to be avoided. “No nation, not even one as powerful as ours, can solve this on its own – we have to do this together,” he said. “Even if we meet every target, we will only get to part of where we need to go. But this will help delay or avoid the worst consequences of climate change. It’ll help set bolder targets.” The Paris agreement, struck last year, calls for all 195 signatories to come up with their own voluntary plans to reduce emissions. While the landmark deal is the first commitment by all countries to reduce emissions, the individual pledges are unlikely to be sufficient to stay within the 2C limit, which could be breached as early as 2050, according to recent research. Separate studies have shown the world is on course for a temperature rise of around 3.5C by the end of the century, based on the emissions cuts promised in Paris. This would cause a range of disastrous environmental consequences, including heatwaves, sea level rise, species extinctions and spread of disease. There are doubts that the US is on track even to meet its initial promise to cut emissions by 26% to 28% by 2025 by 2005 levels. In a further complication, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has promised to withdraw the US from the deal should he win power. However, the ratification locks countries into the deal for four years, so an immediate US exit wouldn’t be possible.  But green groups have celebrated the activation of the Paris deal, pointing to the lightening pace of ratification after decades of international wrangling over climate change. United Nations agreements often take years to come into force, with the Paris deal taking less than a year to pass its ratification thresholds.  “The unprecedented speed of the entry into force of the Paris agreement demonstrates that Paris was not a one-off deal, but rather a long-term commitment to climate action,” said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International.  Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, added: “After years of tireless dedication and work toward an international climate deal, the Paris agreement has finally jumped off the page and into reality.   “Now that the agreement is a reality, we must finally align our global energy and economic policies to meet these goals and end subsidies for outdated fossil fuels, transition to 100 percent clean energy, and stop harmful trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership that run counter to the goals of the Paris Agreement.”  Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and a key architect of the Paris deal, said the deal should be met with “unbridled optimism.”  “We now we have our starting signal – this is the “go” toward a low carbon future,” she said. “That future is going to be exciting: ending the dominance of fossil fuels will deliver an abundance of innovation and opportunity for all of us.   “We can deliver cleaner air, healthier cities and a new kind of ‘industrial’ revolution underpinned by technologies that enable us to live a prosperous life within the boundaries our planet can sustain. To achieve that, we must now increase our ambition to ensure the legacy of this moment is sealed as a positive pivot point in history.”"
"EU ministers have agreed to ratify the landmark Paris climate agreement at an extraordinary summit in Brussels on Friday, all but guaranteeing that it will pass a legal threshold to take effect next week and sparing the bloc’s blushes in the process. The European Parliament is expected to rubber stamp the decision in Strasbourg next Tuesday, allowing the EU to sign off on it as soon as the following day.  The EU’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker said: “Today, the EU’s member states decided to make history together and bring closer the entry into force of the first ever universally binding climate change agreement. We must and we can hand over to future generations a world that is more stable, a healthier planet, fairer societies and more prosperous economies.  “This is not a dream. This is a reality and it is within our reach. Today we are closer to it.” The Paris pact to limit global warming to “well below 2C” will enter into force 30 days after 55 countries, accounting for 55% of the planet’s emissions hand their ratification papers to the offices of Ban Ki-Moon in New York. India is expected to ratify the deal over the weekend, with Canada next week also likely to join the 61 countries that have so far signed up. The EU’s added weight should then tip the treaty into effect.  The EU’s climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Cañete, said that Europe’s reputation had been “on the line” in the run up to today’s meeting. “We are reaching a critical period for decisive climate action,” he said, “and when the going gets tough, Europe gets going.” With global CO2 concentrations permanently passing the 400ppm barrier this week and some climate scientists predicting that the Paris deal’s preferred threshold of keeping temperature rises to 1.5C could be broken as soon as 2020, calls for a greater urgency in Brussels have increased of late.   “We cannot miss this opportunity,” Gianni La Via, the European Parliament’s rapporteur on the file, told the Guardian. “A timely EU ratification decision would send a strong signal and highlight the leadership of the EU and its member states.” The EU was a core member of the “coalition for high ambition” in Paris which pushed a deal through. Ratifying it now will at least allow the bloc speaking and voting rights at a key COP22 summit on its implementation at Marrakesh in November.  EU sources say that 80 or 90 countries have still not ratified the Paris agreement but that a fear of being counted among them focused minds in Brussels. “We would not have been isolated but in terms of our global leadership it would have been politically embarrassing if we had not been able to show unity at this stage,” the official said. The speed of today’s extraordinary council decision was hailed as “truly remarkable” by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK-based thinktank which includes MPs, peers and climate scientists on its board.  One spectre haunting the summit though was the prospect of a victory for the climate-sceptic Republican candidate, Donald Trump, in US elections later this year. EU sources say that the bloc would aim to stick to its climate commitments if that happened. One told the Guardian: “It can’t be indefinite but our initial reaction would be to try to lead others in anticipation that this was a temporary aberration in US politics and that common sense would prevail, whether in four years time or sooner.” Europe’s own intentions have been clouded for some by resistance from coal-dependant Poland to any review of the EU’s existing climate pledge in 2018. In the Paris deal, this is seen as an opportunity to scale up ambitions towards a 1.5C target. The EU has not proposed any new climate actions in line with a 1.5C goal, but new legislation on renewables and energy efficiency is expected later this year, to help meet Europe’s existing climate pledges. Officials believe the measures could have “unpredicted but positive impacts”, helping Europe to go even further than its promised 40% emissions cut for 2030. Today’s discussions in Brussels were dominated by Polish demands for an effective veto over future climate decisions, such as reforms to the EU’s emissions trading system or national emissions cutting targets. “They were looking for a change to the treaty basis of EU climate policy that would have required unanimity by all member states,” a source said. “They did not achieve that.” Some environmentalists are concerned at the lack of deadlines for the EU’s 28 members to individually ratify the Paris deal, or peak their emissions. These are currently forecast to continue rising until 2030 in some countries. Wendel Trio, the director of Climate Action Network Europe complained of “a certain level of hypocrisy” in calls from Brussels for other countries to implement the Paris deal’s tenets. “We can no longer follow the myth that the EU is acting alone or that it is a leader,” he said. “This ratification process shows that the EU is actually running behind [other countries]. It is important for the EU to know that they need to adapt to this new era of climate action, get their act together and improve their climate policies rather than think they can continue on a business as usual trajectory.” Several EU countries have formaly signed off on the Paris deal to date, including France, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, Portugal and Austria. Theresa May has promised to ratify the agreement by the end of this year. "
"The US is on course to miss its emissions reduction target agreed in the Paris climate accord nine months ago, with new research finding that the world’s largest historical emitter doesn’t currently have the policies in place to meet its pledge. Even if the US implements a range of emissions-slashing proposals that have yet to be introduced, the nation could still overshoot its 2025 target by nearly 1bn tonnes of greenhouse gases. This failure would have profound consequences for the US’s position as a climate leader, as well for the global effort to stave off the dangerous heatwaves, sea level rise and extreme weather associated with climate change. “If the policies were locked today, there would be a low likelihood of meeting the target,” said Jeffery Greenblatt, scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and lead author of the study, published in Nature.  “I wouldn’t disparage the US’s efforts so far, but we need to do more as a nation and globally to reduce emissions. However we splice it, that’s hard to do. We can’t make small alterations to our economy – we need fundamental changes in how we get and use energy.” The US pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% by 2025, based in 2005 levels, at last year’s landmark Paris climate deal. At the time, Barack Obama hailed the US as “the global leader in fighting climate change”. But the new study used previous government projections combined with updated emissions data to forecast that even if the president’s centerpiece Clean Power Plan was to go ahead, the US would fall short of its target by 551m to 1.8bn tonnes of greenhouse gases. Adding in all proposed reforms, to areas such as building codes, emissions standards for trucks and fertilizers, would still see a shortfall of 356m to 924m tonnes by 2025. While the US still has time to close this gap, the study warns that additional measures will probably be required at a time when action on climate change is anathema to Republicans whose presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has called global warming a “hoax” and “bullshit”. Greenblatt said: “It’s good to set ambitious targets, it pushes us to be creative and find ways to meet them. We won’t get there with existing policies but it doesn’t mean we are doomed. This is a call to action to ensure we close the remaining gap.” The US has been overtaken by China in recent years as the world’s largest emitter but still expels more than 6.8bn tonnes of greenhouse gases a year from energy, transportation and agriculture. While US emissions have edged downwards over the past decade, Obama’s linchpin climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, has been enmeshed in a legal battle waged by leaders of 27 American states. Court hearings over the legality of plan, which would place emissions limits upon each state, begin on Tuesday. The Paris climate deal, which Trump has said the US will exit should he win the presidency, calls for emissions reductions from 195 signatory countries in order to prevent global temperatures rising more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. However, a string of record-breaking months of heat in 2016 has raised concerns that a more aspirational target of a 1.5C limit is already out of reach. Soberingly, the 2C guardrail is also in jeopardy, with several analyses showing that nations’ emissions reduction pledges are insufficient. Calculations released this month by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that proposed emissions cuts would lead to a 3.5C increase in average global temperatures by 2100. This warming would probably trigger a range of dangerous environmental changes for humans and other species. John Sterman, director of the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative, said the new emissions projection study, which he wasn’t involved in, was “sound” in its conclusions. “The target is absolutely not beyond our reach, it’s just not likely with current policy,” he said. “We have the technology to dramatically cut emissions and economically we know it’s affordable. “The problem is a political problem and an implementation problem. The US, and the world, needs deeper and sooner cuts.” Sterman said cheap gasoline and natural gas prices in the US have led to overconsumption of fossil fuels and slowed efforts to improve energy efficiency. He added that putting a price on carbon, which has been done in California but fiercely resisted by Republicans nationally, would provide the largest single shove towards meeting the 2025 target. “If you had to take one policy to a desert island, it would be a price on carbon,” Sterman said. “But it’s not the only one. There’s no silver bullet to dealing with climate change, there’s silver buckshot.”"
"There are only 36 days left until the US election, and already America is tired. According to a Pew Research Center survey, 59% of Americans were already exhausted by the amount of election coverage in June, when D-day was four months away. As the election draws nearer and the media hysteria mounts, levels of fatigue are hovering around the “please induce a coma and wake me up when this is all over” mark. Here’s the thing, though – nobody is forcing us to keep talking about the elections. We don’t live in Trumpenistan yet; we are not all legally obliged to mention Donald Trump’s name in every second sentence. The democratic process does not hinge on us spending hours writing long Facebook posts explaining our views on the candidates in block capitals to echo chambers of our own opinion. We are allowed to talk about other things. In fact, ’tis the season to talk about other things: there are some autumn conversations that are obligatory. Here are five to get you started and get your mind off the election.  Every year, pumpkin-flavoured drinks, capitalism’s way of ringing in the autumn, start appearing earlier and earlier. This is not a weird sign of climate change; it’s the sign of a weird national obsession. According to Dunkin’ Donuts, “In the New York City area, pumpkin-flavoured drinks were available starting 18 August due to customer feedback that they wanted pumpkin even earlier.” However, pumpkin spice lattes – popularised by Starbucks, but now peddled everywhere – really come into their own when the temperature starts to drop, as it has in the last few days in New York. For the next couple of weeks, millions of people are going to be pulling on their Lululemons and Uggs, grabbing their first PSL of the season and exclaiming: “Ah, now I really feel like it’s autumn!” Meanwhile, millions of PSL haters are going to inform you how abominable the beverage is, to ensure you know they’re not “basic”. Pumpkin spice lattes are the 2016 election in a cup. Divisive, disgusting and everyone’s got an opinion. Dammit, we’re back to the elections. Americans take Halloween almost as seriously as democracy. People spend weeks planning their outfits. Somewhere in the US right now, I can guarantee a group text like this is happening: “Let’s all dress up as a sexy poop emoji or sexy Pokémon this year!”“I dunno … What do you think about the sexy breast cancer awareness costume?”“Some people might find that offensive. What about dressing up like Isis?”“No, wait, I know! Let’s go as slutty Harambe!” Yes, there really is a sexy Harambe costume because this is 2016. And if gorilla-style politics is not for you, there’s also a sexy Donald Trump costume and a sexy Hillary Clinton costume. Who says we need to make America great again? It’s already perfect. In New York, dating is a blood sport. When the temperature starts to drop, however, competition really hots up and “cuffing season” starts. Urban Dictionary explains that, as autumn begins, people “who would normally rather be single or promiscuous find themselves along with the rest of the world desiring to be ‘cuffed’ or tied down by a serious relationship”. Cuffing season is often accompanied by “zombieing”. This is when an ex long gone from your life rises from the dead (metaphorically speaking) and starts randomly liking your social media posts or sending you one-word texts such as “Hi”. If you go to a bar in New York during cuffing season, you will overhear long discussions about if “I should say ‘hi’ back?” (No.) You may also see already-cuffed couples in matching flannels discussing their apple-picking plans. According to a 2015 study, almost 75 million people, about a quarter of the US population, play fantasy football, spending $4.6bn (£3.5bn) on it. Meanwhile only 9% of the US chose Trump and Clinton as the presidential nominees. Fantasy football (I’m talking about American, no-feet-involved football, obviously) is an obsessive topic of discussion around this time of year. Unfortunately, I could not tell you what is being discussed; Trump’s policies make more sense to me than the ins and outs of imaginary leagues. And it turns out, though, you can’t even escape the nightmare of politics with the fantasy of football this year. Clinton is running ads on fantasy football websites, describing Trump as “like that guy in your fantasy league who talks trash all week and forgets to set his lineup”. Ah, autumn. The leaves are changing colour, the air is crisp and the carbon dioxide is abundant. Environmental scientists recently announced that climate change has reached the “point of no return”, with the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere permanently passing the 400-parts-per-million threshold. Some people will tell you that this is a very real disaster of our own making. Others will tell you that the concept of global warming was a conspiracy created by the Chinese to make US manufacturing non-competitive. Other people will post angry messages on social media asking: “Why doesn’t everyone who is worked up about Harambe start getting worked up about climate change, which really matters!” People have always enjoyed talking about the weather; it used to be a safe topic of conversation. Alas, this is no longer the case. Now if you tell someone “Gosh, it’s got cold recently”, there is a good chance they will reply with their unsolicited opinion on global warming. Which will lead you back to politics. Which will lead you back to the elections. There is really no escaping it, after all."
"A UN negotiation is inching towards a landmark deal to curb emissions from airplanes, although environmental groups have warned that the plan will not go far enough to help slow climate change.  The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a UN agency, has gathered more than 2,000 government officials from around the world at its Montreal headquarters to adopt the first ever international mechanism to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from aviation.   A market-based scheme has been proposed at the triennial meeting whereby emissions from aviation will be measured from a baseline to be set in 2020. Emissions that exceed this level will then have to be offset by all countries, with exceptions for developing nations, unless they choose to volunteer.   So far, 63 countries have pledged to join the scheme from its outset, including the US, China, Japan and Canada. The European Union has also voiced its support. A draft text has been put forward with a final version of the deal expected to be decided upon next week.  Global aviation currently moves 10 million passengers around every day, pumping out enough emissions to contribute 1.3% to the overall total of greenhouse gases emitted from all sources, including power generation and agriculture. Aviation’s emissions share is expected to leap to 22% by 2050, placing growing pressure on the sector to help the world avoid further global warming.  But environmental groups have criticized the ICAO plan as “incredibly weak” and warned that it will do little to limit pollution unless it is significantly ramped up. They argue that more countries need to sign up in order to honor the goals set at the Paris climate agreement last year.   “In Paris, world leaders put great faith into ICAO to deliver emissions reductions from international aviation. Global aviation needs to step up and agree to a plan that matches the demands of science,” said Lou Leonard, interim deputy leader for WWF’s climate and energy practice.  “But without broad participation, the proposed deal represents a low bar for an international climate agreement. The clock is ticking; the best way to strengthen the deal at this point is the added benefit of additional countries opting in.”  There has also been criticism of the structure of the plan itself. Participating countries will have to ensure airlines offset emissions by backing carbon-reducing activities elsewhere, rather than use technology to cut the emissions from aircraft fuel.   All emissions up to the 2020 level will not have to be offset, despite probably representing the vast bulk of future emissions, and nations that volunteer to take part can opt out with six months’ notice. Vera Pardee, a campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity, said: “This is a dangerous dodge that does little more than help airlines hide their skyrocketing threat to our climate.  “Instead of employing the host of technologies that actually reduce aircraft pollution, the aviation industry has sold us a highly dubious offset scheme that simply passes off its exploding carbon debt to someone else.”  The International Coalition on Sustainable Aviation, an environmental observer of the UN talks, has warned that the deal could still allow absolute international aviation emissions to increase until at least 2035, meaning that more work needs to be done “in order to ratchet the level of ambition up”.  But the International Air Transport Association, which represents airlines, said that the offset scheme is a “pragmatic compromise” that will deliver carbon neutral growth from 2020.   Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the trade association, said the deal “along with measures to improve technology, operations and infrastructure, will keep aviation at the forefront of industries responsibly managing their climate change impact”.  The airline industry has a goal to improve average fuel efficiency by 1.5% to 2020. But green groups believe airlines could do much more – a recent study from the International Council on Clean Transportation found that fuel consumption in new aircraft designs could be slashed by 25% in 2024 using new technologies."
" The global target to prevent climate catastrophe, crafted at a landmark summit last year in Paris, will be very difficult if not impossible to hit, said some of world’s top scientists meeting this week in Oxford. The first-ever climate pact to enjoin all nations vows to cap global warming at “well below” 2C compared to pre-Industrial Revolution levels – and under 1.5 C if possible.   “Currently we only have a few scenarios that get us there, and they are outliers,” said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, a climate scientist at Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace in Paris, said of the more ambitious goal. All but a few of the hundreds of complex computer models plotting the rapid reduction of greenhouse gases that drive climate change, in other words, zoom right past it. “The 1.5 C target took the scientific community by surprise,” said Prof Jim Hall, director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford, which is hosting the three-day conference ending Thursday. The question stretches back to the chaotic Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, which nearly derailed more than a decade of UN talks, set the threshold for dangerous global warming at 2C. A huge body of scientific literature has accumulated around that benchmark, feeding into periodic reports by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). But a recent crescendo of devastating impacts – heatwaves, deadly flooding, storm surges fuelled by rising seas – pushed world leaders to inscribe even more demanding temperature targets in the Paris pact, inked by 195 nations in December. The effort was led by small island nations, some of which are likely to disappear under the waves within decades.  Major emerging economies, notably India, went along despite fears that the new threshold would be a brake on economic development.  On current trajectories, the world is set to warm at least 3C by century’s end, a recipe for human misery and species extinction on a global scale, scientists say. The inclusion of 1.5C – even as an aspirational goal – was hailed as a political victory, especially by poor, climate-vulnerable nations. But it caught the scientific community tasked with informing policy makers off-guard. Top climate scientists gathered in Oxford to help fill this knowledge gap, and to funnel raw material for a major review – called for in the Paris agreement – to be delivered in mid-2018. “The findings from our conference are going to lead directly into the evidence base for the IPCC special report on 1.5C,” Hall said.  “The bad news is that we are already two-thirds of the way there,” he added, noting that average global temperatures in 2015 – the hottest year on record – were a full degree higher than 150 years ago. Indeed, the 2018 report is likely to make for grim reading. A 2C cap on warming was already seen as hugely ambitious, both technically and politically.  For many scientists, 1.5C seems virtually impossible – at least not without “over-shooting” the target. “We may see the first year of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels within a decade,” cautioned Dr Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the Met Office Hadley Centre in England. For some scientists, even setting the target is a bad idea. “There is a risk that the 1.5C temperature threshold is a distraction,” said Kevin Anderson, deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research in England. “The danger is that it will push us to look at geoengineering solutions rather than how to achieve deep decarbonisation.” Slashing the output of greenhouse gases that heat the atmosphere and oceans – decarbonisation, in other words – has long been the preferred solution to global warming. But despite a boom in renewables, emissions have continued to grow, putting even a 2C target out of reach unless engineers find ways to suck CO2 out of the air and store it underground – so-called “negative emissions.”  The 1.5C goal depends on these geoengineering schemes even more, and could tempt policy makers to opt for “quick fix” solutions rather than a wholesale transformation of national economies, Anderson said. The problem, scientists agree, is that few of these technologies have moved beyond the experimental stage, and those that have may pose new quandaries. Schemes that depend on biofuels, for example, would – if scaled up sufficiently to make a real dent in CO2 levels – compete with food crops that scientists say must double in the next 30 years to keep up with an expanding world population. “Radical changes will be required,” said Nebojsa Nakicenovic, deputy director of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, a major centre for climate modelling. “And not just technically – to be successful, we need new values and norms,” he told the conference."
"Activists campaigning against airport expansion and climate change have staged a “die-in” flashmob demonstration at Heathrow. Scores of protesters, some wearing dust masks and others decked in banners, lay on the floor in Terminal 2 at the airport on Saturday as bemused passengers looked on.   The protesters read out testimonies from communities affected by climate change, urging those taking flights to think about the impact of their travel arrangements.  A second demonstration was held at nearby Harmondsworth detention centre, where protesters dressed in red lay on the ground and obstructed traffic to highlight the link between climate impacts and migration, while a “picnic” protest was held at Gatwick airport earlier on Saturday. The campaigns were linked to other demonstrations around the world opposing airport expansion, timed to coincide with a UN conference addressing the impact of aviation.  Mary Adams from Reclaim the Power, the activist organisation behind the protest, said: “Expanding airports is completely irresponsible and will bring us out of reach of our own targets to stop climate change.  “This problem isn’t being caused by business or normal families taking a holiday, but by a wealthy elite ‘binge flying’, often to second homes. Yet it’s poorer countries that are the hardest hit by climate change, even though they have done the least to cause the problem. Expanding Heathrow is incompatible with creating a fairer and more equal world.” Ministers are currently considering whether to support the plans for Heathrow or Gatwick, and a decision is expected in the coming weeks."

"The huge annual losses of ice from the Greenland cap are even worse than thought, according to new research which also shows that the melt is not a short-term blip but a long-term trend. The melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely, the oceans would rise by six metres around the world, flooding many of the world’s largest cities.  The new study reveals a more accurate estimate of the ice loss by taking better account of the gradual rise of the entire Greenland landmass. When the ice cap was at its peak 20,000 years ago, its great weight depressed the hot, viscous rocks in the underlying mantle. As ice has been shed since, the island has slowly rebounded upwards. Previous satellite estimates of modern ice losses tried to take this into account, but precise new GPS data showed much of Greenland is rising far more rapidly than thought, up to 12mm a year. This means 19 cubic kilometres more ice is falling into the sea each year, an increase of about 8% on earlier figures. The faster rebound is thought to be the result of hotter, more elastic mantle rocks under eastern Greenland, a remnant from 40m years ago when the island passed over the hot spot that now powers Iceland’s volcanoes. The new work was also able to reconstruct the ice loss from Greenland over millennia and found that the same parts of Greenland - the north-west and south-east - were where most ice is being lost both in the past and today.  This means the rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip, but part of a long-term trend being exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland’s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea. “The fact that we are seeing such a similarity of past and present behaviour suggests we could lose ice in these regions for decades into the future,” said Prof Jonathan Bamber, at the University of Bristol, UK, and one of the international team of scientists who carried out the new study, published in Science Advances. Bamber said the presence of a long-term trend does not mean global warming is not a crucial factor: “One thing we can be certain of is that a warmer atmosphere and a warmer ocean is only going to accelerate this trend.” “The headlines of climate change and melting polar ice are not going to change,” said Dr Christopher Harig, at the University of Arizona, who was not involved in the study. “The new research happening now really speaks to the question: ‘How fast or how much ice can or will melt by the end of the century?’ As we understand more the complexity of the ice sheets, these estimates have tended to go up. In my mind, the time for urgency about climate change [action] really arrived years ago, and it’s past time our policy reflected that urgency.” Dr Pippa Whitehouse, at the University of Durham and also not involved in the new research, said: “This study highlights the powerful insight that GPS measurements can give into past and present ice loss. Using such measurements, this study demonstrates that some of the highest rates of ice loss across Greenland - both in the past and at present - are found in areas where the ice sheet flows directly into the ocean, making it dangerously susceptible to future warming in both the atmosphere and the ocean.” The team behind the new research said better estimates of continental rebound rates could be even more significant in estimates of ice loss from the world’s biggest ice cap, in Antarctica, but that sparse data from the remote continent made analysis difficult. In April, very high temperatures led to a record-breaking early onset of glacier melting in Greenland, while another satellite study in August reaffirmed the rapid loss of ice."
"The actor Leonardo DiCaprio has said he thinks that those who don’t believe in climate change should not hold public office. Speaking at the White House ahead of a screening of his new documentary, Before the Flood, DiCaprio said such rejection indicated an inability to engage with the rational world.  “If you don’t believe in climate change, you don’t believe in facts, and science, and empirical truths,” he said. “And, in my humble opinion, [you] should not be allowed to hold public office.” The words were interpreted as a slight against presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has frequently tweeted his scepticism – despite denying he had made such claims in last week’s presidential debate. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. The film, produced by Martin Scorsese, intends to raise public awareness of climate change. Its director, Fisher Stevens, has said he intends to screen it on college campuses and across swing states, including Florida, where Senator Marco Rubio is up for re-election. “Rubio is a climate change denier, and we want to get these deniers out of Congress, to make them understand the Paris [climate] accords are important and that we need to do more,” Stevens said.  Before the Flood premiered in September at the Toronto film festival, where DiCaprio told the audience: “We cannot afford, at this critical moment in time, to have leaders in office that do not believe in the modern science of climate change.”"
"Government officials have acknowledged that Australia’s 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reductions pledged at Paris in 2015 were made without any modelling to show whether existing policies could achieve those targets. They also admitted the government did not have any modelling revealing when Australia’s emissions would peak.  The admissions, made in a parliamentary committee under questioning from Labor Senator for New South Wales Jenny McAllister, fly in the face of advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, telling the government it had “existing legislation, policies and measures to enable it to achieve” the the reductions. They also follow a string of independent modelling exercises showing current policies will not achieve the emissions reductions committed to in Paris. Last week energy advisory firm RepuTex released modelling showing Australia’s emissions wouldn’t fall much at all between now and 2030, under current policies. When asked about whether Australia would meet targets laid out in the Paris agreement, Patrick Suckling, the Australian ambassador for the environment, responded that the government had said it would meet those targets and its track record showed it met internationally agreed targets. “On the basis of past performance, where we’ve met and exceeded Kyoto 1 and Kyoto 2, that’s the track record,” Suckling said. When pushed on the issue by the committee, Suckling referred further questions to Brad Archer from the international climate change and energy innovation division in the Department of Environment and Energy. Under extended questioning, Archer pointed to various analyses of individual policies but wasn’t able cite any modelling that would have informed government if the current set of policies would achieve the 2030 targets. He said the government was paying polluters to pollute less under the Emissions Reduction Fund. “So we can take into account what is being achieved under the Emissions Reduction Fund.” But he couldn’t identify any analysis that looked at the overall impact of current policies. Archer said: “It’s not the case that we have modelling capacity available on-tap to continually undertake analyses.” At another point he added: “There are inherent challenges in making projections over long periods of time.”  Kushla Munro from the international branch of the Department of Environment and Energy later told the committee that the government’s “latest emissions projections go to 2020” and that 2030 projections were being prepared. When asked by McAllister when Australia’s emissions would peak, Archer said “that’s a very interesting question,” and that modelling done so far didn’t include analysis of current policies.  McAllister told Guardian Australia the Turnbull government needed to “own up and admit that their climate policies just aren’t credible”. “These officials have confirmed Australia’s worst kept secret – that the Turnbull government has no idea how it will meet our 2030 emission reduction targets,” she said. “They can’t say when Australia’s emissions will peak and begin to decline, and they wouldn’t confirm that the government’s current policy settings will see us meet the target without adjustment.”"
"John Rumney says that just a year ago, this particular spot was once the most stunning coral garden on the entire Great Barrier Reef. If a film crew said it wanted to get a cliche shot of the reef with its mind-boggling richness of coral and fish species, this was where he took them. Now he’s taking us there to see the destruction wrought by climate change. He says the fact this reef was used in so many films and magazines means it’s a perfect location to see the effects of the recent bleaching event. He tells us he would regularly describe the location as having “more than 100% coral cover”. “It was growing on top of each other and underneath. It was just magnificent,” says Rumney, a veteran reef tourism operator, who helped pioneer ecotourism on the reef, and is now establishing a privately funded non-profit research enterprise, Great Barrier Reef Legacy. “So we have a great baseline of what it was like. And it was absolutely fantastic,” says Rumney. “So anything that is damaged is directly proportional to this year’s bleaching. It’s not like it’s 50% dead and then you had bleaching so you don’t know what is old and new.”  Much has been written about the devastating global coral bleaching event that has snaked its way around the world since 2014, and which touched 93% of reefs on the Great Barrier Reef this year. Surveys of the full impact suggest the worst impacts were in the remote northern third of the reef, far from where tourists regularly go. While almost a quarter of coral has been killed on the Great Barrier Reef, it has been concentrated in the area north of Port Douglas. Despite that, the effects on this reef just 50km north-east of Port Douglas – the most popular launching point for reef tourism – have been severe. Guardian Australia is here with the Climate Council, which visited this reef at the peak of the bleaching, in May, and has come back now to see how much has recovered. Snorkelling on the outer reef where the water is crystal clear, it’s obvious what a vibrant reef it would have been just a few months ago. While the seafloor is almost completely covered by coral, much of it is dead, covered with algae and starting to lose its structure. There are few of the fish that use coral as cover, but plenty of parrot fish and others that feed on the algae that is starting to cover the reef. Tim Flannery, a prominent conservationist and a Climate Council councillor, visited this reef in May. “The coral wasn’t dead but it was severely damaged,” he says. Although a proper study would be needed to make a full estimate of how much was bleached back then, Rumney and Flannery say it was in the order of 80% to 90%. As would be expected in all but the most extreme marine heatwaves, most of the coral found bleached in May recovered.  Coral bleaches when the water around it is too warm for too long. The coral polyps get stressed and spit out the algae that lives inside it. Without the colourful algae, the coral flesh becomes transparent, revealing the stark white skeleton beneath. Because the algae provides the coral with 90% of its energy, it begins to starve. Unless the ocean temperature return to normal within a month or two, the coral dies and gets taken over by a blanket of seaweed. Now, upon Flannery’s return, the state of this particular reef has advanced to the point where it appears about 30% of the coral has died. Emerging from the water, Lesley Hughes, another of the Climate Council’s councillors and an ecologist from Macquarie University, says it’s distressing to see so much death on the reef. Alongside the dead coral and algae, there appears to be an outbreak of the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish. Under dead, broken coral, groups of starfish congregate, munching on the remaining live coral. “So all up it’s a pretty depressing site down there actually,” Hughes says. The bleaching event was caused by unusually warm water. It was spurred on by El Niño, but the unprecedented level of heat was a clear sign the primary cause was global warming. “You’d be easily fooled into thinking this was some sort of natural event,” says Flannery. “But it has been caused by people. It’s the burden of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere causing these unprecedented underwater heatwaves that these ecosystems have just never experienced before and just have no capacity to absorb. The coral just dies.” For Flannery, the dead coral is a stark reminder of the well-known response that is needed to climate change. “If it was up to me and I was the Australian government looking at the loss of this asset, I would be announcing a plan to close down all of our coal-fired power plants over a given period of time, shift to clean energy, and do whatever it takes in the transport sector and so forth to make that transition,” he says. “And then go to the international community and say ‘look, this global asset is in real danger, here’s what we’ve done to try and secure it, please join us to do your bit as well’.” To head back to Port Douglas from the outer reef, we weave through the ribbons of reef that link together for hundreds of kilometres along the Queensland coast. As we approach the shore, a ship in the distance gets larger and larger and we slowly realise it’s a coal tanker. Having collected its coal from one of the ports that dot the Great Barrier Reef, it’s delivering it to somewhere in the world – perhaps India or China – where it will be burned, create more greenhouse gases and further warm the atmosphere, making the next coral bleaching more likely.  • Michael Slezak and Josh Wall were guests of the Climate Council"
"The UK’s world-leading Climate Change Act has been “dangerously neglected”, leaving the government open to lawsuits. That is the view of environmental lawyers at Client Earth, in a report published on Tuesday.  Climate minister Nick Hurd disagreed, saying that an emissions reduction plan due out in the first quarter of 2017 would put the country on track to meet its targets. “Any talk of a legal challenge is very premature,” he told Climate Home on the sidelines of a conference organised by Chatham House in London. Hurd affirmed his commitment to meeting climate goals “in the most cost-effective way”, aligning with an industrial strategy also under development in his department. Yet he offered scant policy detail. At issue is the legislation inked in 2008, which binds the UK to a series of “carbon budgets” that will reduce its emissions 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. The targets are “as credible as any legal target could realistically be,” the Client Earth report states. But it warns that inconsistent policymaking has opened up a sizeable gap between ambition and action. While coal plant closures and renewable energy growth are bending the emissions curve in line with goals to 2022, beyond that point the trajectory is unclear. Five years ago, the government calculated the shortfall for 2023-27 at 187 million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to a year’s worth of emissions from Vietnam. It has not corrected course since, according to Client Earth. Jonathan Church, lawyer at the NGO, said: “A policy and reporting reset is essential if we are to hit emissions targets. We can’t afford to drift for the next five years – as we have done for the last five years – without proper climate policies and progress. “With its new Carbon Plan, the government has the chance to make the Act a living law and put the UK on the path to a clean, green energy future.” Hurd’s opposite number in the Labour Party, Barry Gardiner, endorsed the report. “This government has talked up its commitment to climate change but has utterly failed to meet its statutory climate obligations,” he said. “Their incoherent policymaking is sending deeply confusing signals to investors, and risks creating a costly, disruptive transition to the low-carbon economy we need. “We will not allow government to publicly sign up to long term targets but totally fail to set out the necessary delivery plans that are required by law to achieve them.”"
"He struggled through the frozen wastes of North America in his Oscar-winning performance in The Revenant. Now Leonardo DiCaprio is starring in a different role – taking his powerful new eco-documentary to the White House, in the hope it can help restart President Obama’s battle against global warming. It’s an issue of importance to both men. Obama, who appears in the documentary, Before the Flood, is using the last days of his presidency to make environmental protection a central pillar of his legacy. Last month he created the world’s largest ecologically protected area when he expanded Papahānaumokuākea, a marine reserve in his native Hawaii, to encompass more than half a million square miles. He also gave “marine national monument” status to 4,913 sq miles off the New England coast.  Two years ago, DiCaprio – who has raised money for protecting tigers, orangutans and elephants – was designated a UN messenger of peace, with a special focus on climate change. The White House screening of Before the Flood, which follows DiCaprio as he travels to parts of the world including Greenland, the Pacific islands, Sumatra and industrial regions of China, precedes a global release via National Geographic later this month. DiCaprio and the film’s director, Fisher Stevens, hope to use it in the run-up to next month’s US presidential and Senate elections. They plan to show the film on college campuses and across swing states, including Florida, where Senator Marco Rubio is up for re-election. “Rubio is a climate change denier, and we want to get these deniers out of Congress, to make them understand the Paris [climate] accords are important and that we need to do more,” Stevens said. The film-makers claim 38 US senators accept money from the energy industry, in effect blocking the passage of environmental legislation. “These people are not necessarily climate deniers. They’re just in the pockets of the energy industry, even though that’s at the expense of all of us,” said Fisher. “And [Republican presidential candidate] Donald Trump has said he’s going to try to kill the Paris accords if elected.” Last month DiCaprio told the audience after the film’s world premiere at the Toronto international film festival: “We cannot afford, at this critical moment in time, to have leaders in office that do not believe in the modern science of climate change.” Before the Flood’s release comes as statistics relating to the health of the planet worsen. Last week the Scripps Institution of Oceanography announced it was safe to conclude that global CO2 levels will not drop below 400 parts per million this year – “or ever again for the indefinite future”. The figure is seen as the point at which global warming becomes irreversible. DiCaprio and Stevens came up with the idea to make the documentary while in the Galápagos islands with the oceanographer Sylvia Earle. “We were frustrated with our government, and I felt if the media isn’t getting to the population about climate change, maybe Leonardo can,” said Stevens. “So the message is, it’s up to all of us. It’s a simplistic message but it really is.” Despite the intransigence of US legislators, Obama is using his last months in office to establish his legacy as the most environmentally effective president since Theodore Roosevelt created national parks. In Obama’s reading of the issue, climate change is as much a national security issue as an environmental one. He tells the film-makers: “In addition to the sadness I’d feel if my kids can never see a glacier the way I did in Alaska, even if you were unsentimental about that, you’ve got to be worried about national security and the capacity of the world order to survive the kinds of strains climate scientists are predicting.” Sixty-one countries, including China and the US, representing about 48% of global emissions, have adopted the Paris accords. Countries representing at least 55% of emissions have to adopt the accords for them to be ratified. The film-makers visit Pope Francis in the Vatican, Obama in Washington, political leaders in the Pacific islands of Vanuatu and Kiribati, climate scientists in Greenland and the Indian conservationist Sunita Narain, who explains to DiCaprio that access to energy is as much an issue as climate change for 300 million Indians. “I’m sorry to say this to you, as an American, but your consumption is really going to put a hole in the planet,” Narain tells DiCaprio. “We need to put the issue of lifestyle and consumption at the centre of climate negotiations. ” DiCaprio responds that it’s difficult to present to Americans the argument that they need to change their lifestyle. “I would also argue that it’s probably not going to happen,” he says. If the climate crisis is to be solved, it will be because “renewables will become cheaper the more we invest into them, and that will solve the problem”. But Narain shakes her head. The film-makers have enlisteded Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, the pair behind the The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, for the soundtrack. They use Hieronymus Bosch’s triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights – which made a strong impression on the young DiCaprio – to frame the progress of humankind’s impact on the planet, from innocence to Bosch’s final panel of darkness and ruin. How far off are we now, they wonder? “What haunts me is the last panel, with the planet in ruins, charred and blackened skies,” DiCaprio muses. “If this was a movie we could write our way out of this mess, but real life isn’t a movie and we can’t pretend we know how this is going to end.” He adds: “What we can do is control what we do next, how we live our lives, what we consume – and how we vote, to let our leaders know that we know the truth.” One passage of the documentary takes place during the filming of The Revenant, when director Alejandro González Iñárritu was forced to move production 9,000 miles from a snow-free Canadian location to Argentina in search of a snowy landscape."

"The transition to a low carbon economy is already happening … in the Australian Capital Territory, where the local Labor government has legislated for a 100% renewable energy target by the year 2020.  But this major achievement is at risk on Saturday when residents of Canberra go to the polls for territory elections.   Renewable energy is incredibly popular in Canberra. Eight in 10 Canberrans support the 100% renewable energy target, and the city has one of the highest domestic installation bases (per capita) of rooftop solar. The reverse auctions that the ACT Labor-Green government used to achieve this target have helped create more than 510 jobs in the renewable energy sector (that’s in the ACT alone – more have been created in other states where the wind farms are located), most of which are high-tech, high wage, and high skilled. That represents a 400% growth of renewable jobs in just five years, which is six times faster than any other state or territory in Australia. With such high levels of popularity, it is remarkable that the conservative opposition party, the Liberals, has for years opposed expansion of renewable energy.  In 2014 the Canberra Liberals complained about the “ugly impact” of the renewable energy target. In 2015, they called the target “unfair”. In April this year, they said the 100% target was “too much, too fast”.  Renewable energy targets have been put back on the political agenda following the blackout in South Australia. Federal Liberal and National party politicians hit the airwaves without waiting for power to be restored to blame renewable energy for the blackout.  Climate deniers, fossil fuel lobbyists and conservative politicians have spent the past fortnight tub-thumping for the end of state-based renewable energy targets and a halt to the expansion of new renewable energy construction.  We’ve already seen the impact of this kind of scare campaign.  The anti-renewable energy policies of the Abbott government, and then the Turnbull government, put investment in renewables at risk over the past few years. By fuelling doubt about the renewable energy target, even threatening to repeal it, large-scale renewable’s investors were scared off.  This is important because the renewable energy industry is a big employer with the potential to be even bigger. The solar industry already employs more people than coal-fired generation across the country. In 2014 the solar industry employed more than 13,000 people and even with the uncertainty and watering down of the renewable energy target this is likely to have grown. By comparison, according to the 2011 census 8,000 people worked in fossil fuel electricity generation. Sadly, fossil fuel companies around Australia are betraying the workers who have kept old coal-fired power stations running for decades, with several stations abruptly shut down and the workers abandoned. This underscores the importance of governments committed to a just transition that respects working people and their communities. Across the world the trend is clear. For the last six years in a row renewables outpaced fossil fuels in net investment and capacity additions. New large-scale renewable installations totalled US$286bn in 2016. When the Abbott government announced in 2014 that it wanted to scrap the renewable energy target, no new wind farms were constructed for 16 months because of the policy uncertainty.  It was the ACT’s renewable energy target that ended this drought and helped save renewable investment in Australia. With the federal Coalition government again demonising renewables, the states and territories, including the ACT, have stepped in with local targets.  It was a bizarre spectacle and deeply damaging to his credibility for the prime minister to use a natural disaster to mount a political attack against state-based renewable energy targets. It was even more unseemly that both the prime minister and the energy minister were politicising the natural disaster while it was still happening.  With no evidence, Turnbull and his conservative cheer squad linked the successful South Australian uptake of renewable energy and the blackout. He also took a direct swipe at the Queensland and Victorian renewable energy targets. This is a very different Malcolm Turnbull than the one that said in 2009 that “I will not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am.” Since taking the prime ministership in 2015 he has adopted almost every policy position of his predecessor Tony Abbott.  After spending the past decade condemning, opposing and voting against the ACT’s renewable energy target, the Canberra Liberals have had a, literally, unbelievable conversion.  Facing an election where their only major election promise is to rip up contracts to build a solar-powered tram, the Canberra Liberals claim they now support, after years of opposing, renewables. Not once in the past several years has any elected ACT Liberal opposed their federal colleagues extreme position on renewables, or publicly support action on climate change. It is important to remember that in 2013 the Abbott Liberals supported the renewable energy target. Before the election, they stated they would make no change to the policy. Things turned out very different post-election. Renewable energy targets are a very effective way to increase the uptake of renewable energy but they require a government that is committed to achieving them. Without that commitment it is too easy for a government – which after Saturday’s ACT election could be run by a party that spent a decade opposed to renewables – to backslide. The uncertainty that would be created for the renewables sector in Canberra, if the Liberals were elected, would be deeply damaging. The ACT renewable energy target requires a government with a genuine commitment to tackling climate change. It needs a government that has a vision for a clean energy city. It needs a government that understands important, but complicated, policy looks like reverse auctions. And it needs a government with ministers who genuinely want to see us transition to a cleaner, low carbon economy and city.  The future security of 510 renewable energy jobs in Canberra rest on the outcome of the election this Saturday."
"More than 50 prominent scientists, campaigners and politicians have signed a letter calling on the Science Museum to drop its oil sponsorship.  Despite choosing not to renew its previous sponsorship deal with Shell following criticism and campaigning, the Science Museum decided to accept sponsorship from Statoil, a Norwegian multinational oil and gas company, for its revamped children’s gallery, which the letter’s signatories describe as an “unconscionable” decision.   The museum, which has been free to visitors since 2001, is also to charge admission for Wonderlab: the Statoil gallery, the new interactive gallery for children, which opens on Wednesday and replaces the popular Launchpad gallery.  The signatories of the letter, published in the Guardian on Monday, include Caroline Lucas MP, the co-leader of the Green party; Bill McKibben, the co-founder of 350.org; Douglas Parr, the chief scientist of Greenpeace UK; and Jonathan Oppenheim, a Royal Society university research fellow at University College London. They take issue with both the decision to charge for a gallery aimed at children and the sponsorship deal with Statoil.  The letter urges the museum to drop its entry charge, which the signatories say denies those from less privileged backgrounds the opportunity to attend and be excited about science and renewable energies, and its “unethical” sponsorship.  It reads: “It is unconscionable that in 2016 a museum of science is handing a fossil fuel company legitimacy by allowing it to sponsor a gallery designed to inspire the next generation.”  Referring to the entry charge, which would be £22.50 for a family of four, the letter says: “It is unacceptable for the Science Museum and Statoil to make future generations pick up the bill for their ill-made decisions.”  Lucas said: “By allowing them to sponsor this exhibition, the Science Museum is handing legitimacy to a firm that risks our planet’s future through its plans for further fossil fuel exploration.  “Statoil’s own business plan runs counter to the overwhelming scientific evidence which points to the fact that we must leave the vast majority of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground to avoid catastrophic climate change. “I’m supporting this campaign to kick big oil out of one of Britain’s most treasured museums and also calling on the Science Museum to make this exhibition free so everyone can access it.”  The children’s gallery is one of the Science Museum’s largest and most popular exhibitions, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. The £6m renovation, which has included making the gallery 60% larger, will feature interactive exhibits, live demonstrations and “an explainer-led experience [that] will reveal the beauty and wonder” in the science and mathematics that shape our lives.  Ian Blatchford, the director of the Science Museum, said: “We’ve already taken 30,000 bookings for school children to visit this extraordinary interactive gallery for free and our goal is to welcome 200,000 schoolchildren annually. That will mean twice as many of our most diverse and representative group of visitors enjoying this inspirational space for free as our previous interactive gallery could accommodate.  “We’re fortunate that our sponsors share our huge ambition for this £6m gallery and support our mission to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.”"
"Scottish ministers have banned the use of a technique to extract methane by burning underground coal beds, after expert advice said it posed too many risks to the climate and environment. Paul Wheelhouse, the Scottish environment minister, said he was asking ministers in London to revoke six licences to find test sites for the technique, known as underground coal gasification (UGC), in central and south-west Scotland.  He said an expert report from Prof Campbell Gemmell, former chief executive of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, had found it was unproven, under-regulated and too risky to be approved. Wheelhouse said the infant industry had a history of pollution accidents and “loss of containment issues” at test sites in other countries, but added that the ban could be lifted if it proved safe in future.  To the delight of environment campaigners, Wheelhouse said: “It is the Scottish government’s view that UGC poses numerous and serious environmental risks and, on that basis, the Scottish government cannot support this technology. Accordingly, UCG will have no place in Scotland’s energy mix at this time.” Environmentalists believe the Scottish ban will add pressure on UK ministers to ban or postpone possible UCG projects in England, despite giving the go-ahead on Thursday to the UK’s biggest fracking site yet, on the Fylde in Lancashire. Scottish ministers are still wrestling with their policy on fracking, repeatedly delaying a final decision in the face of strong industry pressure to support it after divisions emerged within the cabinet over its potential value to Scotland’s ailing economy and energy industries. Scotland has had a moratorium on commercial fracking and coalbed methane drilling since January 2015, and Wheelhouse said on Thursday he would publish a set of scientific papers on fracking and open up a public consultation later this autumn.  Scotland had been at the forefront of attempts in the UK by several energy companies and some academics to develop UCG because of its extensive network of rich coal seams under land and the Firth of Forth near Edinburgh and Solway Firth north of Carlisle. The technique involves chemically igniting coal seams, under controlled conditions, and then capturing the released methane-rich gases at ground level before processing the gases. Those could feed chemicals plants and power stations, they said, adding to the UK’s domestic energy mix.  Developers promised that excess carbon dioxide would be buried offshore in carbon capture and storage sites; some claimed the technology promised a bonanza for the unconventional gas industry, with sites eventually being exploited far offshore in the Atlantic or in the North Sea. The European commission has invested tens of millions of euros in UCG research projects. Unlike fracking, UGC technology is still untested, very costly and years away from approval by UK regulators, making the Scottish government’s decision to ban it relatively easy. One of the two developers, Five Quarter, recently went into receivership. There are no carbon capture and storage sites yet in operation in the UK, and no evidence that carbon capture would be cost effective, undermining the business case for UGC.  Environmental campaigners were jubilant following Wheelhouse’s announcement. Friends of the Earth Scotland (FoES) pointed to a case in Queensland, Australia, where developers of one test site, Linc Energy, are now being prosecuted after contamination and leaks into the environment. Mary Church, head of campaigns with FoES, said: “This is a victory for people power. Setting coal seams alight under two of our major firths was always a reckless idea.  “The history of UCG is littered with contamination incidents, ground subsidence and industrial accidents. [We] look forward to the Scottish government acting swiftly to ban shale gas fracking and coalbed methane drilling once it has finished its review.” Andrew Nunn, the chief operating officer for the most active UCG developer, Cluff Natural Resources, which has three development licences in Scotland, said the country would now miss out. He said regulations to control the industry could easily have been introduced.  “It is obviously disappointing that the Scottish government has decided not to trust its own regulators and world-class engineering and scientific resource base to ensure that a UCG industry could be developed under the rigorous scrutiny of a fit for purpose regulatory regime,” he said.  “We have no doubt that UCG will be developed elsewhere in the world and the opportunity for Scotland to benefit from first mover advantage will have been lost.”"

"In the centuries to come, history books will likely look back on September 2016 as a major milestone for the world’s climate. At a time when atmospheric carbon dioxide is usually at its minimum, the monthly value failed to drop below 400 parts per million (ppm). That all but ensures that 2016 will be the year that carbon dioxide officially passed the symbolic 400 ppm mark, never to return below it in our lifetimes, according to scientists. Because carbon pollution has been increasing since the start of the industrial revolution and has shown no signs of abating, it was more a question of “when” rather than “if” we would cross this threshold. The inevitability doesn’t make it any less significant, though. September is usually the month when carbon dioxide is at its lowest after a summer of plants growing and sucking it up in the northern hemisphere. As fall wears on, those plants lose their leaves, which in turn decompose, releasing the stored carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. At Mauna Loa Observatory, the world’s marquee site for monitoring carbon dioxide, there are signs that the process has begun but levels have remained above 400 ppm. Since the industrial revolution, humans have been altering this process by adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than plants can take up. That’s driven carbon dioxide levels higher and with it, global temperatures, along with a host of other climate change impacts. “Is it possible that October 2016 will yield a lower monthly value than September and dip below 400 ppm? Almost impossible,” Ralph Keeling, the scientist who runs the Scripps Institute for Oceanography’s carbon dioxide monitoring program, wrote in a blog post. “Brief excursions toward lower values are still possible, but it already seems safe to conclude that we won’t be seeing a monthly value below 400 ppm this year – or ever again for the indefinite future.” We may get a day or two reprieve in the next month, similar to August when Tropical Storm Madeline blew by Hawaii and knocked carbon dioxide below 400 ppm for a day. But otherwise, we’re living in a 400 ppm world. Even if the world stopped emitting carbon dioxide tomorrow, what has already put in the atmosphere will linger for many decades to come. “At best (in that scenario), one might expect a balance in the near term and so CO2 levels probably wouldn’t change much – but would start to fall off in a decade or so,” Gavin Schmidt, Nasa’s chief climate scientist, said in an email. “In my opinion, we won’t ever see a month below 400 ppm.” The carbon dioxide we’ve already committed to the atmosphere has warmed the world about 1.8F since the start of the industrial revolution. This year, in addition to marking the start of our new 400 ppm world, is also set to be thehottest year on record. The planet has edged right up against the 1.5C (2.7F) warming threshold, a key metric in last year’s Paris climate agreement. Even though there are some hopeful signs that world leaders will take actions to reduce emissions, those actions will have to happen on an accelerating timetable in order to avoid 2C of warming. That’s the level outlined by policymakers as a safe threshold for climate change. And even if the world limits warming to that benchmark, it will still likely spell doom for low-lying small island states and have serious repercussions around the world, from more extreme heat waves to droughts, coastal flooding and the extinction of many coral reefs. It’s against this backdrop that the measurements on top of Mauna Loa take on added importance. They’re a reminder that with each passing day, we’re moving further from the climate humans have known and thrived in and closer to a more unstable future."
"An “ecological love story” is not a common genre, but this is how Susie Greenhill, winner of this year’s Richell prize, sees her novel The Clinking.  Greenhill, who was also longlisted for last year’s Richell prize, stood out among 428 entries in the second year of the award, which is offered to Australian writers who have not yet published a book.   A partnership between Guardian Australia, the Emerging writers’ festival and Hachette Australia, the prize is judged blind and includes $10,000 in prize money, a mentorship and a publication option with Hachette. Michaela McGuire, a judge of the prize and the director of the Emerging writers’ festival, described Greenhill’s writing as “electric, and profoundly affecting”. The Clinking explores themes of extinction, grief and interconnection against the backdrop of a warming climate, through the eyes of a scientist watching “the world he loves and knows intimately disappearing around him”.  Greenhill told Guardian Australia: “I feel like there are a lot of voices that don’t get heard adequately and right now one of those is the natural world.” Greenhill, 43, from Randalls Bay in Tasmania, said she didn’t start writing seriously until her mid 30s. While her writing skills were honed during a period of extensive travel in which she wrote copious letters to family and friends, the real catalyst was an experience during a creative writing workshop. “I read a piece to the people in the workshop and it just felt like I’d communicated for the first time,” she said. “That was quite a pivotal moment, so I decided to explore what would happen if I started finishing pieces and sending them out.”  Her first published work was in the Tasmanian literary journal, Island. She credits the Tasmanian literary community, particularly emerging writers and editors, with key support during the early stages of her writing career.  Greenhill recently completed her PhD at Edith Cowan University in which she explored similar environmental themes through a collection of short stories. She says the “financial breathing space” provided by the award will be immensely helpful, but is still very much surprised by her win.  “It’s a beautiful opportunity,” Greenhill said, accepting the award. “I hope I can create something that would make [Matt Richell] proud. I am totally overwhelmed.” Also making the shortlist for this year’s prize were Andrea Baldwin’s The Illusion of Islands, which examines a family’s attempt to save the loggerhead turtle from extinction; Emma Doolan’s psychological thriller Dark Tides; Sophie Overett’s story The Rabbits, about family secrets, art and loneliness; and Susie Thatcher’s literary mystery Gardens of Stone. The Richell prize was initiated last year in honour of Hachette publisher Matt Richell who died unexpectedly in 2014. This year’s judges included McGuire, senior editor at Guardian Australia Lucy Clark, bookseller Karen Ferris and Hachette publisher Vanessa Radnidge."
"Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, will lead an energy security review determining whether the national electricity market can deliver reliable base load power while meeting Australia’s climate change commitments. Energy ministers held an emergency meeting on Friday and agreed to hold the independent review, which will deliver its preliminary findings in December.  The communique issued after the meeting says the review will take stock of the current state of the security and reliability of the national electricity market and provide advice to governments on a “coordinated, national reform blueprint”. “In light of this body of work, the Australian government’s commitment at Paris and the integration of climate and energy policy at the federal level, the blueprint will outline national policy, legislative, governance and rule changes required to maintain the security, reliability, affordability and sustainability of the national electricity market,” it says. The federal government evidently sees the review as a mechanism to pressure the states to wind back their renewable energy targets. In a statement issued after Friday’s meeting, the federal energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the agreement to hold the review meant that ministers had agreed that “energy security, reliability and affordability is their primary responsibility”. He said regulators had briefed Friday’s meeting that there were “broader issues” about the reliability of the system as a result of the higher uptake of intermittent power, particularly wind and solar, and the flow-on impact on to interconnectors. “We actually heard at this meeting from the Australian Energy Market Commission that the state-based targets do raise serious questions about the efficiency, the cost and location of investment decisions,” Frydenberg said. “That work is still under way.” But South Australia evidently sees the review as a means of building an evidence base and support across Coag for a form of carbon trading for the electricity sector. The South Australian energy minister, Tom Koutsantonis, told the ABC after the meeting he had raised the issue of an emissions intensity scheme during Friday’s meeting, and he intended to build the case for a sectoral baseline and credit scheme as a mechanism for forcing an orderly transition in the national energy market from coal to gas and renewables. He said there was a lot of support for the proposal in Coag, and that in pursuing the emissions intensity scheme, South Australia was only supporting a policy that Malcolm Turnbull had himself supported in 2009. Frydenberg continued on Friday to dead bat questions about whether Canberra would countenance a trading scheme for the electricity sector, or push the federal renewable energy target out beyond 2020 as a means of allowing the states to step back from their schemes. “I’m not going to pre-judge the outcome of our 2017 review [of Direct Action],” he said. The prime minister sought the one-off meeting of energy ministers following the storms that caused a statewide blackout in South Australia last week. Turnbull had linked the SA blackout explicitly to the state’s use of renewable energy, calling it a “wake-up call” for state leaders who were trying to hit “completely unrealistic” renewable targets. Friday’s communique, on the basis of a preliminary report from the Australian Energy Market Operator, said the cause of the blackout was the weather event, resulting in multiple transmission failures, including the loss of three big 275 kV transmission lines north of Adelaide. The prime minister’s rhetoric triggered a furious backlash among the states and a fresh outbreak of toxic climate change politics after a period of relative calm, prompting a coalition of business and energy groups to call for cool heads and bipartisan cooperation in advance of Friday’s meeting. On Friday, Turnbull continued to face off against the states, describing ambitious renewable energy targets as “heroic” and “very much a Labor obsession”. “South Australia is one that has achieved a very high level of renewable energy. If you look at Queensland, where they are currently at about 4%, they say they’re going to get, by 2030, to 50%. Well how on earth is that going to happen?” the prime minister said. “Ditto, similar targets in Victoria. They set these targets and rather than planning for energy security, they just treat it as an assumption. They assume that they can change the composition of the energy mix and that energy security will always be there and the lights will stay on. That has been brought into question.” Frydenberg was more measured, saying that after the talks the government would like to see “great harmonisation” with renewable energy targets and a “truly national system” – but he also acknowledged that the review process he had set in train was a Coag process, and he said the states were not budging. The communique noted “the importance of integrating energy and climate policy at the federal level and the federal government’s commitment to the Paris targets”. At Friday’s meeting, Koutsantonis also reached agreement with his New South Wales counterpart Anthony Roberts to develop a new interconnector between the two states to increase stability in the system."
"Food, clothing, electrical goods, energy – everything we consume has a hidden water footprint. So how can businesses cut water consumption and reduce the footprints of their products? We brought together six experts to debate the question. Here’s what we learned.  [There] is a lack of appreciation of the value of water – or it is taken for granted – and the scarce resource is then being wasted. When this happens, says André Fourie, head of water security and environmental value at SABMiller, it leads to an underinvestment in water infrastructure and services, especially those dealing with wastewater and pollution. If you don’t measure, you can’t manage. This point was made by Dexter Galvin, head of the supply chain programme at CDP. Galvin admits it may sound obvious, but the basics of water accounting – from withdrawals, to usage, to discharge – are key for companies.  While water auditing and monitoring are essential first steps when identifying water use, it’s vital to distinguish between direct and indirect water use. Direct water use can be simply and efficiently measured in-house. Indirect water usage is harder since it extends beyond the company fences. The experts recommend using existing tools to help with this, such as the WRAP Rippleffect programme. In addition, Galvin says the very process of gathering data from suppliers, through a global standard like CDP, leads to better management. Getting farmers engaged was key for our Spanish strawberry project. Without their involvement we had nothing – no access to data and no farms to trial new practices.  These are the words of Jessica Sansom, head of sustainability at Innocent Drinks. The company’s app helped Spain’s strawberry farmers slash their water use by up to 40%.  Sansom says they started with a small group of farmers before scaling up the project once they had more conclusive evidence that it worked. It was crucial that Innocent addressed the wider impact of water reduction on the strawberry farmers’ livelihoods, which meant they had to consider how to reduce water consumption in a way that was low cost, and that also retained the same yields and quality.  The panel also discussed financial incentives and educational support as other ways to help engage suppliers.  Aaron Burton, the director of projects and programmes at Waterwise, predicts that adopting new technologies will be key to helping companies reduce water consumption:  smart metering and big data can help organisations from SMEs to large corporations better understand and manage water use. Water companies can play a role in trialling and demonstrating innovative technologies, says Burton. For example, a Thames Water trial (pdf) at its offices in Reading saw the company replace its duel-flush toilets, taps and urinals with water efficient equivalents, enabling an 83% reduction in water use. The company calculated that were all the bathrooms in the office block refurbished in the same way, it could save 4.8m litres of water and £9,950 in water costs per year.  Unless the top level management in any business sees the business case to act, it is not going to happen. Understanding water related risk is key to ensuring internal buy-in, says Ashok Chapagain, science director of the Water Footprint Network.  There are three kinds: the physical risk of not getting the quality or quantity of water required for current operations or for future expansion; the regulatory risk arising from changes in legislation in the region; and the reputational risk arising from not managing water use responsibly. A collaborative approach is key. A company can take steps to reduce its water use in a specific watershed, says Eliza Roberts, manager of the water programme of Ceres, but if it doesn’t work collaboratively with other companies and stakeholders then it may not succeed in mitigating the risks it is exposed to in that watershed Sansom agrees:  Partnership is absolutely key. Our project in Spain is now a collaboration [between] more than 15 companies, research organisations and NGOs. Working in isolation is pointless."
"Wednesday was a historic day for the climate. No, not another record-breaking hottest month. Not another devastating hurricane. For once, it was a good day.  Wednesday was the day enough countries – representing more than 55% of global carbon emissions – ratified the Paris agreement on climate change for the treaty to enter force.   A weary world, weighed down by Syria, Brexit and American presidential elections must wonder if fancy words like “ratification” actually mean anything. The answer is unequivocally “yes”. This treaty sets us on an irreversible trajectory on which all investment, all regulation and all industrial strategy must start to align with a global economy powered by 100% clean energy. So dramatic is this change of direction that, as of last December, more than 500 global institutions with assets in excess of $3.4 trillion had committed to divest themselves from the fossil-fuelled extractive industries of the past. Government policies globally are now aligned with real-world market forces pushing forward the next great industrial revolution: the clean low-carbon revolution that will transform how we power our lives. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, and the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg have set about transforming the global company reporting system so that it takes account of climate change risks. Financial decision-makers at every level are recognising that fossil fuel investments risk their returns being undermined by stranded assets. They recognise that supply chains face disruption from the effects of climate change. Carney warned just last month that to minimise the risk to financial stability the transition away from high- carbon industries should begin early and follow a predictable path to help markets anticipate the central element of the Paris agreement: a net zero-carbon economy by the second half of this century. A disorderly transition would result in financial shocks that would make 2008 seem no more than a blip To achieve the central goal at the heart of the Paris agreement, of creating a net zero-carbon economy by the second half of this century, we need an orderly, managed transition that minimises risks and allows us to seize the opportunities created by the new jobs and investment in clean industries that will increasingly drive our economies. Binding international law provides a solid bulwark against even the most unexpected political events – just think of Brexit or a Trump presidency. The involvement of city governments, investors and the private capital markets is making the progress to a clean future impossible to roll back. Latest figures from Office for National Statistics show that Britain’s low-carbon businesses generate a total annual turnover of £46.2bn for the economy and employ nearly a quarter of a million people. The growth in the low-carbon sector of the UK economy is now outpacing the growth rate of the economy as a whole, and has grown by almost 30% in the past three years. Of course, maintaining this level of growth requires clear signals from politicians – not the Tory stop-start decisions that have thrown renewable industries into chaos and energy investors into despair. A shale gas infrastructure would require a return on capital over 30 to 35 years. Quite simply this means that shale gas is an expensive detour the UK can ill-afford to take. That is why last week I announced that the next Labour government will ban fracking, and why community secretary Sajid Javid’s decision this week to overturn 18,000 local objections and clear the way for fracking in Lancashire is a colossal mistake. Gas will play an important transitional role in the UK’s energy supply over the next 15 years. But energy efficiency in domestic heating and the decarbonisation of our power supply by 2030 will see demand for it fall by 26%.  We need to be investing in the low-carbon technologies that are creating the apprenticeships and skilled jobs of the future. Wednesday’s ratification of the Paris agreement makes business as usual impossible. We are in a different world now."
"Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, has spoken out in defence of the recent Climate Change Authority (CCA) review on how to meet the nation’s obligations under the Paris agreement, which was criticised by two members of the authority. Guardian Australia revealed this month that the economist Clive Hamilton and the climate scientist David Karoly wrote a dissenting report. They argued the official report privileged “political feasibility” over environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency, resulting in a “dog’s breakfast” of policies.  The official CCA report delivered recommendations on how to meet Australia’s 2030 targets of 26% to 28% below 2005 levels.  But many commentators have pointed out that those targets were not consistent with Australia’s legal obligation under the Paris agreement, which is to keep temperatures “well below” 2C of warming. Karoly and Hamilton argued the official report therefore failed to respond to its terms of reference. They produced their own recommendations, which included adopting a “carbon budget” approach to setting climate policy, reflecting the agreement made in Paris to stay “well below” 2C. In a speech to the International Network for Government Science Advice conference in Brussels on Thursday, Finkel – himself a member of the authority – spoke out about the debate for the first time. He criticised “clickbait” media reporting on the issue and defended the official report, arguing it was not written in a “perfect world” and rejecting the dissenting members’ view of the terms of reference. Finkel said: “In a perfect world, we might have been asked how to transform the country to 24/7 near-zero emissions energy – as soon as possible. “But that’s beside the point. When you are asked for advice, you look at the question and you commit to the process if you believe that you can answer that question in a helpful way. “The report that the CCA delivered answers to that brief. And I believe it does so in a manner that is not just deeply considered and evidence-based, but clever.”  Finkel argued the response to the report was based on uninformed opinions of people who had not read it. “When people actually read the report – rather than responding to the hasty judgments of others in clickbait headlines – they were genuinely impressed,” he said. “But there’s the rub – reading a long report takes time. Reflecting on it takes effort. It’s not surprising that the initial response was to cover the imagined politics of the CCA, not the substance of its report. It is deeply regrettable that the spotlight was gone before the more considered commentators had their chance to respond.” The official report recommended an emissions intensity scheme for the electricity sector, a strengthening of the “safeguard” mechanism in the Coalition’s direct action policy and regulations to cover vehicle emissions. “I welcome the CCA’s efforts to bring the focus back to where it should be: what can we do today that is affordable, reliable and delivers on the commitments we made in Paris,” Finkel said.  The Climate Council, the Greens, other climate groups and experts, including the ANU’s Frank Jotzo, also criticised the official report. Jotzo said the majority report was “piecemeal and lacks a vision for the longer-term policy framework needed to get Australia on track to a low-carbon economy”.  “The intent clearly is to help policy progress in the medium term,” he said. “But it risks locking in a policy suite that will not deliver much, or may cost too much. “If the CCA’s recommendations are misconstrued as being ambitious, we could end up with policy that falls far short of these recommendations. And if its political judgments are off the mark, the CCA’s specific recommendations could become an obstacle for the government’s 2017 policy review.” Finkel encouraged the public to read the summary of the official CCA report themselves. "
"Coffee farmers in Peru suffered heavy losses in 2013 when 40% of the country’s coffee plantations were adversely affected by coffee leaf rust. The disease, which scientists blamed on climate change, damaged leaves and slowed coffee cherry growth, resulting in smaller, lower quality yields.  The risks posed by climate change are not limited to coffee. In developing countries, nearly two thirds of the extremely poor earn a living from agriculture. They are on the frontline in the fight against climate change, yet they often lack the finance and knowledge to withstand its effects. This can prove devastating to their livelihoods. So what can be done to address this poverty imbalance and empower smallholder farmers? This was the question posed at a recent Guardian Sustainable Business seminar, supported by social impact investor Oikocredit and chaired by broadcaster and Guardian journalist Lucy Siegle.  Lebi Hudson, general manager at the Rungwe Smallholders Tea Association in Tanzania, said climate change is already having a direct impact on the association’s 15,000 members. Growers have experienced reduced yields in recent years due to extreme weather, including prolonged droughts.  The impacts extend to the wider community, too, he said, with young people in particular seeing farming as an unattractive prospect and migrating to urban areas. For smallholders, “crisis is a constant way of life”, said Hudson, but climate change presents a more extreme challenge than any previous situation, he added. What it boils down to is farmers managing risk,said Paul Steele, chief economist at the International Institute for Environment and Development. “The issue is whether climate change is such a huge risk that they can’t recover from it and need outside support from governments and other agencies.” With insufficient international aid for smallholders, the need for investment is clear, said Steele. And with the UN calling for collective action to end poverty by 2030, the need to support rural communities is increasingly pressing. But who will provide the funds? Just 16% of traditional banks offer loans to smallholders, according to a report by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, a global network seeking to advance financial inclusion. Alternative sources of funding for smallholders include: climate finance (funds for activities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or help society adapt to climate change); microfinance; or social impact investors that seek a social, environmental and financial return. Some corporate businesses are also helping to provide loans. However, social impact investors must be wary of climate-related risks, which have a direct knock-on effect on the ongoing viability of lending to smallholders. Rubio said climate change had delivered a “real wake-up call” for Oikocredit, which has seen its coffee portfolio drop by 20% in the past three years. Urvi Kelkar, livelihoods and economic impact manager at multinational beverage company SABMiller, said her company was also facing immediate challenges as a result of climate change. “Declining yields are a threat to security of supply,” she said, referring to the fact that SABMiller sources many agricultural crops from developing countries. Despite the challenges, Kelkar said sourcing from smallholders in Africa was a “strategic priority” for SABMiller. The company claims it seeks to build inclusive supply chains, where it sources raw materials from smallholders, with the aim of improving incomes and livelihoods, as well as contributing to the host country’s economic growth. SABMiller has increased its competitiveness in the Ugandan beer market by developing an affordable lager through its subsidiary, Nile Breweries. Eagle Lager is made from sorghum, a cereal grain sourced from smallholder farmers. Some 20,000 smallholders have earned $15m (£11.5m) from Eagle Lager, which has also generated $70m for the Ugandan government.  Hudson also highlighted the opportunities for smallholders in supplying domestic markets, referring to the World Bank’s Africa Can Help Feed Africa report (pdf), which suggests the continent could generate an additional $20bn annually if African leaders remove cross-border food trade restrictions. “Smallholders are directly contributing to food security,” he said, explaining that his members have diversified by growing potatoes and bananas, with approximately half of their bananas destined for Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.  However, it would be wrong to “idealise” smallholders, Steele said, with unpredictable yields still a critical issue. To improve smallholders’ yields, Oikocredit is encouraging production partners to help farmers adopt sustainable farming techniques. For example, Cafédirect, which Oikocredit invests in, is helping 6,600 coffee smallholders plant trees in the Peruvian region of Piura. The initiative contributes to reforestation, which earns the farmers additional income through carbon credits. In east Africa, a project funded by Cafédirect aims to help empower female farmers, who stand to improve their yields by up to 30% by having access to the same knowledge and inputs as their male counterparts. But, as Hudson pointed out, there are wider cultural barriers that need to be addressed. “In some farming communities, women aren’t allowed to speak in front of men. [Women] have to be able to make decisions, too,” he said. Partnering with a range of different stakeholders is fundamental to supporting the developing world’s farmers, said Rubio. Oikocredit is working with technology providers such as Technoserve to help farmers monitor crop performance (which is important for gaining sustainability certifications), as well as financial literacy trainers.  Kelkar said partnerships and collaboration have been critical for SABMiller as the company has developed new supply chains with smallholders. Brewing the company’s Impala beer in Mozambique, for example, was done through a local partnership which turned raw cassava into a “cake” that could be transported more easily to its brewery. The operation sources cassava from 1,500 smallholder farmers. “You have to think holistically,” Kelkar said, emphasising the importance of addressing access to markets, training, appropriate funding and technology, and more accurate weather predictions. SABMiller is working with climate experts to help predict rainfall patterns in production countries and understand water risk, particularly where its factories share water resources with local communities. “We need a broader conversation between science and business,” she said. “It’s not happening quickly enough.”  As climate change continues to threaten the availability and cost of food for the world’s rapidly growing population, the panel agreed that everyone involved in global food production – from scientists and NGOs, to farmers, businesses, governments and funders – will need to take action in order to safeguard smallholders’ prospects and, ultimately, the future of global food security."
"In a rare show of international unity, more than 30 countries this week declared their plans to translate into national laws the Paris agreement on climate change. As a result, by the end of this year, or soon after, the accord should come into effect and become binding under international law.  This is a major step. It will be the first time since 1992 that a global agreement on climate change has been internationally accepted (the Kyoto protocol, signed by the White House in 1997, was famously stymied by the refusal of the US Congress to ratify it), and the first time in history that rich and poor countries have faced the same obligations to tackle global warming. Ratification may seem a small step, given that the agreement was passed by every one of the 195 United Nations member states last December. But it is important because it gives full legal standing to the document. That makes it harder for any government to row back on the Paris commitments. The most obvious potentially recalcitrant nation is the US, the world’s second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, where the presidential contender Donald Trump has vowed to unpick the agreement if elected this November. But other countries are also in danger of reneging. Russia was always a reluctant member, Nicaragua showed signs of trying to stop the agreement while the ink was still wet, and Australia’s volatile politics on climate change could yet cause a U-turn on the part of its government. Paris will enter into force if 55 countries, and enough countries to account for 55% of global emissions, ratify its contents. The former target will be met if the nations that have publicly agreed to ratify now do so, and the latter will soon be met if the EU, as promised, takes on its responsibilities in a bloc-wide agreement, expected early next year. It is also important to recall the history of climate change treaties. The failure of the US to ratify, despite presidential approval, and Russia’s plodding acceptance, meant that the 1997 Kyoto protocol only became legal in 2005. By then it was largely academic, as the world had moved on to begin negotiations on a new global settlement on climate change. The world had also moved on in terms of emissions, as China was confirmed as the world’s second biggest emitter – and is now the biggest. Kyoto placed quantified commitments on all developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Paris does not. Although nearly all of the world’s countries – including the biggest emitters, developed and developing – submitted plans before the Paris conference to cut or curb their emissions, those plans are not legally binding and will not be even when the accord enters into force.  The only legally binding commitment is to limit global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an additional “aspiration” to take even more drastic action to limit warming to 1.5C, which if adhered to could save the world’s low-lying islands from inundation. Quantified emissions curbs up to 2020 – not legally binding but set out publicly – were also agreed in 2009, at the much-derided Copenhagen conference on climate change, and those commitments still stand.  More importantly, the geopolitical landscape has been transformed in the 20-plus years in which the world has been discussing a global response to climate change. China, which carried no obligations under Kyoto, is now the world’s biggest emitter and soon to be the biggest economy. Developing nations are also now the biggest sources of the stock of carbon in the atmosphere, outpacing the richer countries responsible for “historic” emissions before the 1990s. What should we take from the Paris pact? First, recognise the limitations of what can be considered legally binding under international law. While nations were willing to agree to limit global warming, they were not willing to take on binding targets on reducing emissions, of the kind that were stipulated at Kyoto. It is now clear, after more than 20 years of international negotiations, and a changing pattern of which nations contribute most to the stock of carbon dioxide that is warming the planet, that even supposedly binding agreements do not guarantee reductions in emissions. That depends on countries delivering on their pledges to curb carbon production, which in turn depends on their internal politics. No international treaty, legally binding or not, can force countries to limit emissions if they are not willing to do so. So, although the Paris agreement is an important step, it will not be enough to guarantee that warming will not exceed scientific advice. Following through on the goal of limiting climate change will require much more: a reversal of the current reliance on fossil fuels in favour of low-carbon forms of energy production; businesses to alter their practices so that their activities produce less carbon; individuals to alter their behaviour; and finding ways to cope with a growing population of people who, rightly, wish to enjoy the fruits of modern prosperity without destroying the aspirations of their children to do the same. The Paris agreement acknowledged that climate change is a global problem that will require concerted global action. It is not, in itself, a solution to that problem. But it provides a way forward that can be built into a solution. If we want it."
"As we close out a summer marked by uncertainty in news and events, one trend for which analysts voice increasing certainty is the accelerating pace of the clean-energy transformation reshaping how the world generates electricity.  With increasing speed, global energy markets are turning away from fossil fuels and towards wind and other renewable sources, not just because they’re clean but because they’re cheaper, more competitive energy choices and offer a level of long-term certainty more price-volatile fossil fuels just can’t match.   In fact, by 2030 clean energy is expected to overtake fossil fuels and become the largest source in global electricity production — and wind power is forecast to lead the way to meet the surging demand for renewables. In its 2016 Outlook, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) projects:  a fundamental transformation of the world electricity system over coming decades towards renewable sources. From forecast data to market demand, it’s clear the future belongs to wind and other clean energies. In the top energy markets on six continents, wind is now the cheapest or largest source of newly installed power and gaining share. In 2015, the wind industry crossed the 60 gigawatt (GW) mark for the first time and reached an unprecedented 63 GW installed globally.  The bottom line: wind is winning. Not just in forecasts, but in today’s global marketplace.  Wind power installations are projected to continue this trend, more than doubling in developing countries and increasing by one-third in developed countries by 2030. As wind energy costs continue to drop, the primary drivers for clean energy are expected to include replacement of existing generating capacity – fossil fuel or nuclear – because they simply no longer make economic sense; further growth in global electricity demand; long-term policy stability such as that provided by the production tax credit in the U.S.; and nation-specific targets driven by the Paris Climate Agreement. Developing markets in particular have an opportunity to leapfrog older energy sources and meet new electricity demand by using wind power that is cleaner and cheaper than fossil fuels. One example is the Lake Turkana wind project in Kenya, where Vestas supplies wind turbines and Google will be a key investor. Upon completion, it will supply 310 megawatts of clean power, account for some 15% of the country’s electricity consumption, and power Kenya’s future growth more cheaply and cleanly than traditional fuels. While the present and the future look bright for renewables, pushing their energy costs even lower remains key for accelerating the transition to a clean energy mix globally. BNEF reports that onshore wind’s costs are expected to drop 23–36% globally by 2030, but Vestas is committed to driving down the levelized cost of wind energy even further.  To achieve this, we are leading the industry with investments in research and development and our smart data capabilities to help customers lower their cost of energy, increase their annual energy production, and strengthen their business case. With an unrivaled data pool from the industry’s largest installed base of wind turbines as well as meteorological reporting from around the world, we are constantly improving every aspect of the business — from product design and testing, siting and manufacturing, to operations and maintenance.  With this kind of constant innovation and technological advancement driving down the cost of energy, wind is well-positioned to keep its lead as the preferred renewable energy choice. And clean power will continue leading the global transformation away from traditional energy sources.  Indeed, the future belongs to clean energy, and the world’s new clean-energy economy looks strong. Anders Runevad is CEO and Group President of Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the global leader in wind energy."
"When a South Africa Airways scheduled flight flew from Johannesburg to Cape Town last month, it carried nearly 300 passengers. Neither the passengers or the pilots would have noticed any difference between that flight and any other.   But instead of the usual petroleum-based jet fuel, the plane was burning thousands of litres of a clear liquid derived from the oil of nicotine-free tobacco plants grown by farmers on acres of under-used land in the country’s Limpopo province. Boeing, KLM, South African Airways, the Dutch government and others who partnered in the trial were cock-a-hoop with the results, which came as part of something called Project Solaris. It appeared that the fuel was not only efficient, but it was also more or less “sustainable”, because it did not take up farmland needed to grow food or lead to deforestation or ecological problems.  “It showed that a low-carbon aviation biofuel could be be grown that will not affect the environment and could reward farmers,” said Joost Van Lier, a director of South African Sunchem biofuel development, one of the project’s partners. The tobacco fuel used was much more expensive than regular jet fuel, but because many airlines have committed to reducing CO2 emissions and substituting biofuels for some of their jet fuel by 2020, Project Solaris hopes to ramp up the acreage of tobacco grown to eventually produce millions of litres of the fuel in other southern African countries such as Malawi. So far, there have been around 2,500 successful flights fuelled by biofuels. In March, United Airlines became the first US airline to use biofuel for regularly scheduled commercial flights from Los Angeles airport, and in June Alaska Airlines flew commercial flights using biofuel based on isobutanol produced from corn. “Oslo airport now supplies airlines with alternative fuels for regular daily flights. Los Angeles is following and we expect John F Kennedy and other New York airports to stream from 2019,” said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, a coalition of aviation industry companies.  But despite successful tests and trials with different crops and waste streams, is there any hope in the forseeable future of aviation biofuels taking off on the scale needed to make even the slightest dent in the 300bn litres of jet fuel used worldwide every year? Worldwide, flights produced nearly 800m tonnes of CO2 in 2015, or up to 5% of all CO2 emissions.  “No credible scenarios exist for large-scale production of biofuels at present,” said Carlos Calvo Ambel, an energy analyst with Brussels-based watchdog group Transport & Environment. “So far, only a handful of companies produce renewable jet fuel on a commercial scale, and a single airport , Oslo, is set up to provide it.”  International aviation and shipping werenot mentioned in the Paris agreement, so it is unclear how their rapidly growing emissions are to be addressed. But the need for the industry to adopt a global scheme is seen as urgent if there is any hope of meeting the Paris agreement’s aspiration of holding temperature rises to 1.5C. As it is, the current industry projections expect aviation emissions to quadruple, potentially to account for 22% of global emissions by 2050.  Instead of relying on biofuels, governments are pinning their hopes on a UN global carbon offset scheme. This is to be negotiated this week in Montreal when 191 governments meet for the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) summit. A draft scheme is backed by US, Canada, Mexico, EU countries including the UK, and Singapore. According to Transport & Environment, the US wants the new deal to cover as many countries as possible. “Its strategy has been to weaken the agreement’s environmental effectiveness so as to attract more states. China is pursuing a similar strategy, and it has yet to commit itself to signing up,” it said.  But there are grave reservations among NGOs that an offset scheme, which could see other industrial sectors cutting emissions to allow aviation to continue growing, is not ambitious enough and may not even work.  The proposal in the draft text released earlier this month defines a voluntary “pilot and implementation” period from 2021-27 after which countries would have to join in.  “One of the discussions in Montreal will be whether to include Redd [Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation] offsets [offsets based on avoiding deforestation] in ICAO’s offsetting scheme. As a way of addressing climate change, offsetting flying against the carbon stored in forests would be insane,” says Chris Lang, editor of Redd Monitor which has analysed UN proposals to reduce forestry emissions with a similar offset scheme.  “Not only would such a scheme allow the aviation sector to continue expanding and to continue burning fossil fuels, it would rely on carbon being stored in forests. Yet as climate change worsens, the risk of these forests burning and returning the carbon to the atmosphere is increasing,” he said.  The offsetting scheme, which hopes to stabilise aviation emissions at 2020 levels, is strongly defended by Michael Gill, director of the Aviation Transport Action Group (ATAG), an industry coalition.   “Offsetting is not a new concept,” he says. “Indeed, a large number of airlines already offer offsetting to passengers on a voluntary basis. What the industry does need is certainty, with a clear set of metrics defined before the scheme commences and consistently applied throughout its lifetime.” Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), said: “I am optimistic that we are on the brink of a historic agreement—a first for an industry sector at the global level. The aviation industry would have preferred a more ambitious timeline than is currently outlined.”  Critics are not convinced. The International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation (ICSA), the only civil society body accredited to observe the aviation proceedings, has strong reservations about the proposed market-based scheme because it would rely on a system of “voluntary, unguaranteed participation with weak environmental safeguards”. “The new proposed text would allow nations participating ... to opt out with only six months’ notice, raising serious concerns about the durability of the programme,” said the ICSA in a letter to EU commissioners.  The coalition also fears that if the offsets used to achieve the goal of the UN scheme are also credited to other climate goals, emissions will increase while countries and airlines appear to meet their pledges.  Instead they want to see ambitious states and regions allowed to go further in reducing their emissions and clear language introduced to avoid double counting. The environmental coalition prefers an expansion of the EU emissions trading system (ETS), which controversially included aviation for 10 months in 2012. The scheme involved the EU imposing a cap on carbon dioxide emissions for all planes arriving or departing from EU airports, while allowing airlines to buy and sell “pollution credits” , rewarding low carbon-emitting aviation.  But the EU froze the scheme in November 2012 after the ICAO said it would take global action on emissions from planes.  “The EU stopped the clock on its own ETS to give ICAO time to develop an environmentally meaningful measure, not a voluntary scheme which postpones serious action for a decade or more. Europe should be proud of setting the global benchmark, and never replace it with something inferior that is open to bogus offset programmes,” said Andrew Murphy, aviation policy officer at Transport & Environment.

"Geoge Monbiot (Our roads are choked. We’re on the verge of carmageddon, 21 September) bemoans Brits’ reluctance to travel by bike. Apart from climate and geography (try popping to the shops on a wild day in the mid-Pennines) there is a dearth of suitably safe and inviting cycleways. The national cycling charity Sustrans was set up to establish a cycling network for Britain. Although great progress has been made, the routes opened are entirely aimed at leisure cycling – not the utilitarian business of linking A with B. Those who want to use bikes simply as transport are largely still forced on to the highway – almost always shared with heavy traffic. Providing a true national cycling network for routine travel is a vital but completely neglected task.Paul CairnsHalifax • You don’t need to look as far as Helsinki or Hamburg to find an example of a city that is addressing the issue of over-dependence on cars. Come to Nottingham.  Travel by train to our redeveloped station, or leave your car at one of 6,500 park-and-ride spaces and take a tram or bus in. All our park-and-ride buses will soon be electric; the trams on our expanded network already are. Or get on your bike and use our cycle superhighway – with more routes planned. Nottingham is bucking the trend for most large English cities – with latest Department for Transport figures showing that traffic levels have fallen here by almost 40m car miles over the past 15 years. This hasn’t happened by chance – it is a direct result of years of progressive transport policies, including introducing a workplace parking levy in 2012 to pay for many of the improvements that give people a decent alternative to the car for travelling into and around the city.Cllr Nick McDonaldPortfolio holder for business, growth and transport, Nottingham city council • Here along Europe’s busiest bus route, the Oxford Road/Wilmslow Road corridor through south Manchester, some progress in challenging the hegemony of the car has been achieved: we now have our segregated cycle superhighway and nearby a new Metrolink tram route along an old railway line. Unfortunately such advances will be seriously undermined if the Christie hospital is allowed to build even more multistorey car parks in Withington, thereby encouraging their thousands of staff to commute by car and adding to high levels of air pollution and other health risks. As a local councillor said of a previous (rejected)planning application: “Such proposals might well have come from the Jeremy Clarkson school of planning.”Don BerryManchester • Cars produce 70 megatons of the 131.8 megatons of the greenhouse gases attributable to transport, including the emissions caused by the production of the fuels for transport in refineries. Cars produce 53% of this total, HGVs 21%. Buses and coaches are responsible for only 3.4% and rail, both passenger and freight, for a mere 3.2%. The majority of the population, 60%, have no car. Many suburban areas of large towns and cities and smaller towns have no or little public transport after 6pm and on Sundays. In rural areas, there is even less public transport. For those without a car, this can mean no practicable means of taking a job that requires shift or Sunday work, or of pursuing further qualifications and training. Public transport is essential for us all and should be given the priority in financial resources it deserves.Margherita RendelLondon • Rural areas need cars, inner cities already do not, but outer city suburbs must plan them out by offering better alternatives. Unfortunately, many suburbs have good radial trains and buses, but terrible orbital ones, and pro-car local authorities still rule in parts of outer London. Barnet council predicts 29,000 extra cars a day around its Brent Cross shopping centre scheme. It refuses to redirect £200m-plus of planning gain money into something more sensible than extra roads – like starting a north London tram system.John CoxLondon • The reason for our choked roads is more complex than simply more cars. In real terms, car driving is now cheaper, so we make longer journeys. And we insist on travelling at the same time. He might like to check his roads at 3am. Over a week even the most congested road is running at less than 50% capacity. Organising people into buses is easier said than done: once people have cars, no one anywhere in the world has found the magic formula to get them on to buses. And making only electric cars is a utopian ideal: the materials for batteries and fuel cells are scarce. That leaves bikes. There are plenty of EU countries where bike use has increased from UK levels (2% of journeys) to more than public transport use (9% in the UK). The trick is easy. Direct and safe bike routes, and local councils setting an example by removing parking for officers and members. Those who can’t or won’t cycle can use public transport instead.Professor Lewis LesleyMerseyside Cycling Campaign, Liverpool • Increasing by stages the minimum driving age of 17 would not only reduce the number of cars on the road, but also the number of injuries, statistics of which show that younger drivers cause a disproportionate number.John WolfsonPech de Grezelle, Dordogne, France • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"
"Australian health professionals overwhelmingly say they don’t know of any policies that deal with the health implications of climate change, despite the World Health Organisation saying “climate change is the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century”. The results come from the first national snapshot of the knowledge and views of doctors, nurses, health academics and other health professionals on the topic of climate and health.  They were collected by the Climate and Health Alliance, as the group prepares to present its national strategy on climate, health and wellbeing discussion paper to politicians in Canberra this month. Liz Hanna, the president of the Climate and Health Alliance, said the strategy was supported by groups representing most of the health industry and represented the most important move in the climate and health space in Australia to date. When the analysis of the survey results was performed, 134 health professionals or representatives of health organisations had completed the survey. The group was highly aware of climate and health-related issues, with every respondent able to identify at least five of eight major health risks that climate change will bring, including food insecurity, increases in infectious diseases and mental health issues. Despite that, 45% of respondents said they were not aware of the only national climate change adaptation strategy that deals with health – the National Resilience and Adaptation Strategy. Just 7% said they were “fully aware” of the strategy. While some states have begun developing climate and health policies, 65% of respondents said they were not aware of any such policies. “Overwhelmingly, the seemingly well-informed group could not identify many policies at national or state levels specifically targeting the health effects of climate change,” the report said. Hanna said the lack of awareness was a result of the policies being very minimal. She said the health policies in the National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy were mostly useless. “They’re motherhood statements, rather than anything that has any capacity to make a difference,” Hanna said. Ninety-eight per cent of the respondents said they supported the development of a National Strategy for Climate, Health and Wellbeing. Comments in the survey would be used by the Climate and Health Alliance to inform later iterations of the strategy, Hanna said. Hanna said that, among wealthy countries, Australia was particularly vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change since it had such variable rainfall and was already very hot. As temperatures rise, the health implications are going to force change in almost every sector, she said. “In cold countries, landlords and people who manage public housing are required by law to have adequate heating,” Hanna said. “We’re going to get to that point but with cooling. “It will have to permeate all the way through to cricket clubs, who have members playing out in the sun during the day.” When the group goes to Canberra this month to present the strategy, it will be joined by representatives from medical colleges, hospital networks and alliances and associations of other health professionals. “What we’re doing as a health sector is letting the politicians know that there are lots of things that need to be done and we’re here to help,” Hanna said."
"The future of the US’s centerpiece plan to tackle climate change hangs in the balance following nearly seven hours of legal argument over whether it tramples upon the right of states to allow carbon pollution. Power utilities and business groups have joined 27 states in challenging the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, which would be the single largest tool in cutting greenhouse gas emissions to help avoid dangerous climate change.  On Tuesday, lawyers representing the states and the Obama administration presented oral arguments to the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit. Earlier this year, the supreme court halted the rollout of the Clean Power Plan until the legal challenges were heard. The District of Columbia court is expected to decide by late February but if the case progresses to the supreme court it is likely to continue into 2018. Opponents of the plan claim the US Environmental Protection Agency has overreached by declaring carbon dioxide a harmful pollutant that requires regulation. West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, who filed a challenge as soon as the plan was announced, said the plan would cause “West Virginia coalminers to lose their jobs and West Virginians’ electricity bills to skyrocket”. Peter Keisler, a lawyer representing the plan’s opponents, said in court: “We can’t tell a coal plant, ‘You have to become a solar plant’. EPA has no authority to impose a system like this one, which requires, in order to stay open, that the owner invests in other facilities.” The Clean Power Plan would impose emissions limits upon states with coal-fired power plants but will leave it to the states to decide how to lower these emissions. A form of carbon trading, which has been explicitly blocked at a federal level, could even be allowed between states. The EPA, which estimates that the Clean Power Plan will reduce CO2 pollution from the energy sector by 32% below 2005 levels by 2030, said it is confident the regulation will be upheld as it is has “strong scientific and legal foundations”. The EPA’s court submission states that the Clean Power Plan addresses “the nation’s most important and urgent environment challenge”. It adds: “The rule reflects the eminently reasonable exercise of EPA’s recognized statutory authority. It will achieve cost-effective CO2 reductions from an industry that has already demonstrated its ability to comply with robust pollution-control standards through the same measures and flexible approaches.” The EPA is supported by 18 states, plus the District of Columbia, and environmental groups that support the regulation of CO2 under the Clean Air Act. Proponents have warned that the US urgently needs to reduce emissions in order to slow warming temperatures that are linked to sea level rise, extreme weather and the spread of disease.  But critics have accused the Obama administration of a “war on coal” and warned that electricity prices will rise by so much that people will not even be able to surf the internet. Thomas Donohue, president of the US Chamber of Commerce, said the EPA plan was a “power grab” that will “drive up electricity costs for businesses, consumers and families, impose tens of billions in annual compliance costs, and reduce our nation’s global competitiveness – without any significant reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions”. Independent studies, however, suggest that the Clean Power Plan will require emissions cuts that are only slightly deeper than what states are already on track to achieve. Various pieces of research have found the new standards would add anything up to $4.56 to the average monthly household electricity bill, with some studies finding that bills will slightly decrease.  Environmental groups were largely positive after the day of legal argument in front of the court’s 10 judges. “This was a good day in court for America’s Clean Power Plan and for healthier air, a safer climate and economic prosperity,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel for Environmental Defense Fund, which was a party to the case. David Doniger, director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said: “The Clean Power Plan had a very good day. But we aren’t taking that to the bank just yet. What is certain, though, is we need to take swift and decisive action to combat climate change.  “This plan is our best available tool, and the court should uphold it. If we don’t limit carbon pollution, and quickly, we will bequeath to our children and all future generations a world of climate catastrophe.”"
"Every new or refurbished house in Europe will need to be equipped with an electric vehicle recharging point, under a draft EU directive expected to come into effect by 2019. In a further boost to prospects for the electric car market in Europe, the regulations due to be published before the end of the year state that by 2023, 10% of parking spaces in new buildings in the EU zone will also need recharging facilities.  The EU initiative is intended to lay the infrastructure for the sort of electric car boom envisaged by Norway and the Netherlands, which both plan to completely phase out vehicles with diesel engines by 2025. As well as extending the driving range and convenience of electric cars, the mushrooming number of recharge stations would allow vehicles to feed their electricity back into the grid. That in turn would open the door to a futuristic world in which cars supply energy to Europe’s power network at all times of the day and night, balancing shortfalls from intermittent renewable energies when the sun is not shining and the wind not blowing. “This kind of market stimulus is not just positive, it is mandatory if we want to see a massive rollout of electric vehicles in the near future,” said Guillaume Berthier, sales and marketing director for electric vehicles at Renault, which recently unveiled an electric vehicle with a 250-mile range. “The question of how you recharge your car when you live in an apartment within a city is a very important one.” The EU moves are designed to help cut roadside emissions, however, in the short term they may lead to a higher than expected sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions from road transport by 2050 according to a recent report by the European Environment Agency (EEA). Magda Jozwicka, the project manager of the EEA’s research, said there would be a five-fold increase in SO2 emissions by 2050 from electricity production compared to a situation with no electric vehicles. Although this assumption was based on the current energy mix projected by the European commission, which includes coal-burning power plants. The EEA report, which calls for new sulphur dioxide abatement measures in the EU, also says that the additional power demand from a burgeoning electric vehicle sector, which is predicted to account for 80% of cars by mid-century, will strain supply capacity. This could require the construction of 50 new power stations across Europe by some estimates. Martin Adams, the head of the EEA’s air pollution unit said: “A higher amount of electric vehicles will need additional power to be generated. The source of this extra energy is of prime importance. It is clearly feasible that we use clean renewable sources but when you think of where the different countries are at, I think some fundamental decisions are needed to develop a more sustainable energy system across Europe.” The French carmaker Renault said that it accepts that electricity supply problems could emerge as the vehicles’ market share increases exponentially, although it sees a solution. “We could make a huge investment to green our electricity but I personally think the future will be built around local storage with a second life battery,” Berthier said. Vehicle batteries that have worn down still contain energy which can be topped up with energy from on-site wind and solar power generators and sold back to the grid at peak times. Renault is strategically partnering with companies such as Connected Energy in second-life projects, while last month, BMW opened a similar 2MW power station near Hamburg, using 2,600 used electric vehicle batteries.

"Eastern Egg Rock is a freezing speck of island that clings to the coast of Maine, north of Boston. It is fringed with a few bushes, has little soil and no supplies of fresh water. Yet this unprepossessing, seven-acre scrap of wave-washed granite is a site of major ecological interest. Thanks to research carried out here, scientists are gleaning invaluable – and alarming – data about the impact of climate change on the planet’s wildlife. The project is the work of Steven Kress, a veteran ornithologist who constructed a sanctuary here for the Atlantic puffin 35 years ago. The puffin (Fratercula arctica), distinguished by its parrot-like, red-and-yellow bill, had been wiped out there by hunters in the 19th century. In the 1970s, Kress decided to bring them back.  “Puffins are monogamous, loyal and great providers for their young,” says Kress. “I was smitten by them.” Reintroduction was no easy task, however. The puffin is also a highly social bird and usually returns to its parents’ colony to breed after spending several years at sea. “We had to find a way to persuade them to settle on Eastern Egg Rock instead, ” says Kress. The solution, he decided, was to use puffin decoys in the same way that wildfowl hunters employ decoys to attract duck and geese to their guns. One-foot-high wooden replicas were peppered round the island to entice young puffins to land, socialise and eventually breed with other curious puffins. After several years, Kress and his team succeeded, establishing a puffin colony on Eastern Egg Rock in 1981. It is one of only a handful of spots in the US where the species nests. “At the time, our decoy plans were scoffed at. However, we succeeded to the extent that the technique is used today round the world to attract birds to new colonies. It is not so much the colour of the decoy that was important we found but the accuracy of its silhouette.” In 1987, Kress was given a Rolex enterprise award for his efforts. This came with a grant of 50,000 Swiss francs which he used to extend his programme to other seabirds and other parts of the world. Today, there are around 1,000 pairs of puffins on Eastern Egg Rock and other islands nearby. It is a remarkable success story. However, scientists working at the colony, which is supported by Audubon Society, have recently uncovered a worrying trend – a decline in puffin fledgling survival rates. Kress explains: “Most seabirds catch fish and then regurgitate them to feed their young. However, puffins drape the fish that they catch over their beaks before dropping them into the mouths of their chicks. They are like little fishing fleets going out every day before coming back with their catch of the day. Crucially, it is very easy to identify what they have caught. You can see it hanging from their beaks.” Because of this, Kress’s team have been able to study puffin diets in detail for several decades – and found the birds usually fed on hake and herring. Recently, however, there has been a change in puffin diet on Eastern Egg Rock. Herring has disappeared from the menu. Instead, parents are bringing home supplies of butterfish to the nest – with disastrous consequences. “Butterfish are much rounder and much more difficult to eat,” says Kress. “Essentially the chicks cannot swallow them and some starve to death even though their parents are bringing them plenty of fish.” Many chicks still make it to adulthood but suffer seriously reduced body weights which leave them less able to withstand the vicissitudes of sea life. Using data records for the past 20 years, Kress and his team calculate that fledging survival rates have declined by an average of 2.5% per year for those two decades. As to the cause of this harmful change in diet, Kress points to the dangers posed by climate change. “As the Arctic heats up, seas in higher latitudes are getting warmer and warmer. As a result, populations of fish that normally thrive in more southerly waters are moving into these more northerly waters.” The butterfish is an example and it is having a real impact on the puffin. Their chicks can only fit smaller, narrower fish, such as white hake –into their beaks and they have trouble swallowing larger, oval-shaped species like butterfish. The problem is made worse because puffin parents don’t tear up or partially digest the fish they catch for their young. “There is a YouTube clip of a young puffin trying, and failing, to swallow a butterfish,” said Kress. “The tragedy is that the puffins are surrounded by plenty of fish. This is the ocean’s equivalent of the canary in the coal mine. It’s telling us that climate change will not just affect the distribution of fish round the world but there could be disastrous consequences for many different species of wildlife that depend on these fish for food, such as the puffin.”"
"If we were to try to repair the lost public trust in our political system, you may think that climate change and energy seem the most unlikely place to start. How do we get past carbon price scare campaigns of “$100 lamb roasts”, city and industry “wipeouts”, that “broken” carbon tax promise and the constant government policy changes. Surely this is the last place to start? Yet, unbeknown to those still wanting to relive the scare campaign heydays of 2011-12, there is mounting evidence that Australian community has largely moved on. The Climate Institute has been conducting national attitudinal research on this issue since 2007, charting the views of Australians about matters relating to climate change and energy policy, through the ups and downs of changing weather patterns, related natural disasters and the waxing and waning of the political landscape. Indeed, our research shows support for political leadership on climate change has rebounded to be as strong as it has been since 2008 when, you might remember, there was bipartisan support for key policies like emissions trading. This year we began our research against an ominous backdrop – two weeks of often oversimplistic sloganeering about an electricity “crisis” in South Australia – in which the resultant price spike was being blamed on the state’s surging renewable energy and the closure of its coal-fired power stations. (Of course, this was neither the full nor the real story.) Yet our research has shown this “crisis” didn’t actually have a negative effect on the continued growth in enthusiasm for renewable energy. In fact, public support for renewable energy (wind and mainly solar) has continued to grow at the expense of coal and gas. While the real discovery is that so too has Australians’ frustration with our politicians for not supporting it more. This has translated into widespread disappointment with the performance of all levels of government, as well as with business. And after a turbulent 10 years in national policy, Australians strongly hold the view that government at the national level should hold the lead responsibility for climate action. This view is held quite consistently across the political spectrum of voting preference. Only a handful of people say governments – federal, state or local – should not take action. Through our research, and that of others, we have identified that mid-2012 marked the low point in support for climate action. Since that point – when it became clear the dire warnings that the carbon pricing mechanism, or “tax”, would deliver darkness and destruction didn’t eventuate – expectations have been rebounding. Even the repeal of the carbon laws, two years later, didn’t halt this trend. We can identify a number of elements that buttress this rebound. A growing realisation that we are already being hit by the impacts of climate change has been accompanied by growing trust in the science – from a minority in 2012 to a strong majority now. And the myth that Australia was somehow acting alone has now been demolished, most notably via the strong Chinese and US climate partnership, as well as the success of the Paris climate negotiations. Perhaps most powerfully, clean energy alternatives are now a very real part of our lives. This goes beyond the global investment reality where we have seen the level of investment in renewable energy double that in fossil fuels. Plunging costs for solar and wind technologies are being matched by the emergence of other more tangible technologies that people can directly interact with in their everyday lives – electric cars and household batteries. Australians can see the clean energy future and they want to be part of it. Of course, realising this future isn’t simple. We are going to need careful, fair and inclusive strategies to accompany policies that will unlock markets while encouraging the modernisation and decarbonisation of our electricity, transport, buildings and other sectors of the economy. It is now clear that years of policy and political turbulence has sapped a sense of urgency, as well as the confidence people place in politicians. And electricity prices still cause concern. Though the potential is clear, Australians think that continuing with inconsistency, half measures, partisan politics or backtracking will undermine efforts to seize this community potential. Next year the federal government will review our climate policies and will be considering post-2030 carbon pollution targets. It will do so, not only as other nations step up their action initiatives and commitments, but also as the global investor community becomes increasingly attentive to climate change risks and opportunities. I am starting to wonder if we are about to turn a corner – that a political rethink may be under way. Perhaps the relative quiet on climate issues in the 2016 election campaign, and this month’s political compromise to keep $800m in grant funding for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena), are indicators? There is a strong argument to say that the bipartisan Arena agreement largely marks the end of the repeal and reversal phase. Which means attention can now turn to how we build policies from here. Next year’s review will be the first national medium- to long-term climate change policy conversation for at least five years – since the carbon pricing mechanism was being negotiated. It will be an opportunity to connect a flailing political system with a growing and increasingly tenacious, if wary, resurgence in the Australian community’s desire for action. And that leaves us with a very big question – to which our evidence shows most Australians want a constructive, forward-looking and prosperity-building answer: how are our politicians going to respond?

"The Australian Capital Territory deputy chief minister, Simon Corbell, has urged the Turnbull government to get its story straight on renewable energy targets before Friday’s special meeting of energy ministers convened after power blackouts in South Australia. Corbell, in an interview with Guardian Australia on Tuesday, said the former federal environment minister Greg Hunt, on the sidelines of global climate talks in Paris last December, had clearly urged the states to adopt reverse auctions, following the model developed successfully in the ACT to drive the uptake of renewable energy.  Hunt said in Paris the federal government was not proposing a change to the national renewable energy target, “but I have encouraged the states that if they want to do something extra, [they should] apply reverse auctions to the renewable energy target in the way the Australian Capital Territory has done”. Now, Corbell said, the government had abruptly switched course, raising concerns about state-based renewable energy schemes following the South Australian blackouts. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, last week linked the SA blackout to the state’s use of renewable energy, calling it a “wake-up call” for state leaders who were trying to hit “completely unrealistic” renewable targets. “The inconsistency here is very clear,” Corbell said on Tuesday. Corbell will attend Friday’s meeting even though the ACT is in caretaker mode in preparation for an election on 15 October. He sought and was given an agreement by the Canberra Liberals to attend the discussion because in the ACT, the target of 100% renewables by 2020, is bipartisan policy. Corbell said Liberals in the ACT had overcome their initial resistance to the scheme, and had now come to the view that renewable energy was “very popular, and it works” – creating jobs in the region. The South Australian government has already signalled it wants Friday’s meeting to canvas whether there should be a national “emissions intensity” trading scheme for the electricity sector – a development that would reopen the debate around carbon pricing. The SA premier, Jay Weatherill, has been pushing for the adoption of a national scheme that would work as a form of emissions trading for the electricity sector. Generators would be penalised for polluting above an emissions-intensity baseline, to help drive an orderly transition to low-emissions energy sources. But Josh Frydenberg, who got the environment portfolio from Hunt in the post-election reshuffle, and has also assumed responsibility for energy policy, has signalled there will be no consideration of a change to the Coalition’s Direct Action scheme until a review scheduled for 2017. Corbell said the ACT was open to discussion about a new emissions intensity scheme but that any trading scheme would need to “complement state-based renewable energy targets, not replace them”. He said an emissions intensity scheme would give preference to gas as a coal alternative in the short term to deliver base load power, and the danger with that was a carbon-trading scheme would lock in gas as a medium term option “at the expense of a secure pipeline for solar and wind.” Corbell said the government needed to use the forum of the Coag energy council to align climate policy and energy policy in the operation of the national energy market. “There has been a complete failure of federal government leadership of this council – they have resolutely avoided the [alignment of climate and energy policy] for years.” On Tuesday Weatherill announced there would be an independent inquiry into the blackouts, led by former South Australia police commissioner Gary Burns. That review will cover the state government and emergency response to the outage. The Australian Energy Market Operator is expected to issue a separate report this week, before Friday’s meeting, establishing the sequence that led to the power outages."

"One year ago this week, I was sitting in a cramped hotel room with 15 other staffers in Las Vegas for Bernie Sanders’ first debate for the presidential nomination. The question came from CNN: “What is the greatest national security threat?” Pundits criticized and mocked him for weeks after he answered “climate change”. But he was right. And it’s not just Sanders pointing out the imminent threat posed by climate change to global and national security. CIA analysts and our nation’s military strategists are rightfully naming it as a contributor to refugee flows, the spread of disease, and conflicts over basic resources like food and water.  In 2014, 17.5 million people were displaced by climate-related disasters. Those numbers will continue to rise dramatically in the coming decades, according to climate displacement program manager Alice Thomas of Refugees International. Our nation’s defense officials know global warming’s destructive forces could undermine fragile governments in unstable regions of the world where extremist ideologies can take root. Yet mainstream Republican avoidance of reality on the science of climate change impedes the necessary reassignment of resources to meet the challenges posed. Now a new report from the Institute of Policy Studies provides the most accurate calculation of government spending on climate security to date. The picture isn’t pretty. We’re spending 28 times as much on military security than climate security. A public sector investment of $55bn per year is required to meet the challenge, according to the study. With $21bn in the 2017 budget, a shortfall of $34bn is left. That may seem like an insurmountable hill to climb. It’s not! As the IPS report points out, plenty of money lies untouched in the nation’s bloated military budget. The F-35 fighter plane program is a prime candidate for big cuts. It’s the most expensive weapon ever designed, complete with massive cost overruns. The sad cherry on top: the military admits that this plane just doesn’t work. If we turned back now, IPS says we could build enough offshore wind farms to power 320,000 homes for millions of people. Savings from gutting a Navy program designed to build close-to-shore combat ships would provide enough funds to retrain more than 150,000 coal industry workers. The ships have been plagued with mechanical errors. Our own Government Accountability Office says the “actual lethality and survivability performance of LCS is still largely unproven through realistic testing”. Others have called the ships an outright “waste”. Retraining and redistributing our fossil-fuel workforce to green jobs would be a welcome reprioritization. Congress could harness additional savings by reducing service contracting and canceling other wasteful or unnecessary weapons programs. But one party largely stands in the way. Republicans are hell-bent on leading our country down an unforgivable road with grave consequences. Their party’s nominee for president believes that global warming is a hoax engineered by the Chinese. That would be comical if it weren’t so dangerous. Rich Americans justify inaction by dismissing climate change as a far off problem that will affect others. But climate change is here and now. And while the sharpest edge of its destructive forces will sadly hurt people of color and lower-income the hardest, we’re all in deep trouble. In an unusually forceful public service announcement, The Weather Channel this week warned Floridians that Hurricane Matthew would lead to a heartbreaking loss of life. Florida governor Rick Scott said: “This storm will kill you.” These un-natural weather occurrences are becoming more and more frequent. My home state of California faces its worst drought in 1,200 years. When I traveled home for the holidays two years ago, I saw the devastating impact of climate change firsthand. Where boats once sat docked in my hometown marina, only dust remained. Climate scientists are telling us that the United States is not immune to the instability and infighting that will occur when populations are forced to fight over food and water. They need only look to California for confirmation, where northerners and southerners argue fiercely over water access. The only practical solution to curb unrest, suffering and death here and abroad is a massive redistribution of government money. This week’s new report from IPS serves as a thoughtful blueprint. Republicans should take heed of former GOP President Dwight Eisenhower’s words of wisdom: Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. Let’s steward our resources wisely. Let’s choose climate over combat."
"Shell and BP’s pay plans encourage their bosses to dig for oil instead of investing in low-carbon energy and should be overhauled by shareholders, according to the campaign group ShareAction. Investors in the oil companies should use binding votes on pay policies next year to scrap short-term targets and reward chief executives for working towards the target set in Paris last December to limit global temperature increases to 2C or less, the responsible investment group says in a report.   ShareAction said international pressure to reduce the impact of climate change was an existential threat to companies whose business depends on extracting fossil fuels. Persisting with pay plans that reward old measures of success risk Shell and BP becoming obsolete and ultimately going bust, the report says. Large companies face binding shareholder votes on three-year pay policies at next year’s annual general meetings under rules introduced in 2013. Shell and BP’s policies will take them up to 2020 when pledges under the Paris treaty could be strengthened, making the votes important, ShareAction said. Shareholders voted against the £14m pay package for Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, and ShareAction said the pay policy votes would be a test of investors’ resolve. Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, was paid €5.85m (£5m) last year.  Catherine Howarth, ShareAction’s chief executive, said: “Responsible investors who are serious about climate risk have a crucial opportunity to ‘walk the talk’ at BP and Shell next year by pushing for remuneration policies designed make these companies commercially resilient in a low carbon world – and voting down policies which fail that test.” ShareAction said bonuses were largely tied to shareholder returns, project delivery, replacement of reserves and measures that encourage oil extraction. Long-term bonuses were paid after a few years yet the effects of Van Beurden and Dudley’s decisions lasted for decades, ShareAction said. ShareAction called on investors to push BP and Shell to develop low-carbon energy, remove outdated performance measures and reward bosses for working towards the Paris targets.  Van Beurden and Dudley have said they support a shift to renewable energy but have resisted pressure to make a radical switch to their companies’ activities, which have attracted increasing opposition. BP’s attempt to drill in a marine reserve in the Great Australian Bight was delayed for the third time on Wednesday and Shell has started production at the world’s deepest underwater oil and gas field in the Gulf of Mexico. Van Beurden has argued new oil supplies are needed to meet demand from a growing, more urban and prosperous global population. Dudley has said governments should do more to prevent energy being wasted and that oil companies should not be required to go lead the search for renewable sources. BP said it had been in talks with shareholders over pay and would consult them on its proposed pay policy later this year. Shell said it would read the report with interest."
"On Tuesday, the Science Museum will launch its new interactive gallery for children – Wonderlab: The Statoil Gallery. Despite securing sponsorship from an oil and gas company that is recklessly planning to drill seven new wells in the fragile Arctic, the London museum has also introduced an entry charge, restricting access to those visitors able to pay. It is unconscionable that in 2016 a museum of science is handing a fossil fuel company legitimacy by allowing it to sponsor a gallery designed to inspire the next generation. Statoil is pursuing new sources of oil that must stay in the ground if there is to be any hope of leaving a safe climate for the children that are to visit this gallery. And from the Norwegian Arctic to the Great Australian Bight, Statoil’s plans are opposed by local communities and indigenous peoples who want the company off their lands and out of their waters.  Putting a charge on galleries aimed at children denies those from less privileged backgrounds the opportunity to become engaged in science and excited by the renewable energies that will play a vital role in their future. It is unacceptable for the Science Museum and Statoil to make future generations pick up the bill for their ill-made decisions. Wonderlab’s entry charge and its unethical sponsor must both be dropped.Bill McKibben Author, educator, environmentalist and co-founder of 350.orgProfessor Jonathan Oppenheim Royal Society university research fellow, department of physics and astronomy, University College LondonDr Stuart Parkinson Executive director, Scientists for Global ResponsibilityDr Douglas Parr Chief scientist, Greenpeace UKCaroline Lucas MP and Jonathan Bartley Co-leaders, Green partyProfessor Simon L Lewis Professor of global change science, UCLDr Sarah Bell Senior lecturer in environmental engineering, UCLDr Stephen Webster Director, Imperial College science communication unitDr Philip Webber Chair, Scientists for Global ResponsibilityStephen Kretzmann Executive director, Oil Change InternationalGunnar Kvåle Professor emeritus, Centre for International Health, University of Bergen, NorwayDanny Chivers Author of The No-Nonsense Guide to Climate ChangeDr Victoria Johnson Research associate, Sustainable Consumption Institute, University of ManchesterProfessor David Colquhoun FRS Professor of pharmacology, UCLProfessor Richard Ashcroft Professor of bioethics, Queen Mary University of LondonDr David Kirby Senior lecturer in science communication studies, University of ManchesterDr Emily Dawson Lecturer in science communication, UCLDr David McCoy MedactDr Felicity Mellor Senior lecturer, Imperial College science communication unitProf Andy Stirling SPRU, University of SussexDr Matt Folley Senior research fellow, School of Natural and Built Environment, Queen’s University BelfastDr Alice Bell Former Science Museum employeeDr Sarah Davies University of CopenhagenDrew Pearce PhD science researcher and member of Progressive Science InstituteBeth Rice PhD science researcher and member of Progressive Science InstituteDr David Hookes Honorary senior research fellow, Department of Computer Science, Liverpool UniversitySophia Collins Science engagement specialistPhil Ball Environmental activist and member of the Arctic 30Clara Paillard President of PCS culture sectorSophia McNab UK Youth Climate CoalitionMads Flarup Christensen Executive director, Greenpeace NordicBunna Lawrie Mirning elder and whale songman, Nullarbor/Great Australian BightPeter Owen Director, Wilderness Society South AustraliaNnimmo Bassey Health of Mother Earth Foundation, poetMaja Ratkje Musician and member of Stopp Oljesponsing av Norsk Kulturliv (End Oil Sponsorship of the Arts Norway)Claire James National coordinator of Campaign Against Climate ChangeDavid Powell New Economics FoundationAlmuth Ernsting Co-director, BiofuelwatchMartin Hagfors Musician, End Oil Sponsorship of the Arts NorwayElin Vister Artist, End Oil Sponsorship of the Arts NorwayHasse Farmen Musician, End Oil Sponsorship of the Arts NorwayIan Pocock London Campaign Against the Arms TradeDr Anna Galkina PlatformBergljot Gjelsvik BP or not BP?Lola Perrin Composer and pianistFeral X Activist and projection artistRob Burbea Composer, Dharma Action Network for Climate EngagementDr Chris Garrard Composer, musicologist and environmental campaignerJames Simon Telford Musicologist, composer and sound artistEmma Johnston Primary school teacher • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"
"The Dutch parliament has voted for a 55% cut in CO2 emissions by 2030, which would require the closure of all the country’s coal-fired power plants. The unexpected vote on Thursday night by 77 to 72 would bring the Netherlands clearly into line with the Paris climate agreement, with some of the most ambitious climate policies in Europe.  It is not binding on the government, but the Liberal and Labour parties say they will now push for speedy implementation of the motion. Five Dutch coal-fired power stations were closed last year but the country still has another five plants in operation. Three of these came online in 2015, and have been blamed for a 5% rise in the country’s emissions last year. The Dutch Liberal MP and vice president of the parliament, Stientje van Veldhoven, told the Guardian: “Closing down big coal plants – even if they were recently opened – is by far the most cost effective way to achieve the goals of the Paris agreement, and all countries will need to take such far-reaching measures. We cannot continue to use coal as the cheapest source of energy when it is the most expensive from a climate perspective.” A court in the Netherlands last year ordered prime minister Mark Rutte’s government to cut its emissions by a quarter by 2020, citing the severity of the global warming threat which the Netherlands has recognised in international treaties.  Dennis van Berkel, legal counsel for Urgenda, the group which brought the case, described the vote as “an enormous leap for climate policy in the Netherlands”. The vote also calls for a 25% emissions cut by 2020. The country’s centre-right coalition government is pursuing a twin-track response of appealing the ruling to the country’s higher court, while preparing a climate package for early November.  This could include limited coal plant closures, more funding for projects involving renewable energy, carbon capture and storage, and geothermal heating. Some environmentalists fear that the final package will involve a coalition deal that renders the parliamentary vote obsolete. The issue has been a divisive one in the Netherlands, with the Labour party, a coalition partner in Rutte’s government, backing the opposition in yesterday’s vote. The Dutch environment ministry was not immediately available to comment on the vote. However, the economic minister Henk Kamp spoke out earlier this month against any mothballing of the three new plants built by EOn, RWE and Engie. “They are the cleanest (coal plants) in Europe,” he said. “We’d be crazy if we shut them.” In March, the Netherlands will elect a new government, with Geert Wilders’ far-right, populist and anti-immigrant Freedom Party leading many opinion polls. Wilders has previously spoken dismissively of “the sinister green-windmill subsidy complex”. Willem Wiskerke, a spokesman for Greenpeace Netherlands said: “He is a climate denier like Donald Trump, nothing more, nothing less, a rightwing, fact-free populist who denies the climate crisis and will not put any effort into solving it.” While yesterday’s coal-crushing vote is not formally binding, van Veldhoven said she was optimistic that quick action to force a decision this autumn would tip the government’s hand, before next year’s elections. “It is our clear political statement so this is what they must do,” she said. “It is a motion, not a law, so there is some room for manoeuvre. But having one coalition partner support it is always a good guarantee that an adopted motion will be enforced.” Following passage of any new law, EU Emissions Trading System permits would also have to be reduced, to prevent a freak surplus lowering the price of carbon allowances, van Veldhoven said. The parliamentary vote follows a recent report by the consultancy CE Delft, which found that the cheapest way to meet the Netherlands’ climate commitments would be to close one or two new coal stations. The paper, which was commissioned by Eneco, a Dutch green power company, estimated this would cost the average household €30 (£26) a year, but save them €80 a year on energy bills. However, the Dutch government’s economic ministry has tallied the bill for closing all of the country’s coal plants by 2020 at €7bn. While this would have little effect on energy security and cut Holland’s emissions by 31%, the CO2 savings would fall to just 9% due to a rise in coal-produced power imports, the report said. "
"The past is a different country – take the USSR during 1988 which was being convulsed as Mikhail Gorbachev’s perestroika swept through the nation. A nation that three years later would no longer exist. The world’s greatest experiment with communism was coming to an end. In June that same year, a scientist would testify to the United States Senate that another experiment was well underway. In explaining this experiment he presented evidence that painted a future as dystopian as any conjured up by the then President Ronald Reagan about the dangers of communism.  “Global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed warming ... It is already happening now,” he said. That scientist was James Hansen, who was to become one of the most prominent advocates for addressing global warming, both in his leadership of climate science as the head of Nasa’s Goddard Institute, and in later years via activism and occasional peaceful civil disobedience. Global emissions of greenhouse gases have increased by 60% since 1988. While Hansen’s testimony is responsible for a significant increase in people’s awareness of climate change, the consequences appear yet to sink in.  Twenty six years later, Hansen is now seeking to have his day in court to effectively force the US government to significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Next month the district court of Oregon will rule whether to allow Hansen’s and 21 young American citizen’s case against the US government to proceed to trial.  “It seemed to me that, at least in the US, the most fundamental concepts on which our country was founded were equal rights, equal protection of the laws. All people should have equal rights to life, liberty, property, and pursuit of happiness. The same as for civil rights,” says Hansen. By failing to rein in climate change impacts, the rights of young people alive today and those that will be born in the future are being disregarded. There is also a fundamental failure of governments to manage natural resources and so protect the public trust. Hansen has long argued that humanity should move towards a safe limit for CO2 in the atmosphere of 350ppm - a value that the organisation 350.org takes its name from – moving that boundary up or down as new evidence comes in. CO2 is currently above 400ppm and rising. If we do nothing, then a child born today will never experience safe levels of greenhouse gases and we will be forcing future generations to suck out CO2 directly from the atmosphere in order to avoid dangerous climate change.  Some of this could be achieved with better soil management and replanting trees, but the longer we delay the more reliant we become on negative emissions technologies such as carbon capture and storage which is still effectively at the prototype stage. Hansen and an international team of scientists have recently attempted to calculate the costs of the range of negative emissions that would be required to avoid dangerous climate change – and came to $104-570tn this century. Compare that to the current total size of the global economy, which is a little under $80tn. One argument against cutting greenhouse gas emissions is that it may threaten economic growth. It may be better to leave it to future generations to clean up our fossil-fuelled mess as presumably they will have the smarts and technology to do so. But we have to consider how likely it is that future generations will be able to afford such sums, at the same time as figuring out how to feed, clothe and house more than 9 billion people. Hansen and his team’s calculations are contained in a paper that is currently in review in the journal Earth System Dynamics - ESD - and so may well be revised, or potentially rejected. Here I must disclose that I am on the editorial board of ESD, but I write this independently and do not claim to represent the views of the other editors. It is usual practice to not publicly discuss a paper that is in review - even an open access review model that ESD operates in which the original manuscript is made available online, along with reviewer’s reports, author’s responses and editorial judgements.  I am a big fan of this process as everything is made transparent. And so is Hansen as his recently published paper on megastorms and rapid multi-metre sea level rise was published in a similar open review journal. Some scientists expressed concerns over how that paper was reported prior to publication.  If Hansen’s current work is accepted for publication then I would welcome the opportunity to discuss it in detail. Right now its significance is that it may have a bearing on next month’s legal case as well as generating academic interest and discussion in its own right - published or not.  That humans are affecting the Earth’s climate is one of the most thoroughly researched and well-established scientific findings of all time. What should be done with that knowledge is something that people have been struggling with since before 1988. If we are to avoid crippling future generations with debts and dangerously degraded environments, then time is running out for us to come to workable solutions. "
"Canada’s commitment to fighting climate change has been questioned after the Liberal government, led by Justin Trudeau, announced conditional approval for a C$36bn liquefied natural gas project in northern British Columbia. The decision – the Trudeau government’s first on a major energy project – was announced late on Tuesday. “The government approved the Pacific NorthWest LNG project,” Catherine McKenna, the environment minister, told reporters in a Vancouver suburb.   Backed by Malaysia’s energy giant Petronas, the project would ship 19m tonnes a year of frozen, liquefied natural gas to markets in Asia. The government promised the project, one of Canada’s largest resource development projects, would create thousands of jobs – as many as 630 direct and spin-off jobs and 4,500 construction jobs – and add nearly C$2.4bn per year to the country’s GDP.  The government’s approval was contingent on the project meeting 190 conditions, including keeping greenhouse gas emissions capped at 4.3m tonnes per year, a drop of about 20% from the project’s initial proposal. Upstream emissions are not included in this cap and could add as much as 8.7m tonnes of carbon emissions to the project, according to estimates from a draft report released by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency in February.  McKenna said the decision had been informed by rigorous environmental assessment as well as meaningful consultations with First Nations groups. “The only way to get resources to market in the 21st century is if it is done in a responsible and sustainable manner. This decision reflects this objective.”  But despite claims by the British Columbia government that the exported fuel would offer an alternative to coal-fired plants in Asia, environmentalists warned the approval of the project would undermine Canada’s climate change commitments. “How can Prime Minister Trudeau claim to be a climate leader on the international stage, while approving this new project that will become the single largest source of climate pollution in the country?” Karen Mahon of Stand Earth asked in a statement after the decision was announced. “Honestly we expected better.” Since taking the reins of Canada’s government last year, Trudeau has sought to position himself as a climate change leader on the world stage while assuring Canadians that the government would strike a balance between caring for the environment and bolstering the country’s struggling energy industry.  The Pacific NorthWest LNG project, which includes a nearly 600-mile (900km) natural gas pipeline and an LNG facility near Prince Rupert in British Columbia, was widely seen as one of the government’s first tests of this commitment.  During last year’s federal election campaign, Trudeau courted environmentalists with promises to invest millions of dollars in clean tech and confront climate change. Tuesday’s approval was a betrayal to the many who voted for action on climate change, said Caitlyn Vernon of the Sierra Club of British Columbia. “The Trudeau government’s lofty rhetoric on climate has been proven nothing more than sunny ways talking points.” In May, 90 scientists and climate experts from Canada, the US and Australia urged Trudeau and his government to reject the Pacific NorthWest LNG project in an open letter. The 190 conditions set out by the government provided a chance to meaningfully address some of the concerns, said Merran Smith of Clean Energy Canada. Instead, the bar was set too low. “What’s shocking about this approval is that other LNG projects are proposing much cleaner operations,” she said. “Ottawa should have required Pacific NorthWest to run on clean electricity and use available technology to reduce its carbon pollution by more than 40%.”  Even before the government announced its decision, six First Nations affected by the project said the project had so far failed to meet their expectations for respecting indigenous rights. “Providing a green light for this project at this time will only lead to protracted litigation which benefits no one,” the Skeena Corridor Nations said in a statement.  In the wake of Tuesday’s announcement, analysts pointed out there was little guarantee that the project would be built. The government’s decision comes amid weakening demand and oversupply in the global natural gas market. While those behind the project welcomed the approval and described it as a significant milestone, the company said a total review of the project would be carried out by the company and shareholders before any final decision is taken."
"Public support for Australia to be a world leader in climate change solutions has rebounded to its highest since the major political parties agreed on emissions trading, research shows. About 65% of the nation want to see Australia lead the world in solutions, an increase from 52% in 2010-12 when the “carbon tax” debate was front and centre in politics. The annual attitudinal study by the Climate Institute shows this year’s jump, up from 59% in 2014-15. It’s the closest it has been to the 76% support in 2007 when then prime minister John Howard announced an emissions trading scheme. The institute chief executive, John Connor, said the results show support is recovering from the carbon tax scare campaign. The study also found 77% of Australians believe climate change is happening, up from 64% four years ago and 70% last year. Three-quarters of Australians believe governments should plan for the orderly closure of coal plants and replace them with clean energy. Just 3% say coal is their preferred energy source for Australia. And 77% believe state governments should bring in incentives for more renewable energy. The study also found people want climate policy to be bipartisan, with 90% believing the responsibility for action rests with the federal government."
"Climate scientists have 95% confidence that humans are the main cause of global warming over the past six decades. Their best estimate attributes 100% of global warming since 1950 to human activities. 90 to 100% of climate scientists and their research agree on this. Human-caused global warming is as settled as science gets. Yet most Americans don’t realize it. Moreover, the more conservative a person’s ideology, the less likely they are to accept this scientific reality or to trust the scientific experts.  According to a new Pew Research Center poll, just 48% of Americans realize that the Earth is warming mostly due to human activity. Highlighting a vast partisan reality gap, 79% of liberal Democrats and just 15% of conservative Republicans answer the question correctly. Among social scientists, there’s an ongoing debate about whether facts can change peoples’ minds on scientific issues that have become politically polarized, like climate change. There’s some evidence that when conservatives have more scientific knowledge, it just gives them more tools to use in rejecting the scientific information that conflicts with their ideological beliefs. Pew asked a variety of general science questions to test the correlation between scientific knowledge and acceptance of human-caused global warming. Overall, Democrats and Republicans got the same average score on these scientific questions, although liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans scored better than moderates in both parties. When it came to understanding that humans are causing global warming, Pew found that scientific knowledge makes a huge difference among Democrats, and no difference among Republicans. However, previous research has shown that conservatives with climate-specific knowledge are more likely to accept climate realities.  For Democrats, ideology isn’t a factor because the main solutions to the problem (e.g. regulations and pollution taxes) don’t conflict with their ideological beliefs. Thus scientific knowledge determines whether they understand that humans are causing global warming. For three-quarters of American conservatives, their ideology prevents them from accepting that reality, regardless of their scientific literacy. The expert consensus on human-caused global warming poses a conundrum for conservatives. People usually defer to the experts, in particular on complex issues like climate science. How can they square an ideological opposition to climate change solutions with the 97% consensus among scientific experts that humans are causing global warming? The Pew survey suggests that conservatives accomplish this by denying the expert consensus, and by distrusting the experts. The poll asked whether respondents thought that “almost all climate scientists agree that human behavior is mostly responsible for climate change.” Only 27% of Americans were aware of this fact, including just 55% of liberal democrats, 29% of moderate Democrats, and 15% of Republicans.  When asked if climate scientists can be trusted to give full and accurate information on the causes of climate change, only 39% of Americans answered yes, including 70% of liberal Democrats and 15% of conservative Republicans. More than half of conservative Republicans also said that climate scientists’ research findings are influenced by the desire to advance their careers and their political leanings. In short, when experts tell you something you don’t want to believe, reject their conclusions by accusing them of bias, as we saw conservative Australian senator Malcolm Roberts do recently on Q & A: Research has shown that American conservative media outlets like the Wall Street Journal and Fox News are terribly inaccurate and biased in their climate change reporting. In fact, a study in 2013 found that conservative media consumption decreases viewer trust in scientists and belief that global warming is happening. The Pew survey results further reinforce that finding. Moreover, a study published last year found that the Republican Party is the only major political party in the world that rejects the need to tackle climate change. This is likely due to the party’s reliance on fossil fuel industry campaign donations. Humans are causing global warming. Scientific experts agree about this. Smoking causes lung cancer. Gravity is real. Humans landed on the moon. These are all statements that reflect the reality we all live in whether we’re politically liberal or conservative. Political ideology should not determine whether we accept these realities. And yet in America, on climate change, it does. The Republican Party has created an echo chamber in which their media and political leaders live by the phrase jokingly uttered by Mythbuster Adam Savage: Republican voters take their cues from party leaders and often get their information from conservative media outlets. On climate change, those leaders and media sources reject reality and substitute their own denial and misinformation, because it benefits them. Their voters become misinformed as a result, and thus don’t demand change from party leaders. Everybody outside the denial echo chamber is puzzled by it, and since it’s impervious to external facts, few know how to break through. Climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe has been trying to make a difference by identifying commonalities with many conservatives, like her evangelical faith. Loved Dr. @KHayhoe's message that #climatechange doesn't have to divide us – we can unite around shared values to #ActOnClimate. #SXSL pic.twitter.com/K2crDte8Si There are glimmers of hope in the Pew survey. For example, there’s bipartisan support for wind and solar energy, with 83% and 89% of Americans in favor, respectively. As Hayhoe noted in her climate event with President Obama and Leonardo DiCaprio this week, Texas produces the most wind power of any state, generating 10% of its electricity from wind. Because they’re becoming increasingly cheap and popular, clean technologies are giving us a shot at preventing the worst consequences of climate change.  Much like climate change, science denial poses a long-term threat to the Republican Party. And similar to alcoholism, denying the problem doesn’t make it go away; if you don’t accept the problem and take steps to deal with it, reality will eventually come crashing in with disastrous consequences.  There are conservative thought leaders who realize this and are in a battle with the science-denying wing over the future of the Republican Party. With reality on their side, they will eventually win; hopefully before too much irreversible damage is done to the party and to the Earth’s climate."
"Hillary Clinton used the global climate crisis as a weapon for another assault on Donald Trump on Tuesday, enlisting the help of her husband’s former vice-president Al Gore to urge America’s voters not to risk sending a “climate change denier” to the White House. In a joint address in Miami, Clinton and Gore repeatedly hammered the Republican nominee for his stance on climate change and his belief that global warming is a hoax initiated by the Chinese.  “Climate change is real, it’s urgent, and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it,” Clinton said, promising investment in clean energy. “We can transform our economy, we can rally the world to cut carbon pollutions and above all we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect the planet. Just remember what is at stake. My opponent is a guy who denies science, who denies climate change every day.” Yet it was Gore, who lost the 2000 presidential election to George W Bush by less than 500 votes in Florida, who delivered the more powerful message about why the climate crisis is one of the most serious issues in this campaign, and why he believes Clinton is the only candidate who can help solve it. Praising last year’s Paris climate agreement between nations as a solid starting position, Gore said the country faced a “stark” choice. “The world is on the cusp of either building on the progress of solving the climate crisis, or stepping back, washing our hands of America’s traditional role as a leader in the world,” he said. During her own 22-minute address to a 1,600-strong crowd at Miami-Dade College, Clinton avoided any mention of the controversies that have dominated the political agenda over the last five days. Instead, she stuck steadfastly to themes of climate change and her policy proposals to “accelerate the transition” towards clean energy in the US. “I want to see 500 million more solar panels installed in America by the end of my first term,” she said. “Let’s generate enough clean energy to power America.” Building more energy-efficient buildings and cutting the country’s reliance on oil by one-third would also bring massive economic benefits, the Democratic candidate said. “We can do all of this and create millions of good paying jobs as we do. The clean energy solutions are being created right here in America. And while we do that, make sure communities are ready for the effects of climate change that are coming right at us,” she said. That comment referred to the recent impact of Hurricane Matthew on the Caribbean, where the storm killed hundreds, and in the US, which has seen more than 30 deaths, most of them in North Carolina, which is still suffering from significant flooding. Gore, who won the 2007 Nobel peace prize for his efforts to tackle manmade climate change, highlighted in his movie An Inconvenient Truth, blamed the severity of recent hurricanes on global warming. “Matthew went from a tropical storm to a category 5 hurricane in just 36 hours, and that’s unusual.” Nowhere are the effects of global warming more evident than Florida, Gore said.  Just yesterday there were six more cases of Zika in Miami-Dade County. Changing climate conditions shift the places where these diseases become endemic. Mosquitoes incubate faster and bite more often. “These and many other consequences are really wake-up calls for us.”  Clinton, too, referenced the threat to Florida, a key swing state. “The impact of climate change goes beyond severe events like hurricanes, it’s a daily reality in Miami. In streets in Miami the ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system. If you need proof climate change is real, there you go,” she said. She warned: “At the rate we are going, one in eight homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century.” Global warming, she said, had also been cited by the Pentagon as a threat to national security, posing as an example flooding at the US navy base in Norfolk, Virginia, affecting the operations and readiness of the service. “We can’t afford a candidate who doesn’t accept climate change,” Clinton said. “Maybe he’ll listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our security. “We need a president who believes in science and can lead America in fighting this threat, creating jobs and, yes, saving our planet.” The final word, however, belonged to Gore, who Clinton said she “couldn’t wait” to have as a White House adviser on climate change. “Americans have the ability to bring about such a big and important change, the will to change and build a brighter future is itself a renewable resource,” he said, drawing a loud: “That’s a great line, I love that!” from Clinton beside him."
"The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Monday that Canada will impose a tax on carbon emissions starting in 2018 as part of its efforts to meet targets set by the Paris climate change accord. Trudeau made the announcement in parliament as debate started over whether Canada should ratify the Paris accord on climate change. The House of Commons is expected to approve the Paris accord in a vote on Wednesday.  Trudeau said provinces and territories can either put a direct tax on carbon emissions of at least $10 Canadian ($7.60) a ton or adopt a cap-and-trade system. If a province fails to do either by 2018, the federal government will implement a basic carbon tax of $10 a ton, rising by $10 a ton per year until it reaches C$50 a ton by 2022. “There is no hiding from climate change,” Trudeau told the Commons. “It is real and it is everywhere. We cannot undo the last 10 years of inaction. What we can do is make a real and honest effort – today and every day – to protect the health of our environment, and with it, the health of all Canadians.” Trudeau argued that pricing carbon pollution will give Canada a “significant advantage” in building a cleaner economy, compel businesses to develop innovative ways to reduce emissions, and create hundreds of thousands of clean technology jobs. The Saskatchewan premier, Brad Wall, blasted Trudeau for unilaterally announcing his plan and not working with the provinces on a collaborative proposal. Provincial environment ministers were meeting with their federal counterpart when Trudeau surprised many with his announcement. “The level of disrespect shown by the prime minister and his government is stunning,” Wall said in a statement. “This new tax will damage our economy. The bottom line is that the Saskatchewan economy, already hurting from a downturn in commodity prices, will be one of the hardest hit by a new federal carbon tax because of our trade-exposed resource industries.” Alberta’s premier, Rachel Notley, said her oil-rich province will not support Ottawa’s climate change plan unless the federal government makes progress on new oil pipelines to Canada’s coasts. Trudeau’s government is expected to decide the fate of at least one major pipeline to the Pacific coast by the end of the year. Alberta already plans to implement a carbon tax but objects to the higher costs of Trudeau’s plans in later years. Canada’s most populous provinces, Ontario and Quebec, are joining in a cap-and-trade program. British Columbia already has a carbon tax. Trudeau said: “85% of the Canadian economy is located in provinces where there is pricing on carbon pollution in one shape or another. We are going to bring that up to 100%.”"

"One big storm and our climate and energy debate is surging back to peak stupid. Now Malcolm Turnbull has encouraged the campaign to use the South Australian blackout to slow the shift to clean energy, saying state renewable energy targets are “extremely unrealistic”.  Except all the evidence says the state targets are exactly what Australia needs to meet the promises the prime minister made in Paris last year about reducing greenhouse gases. Of course it would be preferable to have a consistent national policy to reach those goals, but it’s not exactly the states’ fault that we haven’t got one. That vacuum was Tony Abbott’s proud achievement, with the abolition of the carbon price and the winding back of the federal renewable energy target, after a lengthy debate about whether it should be abolished altogether, which of course dried up almost all investment in renewable energy. And consistent, credible national policy hasn’t been any more evident in the year since Turnbull took over either. His own officials admitted in a Senate inquiry this week they had undertaken no modelling at all about how to meet the target Turnbull pledged in Paris for reducing Australia’s emissions out to 2030. That’s the target he is about to ratify, the target that will be Australia’s legal obligation. But plenty of others have done modelling and analysis for him, and they all conclude that he won’t meet it, not with the Coalition’s current policies. They all say he will have to introduce significant new policies, including to shift electricity generation away from coal and towards renewables more quickly. In fact they all conclude that the state targets he so ridicules (Victoria’s 40% renewables by 2025, South Australia’s 50% by 2025, Queensland’s 50% by 2030) are more or less what he is going to have to try to achieve. There was his own Climate Change Authority report, which concluded electricity generation needed to produce zero emissions “well before 2050”. If that’s the goal and we haven’t got to 40% renewables by 2025, we’re in big trouble. There was the Climate Institute modelling, which found he needed to phase out high-carbon generation over the next 15 to 20 years or else face a crunch so severe after 2030 that it would cause severe economic disruption. And there was the recent Reputex report, which also concluded the Coalition’s current policies cannot reach its own targets, even factoring in the state-based renewable energy schemes Turnbull so criticises. It says he desperately needs a credible and consistent national policy, including measures to reduce emissions from power generation much faster. Who knew? Of course the government has to find ways to shift generation from fossil fuels to renewables while ensuring we keep the lights on, and while trying to minimise the increase in power costs. It could, for example, start the switch with an intensity-based emissions trading scheme for the electricity sector, which is Labor party policy and would therefore win bipartisan support, is very similar to the policy Turnbull proposed as opposition leader in 2009, and which the energy market regulator – the Australian Energy Market Commission – recommended he adopt last year and said could operate “without a significant effect on absolute price levels faced by consumers”. (It is also something the government’s “Direct Action” could be converted into, and most in the business community are assuming it will be.) It could extend the current watered-down federal renewable energy target, which ends in 2020. And Turnbull and his energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, absolutely should urgently consider how to make sure the electricity grid is better able to cope with increasingly frequent bouts of extreme weather. But whatever Turnbull does has to involve convincing the climate sceptics in his own party that change – and some impact on power prices – is inevitable. Backing in their belief that renewable energy can’t keep the lights on is a bad way to start. When Malcolm Roberts, the One Nation senator and former project leader of the climate-sceptic Galileo movement, tweets how great it is that Turnbull is “coming around to One Nation’s position” that’s not a good thing, not if the prime minister meant anything he said on this subject in the past or has any intention of keeping the promises he made in Paris. And whichever way he does it, he will still have to shift electricity generation to renewables, at least as quickly as the state targets are suggesting. The longer the delays, mired in the grand delusion that his current policy is fit for purpose, and the more he entertains the view of his conservative wing that renewable energy is just some kind of leftwing plot to take the country back to the dark ages, the bigger the economic shock and disruption when Australia finally gets around to doing what it has to. In his attack on the states this week, Turnbull said “You’ve got to take ideology out of it. You’ve got to work out what you want to achieve and then make sure that your measures will deliver that for you.” Exactly right. But what his government has done so far is the definition of putting ideology before sensible policy planning. That’s irresponsible, not the states’ attempts to fill a policy vacuum of the Coalition’s making."
