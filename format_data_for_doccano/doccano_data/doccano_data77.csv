Share this...FacebookTwitterNASA chief scientist Waleed Abdalati has issued a response to the letter of protest from 50 former esteemed scientists, engineers and astronauts. Unfortunately, his response only adds to NASA’s embarrassment.
Normally when a professional organisation gets a high level complaint from such a number of esteemed members, the first step is confirm and to look into it seriously. Something like: “Thanks – we’ve received your complaint; we’ll look into it and get back to you”.
Apparently the chief of NASA no longer bothers taking the precaution of following up and investigating high-gravity issues from within. He just dismisses them off the bat. Not only is this inappropriate, but it is also reckless managerial behavior.
Abdalati has failed to exercise due diligence in the face of a serious matter.
Here’s NASA’s “us-against-them” response:
NASA sponsors research into many areas of cutting-edge scientific inquiry, including the relationship between carbon dioxide and climate. As an agency, NASA does not draw conclusions and issue ‘claims’ about research findings. We support open scientific inquiry and discussion.
“Our Earth science programs provide many unique space-based observations and research capabilities to the scientific community to inform investigations into climate change, and many NASA scientists are actively involved in these investigations, bringing their expertise to bear on the interpretation of this information.
We encourage our scientists to subject these results and interpretations to scrutiny by the scientific community through the peer-review process. After these studies have met the appropriate standards of scientific peer-review, we strongly encourage scientists to communicate these results to the public.

If the authors of this letter disagree with specific scientific conclusions made public by NASA scientists, we encourage them to join the debate in the scientific literature or public forums rather than restrict any discourse.”
Sheesh – no wonder the Challenger blew up! Have they not learned anything?
Instead of sweeping serious issues under the carpet, how about contacting those with the grievance and looking into it to see if there is something behind it? Did you even bother to call them?
Did NASA tell Morton Thiokol engineers to take the peer-review route in 1986?! Who are they kidding?
NASA’s knee-jerk dismissal of the letter of complaint is dubious, and reveals an organisation that is no longer functioning correctly. Its off-hand decision to dismiss the letter is amateur, unprofessional and stunningly negligent. Here, unwillingness to investigate is cover-up.
Abdalati’s handling of this matter is a scandal, and is on par with a CEO ignoring a letter from 50 women managers bringing up sexual harassment issues.
Moreover, open scientific discourse begins by looking into claims of serious deficiencies, and not ignoring or suppressing them.

"The Labor leadership aspirant Jim Chalmers says the party’s entire policy agenda, including its ambitious 45% emissions reduction target, could be upended in the wake of Saturday’s shock election loss. “Everything is up for grabs,” Chalmers told the ABC TV’s Q&A program when asked whether Labor would review its climate policy.  Most of the panel discussion revolved around Chalmers, who confirmed he was considering nominating for Labor’s leadership ballot. Chalmers was repeatedly backed into a corner when asked how his party’s platform might shift in the aftermath of the disappointing result on Saturday. He was forced to acknowledge that something needed to change but unable yet to say what those changes might be. “All of these policies after an election loss are up for review, they’re up for discussion,” Chalmers said. “We have to reflect on that, obviously. We’re not going to pretend that we are not going to give consideration to all these policies. “Obviously the vote was disappointingly weak. I’m not going to pretend that away, I’m not going to try and sugarcoat that. “Our job now is not to engage in some year-long pity party or drag our arses around, our job now is to rebuild and renew and refresh.” Thanks @qanda for an excellent exposition of all the policies the Opposition won't be implementing because they lost the election two days ago. #qanda In an episode devoted mainly to campaign inquests, the retiring minister Christopher Pyne said he thought Malcolm Turnbull would have won the election had he not been dumped by the Liberal party last year. “What Scott did was … an amazing achievement. I think Malcolm would have won the election as well. I still believe that. We gave ourselves quite a handicap last August.” Pyne said complaints about Clive Palmer’s advertising spend – a $60m yellow campaign that heavily attacked the opposition leader Bill Shorten – were “sour grapes” and that the same criticism had not been directed at other third-party electioneering. “A lot of [Palmer’s advertising] was complete and utter rubbish. That’s his business. That’s his business whether he spent $60m. We don’t like what GetUp has done. We don’t like what the ACTU has done. They don’t donate to us. But that’s the way things are.” The business leader Ming Long said she did not think Palmer was “stupid” for spending so much money on a campaign where he polled about 3.4% of the national vote. “He’s a businessman,” she said. “He wants an investment for that $60m return. It’s important for the journalists and the media in our country to keep an eye on is there a deal. Is he getting some sort of return for that?” The journalist Alice Workman, of the Australian, highlighted how effective the Coalition campaign in regional Queensland had been at capturing concerns from coalminers about jobs. “Climate change means different things to people in inner-cities than it does to people in Queensland,” she said. Chalmers conceded that coal had hurt Labor in key central Queensland marginal seats. “Clearly in central Queensland and north Queensland we had a problem and that’s reflected in the results,” he said. “We would be dishonest if we tried to claim that coal didn’t play a part in that. But nationally, overwhelmingly, we need to deal with climate change. Nationally, renewable energy needs to play a bigger part of the mix.” Has “the silent majority” spoken? Are progressive parties like Labor out of touch with the majority of voters? #QandA pic.twitter.com/0eHkOda1XP In a rare hour of air time, particularly one so focused on the climate crisis, the controversial broadcaster Alan Jones managed to say little that was more outlandish than his coral-coloured suit jacket. He aimed a few barbs at Labor, using lines such as the “economic suicide note” which he had repeated ad nauseam during the election campaign. Finally, with a few moments of the panel discussion remaining, Jones could contain himself no more, trotting out a convoluted climate denial argument about the trace amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, one refuted by scientists as contrarian nonsense. Workman rolled her eyes and said: “Oh my God.” Jones retorted: “Alice, you’ve been speaking for most of the night.” The host, Tony Jones, suggested Jones might need to be fact checked. It was unclear whether he was referring to Workman’s air time, or the need to decipher the broadcaster’s personal climate science."

"It has taken Roger Tyers four days to reach Moscow by train from Kiev. His destination is Beijing: a trip that will take 14 days, with a couple of overnight stops along the way. Tyers, an environmental sociologist at the University of Southampton, is on his way to China to research attitudes to the environment, the climate emergency and personal responsibility. “Given that, I thought it would be somewhat hypocritical of me to fly,” he says over Skype from his hostel room. It has been months in the planning – he had to convince his bosses to give him a month off to travel to and from China. Has it been a pain? “It definitely has. It’s a matter of getting your train schedule in line with your visa requirements. I didn’t realise I needed a visa to travel through Mongolia, even though I’m not stopping there. There have been moments when I’ve been close to giving up and either cancelling the whole trip or just booking a flight.” But he is glad he has stuck with it, he says. “I have to prove it is possible.”  The no-fly movement is a small but growing community of people who are drastically reducing the number of flights they take, or giving up air travel altogether. Many campaigners say they feel flying is about to receive the same attention as shunning plastic or eating less meat because of its 2% contribution to global carbon emissions, predicted to grow to as much as 16% by 2050. In Sweden, where the movement has taken off, a new term has emerged: flygskam, meaning “flight shame”. Siân Berry, the co-leader of the Green party, has called on people to take no more than one flight a year and suggested a tax should be imposed on further journeys. Berry hasn’t flown since 2005. The climate activist Greta Thunberg hasn’t flown since 2015; she did her European tour last month by train. In January, she attended the World Economic Forum at Davos in Switzerland, travelling 32 hours each way by rail, while a record number of private jets – about 1,500 – brought the rich and powerful attendees. It is becoming harder to defend alleged hypocrisy, however well-meaning. The actor Emma Thompson was criticised for flying from Los Angeles to support the Extinction Rebellion protest in London, not only by the usual naysayers eager to point out double standards, but also by environmental campaigners. “She could just as easily have paid for a billboard poster in Piccadilly and got her message across there,” said Kevin Anderson, a climate scientist who hasn’t flown since 2004, on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The issue has been significant among environmental scientists for years; the Flying Less campaign, aimed at academia, has been running since 2015. Paul Chatterton, a professor of urban futures at the University of Leeds, also hasn’t flown since 2004. “I think every academic has to justify why they are flying to that particular ‘must-go’ conference. If we have something really important to say, say it in a different way.” He travels to European conferences by train. “One of the privileges of being a middle-income professional – and this is a direct plea to other middle-income professionals – is that you can negotiate with your boss and you have a bit more money to get the train. I’m not talking about people who can’t afford to do that, because I know trains are more expensive.” As for Chatterton’s no-fly family holidays, the best ones have been taking the ferry from Hull to Rotterdam and cycling around the Netherlands. “You travel light, you make it an adventure with your kids,” he says. “Who wants to sit in a departure lounge? You get the excitement of travelling through places, figuring out what the next journey is. I think we have to get back into the idea that travelling is special; it’s a privilege.” Most flying is carried out by a small proportion of the population. Aled Jones, the director of the Global Sustainability Institute at Anglia Ruskin University, says we have become used to the low-cost weekend flight abroad in a short space of time. “When I was growing up, and certainly for the generation before, flying on holiday was not something you expected to do,” he says. “By radically cutting down, we’re not going back to the dark ages; we’re going back to when people holidayed in the UK. It will be less of a sacrifice for a lot of people than we expect.” He admits that addressing “love miles” – flying to see family who live abroad – is “a very different challenge”. Maja Rosén, who lives in Sweden and gave up flying in 2008, had always kept quiet when friends talked about flying abroad on holidays – until last year. “I thought: ‘How is it possible I’m more scared of destroying the mood than climate collapse?’ I decided that my new year resolution last year would be to start asking some inconvenient questions. I realised that most people weren’t aware of the impact from flying and how huge it is.” She and a friend started a campaign, Flight-free 2019 (now Flight-free 2020), to encourage people to pledge not to fly. By the end of 2018, 15,000 Swedes had signed; by the end of this year, she thinks it will be 100,000. It has changed the conversation around flying in the country: passenger numbers dropped at Swedish airports in 2018, while a record number of people in the country took the train. “People don’t realise that what they do as an individual is so important because it affects those around them,” says Rosén. “If you keep flying, all your friends will as well. You contribute to the norm. But if you decide to give up flying or take a flight-free year, that makes others reflect. Change can happen fast as soon as enough people start acting. Before, people saw flying as an experience or something you do, it wasn’t in the category of consumption, but I think now people are starting to realise that by taking a flight they are a heavy consumer of fossil fuel.” There is now a British arm of the campaign, run by the writer Anna Hughes, who last took a flight eight years ago. More than 1,000 people have pledged to have a flight-free year. Hughes likens it to the Veganuary campaign, by which people give up animal products for January to raise awareness of veganism and change behaviour. She has travelled to Ireland, Denmark and other European countries – and seen a lot of the UK. “There is nowhere I can think of that I want to go that I can’t get to by bike, train or boat. If I was going to go further, I would just take a long time to do it.” The author Nicola Davies is taking long-haul flights for a couple of upcoming commitments, but after that she will radically rethink her flight consumption, she says. There will almost certainly be no more European flights; she has already travelled to the Balearic Islands in Spain by car. “We did the journey down to Barcelona in two days, then the ferry crossing is eight hours,” she says, adding that it requires a bit more planning than travelling by plane. “It’s much more exciting, much closer to the real skin of the planet than the feeling you get from going to an airport, popping into a metal tube and then popping out at some other point on the planet with no real grasp of the distance, habitat, people and cultures you’ve passed over on the way. “I think this shift to no, or fewer, flights is an opportunity to redraft what travel truly means, rather than a sort of consumerist ticking of boxes. If we give up the idea of the weekend break in Budapest or the three days in Miami for a stag do, I think that’s probably helpful – for us as human beings, as well as for the planet.” There are people who are reminding us that it is possible to travel overland with young children. “We’ve gone to Italy by train, Spain, different parts of France,” says Linda Thomas, a fashion designer. For the first couple of years, giving up flying felt like a loss, she says, but the train-travel website seat61.com has enabled them to plan more adventurous journeys. “We’ve had some really incredible wildlife experiences. There would be a feeling of guilt otherwise – that you’re seeing something, but also contributing to its demise at the same time, when you’ve taken a long-haul flight to get somewhere. It doesn’t feel like a loss; it feels like we’ve gained new experiences.” Wendy and her husband have cut down on flying in recent years and decided to stop altogether at the beginning of 2019. “We couldn’t really justify it any more. Something that was purely for fun didn’t feel enjoyable any more; it didn’t feel right.” They have had fantastic family holidays by train, starting with a trip to Chamonix in the French Alps with their six-month-old daughter, but Wendy says it has been hard not seeing her husband’s family, who live in Malaysia. Cath Heinemeyer, a researcher and community artist who hasn’t flown for 19 years, says visiting family has been a challenge. “My family live in Northern Ireland, my husband’s family live in Germany and we live in York. We do see them, but we see them less frequently, for a longer time.” She admits they haven’t faced family commitments that would be simplified by flying. “Our parents are in reasonable health. Maybe it will get challenging if we’re suddenly called to support them in their later years. We would have to decide that on a case-by-case basis.” It can be more expensive – “You need to get a bit savvy about booking” – and it requires research, she says. “We have had mishaps, where we’ve had tiny children and missed a train connection and had to find last-minute accommodation in some city.” Heinemeyer felt a twinge of regret at missing her high school reunion in Canada, but otherwise not flying hasn’t felt like a sacrifice, she says. “I like the children to realise how far they’ve travelled and see how the landscape changes. It’s just a thing we’ve always worked around. Your journey becomes part of your holiday.” Lewis McNeil, a project manager for the charity the Orchard Project, proved the viability of long-haul overland travel after he gave up flying in 2006. There was “a ‘letting go’ period akin to the end of a relationship, but things got exciting when I realised that one can still travel, and travel far, while creating a fraction of the emissions that air travel is responsible for”, he says. He has gone by coach to many European destinations, finding the train too expensive if booked last-minute, but his most intrepid no-fly holiday was a nine-day cargo-ship journey from France to Trinidad in the Caribbean, booked through a specialist company, then on to Venezuela by boat. “The idea behind this is that you’re piggybacking on emissions that are already going to be emitted – that cargo ship, as unsustainable as it is with our crazy trade system, is going anyway. With flying, flights depend on demand.” The journey was magical. “Watching dolphins and whales, seeing incredible starlit skies in the middle of the Atlantic, swimming in the little plunge pool, swotting up on Spanish, making friends with the Filipino crew and sharing music. It was pretty expensive, at €90 (£79) per person a day, but that included food and a lovely en suite room complete with a porthole and a writing desk.” He returned from Colombia to the Netherlands. The key to flight-free travel, he says, is “seeing the journey as part of the adventure” – although travel pillows, eye masks, earplugs, snacks, books and a tablet with films downloaded all help. After Moscow, Tyers will get the Trans-Siberian railway to Irkutsk, then on to Beijing. “Not everybody can do it, I understand that,” he says. “Not everybody has the time, or bosses who are willing to let people take longer to get places. But for those who can – and I think a lot more people can than realise – flying less is good; it’s enriching.” He is pessimistic that people will change voluntarily to the degree needed. “But we’ll see. Often the cultural change comes first, then political change – and I do think there’s something in the air.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterSulfur Dioxide and Arctic Warming
By Ed Caryl
Sulfur dioxide, SO2, is not a greenhouse gas. But it should not be ignored when discussing climate. We know that the SO2 injected into the stratosphere by large volcanoes such as Agung, El Chichon, and Pinatubo, can cause cooling for a period of years. This is because of the reflective haze created by SO2 combining with water vapor to create sulphuric acid aerosol that then takes two or three years to fall down to altitudes where they find enough water vapor to grow, form clouds, and rain out.
We know that SO2 from industry and fossil fueled power plants form smogs and low clouds that produce acid rain down wind from the sources. We know what damage acid rain can do when the acid content is high enough to harm plant life. But little attention has been paid to the climate effects of the smogs themselves.
We know that low clouds and fogs keep surface temperatures from falling at night, as well as keeping surface temperatures from rising during daylight.
We know that in the polar regions in winter it is night all the time.
Now put those things together. In the Arctic, in winter, smogs and low clouds caused by SO2 will trap heat below them 24 hours a day, and in the spring will prevent sunlight from reaching and warming the surface. On the Arctic Ocean, this will delay both freezing in the winter and melting in the spring.

Figure 1: NORSEX ice extent for the last five years plus 2012 to date.
 We can see clearly that the freeze-up in the Arctic has been delayed in recent years compared to the 1979 to 2006 average. Because the freeze-up is delayed, there is less ice to thaw in the spring, so that delay is less obvious, except that the ice minimum is also delayed compared to the average. Now we get to why? First, we look at two temperature anomaly maps of the Arctic.

Figure 2a and 2b: Temperature anomaly maps from Climate4You of the Arctic for all of 2011 and March of 2012. Note the location of the warming.

Now another map. This is a map of northern Russia.

Figure 3: Google map of northern Russia. The indicator on the map is the location of Norilsk.
Norilsk is the location of the world’s largest nickel mine. They also recover copper, cobalt, platinum, and palladium. Nearby, coal is mined to support the power needs of the city (130,000 population), the mine, and the smelter operations. SO2 emissions are about one million metric tons per year. This one location is responsible for 1% of all the SO2 emissions in the world, 10% of all of Europe’s emissions.
CNN reports that there is not a single living tree within 48 kilometers (30 miles) of the nickel smelter. 2,832 square kilometers (1093 square miles) of forest have been killed, and another 5371 square kilometers (2073 square miles) have been damaged. For a full report on the damage read this pdf document.
Norilsk Mining has other smelters on the Kola Peninsula very close to the Norwegian border. They also emit large amounts of SO2. Both locations are well above the Arctic Circle. All these emissions are within a very sensitive part of the Earth: the Arctic.
During the winter, the winds in the Arctic are variable, depending on the position of the Arctic front. The winds alternate between blowing to and from the land, moving any pollution over the Arctic Ocean or inland. In Figure 2b, in March,
the pollution from Norilsk was moving over the ocean much of the time. You can see the ebb and flow of the winds as they moved the sea ice in an animation of the last year here (from NRL).
Normally, SO2 is not a greenhouse gas, but it is in the dark of winter in the Arctic. In combination with water vapor, which is a greenhouse gas, it produces smog and low clouds that reflect heat back to the surface when it is dark, and upward into space when the sun shines. This distorts the melting and freezing patterns resulting in less ice in the Arctic Ocean. Yes, the reduction in ice in the Arctic is anthropogenic, with a Russian accent.
One thing people don’t know is that the platinum/palladium used in in automotive catalytic converters comes from Norilsk. We are simply moving the pollution from a distributed source, automobiles, to a concentrated source in Siberia. We are all responsible for Arctic warming.
Postscript: Norilsk Mining plans to reduce SO2 emissions by two-thirds as soon as they develop the necessary technology. They think this can be done by 2015 or 2020. Just in time for the general global cooling.

"It’s going to be hard for those who care about and work on climate change but we must dust ourselves off, because neither despair nor emigrating to New Zealand will help solve the mess Australia’s climate policy is in. The government has been re-elected with a minimalist climate policy and a weak emissions target, despite widespread community support for action on climate change. Where to from here?  The near term looks grim. The Coalition government will feel locked into its stance against climate action, even if many smart heads in government will understand that a do-nothing approach is unwise. The Labor party might feel that its progressive stance on climate change hurt it. Tax policy might have swung the election, but climate change clearly played a role. But climate policy will not be stuck there, even if it is a slow and hard road. There are strong international pressures, most of the Australian business community does not want the economy stuck in the past, and the states will not accept a vacuum on climate and energy policy. The world has started the transition to a low-carbon energy and industrial system. Australia’s best bet is to make use of our tremendous opportunities for low-carbon energy production. Hanging on for grim death to the high-carbon industries of the last century is no economic strategy. The world will not carve out a niche for Australia to continue prospering as a 20th-century style high carbon economy. Global demand for coal will fall. The future for our energy industries is in cheap renewable energy. All that before we even consider our country’s vital interest in a strong global climate effort. We are on the frontline of climate change impacts. Meanwhile in our public and political debate, obfuscation and scaremongering must not win out over analysis and strategy. We need a real national conversation about what role Australia can play in the low-carbon economy of the future. We need to understand where the economic opportunities lie, we need a blueprint for a low-carbon energy and industrial system to encourage investors. And we will need to support the regions and communities where economic activity will dry up, particularly coal regions. Why are we not getting there? Tony Abbott put the finger on it in his concession speech after losing his seat in parliament. “Where climate change is a moral issue we Liberals do it tough. But where climate change is an economic issue we do very well,” said the man who gained the prime ministership by stoking fear about a carbon tax. In electorates that are not affluent, fear about cuts to income are potent. Labor focused on strong ambition for climate outcomes but did not talk much about how to achieve it, or the costs and benefits. It got stung by shoddy claims that a strong emissions target would be very costly, to which Labor did not have a good answer. Cutting emissions can be achieved with low economic cost and some direct benefits, even before considering climate damages avoided. Wind and solar power are now by far the cheapest ways to produce electricity from newly built plants in Australia. A sensible policy would be to facilitate the rapid investment in renewables, guide an orderly exit from coal, and encourage industry to move to zero-carbon energy sources. Various state governments see it that way. If the do-nothing approach prevails, the national electricity market will continue to be in a mess. More coal power stations will exit suddenly when old equipment fails. Replacement investment in renewables and storage will not be ready, causing power prices to shoot up like they did after the closure of Hazelwood. Without a low-carbon roadmap, money spent ensuring reliability of the grid will not be what is needed long term. The federal government may again be tempted to subsidise the refurbishment of old coal plants, and to lavish coal subsidies on Queensland. The incumbent energy industries will see their profits will remain high. Consumers, energy-using businesses and taxpayers will pay the bill, and emissions will be unnecessarily high. With effective policy, things could be very different. Australia could meet practically all of its energy use from solar and wind power. We could use green electricity and renewables-based hydrogen in industry and in transport. We could build up an industry that produces green hydrogen, ammonia, aluminium and steel for export to countries who are less fortunate than Australia in their endowment with renewable energy opportunities. Those industries could grow larger than the coal and gas industry now is. They could last indefinitely and help the world decarbonise. To the many people in Australia who care deeply about climate change and dedicate some of their life to finding solutions, the election outcome will seem like a hard blow. But do not despair, do not retreat. Continue your work, with objectivity, integrity and dedication. Countries that produce and export large amounts of fossil fuels have an uphill battle for forward looking policy on climate. But the opportunities in the global shift to clean energy are compelling, and coal is not the future. Let’s insist on having that national conversation. • Frank Jotzo is the director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University"
"When a letter from BlackRock’s founder and chief executive, Larry Fink, landed in inboxes in January saying that the world’s biggest investor would no longer invest in companies that are not compliant with the Paris climate agreement, people took notice. The media jumped on the announcement, which appeared to herald a new era of finance facing up to the perils of the climate emergency. The letter was a hoax, carried out by the Yes Men, a group of pranksters with a history of embarrassing big companies. But while the message was fake, the concern behind it was not: environmental campaigners see BlackRock as a key obstacle to progress on meeting climate crisis goals. Now they are stepping up the pressure on the world’s biggest asset manager – which faces its shareholders at its annual meeting on Thursday – to use its influence on some of the world’s biggest polluters, as it has done previously on issues such as executive pay. Fink, who was paid $24m (£18.8m) in 2018, began BlackRock as part of Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity group, and spun it out in 1995. Since then, New York-based BlackRock has risen to become an investing behemoth, controlling $6.5tn in assets – a value more than twice the annual output of the UK economy. That staggering size has placed BlackRock at the heart of the global fossil fuel industry: it is the largest investor in coal worldwide, according to InfluenceMap, an environmental campaign group, and has by far the highest density of coal holdings of the world’s 10 largest investors. BlackRock effectively owns 2.1bn tonnes of thermal coal reserves, based on the size of its stakes in major miners. BlackRock is counted among the top three shareholders in every oil “supermajor” bar France’s Total, and is among the top 10 shareholders in seven of the 10 biggest coal producers, according to Guardian analysis of data from financial information firm S&P. Yet Fink, 66, who moves in US Democrat political circles, argues it is not his company’s duty to fight the climate emergency. In the real version of his annual letter to shareholders, published in January, Fink said that his overriding duty is to make customers money. “Our firm is built to protect and grow the value of our clients’ assets,” Fink wrote. “We often get approached by special interest groups who advocate for BlackRock to vote with them on a cause. In many cases, I or other senior managers might agree with that same cause – or we might strongly disagree – but our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter here. Our decisions are driven solely by our fiduciary duty to our clients.” After publication of this article, BlackRock contacted the Guardian to clarify it that considers climate change a significant investment risk that has the potential to impact the long-term value of many companies. Critics argue this approach is not financially sustainable in the long term, given the likelihood that the climate crisis is expected to make some business models redundant or even illegal through measures such as bans on petrol- and diesel-powered cars or fossil fuel companies being forced to leave oil in the ground. Lauren Compere, a managing director at Boston Common Asset Management, a US investor, said investor action on the climate emergency was “not about being political”, but was rather a case of looking at the risks presented by the crisis to savers’ assets. Compere, whose job involves engaging with companies over issues such as the climate crisis, said other investment funds could put greater pressure on businesses. “There are big players that could be more proactive, more consistent, and frankly should probably be leveraging their assets more,” she said. “Across the globe it is not acceptable to sit on the fence not leveraging your assets.” Casey Harrell, a senior campaigner at the Sunrise Project, part of a broad coalition of groups putting pressure on BlackRock’s environmental record, said: “There is a real big disconnect between words and deeds that needs to be highlighted.” Investment strategies that follow environmentally friendly companies should be part of BlackRock’s core offer to clients, rather than an option they must actively choose, he added. BlackRock has acknowledged the growing demand for greener investment products as it tries to gain millennials as customers and employees. In October 2017 it hired Barack Obama’s former climate change adviser, Brian Deese, to be managing director of its sustainable investing business, which now has $32bn in assets under management. Former UK chancellor George Osborne is another part-time employee, earning £650,000 a year, although climate crisis was not included on the list of topics – such as China and European politics – that he is advising on. Regarding investment attitudes towards companies that are undeniably contributing to the climate emergency, BlackRock and other major investors argue it is better to push for change from within. After publication BlackRock contacted the Guardian to clarify that the large majority of its equity holdings are held through index funds and ETFs, which are designed to track indices controlled by third parties in which customers have chosen to invest. As a result, BlackRock focuses on engaging with companies to understand how they are managing material risks, including climate related risks, a spokeswoman said. With BlackRock’s scale, meaningful engagement would be a gargantuan task. BlackRock’s stewardship team of 43 people – which decides how BlackRock votes at shareholder meetings – must cover every major listed company in the world across 90 markets. When it does engage, evidence of progress is limited. BlackRock said it had 232 “engagements” with companies on climate-related matters during the year to June 2018. Only a fifth of the companies bothered to respond in “substantive fashion” to requests to disclose climate risks to their businesses – or to say why they did not plan to do so. BlackRock could not provide any quantitative evidence that its engagement approach was working. Research by Majority Action, a pressure group, found that BlackRock lags many of its rivals in supporting climate-related resolutions.In the year ending 31 August 2018, BlackRock supported only 23% of climate crisis reporting proposals – to make companies report their carbon dioxide emissions or their exposure to climate emergency-related risks – compared with 33% at US-based Vanguard and 85% at the UK’s largest asset manager, Legal & General. In some cases BlackRock has stood in the way of environmental action. The company voted against a 2018 proposal for Royal Dutch Shell to carry out detailed scenario planning for a world affected by temperature rises of 2°C, “because we found the proposal overly prescriptive”. In the case of US oil company Chevron, BlackRock was among the investors that could have tipped the balance in favour of imposing targets for reducing emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas. Some 45% of shareholders voted in favour, but BlackRock and Vanguard, both of which held more than 6% of the votes, opposed the motion. In a statement to the Guardian, BlackRock said it was better, given the firm’s commitment to long-term investment in businesses, to discuss climate policy with companies than to challenge them through shareholder resolutions. “Given the multi-year nature of the energy transition and the challenge of addressing climate change, our process emphasises engagement before voting because we find that is the most effective way to achieve productive outcomes in our clients’ long-term interests.” While BlackRock is by no means the only investor dragging its feet on climate issues, its power and totemic place at the top of the investment world mean it could have an outsized impact, according to activists. “There’s a bit of a herding mentality in the institutional investors,” said Jeanne Martin, a senior campaigner on fossil fuels at ShareAction, a responsible investment charity. “If they start using their shareholder rights at these companies that would really shift the dial.” • This article was amended on 23 May 2019 to insert clarifications from BlackRock."
"The chief executive of National Grid has warned that Labour’s renationalisation proposals would hold back the UK’s move to cleaner energy and mean higher prices for customers, as the company reported an £1.8bn annual profit. National Grid, which runs the UK’s national electricity network, said its profit for the 12 months to 31 March was down by nearly a third from £2.7bn the year before. It wrote off £137m of costs spent to connect two nuclear UK projects in Cumbria and Wales that were cancelled, and also took a financial hit from a seven-month labour dispute at its US business. Mounting a staunch defence against Labour’s proposals to renationalise the FTSE 100 company, John Pettigrew, the chief executive, described them as a huge distraction. He indicated that nationalising power networks could lead to higher costs, which would be passed on to consumers, who pay for energy transmission through their utility bills. “It’s very clear that it will not either accelerate the decarbonisation agenda in the UK, not will it result in lower costs for customers. It will delay the decarbonisation in the UK and potentially increase costs for customers.” National Grid became a commercial business in 1990 when the UK’s electricity industry was privatised. It listed on the London stock exchange five years later. Pettigrew said when he started out in the industry 30 years ago, there was “slow decision making, bureaucracy and it felt like Yes Minister”. He added: “You need operations that are nimble and can make decisions quickly.” He said the UK had a world-class energy network and stressed that National Grid was ramping up investment to £5bn a year, from £4.5bn last year. It is putting £2.2bn into interconnectors – transmission cables for electricity to other countries – and 90% of the energy delivered by them will be clean. Labour argues that taking the companies that control the UK’s £62bn energy infrastructure back into state ownership is key to decarbonising the economy, and would end the rip-off of customers, with shareholders paid £13bn in dividends over the past five years. Nationalisation would affect National Grid and the network arms of Scottish Power and SSE, which control the pipes and cables that supply homes and businesses with gas and electricity. Labour and consumer groups have criticised National Grid and other energy infrastructure firms for making big profits and paying out large sums to shareholders, while consumers pay for the cost of maintaining the network through their bills. Rebecca Long Bailey, Labour’s shadow business and energy secretary, said about National Grid’s results: “These figures speak for themselves … As a country we face a huge challenge to rapidly decarbonise our energy system while bringing costs down for households – and we simply cannot afford to continue with a privatised monopoly that puts the public at such a structural disadvantage.” National Grid paid £1.2bn in dividends to shareholders last year. Pettigrew acknowledged that the regulatory environment would get tougher. Ofgem wants to reduce the amount of cash which is flowing into the pockets of shareholders, by setting the rate of return paid to investors at 3% to 5%, rather than the current 7%. However, National Grid argues that a fair return would be 5.5%. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “Statutory profit is down markedly, returns on equity are under pressure and the company is hit by a write-off relating to cancelled nuclear power plants. “At least the inflation-protected dividend is intact and reassuringly the company has renewed its commitment to grow the payout in line with RPI inflation going forward.”"

Already today they have the means to control global climate, they say. A world without ills awaits you! What are you waiting for?
Excerpts of Joe Biden speaking at Cypress Bay High School graduation ceremony (emphasis added, and not in order):
Imagine the breakthroughs that are on the horizon and just beyond it. Imagine by the time you’re in a position to buy your first home, putting a roof of solar shingles that will cost no more than today’s ordinary shingles that will be able to power your home, heating, cooling, running appliances at a fraction of the cost your parents pay today.  Imagine a world in which hunger is vanquished by crops that don’t depend on the soil or water or fertilizer or pesticides to thrive! They’re just around the corner. Imagine famine being a memory — and with it, the end of so much war and conflict that plagues so much parts of the world! Imagine a day when the lightweight materials, cleaner fuels, [and] advanced engines simultaneously make our air cleaner — allowing us to go the equivalent of hundreds of miles to the gallon. And maybe, most importantly, freeing us from our dependence on foreign oil and all that entails for a nation. Imagine a day within your lifetime when doctors can and will engineer your white blood cells to attack cancer cells and leave healthy cells untouched, allowing cancer patients to live out a full life without undergoing the difficulty some of you observe, painful chemotherapy and radiation procedures. Imagine a day, when in your, doctors are able to regenerate entire body parts and limbs that have been damaged and lost, not only saving tens of thousands of lives, but restoring the thousands of  our Iraq and Afghan veterans coming back in need of prostheses, so they will be able to live a full and ambulatory life.”
If his audience believes all that, then those graduation caps really need to be replaced with dunce hats.
Remember:  if anything ever happened to Obama, he’d be President! With a little luck, only another half year before we’re out of the woods.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPhysicist and meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls was interviewed by Bettina Hahne-Waldscheck of the Swiss magazine “factum“.I’ve translated and summarized the interview, paraphrasing for brevity.
factum: You’ve been criticising the theory of man-made global warming for years. How did you become skeptical?
Puls: Ten years ago I simply parroted what the IPCC told us. One day I started checking the facts and data – first I started with a sense of doubt but then I became outraged when I discovered that much of what the IPCC and the media were telling us was sheer nonsense and was not even supported by any scientific facts and measurements. To this day I still feel shame that as a scientist I made presentations of their science without first checking it. The CO2-climate hysteria in Germany is propagated by people who are in it for lots of money, attention and power.
factum: Is there really climate change?
Puls: Climate change is normal. There have always been phases of climate warming, many that even far exceeded the extent we see today. But there hasn’t been any warming since 1998. In fact the IPCC suppliers of data even show a slight cooling.
factum: The IPCC is projecting 0.2°C warming per decade, i.e. 2 to 4°C by the year 2100. What’s your view?
Puls: These are speculative model projections, so-called scenarios – and not prognoses. Because of climate’s high complexity, reliable prognoses just aren’t possible. Nature does what it wants, and not what the models present as prophesy. The entire CO2-debate is nonsense. Even if CO2 were doubled, the temperature would rise only 1°C. The remainder of the IPCC’s assumed warming is based purely on speculative amplification mechanisms. Even though CO2 has risen, there has been no warming in 13 years.
factum: How does sea level rise look?
Puls: Sea level rise has slowed down. Moreover, it has dropped a half centimeter over the last 2 years. It’s important to remember that mean sea level is a calculated magnitude, and not a measured one.  There are a great number of factors that influence sea level, e.g. tectonic processes, continental shifting, wind currents, passats, volcanoes. Climate change is only one of ten factors.
factum: What have we measured at the North Sea?
Puls: In the last 400 years, sea level at the North Sea coast has risen about 1.40 meters. That’s about 35 centimeters per century. In the last 100 years, the North Sea has risen only 25 centimeters.
factum: Does the sea level rise have anything to do with the melting North Pole?
Puls: That’s a misleading conclusion. Even if the entire North Pole melted, there would be no sea level rise because of the principles of buoyancy.
factum: Is the melting of the glaciers in the Alps caused by global warming?
Puls: There are many factors at play. As one climbs a mountain, the temperature drops about 0.65°C per 100 meters. Over the last 100 years it has gotten about 0.75°C warmer and so the temperature boundary has shifted up about 100 meters. But observations tell us that also ice 1000 meters up and higher has melted. Clearly there are other reasons for this, namely soot and dust. But soot and dust do not only have anthropogenic origins; they are also caused by nature via volcanoes, dust storms and wildfires. Advancing and retreating of glaciers have always taken place throughout the Earth’s history. Glaciology studies clearly show that glaciers over the last 10,0000 years were smaller on average than today.
factum: In your view, melting Antarctic sea ice and the fracture of a huge iceberg 3 years ago are nothing to worry about?

Puls: To the contrary, the Antarctic ice cap has grown both in area and volume over the last 30 years, and temperature has declined. This 30-year trend is clear to see. The Amundsen Scott Station of the USA shows that temperature has been declining there since 1957. 90% of the Earth’s ice is stored in Antarctica, which is one and half times larger than Europe.
factum: Then why do we always read it is getting warmer down there?
Puls: Here they are only talking about the West Antarctic peninsula, which is where the big chunk of ice broke off in 2008 – from the Wilkins-Shelf. This area is hardly 1% of the entire area of Antarctica, but it is exposed to Southern Hemisphere west wind drift and some of the strongest storms on the planet.
factum: What causes such massive chunks of ice to break off?
Puls: There are lots of factors, among them the intensity of the west wind fluctuations. These west winds have intensified over the last 20 years as part of natural ocean and atmospheric cycles, and so it has gotten warmer on the west coast of the Antarctic peninsula. A second factor are the larger waves associated with the stronger storms. The waves are more powerful and so they break off more ice. All these causes are meteorological and physical, and have nothing to do with a climate catastrophe.
factum: Then such ice breaks had to have occurred in the past too?
Puls: This has been going on for thousands of years, also in the 1970s, back when all the talk was about “global cooling”. Back then there were breaks with ice chunks hundreds of square kilometres in area. People were even discussing the possibilities of towing these huge ice chunks to dry countries like South Africa or Namibia in order to use them as a drinking water supply.
factum: What about all the media photos of polar bears losing their ice?
Puls: That is one of the worst myths used for generating climate hysteria. Polar bears don’t eat ice, they eat seals. Polar bears go hungry if we shoot their food supply of seals. The polar bear population has increased with moderately rising temperatures, from 5000 50 years ago to 25,000 today.
factum: But it is true that unlike Antarctica, the Arctic is melting?
Puls: It has been melting for 30 years. That also happened twice already in the last 150 years. The low point was reached in 2007 and the ice has since begun to recover. There have always been phases of Arctic melting. Between 900 and 1300 Greenland was green on the edges and the Vikings settled there.
factum: And what do you say about the alleged expanding deserts?
Puls: That doesn”t exist. For example the Sahara is shrinking and has lost in the north an area as large as Germany over the last 20 years. The same is true in the South Sahara. The famine that struck Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia was mainly caused by the leasing of large swaths of land to large international corporations so that they could grow crops for biofuels for Europe, and by war. But it is much easier for prosperous Europe to blame the world’s political failures on a fictional climate catastrophe instead.
factum: So we don’t need to do anything against climate change?
Puls: There’s nothing we can do to stop it. Scientifically it is sheer absurdity to think we can get a nice climate by turning a CO2 adjustment knob. Many confuse environmental protection with climate protection. it’s impossible to protect the climate, but we can protect the environment and our drinking water. On the debate concerning alternative energies, which is sensible, it is often driven by the irrational climate debate. One has nothing to do with the other.

Commissar Connie demands your data – or else face enforcement action.
EU Environment Commissar Connie Hedegaard, of tiny Denmark, is getting tough with economic and political behemoths like USA, China and Russia…to name a few.
Reuters writes:

But at least China is not taking this lightly, as they are threatening to impound EU planes should Hedegaard and all the napoleonic enviro-bureaucrats in the EU not back down.
Wei Zhenzhong, secretary general of the China Air Transport Association, said:
We would not like to see a situation of ‘you hold up my planes and I hold yours’. The government will take at least the same kind of measures, and these anti-sanction moves will be lasting,”
But the EU enviro-bureaucrats think it’s okay to boss the rest of the world around. Reuters writes:
The EU says such action is needed to meet the bloc’s environmental targets and fill a vacuum left by international failure to deal with aviation emissions.”
China has already postponed orders for Airbus planes worth $14 billion. Those are orders Boeing surely has an eye on. Expect Hedegaard to come under lots of pressure from other EU pols more concerned about jobs and urgently work on a face-saving measure.

Recently I happened to look through some scientific papers and articles on global warming and the various forcing factors that affect our climate.
One that caught my eye was a paper by N.A. Krivova and S.K. Solanki [2003] called: Solar variability and global warming: a statistical comparison since 1850.

http://www.solen.info/solar/cyclcomp.html, web page prepared by Jan Alvestad
In the conclusions of the paper they state:
We have shown that even in extreme cases that solar variability caused all the global climate change prior to 1970, it cannot have been responsible for more than 30% (50% for the intercalibration Willson, 1997) of the strong global temperature rise since 1970.”
WUWT also reported the authors saying (emphasis added):
However, it is also clear that since about 1980, while the total solar radiation, its ultraviolet component, and the cosmic ray intensity all exhibit the 11-year solar periodicity, there has otherwise been no significant increase in their values. In contrast, the Earth has warmed up considerably within this time period. This means that the Sun is not the cause of the present global warming.”
While I agree that the sun was most likely behind all the warming since 1850 and earlier, I cannot agree that the sun was not behind the warming since 1970. The link may not be immediate or short term but a lagged connection nevertheless. The average decadal sunspot number during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s were 84.2, 67.2 and 49.6 respectively. The average mean global temperature anomalies during the same decades (HADCRUT3GL) were +0.079°C, +0.235°C, and +0.411°C respectively.
I went back and crunched the numbers for UAH satellite global temperature data and got mean temperature anomalies of -0.135°C, -0.0295°C and 0.0178°C. So on a decadal basis the sun and the global temperatures seem not to be correlated when measured by satellite or ground stations during the last 3 decades. Was Solanki correct then after all?
No. And there may be a logical explanation. Let’s take a decade at a time. The two graphs at the end of this article illustrate the average decadal sunspot numbers and average global temperature anomalies (hadcrut3gl) for the period 1900- 2010. But first the last 3 decades:
2000-2009 average decadal sunspot number was 49.6, down from 67.2 the decade before.  The average decadal mean global temperature anomaly was 0.411°C up from 0.235°C the decade before.
* The actual solar activity was naturally down since solar Cycle No. 23 was declining to its minimum.
* The decade’s temperatures were influenced by the lagged solar Cycle No. 22 and 23 which together had 4 active solar years averaging 113.
* PDO and AMO were mostly positive correlating with a warm mode in the Pacific and Atlantic. PDO stated to go negative in late 2007.
* North Pacific Ocean SST anomalies were rising and then declining after 2005 causing global atmosphere temperatures to stay high [but flat with no rise].
* There were 4 El Nino’s.
1990-1999 average decadal sunspot number was 67.2 down from 84.2 the decade before. The average decadal mean temperature anomaly was 0.235°C up from 0.079°C the decade before.
* The actual solar activity was higher than the following decade but lower than the previous with parts Cycle No. 22 and 23.
* The decade’s temperature was influenced by the lagged Cycle No. 21 and 22 which also had 5 active solar years 131.4.
* PDO was positive the entire decade, AMO was positive about half the decade.
* Significant El Nino in 1997/1998, 1994/1995, 1991/1992.
* North Pacific Ocean SST anomalies were mostly rising except after the 1997/1998 El Nino.
* There were 3 El Nino’s.
1980 1989 average decadal sunspot number was 84.2, up from 61.2, the decade before. 
The average decadal mean temperature anomaly was + 0.079C, up from -0.103 C
* The actual solar activity was up with influence from solar cycles 21 and 22
* The decade’s temperatures were influenced by lagged solar cycle 20 and 21 which had 3 active solar years averaging 134
* PDO was positive or warm mode, AMO was negative
* Significant EL Nino 1986/1987 North Pacific Ocean SST anomalies were fluctuating
* There were 2 El Nino’s.

Bob Tisdale in his blog and his article called Can El NINO events explain all of the global warming since 1976 parts 1 and 2 explains how a series of El Niños events could account for the major changes in global temperatures since 1976 through certain key El Ninos . The more significant El Nino in effect were 1997/1998, 1991/1992 and 1994/1995 and 1987/1988. See the graph below from Bob’s blog.
From my own analysis, during positive or warm phase of PDO and AMO, there are significantly greater number (2.5 times) of strong El Ninos than strong LA Ninas and more El Nino months compared to La Nina months .There were less La Nina’s in total as well .
Strong ElNinos seem to follow about 9-11 years after the previous strong solar maximum. 2009/2010 El Nino followed about nine years after the solar maximum period (4 months) of Cycle No. 23. The El Nino of 1997/1998 followed the very active solar maximum period (5 months) of Cycle No. 22. The same happened with the biggest El Nino ever recorded in 1878 which followed the solar max of 1869-1872.
PDO index tracks a spatial pattern of SST anomalies that, when it is cold in the western and central part of the North Pacific and warm in the eastern part of the North Pacific, the index has positive values. A more positive PDO index is typically a result of both more positive and warmer SST anomalies in the NE Pacific in combination with more negative or cooler SST anomalies in the NW and Central Pacific.
The AMO has been basically warm or positive mode during the period 1995-2012. So we have both the PDO and AMO as positive correlating with more warmer water along the coast of North East Pacific ocean and the North Atlantic ocean.

Summary
There appears to have been a correlation between solar activity and global temperatures going back for thousands of years as given by many peer reviewed papers, some of which have been posted on this blog very recently. In my graphs, the correlation appears to be there for the decades 1900 to 1940′s as the decadal average sunspot number and
the decadal average mean global temperature anomalies seem to rise together. In the 1950′s  solar activity and global temperature anomalies went in opposite directions when we had major solar activity (91.7 average decadal solar sunspot number) but the decadal global temperature anomalies were flat or slightly down as the PDO was negative correlating with more  cooler water in Pacific North East than in the Northwest and Central  Pacific. Also global SST were cooler in the 1950s. Scientists have been looking at
various lag factors and other concepts to get a better handle on the sun/ocean/atmosphere link.
In my judgment the reason why sometime global temperatures and solar activity do not correlate is that the ocean cycles are out of sync with solar effects during certain decades. This was apparent during the cool period of 1950’s to 1970’s where colder ocean cycles in the Pacific and Atlantic as correlated by negative PDO and negative AMO reduced the “lagged” warming effect of some strong solar cycles especially the strong solar maximum around 1956 -1960. Ocean cycles seem to overide or nullify decadal solar effects in certain decades.
Yet during the period 1980-2010, the solar activity was slowly  declining but both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans were both  positive correlating with a warm mode (AMO and PDO both positiv)], resulting in the global surface temperatures going up while the sunactivity was declining. It is no coincidence that during this last decade when the lagged
effects of the decline of last solar cycle# 23 and the decline of the ocean cycles as reflected by AMO and PDO indices, both of which are now in sync, that global temperatures should  also  decline. This makes sense to me and it disproves claims that solar effects were not responsible for the 1980 to 2010 global warming.

What follows is the mean global temperature anomaly for each decade. Note overall it correlates with sunpsot activity:

The following chart is from from Climate 4 You sun section web page and illustrates the trend of the sunspot number since 1700. Notice the dips that correspond to cooler periods for the global temperatures including the 1960s, 1970s:

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe global warming movement really started up in the late 80s. Even back then blowhard scientists were telling us that the science was settled. And because the science was in fact not really settled and poorly understood, many fell into the trap of making downright stupid predictions.Today, 20 to 25 years later, it is good time to go back and look at how all these “settled” predictions are turning out. Most, we will find, were the sort of thing one typically hears from fortune-tellers.
One example is Hartmut Grassl, who was director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg until 2005, and a harsh critic of Die kalte Sonne book. Hat tip: Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s excellent “Die kalte Sonne” debunking site.
As we will see, instead of bringing prestige to the once renown institutes, many blowhard, the-science-is-settled fortune tellers will wind up being dark, embarrassing chapters that these once prestigious institutes will certainly be ashamed of in the future.
Maybe I’m being a bit too hard saying this. But scientists who succumb to dogma, politics, or just pure money, deserve no less. With each passing day they are beginning to appear more and more like arrogant, inflated ego scientists who thought they could win the day by claiming an authority that had obviously been misbestowed.
Working for insurer that rewards top performers with sex orgies
Today Hartmut Grassl, who was once director of the UN World Climate Program in Geneva from 1994 to 1999, is also a foundation board member of reinsurer Munich Re – a major beneficiary of the climate catastrophe scare (and promoter of sex orgies for top performers). Although Grassl’s fortune telling and predictions of doom are paying huge dividends for the insurance industry, they are turning out to be completely wrong.
Grassl predicted temperature would increase up to 2°C in 30 years.
Grassl made a stunning prediction back in 1990, Die kalte Sonne website writes here:
In 1990 Hartmut Graßl sounded the alarms with his book “Wir Klimamacher” (Us climate makers) predicting a terrible climate catastrophe. On page 61 he wrote with co-author Reiner Klingholz: ‘Already in the next 30 years the temperature of the Earth will increase, with a high probability, by one or two degrees Celsius.’
Today, 22 years later, we can check how well this prediction is doing so far. The result ought to be sobering for anyone concerned about a warming catastrophe. Well, they can all breathe a sigh a relief. Here’s what actually happened since 1990:
Temperature increase since 1990: 0.25°C.
Temperature increase over the last 10 years: ZERO!
And for Grassl’s crystal ball fortune to be correct, with eight years left to go, the global temperature would have to increase 0.75°C just to reach the lower limit of his prediction, and a whopping 1.75°C for his most pessimistic vision to come true. The chances of that happening, given the current phases of the the sun and oceans, are next to nothing. Good luck finding a climate scientist willing to bet Grassl will be right.
The question to Grassl is: What happened? Please explain it to us. Settled science you said?

To keep things in perspective, the entire climate discussion today is the nitpicking over a 0.8°C temperature rise  – over the last 160 years!
“The debate is over,” Grassl said in 1994
In 1994 Grassl was so convinced of his predictions that he declared the climate debate to be over. According to Die kalte Sonne site, Grassl wrote:
From the scientific side of it, the indication process concerning the topic of the greenhouse effect is over and the guilty verdict is in. It’s no longer about gathering more evidence, but solely about alleviating the punishment. The global mean temperature will increase over the next decades by one to two degrees Celsius. Each global change in climate magnitude, also including the mean temperature, forces new weather extremes at almost every location. We will see floods here, droughts there and storms at other places like we have never seen before.“
Reference for that quote: Graßl, H.: Technik München, Mitt.-Bl. Techn.-Wiss. Vereine München, 1994; 3,4. quoted e.g. in: Heinrich Röck Klima und Politik“ 2001.
Obviously today we see that much of what Grassl was saying was pure baloney. The temperature increased only a small fraction of what he predicted, thus indicating that CO2’s predicted effect had been completely over-estimated. Moreover, weather extremes have not increased at all. Today’s weather events are well within the boundaries of natural variability, see here and here, as well as page 202-208 in Die kalte Sonne. What has radically changed is our ability to record weather events. We have satellites, radars, computers, and almost everyone today walks around with a mobile phone that can make good video clips for the evening news.
This means that Grassl in his climate equation had foolishly neglected the other fundamental climate factors, namely the sun and oceans. An astonishing accomplishment for a scientist of his rumoured caliber. If a college professor were to grade Grassl’s work behind his prediction, he would certainly have to give him an “F”.

It is high time to admit to these errors and to make fundamental corrections to the climatic world view. Instead Grassl shifts into obstinate mode and refuses to depart at all from his now obsolete views.”
In his book Klimawandel – Was stimmt? Die wichtigsten Antworten“  (Climate Change – What’s Correct? The Important Answers) of 2007, Grassl simply avoids using terms like the Roman Warm Period, Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age when discussing the climate of the last 10,000 years. He believes in the bogus hockey stick.
On page 15 Grassl describes the good correlation between CO2 and temperature over the last 750,000 years, and from this he postulates, like Al Gore did in in movie, that CO 2 was the driving climate force.
Let history judge Grassl as a scientist on that alone.
Other scientists who made dumb predictions, behaved arrogantly, and today refuse to admit their gross errors have to expect the same scrutiny and treatment. Be warned that history will not look upon you positively.

Alabama sends a message on sovereignty to UN.
And thanks to the great state of Alabama! I know where to move next.
==============================================

The State of Alabama and all political subdivisions may not adopt or implement policy recommendations that deliberately or inadvertently infringe or restrict private property rights without due process, as may be required by policy recommendations originating in, or traceable to ‘Agenda 21,’ “
[…] Public support for the Alabama law was overwhelming and bipartisan […] the law points out, the UN has enlisted a broad array of non-governmental and inter-governmental organizations in its effort to foist Agenda 21 on the world — most notably a Germany-based group called ICLEI […] Meanwhile, local governments across America — under intense pressure from citizens and activist groups — are slowly awakening to what critics call the “dangers” of the UN scheme. Dozens of cities and counties have withdrawn from ICLEI in recent years, and as awareness continues to grow, that trend is expected to accelerate.”

===============================================
Yeah! When was the last time we’ve seen that kind of legislation? The tide is turning.
Folks, it starts one state at a time. I urge lawmakers to present such a measure to their own state houses. Let’s find out where the loyalties of our lawmakers really are.

"“The greatest insult to a sitting US president ever.” It’s not often that I turn to the words of Nigel Farage to seek confirmation I might be involved in doing something right, but last July was different. It was a few days before Donald Trump was due to touch down for his first visit to British shores since his election to office. And things weren’t quite going to plan. Britain was in thrall to the story of whether a 20ft-high bright orange helium balloon would be given permission to soar above Parliament Square in central London: Trump Baby had arrived.  The baby was lovingly crafted to pierce the force field of wilful ignorance and moral vacuity that guards Trump’s fragile ego – it seemed to capture in one adept symbol the public’s disdain for a man who might be beyond reason but, as it turned out, was not beyond mockery. It was suddenly everywhere: Farage talked about it on LBC; journalists asked the American ambassador about it; and even Trump himself mentioned it in an interview with the Sun, saying, “I guess when they put out blimps … to make me feel unwelcome, [there’s] no reason for me to go to London.” Between that and the tens of thousands of diverse people who poured on to London’s streets – on a working day – in one of the biggest demonstrations since 2003’s Stop the War march, you’d be forgiven for wondering if the sexual predator-in-chief might just have got the message. But it seems he hasn’t. In a fortnight’s time Trump will be returning to the UK to take up the official invitation of a full state visit. With political fatigue reigning over the general public – and with so many progressive organisers exhausted by the relentless campaigning demanded by a social and ecological reality that threatens the lives and wellbeing of almost everyone – the task of standing up once again to Trump and his politics might feel overwhelming. But it is not optional. There is no one who signifies the trashing of morals and the abuse of every power to hand, in service of a blindingly arrogant, deceitful and cowardly self-interest, more than Trump. But he is more than a signal. For the communities thrown under the bus by Trumpism and its supporters, his policies mean separation from family, climate breakdown, lives cut short by gun violence and a lack of healthcare. That is why we are asking the public to help Trump Baby fly once again. But first (somewhat ironically), we need to do a deal. Flying an inflatable was only ever meant to cut the president down to size, we always knew that it needed to form part of a more active resistance to Trump’s policies. So while Trump Baby may well lay claim to being the most politically impactful inflatable of all time, we recognise that is limited, and we can do so much more with it. That’s where you come in. We’ve identified six organisations working across Islamophobia, misogyny, the climate crisis, abortion rights and migrants’ rights which need that support. Groups such as the Sunrise Movement in the USA which is pushing for a Green New Deal, Jawaab which is building a movement against Islamophobia, and reproductive rights group Planned Parenthood. We’re asking everyone to help meet a £30,000 fund-raising target to channel real resources in to protecting the people in Trump’s sights. Trump Baby started as a bit of fun, but we are deadly serious about supporting communities and campaigns in need of our solidarity, assistance and love. If we hit that target by 3 June – the day of Trump’s arrival – then the very next day Trump Baby will fly. And Trump Baby must fly. • Nona Hurkmans is a spokeswoman for the Trump Baby team"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal climate, we are told, was more or less constant before man began emitting greenhouse gases. This is what a number of IPCC scientists tried (and are still trying) to tell us with their fabricated hockey sticks.

A  new 9170-year paleohydrologic reconstruction by Kirby et al is out. The team of scientists have examined deposits from Lower Bear Lake in the San Bernardino Mountains, in southwest United States. These mountains are the source region for the Mojave River.
The authors write in the abstract that “the new multi-proxy record is characterized by alternating organic-rich/carbonate-rich sediment units”, which they say can be interpreted “to reflect hydrologically-forced changes in the lake’s depositional environment”.
What result did they find? (My emphasis):
Our interpretation of the proxy data indicates nine decadal-to-multi-centennial pluvial episodes [periods of heavy precipitation] over the past 9170 cal yr BP. Of these nine inferred pluvials, five are interpreted as more pronounced based on their combined proxy interpretations: (PE-V) 9170?–8250, (PE-IV) 7000–6400, (PE-III) 3350–3000, (PE-II) 850–700, and (PE-I) 500–476 (top of core) cal yr BP.”

This tells us that precipitation amounts were high in the region of the San Bernardino mountains during those periods. Moreover, the authors add that this was not a locally isolated phenomenon, but was widespread over the general region:
Our comparison extends north also to Tulare Lake, which drains the southcentral-western Sierra Nevada Mountains. This temporally and spatially coherent signal indicates that a similar climate forcing acted to increase regional wetness at various times during the past 9170 cal yr BP. […] Holocene pluvial episodes are associated with changing the frequency of large winter storms that track across a broad region at decadal-to-multi-centennial timescales.”
Centennial time scale? This would indicate something more at work than ocean cycles, which are internal within the climate system, and suggests that other natural, external cycles are at work. However, IPCC scientists like to suggest that these natural factors no longer play a role today, that they stopped working a hundred years ago, and so leave them out of their climate models.
According to the German-language Wikipedia, in paleoclimatology pluvials are usually in connection with unusually strong precipitation – geologically shown to have occurred mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. Good examples are areas that are deserts today, e.g. the mudpans of the Sahara, Lake Bonneville in western Utah, Lake Moeris Faiyum, Egypt, and Lake Chad.
Overall the cold periods on the Earth were less wet than the warm periods.
All that is left to do is to compare the results of the new study to solar activity over the last ten thousand years. Maybe we’ll find that there was cyclic volcanic activity driving it all!

Share this...FacebookTwitterHow often do we hear screams “head for the hills, sea levels are rising fast!” from alarmists like James Extreme Hansen of GISS and Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)?
Yet, study after study show that there is no evidence of accelerating sea level rise. All sea level fluctuations are within the normal range of variation. Nothing unusual is happening.
The latest study is by Albrecht et al 2011, Determining sea level change in the German Bight appearing in the journal Ocean Dynamics 61: 2037-2050. Hat-tip: http://www.co2science.org.
The study focused on regional mean sea level (RMSL) in the German Bight of the North Sea. Albrecht et al based their work on homogenized annual mean sea level data for the period 1843-2008 acquired by 15 tide gauges.
According to CO2 Science, the authors determined that “regional mean sea level increased at rates between 1.64 and 1.74 mm/year with a 90% confidence range of 0.28 mm/year in each case.”  As for an acceleration in RMSL rise within the past few decades, CO2 Science writes:
…they note that in terms of 20-year trends, the most recent rates are ‘relatively high.’  However, they report that these rates “are not unusual and that similar rates could also be identified earlier in the record.”

I don’t recall seeing anything about this in the papers on on TV. The authors also note:
…the same conclusion concerning a possible acceleration in the recent past was drawn by Haigh et al. (2009) for the North Sea region of the English Channel.”
A press release by the Institute of Coastal Research at the Helmholtz Center in Geesthacht, Germany also said the same 2 months ago, based on the same data I assume (emphasis added):
A group of Geesthacht coastal researchers, together with engineers from the University of Siegen, has recently carried out an analysis of the rise in sea levels in the German Bight. All reliable water level measurements were evaluated for the first time, in order to determine how the mean sea level of the German Bight has changed. According to this evaluation, the sea level rose by approx. 20 centimetres in the last century, in recent times higher than in the years around 1960. However, similarly high increases in levels also occurred in the first half of the 20th century. They are, therefore, not unusual.”
There seem to be natural cycles at work here.
And strange on how all the models show acceleration, but the real data do not.

"New York prides itself on being a green city. It is often ranked as the most sustainable city in the US: as a result of its density and its admirable (if financially challenged) public transit system, New Yorkers have extremely low carbon emissions per capita. Adding to its green laurels, the city council’s recent Climate Mobilization Act requires pollution-cutting retrofits on big dirty buildings – which are responsible for nearly 70% of the city’s carbon emissions. But NYC could be doing a lot more to go green – and fight extreme economic inequality at the same time. Room for progress is most evident in the energy sector. NYC’s electric grid is polluting and inefficient, relying heavily on fossil fuels and ageing infrastructure. With the state’s oldest and dirtiest power plants concentrated in New York City’s low-income communities and communities of color, it is no surprise that each year more New Yorkers are killed by pollution from electricity generation than in any other major city in America. The system is also economically unjust: with some of the highest electricity rates in the nation, New York City saw more than two million shut-off notices in 2018 alone, and almost half a million families pay more than they can afford in energy costs.  Mayor Bill de Blasio just announced an energy plan that would potentially move New York City a big step in the wrong direction. In a little-discussed provision of the city’s latest OneNYC sustainability plan, Mayor de Blasio commits to powering 100% of City government operations with “clean” hydroelectric power from Canadian state company Hydro-Québec. According to the mayor, this would help the city move away from coal and gas, in the process cutting emissions by 40% over the next decade. What’s not to like? The mayor’s proposal calls for construction of a 330-mile-long underground high-voltage transmission cable, called the Champlain-Hudson Power Express (CHPE), to bring power from Canada down to NYC. The project, which is slated to cost nearly $20bn, would lock NYC into dependence on Canadian hydropower long-term, while diminishing the ability for local offshore wind, solar and other renewable industries to thrive. Furthermore, there is nothing “clean” about hydropower. Building the CHPE would require excavating a trench down the spine of the Hudson Valley, a costly and environmentally disruptive enterprise. Construction could potentially stir up long-buried carcinogenic PCBs in the Hudson River, the nation’s largest superfund site, threatening a recovery process championed by advocates for decades. And the dams that would generate power for NYC have flooded hundreds of miles of boreal forest, annihilating watershed ecosystems and agricultural potential across the north-eastern US. There are also serious questions about how affordable and reliable the CHPE project will be. In April Hydro-Québec’s own managing director admitted to millions in losses from power failures attributed to climate change. With the inevitability of more extreme weather events, city government operations in America’s largest metropolis should not be powered by imported electricity from vulnerable sources hundreds of miles away. Politically, Hydro-Québec’s projects undermine First Nations sovereignty in Canada. Members of the Pessamit Innu First Nation have accused Hydro-Québec of “cultural genocide” for the damage to rivers that have been vital to their economy and cultural traditions for generations. Although Hydro-Québec has promised to supply NYC’s municipal energy needs without building new dams, the city will nonetheless be investing long-term in a company that has been building a series of new dams since the late 2000s. Ninety percent of proposed Canadian hydroelectric projects threaten to expose indigenous communities to poisonous methylmercury directly resulting from damming rivers and flooding forests. This is not the first time Mayor de Blasio squandered a chance to command bold leadership on climate change. The New York Power Authority (NYPA), a public-benefit corporation, supplies power to city government. NYPA recently coordinated the largest procurement of renewable energy in US history, and the city was not an active participant. The mayor could have used the procurement to request a truly renewable energy product that includes provisions for economic opportunities developed in partnership with historically burdened communities. He would have made strides in the city’s climate targets while establishing NYC as a hub for the clean energy industry, benefiting communities bearing the brunt of rising inequality and environmental pollution. There are still paths for New York City to transition to renewable energy. The mayor can still request a renewable energy product that requires local economic development commitments and does not depend on foreign hydropower. While technologies like offshore wind currently cost more, evidence shows that upfront government support for nascent renewable industries leads to competitive pricing long-term. Additionally, the city could democratize the energy system by devoting more resources to grassroots-led and locally owned clean energy projects in underserved communities, and facilitate direct community investment in new infrastructure. Such initiatives would guarantee far reaching economic returns and reduced energy bills, offsetting regressive impacts from rising living costs and the steep hike proposed for energy consumers. The stakes have never been higher for America’s largest city to transition to renewable energy. With the limited time we have left, the mayor needs to rethink his commitment to Canadian hydropower, instead investing in energy initiatives that truly empower New Yorkers in an era of growing inequality and climate change.

"All state schools in England should offer pupils a compulsory plant-based menu one day a week, under new recommendations to the government that aim to make school meals more environmentally friendly and reflect changing dietary advice. Given wide acceptance that diets need to change to address the climate crisis – including by eating less meat and more beans and pulses – the Soil Association is urging the Department for Education to replace a non-mandatory recommendation for a weekly meat-free day with a statutory menu once a week offering only plant-based proteins and foods.  The relatively few schools that already offer a meat-free day are often serving up less healthy lunches such as cheese-laden pizza, the organic food and farming group says, underlining the need for kitchens to be given support to provide more imaginative, healthier meals. The DfE has started reviewing school food standards in light of the latest evidence on reducing meat and sugar consumption and boosting fibre in Britons’ diets. The UK Committee on Climate Change report released earlier this month recommended a 20% decrease in meat consumption and an increase in the consumption of plant-based proteins, while a recent study from EAT-Lancet also recommended a shift from meat to plant proteins on climate grounds. “The update of the school food standards provides an ideal opportunity to make school meals healthier and more climate-friendly,” said the SA’s policy officer, Rob Percival. “We know that children would benefit nutritionally from eating more beans, pulses, and plant-based proteins. The climate would also benefit – we should all be eating less and better meat. Some schools are showing that its possible to serve children healthy plant-based meals, alongside higher welfare meat. It’s time the government caught up – the updated school food standards should require that schools serve a plant-based protein day each week.” With increasing numbers of pupils now striking over climate change, the SA is highlighting food and diet as an issue of growing importance to young people. The current standards were introduced in 2015, replacing the original nutritional regulations launched in 2008 following TV chef Jamie Oliver’s personal crusade to improve the standard of school meals – and remove junk food such as the notorious “turkey twizzlers”. Adherence is mandatory for all state-funded schools, except for academies established between 2010 and 2014. The DfE has convened an expert panel to review the school food standards update, which includes representatives from Public Health England. A DfE spokesperson said: “Our school food standards ensure that school meals are healthy and nutritious. They do not require meat to be served every day, and schools have the freedom to introduce a meat-free day each week.”"

Seth Borenstein’s recent article in the Associated Press claims that recent weather events are a result of global warming. They are not; they are clearly weather, local in nature and short-lived. Borenstein is another “Chicken Little”, a calamitologist, crying “Wolf”. Here are the facts.
If recent weather events were because of a global increase in temperature, we should be able to see a global increase in temperature. We don’t. We see quite normal local variations, but on a global basis, nothing… a slight cooling.

Figure 1: GHCN/GISS temperature trend from November 2011 to April 2012 (the most recent figures). In the upper right corner is the global trend, 0.03°C cooling.
The previous six months shows a quite different pattern of local trends, but, again, the global trend is cooling.

Figure 2: Trend for May to October 2011. In this six month period, the globe cooled by 0.07°C. The local trend pattern is completely different than in Figure 1.
Six months does not establish any kind of climate trend. Six month trends are Weather. Others have said that it takes 17, 30, or 60 years to establish a climate trend. These longer periods are simply climate cycles. What we experience from year to year is simply weather. We are now into 14 years of cooling according to satellite measurements.

Figure 3: RSS satellite global temperature anomaly. Where’s the warming?
In Figure 3, temperatures before 1998 were affected by the El Chichon and Mt. Pinatubo volcanic cooling events. 1998 was affected by a strong El Niño event, as was 2010. But the global trend over that last 14 years is cooling by about 0.1°C. But please note that I am not using that trend to claim a coming ice age.
There is another meme used in Mr. Borenstein’s story, that global warming is causing more wildfires.
Others have claimed that global warming is causing the Pine Bark Beetles to wildly expand, killing vast stretches of forest. One of the fires in Colorado was in a forest with 70% beetle-killed trees. The truth is that before the white man arrived, the forests were managed by nature using fire. The natural condition was that fires thinned out the forests keeping the tree population to about 100 per acre of mostly mature trees. The Forest Service has suppressed the natural fires, does not allow thinning, and now the tree density is up to 1000 per acre. The Pine Bark Beetles no longer need fly from tree to tree, they can walk,… without touching the ground.
Mr. Borenstein, you need to get over your fits of hysteria.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Gergis Australian Hockey Stick folly has been dominating climate science news. Won’t they ever learn?

New hockey stick, but with the same problems.
Geologist Sebastian Lüning and Prof Fritz Vahrenholt comment on the story. I’ve translated their comment in English to give readers an idea of what the German skeptic viewpoint is. Parts have been edited for brevity.
=========================================
Controversy surrounds new Australian Hockey Stick: authors withdraw paper
Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
Most of you know about the Hockey Stick saga. Late in the 1990s Michael Mann in his doctorate thesis flattened the pre-industrial temperature history by using a “suitable statistical process” along with faulty data so that the warming occurring since the end of the Little Ice Age could be shown as an unprecedented event (see The Hockey Stick Illusion by Andrew Montford). Today this Hockey Stick curve is deemed as refuted. Even Michael Mann’s team bit their lips and corrected it in 2008. Suddenly the Medieval Warm Period and ther Little Ice Age reappeared.
Even so, it seems some IPCC scientists just can’t to break their addiction to the good ol Hockey Stick days. They’d like nothing more than to turn back time. With this in mind, one can surely understand the short-lived euphoria that swept over IPCC fanclub website “Real Climate”.
Real Climate erupted in jubilation when the new Australian hockey stick by Gergis et al appeared. In the new reconstruction they had found their long lost son. The warming of the last 100 years was once again something special, and not because of natural cycles.
The Australian authors interpreted their new curve as evidence of an unusual warming in the late 20th century. Once again this impressed the IPCC so much that the paper was promptly integrated into the recently drafted AR5. The draft boasted of “completely new datasets” that made up the reconstructions.

However, hockey stick sleuth and statistics ace Steve McIntyre (prompted by a tip  from Jean S) could not resist the temptation of taking a good look at the curve. Here he found unexpected things (see his report at Climate Audit).
Firstly the “new” datasets turned out not to be as new as claimed in the AR5 draft. Moreover, the data had been used in the report from 5 years earlier.
In addition, Joelle Gergis and her colleagues committed capital methodological and calculation errors, as McIntyre together with Jean S were able to show. McIntyre began to correpsond with Gergis by e-mail, but instead of thanking McIntyre for the important information, Gergis curtly wrote back saying she wanted no further E-mail contact. Also Gergis refused to provide further data for the purpose of checking.
That’s a strange communication strategy in such as scientific crisis situation – batten down the hatches and close your eyes. Also Gergis’s website appeared to go offline. Andrew Montford then reported that Joelle Gergis is apparently an active member of the environmental movement. Her blog related to this also suddenly disappeared. But the Internet has a memory and a copy of the blog can be found at at webcitation.org.
By mixing activism and science, Joelle Gergis has apparently lost all critical distance research results, which invariably leads to such errors. A science open to results is impossible with that attitude. This is not only true for Gergis. Inconvenient results are suppressed, interpretations constantly distorted in one direction, and alternatives are ignored or swept aside. Gergis’s refusal to admit to errors and to have a fruitful dialogue with opposing views can only be explained by her ideological fixation.
Luckily a co-author of the Australian paper jumped in and controlled the damage. David Karoly wrote McIntyre an Email, thanked McIntyre for the information and confirmed that there had been large errors which the team will look into. The published paper was withdrawn. At the Journal of Climate site, the paper is no longer available:

 
In summary, the comeback attempt of the Hockey Stick turned into a complete folly. The IPCC are certainly the ones who will be the most annoyed by the incident, as the already integrated paper will have to be removed from the 5AR draft. According to a press release press releaseg about the paper put out by the University of Melbourne dated 17 May 2012, it is clear that the it had been written especially for the IPCC 5th assessment report. Does the blunder indicate that peer-reviewers of many journals are simply too uncritical when it comes to works by authors close to the IPCC?
How could peer-reviewers have missed it? Similarly slipshod was the work of Notz & Marotzke (2012) (see our blog article ”Hamburger Max-Planck-Institut uses dubious data on Arctic sea ice“). It is absolutely mind-boggling how such papers are able to survive the peer-review process. The grievances are obvious already at first glance.
At Realclimate blog the team has shifted its focus over to determining who actually first discovered the error in the Australian paper. The last thing they want is to do is to concede the victory to McIntyre.

The IPCC thinks the sun plays nary a role on climate and that anthropogenic factors explain almost the entire warming since 1850.
It’s been completely ignored that Gerard Bond was able to show more than 10 years ago that the last 10,000 years have been characterized by a global temperature roller coaster that runs up and down in sync with solar activity (Bond et al. 2001).

Figure 1: Comparison of solar activity (blue curve) and the Asian climate development (green curve, delta 18O of a stalagmite in a Chinese cave) for the last 9000 years (both curves normalized). One clearly sees a good agreement between the two curves, which stgrongly suggests a significant climate impact by the sun. Figure from Steinhilber et al. (2012).
In our book “The Forgotten Sun“ (p. 68-75) we were able to show the close relationship between the climate and the sun in multiple studies from all parts of the globe and that the warming of the last 150 years also closely follows the pattern.
Now a new paper by the international team of scientists led by Friedhelm Steinhilber of the Swiss Federal Institute for Aquatic Sciences and technology (Eawag) has just produced yet more important evidence of the sun’s impact on the Holocene climate development. The group, which also includes glaciologist Hans Oerter of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, published the results last month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
Using multiple Antarctic and Greenland ice cores and global tree-ring data, the scientists reconstructed solar activity over the last 9000 years. They also used the so-called cosmogenic beryllium and carbon isotopes 10Be and 14C, whose frequency on Earth is controlled by the strength of the sun’s magnetic field, and thus by solar activity.

The group carried out a spectral analysis of the new solar activity curves and found, as expected, the usual characteristic solar cycles, among them also the 210-year Suess-de Vries cycle, the 1000-year Eddy-cycle and the 2300-year Hallstatt-cycle. The Grand Solar Minima coincided mostly with the minima of the Suess-de Vries cycles.
The cycles are superimposed by the longterm rising and falling signal of orbital changes associated with the Milankovitch cycles. The Milankovitch cycle is in part responsible for the warm temperatures of the Holocene Optimum 6000 years ago, when it was considerably warmer than today. Steinhilber and his colleagues removed these orbital signals from the data in order to filter out the primary solar activity.
They then compared the new solar activity reconstruction with a climate dataset earlier obtained by colleagues in a Chinese cave covering the last 9000 years. The fluctuations in the 18O-oxygen isotope concentrations show the precipitation fluctuations and the intensity of the Asian monsoons. What resulted was a surprising agreement between solar activity and the Asian climate development (see Figure 1 above).
In times of low solar activity, Asian monsoons were less pronounced in general. Also the most important solar cycles could be found in the frequency analysis of the Asian climate signal. One can only conclude that solar activity cycles are the main driver of the last 10,000 years and that they continue to be so today as we continue to remain in the now well-documented pattern.
In the 9000-year time period investigated by Florian Steinhilber and his colleagues, there are however some phases where the correlation between solar activity and climate is missing. For these periods, the scientists assume that other geological factors, like large volcanic eruptions and associated atmospheric aerosols, or other natural factors influenced and overrode the solar signal. In general these factors must always be taken into account when conducting statistical analyses.
The new results from the Steinhilber Group once again shows the significant importance of the sun on the Earth’s climate development.
We can only hope that the authors of the current, new IPCC report will add it and all the other important studiesn in its synthesis report and finally add the sun’s major impact in the models. However, this only hopeful thinking. In contradiction to the growing body of scientific evidence, the IPCC has already made it clear that it will ignore the sun’s major impact even more (see our blog article “Der neue IPCC-Klimabericht: Sonne noch weiter degradiert!“).
This needs to be seriously looked into.

Share this...FacebookTwitterChris Horner made a great presentation at the European Institute For Climate and Energy’s (EIKE) 4th Climate Conference, Munich, in November, 2011. A must-watch, recently posted video!

Hat-tip: Reader DirkH
Horner starts by focusing on the real aim of the green movement, which is to make energy expensive, and so we have to expect fuel poverty in the future to go up. Horner says, “Green jobs will mean pink slips, red ink, and dark times.”
At the 6:40 mark, Horner zooms in on the IPCC, transparency, and the FOIA.
Horner reminds us that the FOIA is an act designed to allow the taxpayer “to know what the government is up to”. But for the IPCC and climate scientists, it represents a real problem that obstructs “the cause”. So the IPCC proceeded to exempt itself from FOIA law and even acted criminally to skirt it, “organising a campaign to obstruct and to delete records” and “creating safehouses to evade FOIA laws,” Horner says.
First (10:10 mark) they used excuses for not disclosing the records, claiming they were “personal, lost, deleted“. In the UK, the excuses were even “getting absurd”. They “organised an effort to delete e-mails”, in a “very deliberate, very thoughtful” way. It “wasn’t rash”. “They really didn’t want these things out.”
At the 21:00 minute mark, Horner sums up the scientists reluctance to release documents, and their scheme to destroy records.
There was an admitted, agreed, written campaign to delete e-mails, to get around, to circumvent FOIA. So that is legally, deliberately and lawyerly drafted.”
Horner said, “The e-mails exposed the Team for the reasons pointed out. They were politicising, they were perverting peer-review. They were perverting the IPCC process. And they were creating falsely tidy stories.” For what? “For the Kyoto cause.”
The inquiries conducted to exonerate the Climategate scientists were whitewashes. They were designed not to find any wrongdoing.
At the 24-minute mark, Horner tells how the IPCC records are public records and how the IPCC was actively dodging FOIA obligations.

FOIA has always been a thorn for the IPCC scientists, who, as Horner shows, had plenty to hide. Much effort was expended to circumvent FOIA requirements.
Horner explains the more recent tactics at the 33.50 mark. For example senior officials were given “handles” to conceal their identities. They ran third party activist websites to make it appear they had support. They set up safehouses at non-governmental websites to circumvent FOIA laws and to keep taxpayers from gaining access to documents.
John Holdren took control of the IPCC process after the president had been innaugurated. Horner shows an IPCC letter from IPCC official Thomas Stocker, who wrote that FOIA problems “require urgent attention in order to meet the challenges of modern methods of working and communication and given the experiences during and since AR4.” He then suggests establishing a “closed electronic discussion fora”.
By October 8, 2010, Horner shows in a slide that “IPCC’s Stocker had in fact already established a ‘closed electronic fora’ for WG1 evading e-mails and national FOI”.
Horner then says the IPCC enlisted to Obama Administration to create offline, non-governmental electronic fora, while stonewalling requests for records. He says:
So the White House Office of Science and Technology policy led a government-wide effort to enable the UN to pull this off, expressly to frustrate national FOIA laws.”
Horner concludes that “there will be fallout, there will be a price to pay. It is the institutions of science that are going to suffer the most.”
By now the readers will ask: “For what?” The answer is: “the cause”.
What is “the cause”?
Recall what Horner said at the beginning of his presentation. As societies get richer, they become more focused on keeping things clean and orderly.
I’ll expand on Horner’s assertion, and add that once a certain level of affluence is reached, the advanced society begins to get individuals who turn radical and intolerant, and eventually view the poor masses as excess population and as a threat to the planet. Think of Holdren, Ehrlich and Schellnhuber who have in one way or another expressed that the ideal human population on the planet is around a mere billion, or less.
Is this “the cause” that these individuals are really alluding to? Indeed some do view the green movement as the latest final solution.

It turns out that National Socialism is the biological father of modern environmentalism. As you shall read, green naturally appeals to brown, and vice versa in many respects. This is so because much of green ideology was inherited from the browns to begin with.
Miersch and Harnasch write how this is so in the latest print edition of news magazine FOCUS, in an article they’ve reprinted at their website here: Ökonationalsozial.
What follows are FOCUS excerpts I’ve translated in English.
The National Socialist Party has a long green tradition, it turns out. Today Germany’s brownish NPD Party, for example, marches against nuclear power and gene technology. It demonstrates for organic food and bio-farming. The word “nature” appears everywhere in its party literature. “Man is part of nature. That’s why nature is simply not only the environment around man. Materialism of the last decades has driven the destruction of the natural life’s base in an irresponsible way.“ This is not a quote from Greenpeace literature, but from the party program of Germany’s brownish NPD party.
During Green Week at the end of January in Berlin, thousands of animal activists, gene-technology opponents and organic farmers protested. Many among them were “Autonomous Nationalists“ who held signs that read “Against plant food patents“ and “Against capitalist slavery“. The browns are infiltrating the greens.
Michael Miersch
Because Neonazis are hanging out increasingly within the Green scene, non-brown greens have become alarmed. One state official went through the trouble of authoring a 36-page information guide titled “Nature Protection Against Rightwing Extremism“ in order to curb the growing brown flood within the Green Movement.
Brownish organisation Midgard not long ago distributed a green-brown propaganda magazine in South Germany. The magazine called “Environment and Active“ has the motto: “National policy is environmental policy.“ In the 1930s the Nazis shared the green ideology, and had the Weltanschauung “blood and soil”, which revered healthy eating, idealized rural agrarian life and German forest romanticism.
For the Nazis in the 1930s, sustainable living was a primary aim of the regime. There was a huge interest in renewable raw materials and alternative energies. Back then wind turbines were called Reichskrafttürme (Reich’s power towers). Later in 1959 Germany published a novel that warned of man-made climate change: Der Tanz mit dem Teufel (Dance with the demon). The book’s author was Austrian Günther Schwab, a Nazi SA stormtrooper. He went on to be viewed as a “green visionary“.
Former Nazis were active in environmental groups and went on to become the grandfathers of the Germany’s modern greens. They became very much involved in Germany’s early Green Party, thus exposing the myth that the Green Party was “a new movement”. Green Party honcho Jürgen Trittin warns at his website of “the many commonalities“ between brown and green.
August Haußleiter in 1980 was one of the German Green Party’s first leaders. It was discovered that the concerned environmentalist was also an anti-Semite. He resigned and in 1986 joined the Bavarian Greens.

Joseph Beuys, a green leader in the 1980s, was involved with the Volks National Revolutionaries. Baldur Springmann was connected to the SA, SS and NSDAP. In 1982 he left the Green Party and joined the new Ecology-Democratic Party.
In 1983 Werner Vogel was one of the first Green Party parliamentarians. He happened to be an SA Sturmführer and NSDAP member as well.
In 1984 Luise Rinser wrote poetry about Hitler, and in 1981 vaunted over dictator Kim Il-sung.
Alfred Mechtersheimer was at first a prominent green, but then left and became a brown.
It is not only the Green Party that had brown streaks, so did many of Germany’s earlier environmental groups, which later transformed into groups known today as NABU or BUND. Lina Hähnle, Chairman of what today is NABU, once pledged allegiance to Hitler.
Also the Association for Nature Protection in Bavaria sympathized with Nazi causes. From 1958 to 1963, Alwin Seifert was National Director of the Association For Nature Protection. Seifert in 1940 had a high level position in the Nazi regime as Reichslandschaftsanwalt (Reich’s Counsel For Landscape). Here he occupied himself with such matters as planning the future of the conquered lebensraum in Eastern Europe. He was instructed by Heinich Himmler to make it so that “the German folk could feel at home there”. Twenty five years later Seifert authored the book: Gärtner, Ackern – ohne Gift (Gardens, Meadows – Without Toxins), which today is still a bestseller and, according to Amazon, ‘a Bible of the Green Movement’.”

My comments: To me this is astonishing. But when you think about it, so many parallels jump out at you. Think for a minute about the 10:10 No Pressure fiim. Think about Schellnhuber’s “Great Transformation masterplan” or Michael Mann’s “the cause”. Think about how environmentalists feel about 7 billion people on the planet. Think about all the science and media manipulation going on to fool the public to promote the obvious lie of CO2 dominating the climate. Think about those who want to change the planet so that “they can feel at home there”. Recall what Hansen said about China’s regime. The list goes on and on. These people are not brown, but they really ought ot think about what they look like. Actions speak volumes.

"Australians are not big on advertising their political allegiances. So the proliferation of Zali Steggall posters around the Sydney northern beaches seat of Warringah must be causing the incumbent, former prime minster Tony Abbott, some serious heartburn. There are literally hundreds around the electorate: on mansions, in windows of apartments, in storefronts and on building sites. In the streets of Manly and at pre-poll centres, the turquoise T-shirts of the independent Steggall often outnumber the Liberal-blue supporters two to one or more. And then there are the orange shirts of the activist group GetUp, who are out in force door-knocking thousands of homes with their mainly grey-haired army of supporters. The only public seat poll during the campaign in Warringah, by Lonergan for GetUp two weeks ago, points to an ignominious end for Abbott. The Lonergan poll of 805 people taken on 1 May had Steggall romping home, 56% to 44% two-party-preferred. The fact that it was commissioned by GetUp gives some comfort to those who still think Abbott has a chance, although there are rumours of an internal poll that has been buried because it was so bad for Abbott.  Other signs are also bad for Abbott. His fundraising site, Battlelines, has been struggling to meet its fundraising target of $150,000. With less than two weeks to go it was telling supporters it still needed to raise $51,255, and this week it told supporters it had made progress towards closing the gap but needed another $100,000 for last-minute digital advertising. Abbott is banking on his support coming from the quiet voters of Warringah: the people who don’t proclaim their allegiance with T-shirts, posters and donations. But he is also facing a groundswell of discontent from moderate Liberals who have organised against him and coalesced around Steggall. They are angry about the Liberal party’s lack of action on climate change, the failure of Abbott to represent the progressive sentiments of the northern beaches electorate and the party’s dysfunction. In the once solidly Liberal area of Mosman, the Abbott stalwarts are enduring a torrid time. When the Guardian visited the Mosman prepoll two weeks ago, two volunteers handing out how-to-votes for the renegade conservative Liberal senator Jim Molan, who is attempting to “ticket bust” and get supporters to put him above the two Liberals and National on the official ticket, quickly opened up about the abuse they were copping. “They drive by in cars and they roll down the window, out comes the hand and the middle finger goes up,” says one well-dressed woman in her sixties. “They honk and yell abuse. And this is Mosman! “Two Queenwood girls came past yesterday and started abusing us about climate change. They were just vile,” says her friend. “Very rude,” says the first woman. “They’d just swallowed the propaganda on climate change.” Queenwood is an elite private girls’ school in the area. Steggall, a former student, is on the council of governors. She’s also a former Olympian, a barrister, the daughter of a local solicitor in Manly and spent most of her life in the beachside suburb except when she was training to be a skier in France. She has become a lightning rod for all the discontent and frustration that this well-heeled electorate feels with its MP of 25 years. The Liberal party and the rightwing conservative group, Advance Australia, backed by Maurice Newman and other businessmen, have been attempting to portray Steggall as a stooge of the Labor party, GetUp, Alex Turnbull ( the son of the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull who was unseated by the Abbott forces in late 2018) the environmental movement, the Greens and/or Stop Adani. It has pushed out a four-part video, which warns that GetUp is as insidious as the communist party and is using brain-washing tactics to capture well-meaning supporters. But the truth may be much simpler than an elaborate Green-left conspiracy. About a year ago, several people in the community, many of them disaffected moderate members of the Liberal party, started organising to get rid of Abbott because of the role he had played in blocking meaningful action on climate change, including undermining his own party’s national energy guarantee. It snowballed. The group People of Warringah had existed since the last election, when another independent ran and got 11% of the vote. Voices of Warringah formed about 12 months ago. The North Shore Environmental Stewards also formed, which included several prominent Liberals members. Late last year the groups met and agreed on an informal preselection process, rather than see multiple independents run. They backed Steggall. There are also local insurgents. Mark Kelly, who owns a surfboard company in Manly, is behind the Vote Tony Out T- shirts and tote bags, which started appearing about a year ago. “A lot of it is just me. It’s true grassroots. I put in $10,000 for the first lot of T-shirts but now I’m sitting on $35k of stock downstairs.” Kelly has sold more than 6,000 T-shirts and he thinks it will approach 7,000 by election day. The hotspot for sales is Mosman. Kelly says he never gives the T-shirts or stickers away. He says it’s important that people are committed and can talk about why they want to vote Abbott out. Unlike Getup, which marshals volunteers to talk to people they don’t know, Kelly says he has been encouraging his group to talk to their peers and family. “There’s only 100,000 people in Warringah, but I want the other 25 million in Australia to ring people they know in Warringah and start having conversations with them, along the lines of: ‘You’re responsible for this, now can you help us fix it?’” Kelly says. The question is whether Steggall’s support is as deep across the electorate as it appears to be in Mosman and Manly. Warringah is an electorate with different parts. In village-like Manly, where there are a mix of young renters and wealthy older residents, there has been a historic willingness to embrace independents such as Peter Macdonald and David Barr in the state seat. Wealthy Mosman and Cremorne should be blue-ribbon Liberal, but the well-educated population appear to be the most angry about the Liberals’ lack of action on climate change, and Abbott’s stance on same-sex marriage. Areas such as Killarney Heights and Frenchs Forest are middle-class suburbs with a mix of older residents and young families with big mortgages. In 2016 the booths in these areas returned a 55%-58% primary vote for Abbott, compared with 51.6% overall. If Abbott’s primary falls below 40% due to moderate Liberals defecting, he is in real trouble, as there will be limited preference flows to him. Labor, the Greens and the other independent, Susan Moylan-Coombs, are putting Steggall ahead of Abbott on their how-to-vote cards. Abbott’s strategy is to try to shore up his support among voters through a mix of fear that a vote for Steggall will deliver Labor’s agenda on taxes, franking credits and negative gearing, while also running on his record as a good bloke who delivers for his electorate. His Facebook page and local material has centred on his contribution to the community: the pollie pedal, which raises money for local charities; millions in grants he secured for the local surf clubs; and a famous incident in which, as a volunteer firefighter, he saved a constituent’s house. He has also made his support for the building of the tunnel to replace the Spit Bridge a major focus, even though the northern beaches tunnel is a state project. The federal government has splashed $50m towards the total $14bn price tag. But after 25 years, even this largesse is hard to sell. “There is quite a bit of cynicism about the tunnel, because its been trotted out every election,” Steggall says. It has been at the centre of his campaign every time since 1994. While Abbott has gone hyper-local, the Liberals’ official line of attack on Steggall is to warn that a vote for her is a vote for Bill Shorten. When queried about whether this was accurate, given Steggall is not directing preferences, Abbott responded in a Manly forum that the loss of any Liberal seat takes Shorten closer to The Lodge. It highlights how unwilling the far right is to accept that they have moved away from moderate liberals. The appearance of her posters on building sites is proof that the CFMEU building union is backing Steggall, he says. The third-party attacks on Steggall, led by Advance Australia, are more pointed. They link Steggall to Shorten and misleadingly quote her saying she has never voted Liberal in her life. “What else would they do?” Steggall says. “I am a moderate liberal. Again it highlights how unwilling the far right is to accept that they have moved away from moderate liberals. They view anyone who is not with them on the far right, as left,” she tells the Guardian. “I haven’t got anything to do with GetUp, I haven’t got anything to do with the Labor party,” she says, sounding a little exasperated. “I know much has been said that I haven’t voted for Tony Abbott at the federal level. I … I voted Liberal at state and local elections. As far as federal elections have gone, I knew that his policies are just too conservative for me, and I viewed it as a protest vote because I knew this electorate would never go any other way than conservative,” she says. “I am for small government, competition. I think we need to support small businesses to be more efficient and competitive. You need to strike a balance between workers’ rights and pay, but it can’t be at the expense of business being effective.” The reason she is gaining support is simple: she has a plan on climate change and Liberals are fed up with the party’s lack of action. Other candidates have struggled to gain oxygen in a race between a former Olympian and a former prime minister. Kristyn Glanville, running for the Greens, is an environment and planning lawyer. “What motivates me to run is I did a lot of pro-bono work for refugees.” Australia’s policies are “retraumatising” them, she says. “I just feel I had to be able to tell my children and grandchildren that I hadn’t stayed silent on all these issues.” Running for Labor is Dean Harris. He says his campaign has “plans to address the issues rather than just holding on to power”. “Transport is a big issue in the community,” he says. “I have spoken to a lot of transport experts who say you don’t get people off the road by encouraging them to take more trips by car. Experts say that there’s a good case for light rail or heavy rail, connecting into Chatswood.” It may be the fight of his life, but Abbott has been strangely low key in the campaign. He has has been largely unavailable to the mainstream media and he has avoided most of the community forums. He has attended two debates with Steggall hosted by Sky News and has done some solo appearances at community meetings. The reaction to Abbott, a consummate performer at these gatherings, has been polite but sceptical. One question in particular seems to arouse passions in the audience: why did he abstain from voting for same-sex marriage, when his electorate voted 75% in favour? At a Manly precinct gathering he explained there were two theories of representation: that the representative should take soundings from his electorate and take their views to Canberra; or that the representative should act according to his conscience. Abbott belongs to the latter school. It was the closest the audience came to booing. And that is at the heart of it: Steggall has outlined a platform that she will push for if she becomes the MP for Warringah. So has Abbott over the years. The question is whether the voters of Warringah are prepared to buy his version of conservative politics for another three years."
"Ice losses are rapidly spreading deep into the interior of the Antarctic, new analysis of satellite data shows. The warming of the Southern Ocean is resulting in glaciers sliding into the sea increasingly rapidly, with ice now being lost five times faster than in the 1990s. The West Antarctic ice sheet was stable in 1992 but up to a quarter of its expanse is now thinning. More than 100 metres of ice thickness has been lost in the worst-hit places. A complete loss of the West Antarctic ice sheet would drive global sea levels up by about five metres, drowning coastal cities around the world. The current losses are doubling every decade, the scientists said, and sea level rise are now running at the extreme end of projections made just a few years ago. The research, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, compared 800m satellite measurements of ice sheet height from 1992 to 2017 with weather information. This distinguished short-term changes owing to varying snowfall from long-term changes owing to climate. “From a standing start in the 1990s, thinning has spread inland progressively over the past 25 years – that is rapid in glaciological terms,” said Prof Andy Shepherd, of Leeds University in the UK, who led the study. “The speed of drawing down ice from an ice sheet used to be spoken of in geological timescales, but that has now been replaced by people’s lifetimes.” He said the thinning of some ice streams had extended 300 miles inland along their 600-mile length. “More than 50% of the Pine Island and Thwaites glacier basins have been affected by thinning in the past 25 years. We are past halfway and that is a worry.” Researchers already knew that ice was being lost from West Antarctica, but the new work pinpoints where it is happening and how rapidly. This will enable more accurate projections to be made of sea level rises and may aid preparations for these rises. In the recent past, snow falling on to Antarctica’s glaciers balanced the ice lost as icebergs calved off into the ocean. But now the glaciers are flowing faster than snow can replenish them. “Along a 3,000km [1,850-mile] stretch of West Antarctica, the water in front of the glaciers is too hot,” he said. This causes melting of the underside of the glaciers where they grind against the seabed. The melting lessens the friction and allows the glaciers then to slide more quickly into the ocean and therefore become thinner. “In parts of Antarctica, the ice sheet has thinned by extraordinary amounts,” Shepherd said. Separate research published in January found that ice loss from the entire Antarctic continent had increased six-fold since the 1980s, with the biggest losses in the west. The new study indicates West Antarctica has caused 5mm of sea level rise since 1992, consistent with the January study’s findings. The expansion of the oceans as they warm and the vast melting in Greenland are the main current causes of the rising oceans, but Antarctica is the biggest store of ice. The East Antarctic ice sheet contains enough ice to raise sea levels by about 60 metres. It had been considered stable, but research in December found even this stronghold was showing signs of melting. Without rapid cuts in the carbon emissions driving global warming, the melting and rising sea level will continue for thousands of years. “Before we had useful satellite measurements from space, most glaciologists thought the polar ice sheets were pretty isolated from climate change and didn’t change rapidly at all,” Shepherd said. “Now we know that is not true.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother peer-reviewed paper, another smashed hockey stick.
The latest paper is one by Mathias Trachsel et al, titled: Multi-archive summer temperature reconstruction for the European Alps, AD 1053–1996. Moberg and Esper are among its authors.
They present a multi-archive, multi-proxy summer temperature reconstruction for the European Alps for the period AD 1053–1996 using tree-ring and lake sediment data. The results show that summer temperatures of the last millennium are characterized by two warm periods (AD 1053–1171 and 1823–1996) and two cold phases (AD 1172–1379 and 1573–1822).
But get this. The abstract states (my emphasis):
Highest pre-industrial summer temperatures of the 12th century were 0.3 °C warmer than the 20th century mean but 0.35 °C colder than proxy derived temperatures at the end of the 20th century. The lowest temperatures at the end of the 16th century were ∼1 °C lower than the 20th century mean.”

Now let’s assume the end of the 20th century proxy-derived temperatures are reliable. That would mean all the CO2 added by man over the last 1000 years (approx. 110 ppm) has led to a whole third of a degree Celsius of warming when compared to the Medieval Warm Period.
That’s it? This is a crisis?
Skepticalscience.com couldn’t find anything alarming either. All they could conclude was that the end of the 20th century in the Alps was a wee bit warmer than the Medieval Warm Period, that according to proxy data.
The added late 20th century tree-ring growth was probably due mostly to the CO2 enrichment.
That really should tell us and especially the IPCC something about the magnitude of feedbacks involving CO2 and water vapor.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s a new paper out called A model-data comparison of the Holocene global sea surface temperature evolution by G. Lohmann, M. Pfeiffer, T. Laepple, G. Leduc, and J.-H. Kim. Hat-tip: a reader.
This is an important study because scientists need a way to check the reliability of their models. If the models can recreate the past, then there’s a chance they can be used for the future.
We have about 150 years worth of reliable instrumental records that can be used to check models. Beyond that, scientists have had to reconstruct temperatures using proxy data. That’s the only way to check models that go way back. But we also know that using proxies as thermometers is not an exact science. Yet, with enough of them, you can get a pretty good idea of how climate behaved in the past. So it should be possible to use them to test models.
In the paper’s introduction we find:
Information beyond the instrumental record covering the last 5150 yr can be obtained mainly from two strategies: on the one hand by deriving from proxies which record past climate and environmental conditions, and on the other hand by simulating climate, using comprehensive models of the climate system under appropriate external forcing.”
Relying on models to tell us what the past climate was? Sounds rather dubious. So, according to the abstract, the authors compared the ocean temperature evolution of the Holocene as simulated by climate models and reconstructed from marine temperature proxies.

The proxy dataset comprised a global compilation of marine alkenone and Mg/Ca-derived sea surface temperature (SST) estimates. The authors write what they observed (emphasis added):
Independently of the choice of the climate model, we observe significant mismatches between modelled and estimated SST amplitudes in the trends for the last 6000 years. Alkenone-based SST records show a similar pattern as the simulated annual mean SSTs, but the simulated SST trends underestimate the alkenone-based SST trends by a factor of two to five. For Mg/Ca, no significant relationship between model simulations and proxy reconstructions can be detected.”
The authors later in the abstract add:
…when modeled temperature trends are set up to allow drastic shifts in the ecological behavior of planktonic organisms, they do not capture the full range of reconstructed SST trends. These findings challenge the quantitative comparability of climate model sensitivity and reconstructed temperature trends from proxy data.”
Most of us know that determining the “appropriate external forcings” (mentioned above) has been elusive in climate science, and has involved many dubious assumptions and downright hanky panky – all to make CO2 appear as the dominant driver.
Proxies will always be the superior way of determining how climate behaved in the past. Eventually models will be able to reproduce the past, but that will not mean they will be capable of predicting the future. One can use many different combinations of forcings in models to reproduce the past climate. But finding out which one was in fact correct, if any, will remain quite the challenge.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA Brazilian team of scientists led by Pabulo Henrique Rampelotto recently published in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar Terrestrial Physics a paper on precipitation and temperature patterns in Santa Maria in Southern Brazil.
It’s the sun! What follows are excerpts from “Die kalte Sonne“ website.

Brazilian agriculture and climate. Public domain by its author, João Felipe C.S. (via Wikipedia).
The scientists carried out a frequency analysis of two data sets for the time period of 1912 until 2008. They especially checked for natural control factors such as solar activity fluctuations and internal ocean cycles like ENSO.
And what did they find?
You guessed it! Natural factors are driving the trends in Southern Brazil. Die kalte Sonne site writes that the temperature and precipitation developments are characterized by a series of natural cycles. Both data sets show similar cycle lengths. Die kalte Sonne site writes:

Rampelotto and his team found in addition to some short periods of between 2 and 8 years also characteristic cycle lengths of close to 11 years, 22 years and 64-83 years, which correspond to the solar periods of the Schwabe, Hale and Gleissberg cycles (see p. 51 in “Die kalte Sonne”). The results also showed that the 22-year Hale cycle was more pronounced in the datasets than the 11-year Schwabe cycle.  This is an important indicator that shows solar magnetic field and cosmic rays play an important role in climatic processes, i.e. evidence of the Svensmark solar amplifier (see p. 231 in “Die kalte Sonne”).
A polarity reversal of the solar magnetic field takes place every 11 years (Schwabe Cycle), thus resulting in that the original configuration is reached after 22 years (Hale Cycle). The polarity of the magnetic field only plays a role for the electrically charged rays, but not for the radiation fluctuations, which cannot be influenced by the magnetic field. If the solar magnetic field and cosmic rays did not play a role on the Earth’s climate, then the pronounced 22-year Hale cycle would be without explanation.
Another important factor of influence for temperature and precipitation amounts in Southern Brazil is the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During El Nino periods, precipitation in the region increases.
The study shows that both solar activity fluctuations and internal oceanic cycles played crucial roles on Southern Brazilian climate during the last 100 years and continue to play a role today. The relative share of these two factors on climate fluctuations is difficult to estimate because their corresponding contributions can vary as to geographic location and altitude above sea level at the particular areas. Here, there can also be non-linear effects, which need to be researched further according to Rampelotto and his colleagues.
A lack of correlation between solar activity and climate development during any particular phase is no reason to doubt the fundamental effectivity of the process. Rather it also may be due to the interactions and overlapping with other climate factors such as internal oceanic oscillations. Such a climate-factor combination of sun and PDO must also be assumed for the global temperature development of the last 70 years (see p. 116-120 in “Die kalte Sonne”).”
More than a dozen solar papers recently!
This of course is the most recent of a spate of studies showing the sun (without which there would not be a climate) plays the lead role in climate change. Also see here, here, here, here, here, here here, here, here and here, to name a few.

By Rudolf Kipp
The topic of this article ought to handled in short order. When you take a look at the data from Antarctica, it is plainly visible that the ice around the 7th continent has been more or less growing since satellite measurements began in 1979.

No sign of melting here.
However, you’d never know it from the news we get from this corner of the planet. After all, any report about steadily growing ice simply doesn’t fit the narrative of the growing threat of global warming and the related melting ice caps.
Indeed the media never send us reports about the continent as a whole. Rather, they prefer to focus on what is happening on a very small area at the fringes of the South Pole, a northern area of about 0.5 million square km², which represents about 4% of the entire Antarctic surface.

For climate science and our media, the Antarctic Peninsula is of decisive importance, as ultimately it is the only place at the entire South Pole where “something is happening”. This region has huge ice sheets, which float on the sea and are mostly connected to the ice on land. Common for these ice sheets is that their tips break off time and again in a natural process known as calving.
And it just happens that the ice sheets on the West Antarctic Peninsula are everything but static. Since the dynamics of these ice fields have been measured by satellites with increasing precision, it has been observed that these sheets break up and get released into the sea as huge icebergs.
According to prevailing dogma, all this can only be blamed on the human impact on climate. Thus year after year we’ve been receiving reports about the imminent collapse of the Antarctic ice sheets. Here are just a few from the German press: 2002, 2003,  2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011.
This tradition of yearly alarms continues this year as well, this time from the European Space Agency (ESA), which appears in a report at Spiegel. The evaluation of satellite photos over the last 10 years shows that the Larsen-B-Ice Shelf has lost three quarters of its area. According to ESA, the blame for this is (man-made) global warming. After all, northern West Antarctica has warmed 2.5°C over the last 50 years.

So with such claims, it is truly worth taking a look at the measurement stations in this region. Let’s take a look at the results from measurements taken at the Larsen Ice Shelf. We see immediately that the trend is relatively constant, if not slightly downward, since measurements began in 1985.

Temperature development Larsen Ice Shelf (NASA GISS)
However, the measurements at the Larsen Ice Shelf go back only to 1985, and the ESA press release expressly states a temperature development going back 50 years. So let’s look at the next stations closest to the Larsen Ice Shelf with sufficiently long measurement histories. They are (see charts below) Faraday (since 1944), Rothera Point (since 1946), Bernado O’Higgins (since 1963), Base Esperanz (since 1945) and Base Arturo P (since 1966).
All these stations have one thing in common: A “warming of 2.5°C over the last 50 years” is nowhere to be found. And any warming that did occur, did so without exception before 1980. Taking this into account, attributing the break-up of the Larsen Ice Shelf to global warming is already quite adventurous, to put it mildly.

So, how long before James Hansen tampers with this data?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) provides a statement on the senselessness of renewable energy in Germany and features a video by skeptic EU Parliamentarian Herbert Reul (Germany).
EU Parliamentarian Herbert Reul of Germany’s conservative CDU Party has produced a video about energy policy in Germany and put it up at Youtube and the Internet. His primary message: The isolated energy policy of the German government will cost Germans €2.3 trillion €. In numbers that’s €2,300,000,000,000. And for what? To brake a computer-simulated increase in global temperature a whole 0.003 °C. It is claimed that it serves to ‘protect the climate’.
That some German Parliamentarians are finally beginning to address the failed and destructive German energy policy is very welcome. However, they’re are few in number. We suppose that there is a lack of courage and knowledge among them to articulate themselves to the mainstream ideologues of the eco-industrial complex. Perhaps a video is the right approach to take for now.
As European Parliamentarian Holger Krahmer reported at the Climate Conference of the Free Democrat Party (FDP) of Saxony on 30 June 2012, the European Parliament recently took up the the proposals of the Commission and ratified the so-called Energy Efficiency Directivese (also see here). In it there’s very little about energy efficiency, but much more about rationing energy. The directives obligate member countries to make sure that energy providers sell their customers 1.5% less energy every year. Thus energy shall be – with no need to do so – rationed.
That’s a scandal of the first order and a socialistic assault on the free market economy that will have far-reaching repercussions. Even “if all of Germany switched off all its power overnight, hardly anyone would notice globally,“ said Krahmer. And Professor Bodo Sturm of the HTWK Leipzig confirmed in his presentation at this conference: ‘Germany’s total share of global emissions of greenhouse gases is less than 3%. That alone shows how senseless many mini-actions for reducing CO2 are in Germany, for example the symbolic turning off of lights for one hour.'”

The main points:
0:25: Energy policy in Germany is driven solely by climate – cost has been thrown overboard.

0.50: Go-it-alone policy would be irresponsible. A large consulting company concluded: “Going-it-alone will cost Germany €2,300,000,000,000.00 (2.3 trillion euros).
1.30: Wind energy costs an enormous sum of money and its supply is unreliable. The massive infrastructure for delivering it to markets just isn’t there.
2.20: Just the solar systems installed through 2010 are going to cost Germans 80 – 100 billion euros.
3.00: Renewable energies need generation systems, transmission infrastructure and back-up systems. It’s going to be extremely expensive, so expensive that a significant part of the citizenry is not going to be able to afford it and industry is going to leave.
4.00: It’s going to cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. People claim that renewable energies will create 300,000 jobs, but it’s also going to cost billions and over a million traditional jobs.
4.50: Renewable energies are a major assault on the environment and wildlife.
5.20: The supply of fossil fuels is vastly larger than what we once believed. Coal for 300 years…America shale gas is revolutionizing the energy market. Spreading fear that energy is running out is pure nonsense.
6.00: The solution is a mix of energy sources. Energy politics must be honest and informed.
Unfortunately Herbert Reul is only one of very few within the German conservative CDU party. But he at least represents a start.

"An influx of climate-denying far-right MEPs could pose a “toxic” threat to EU climate policy after the European elections, according to senior MEPs and academics. Populist parties are expected to take up to a third of the parliamentary seats in Thursday’s vote, with Matteo Salvini’s League in contention to be the largest single party, and Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) overtaking Emmanuel Macron’s La République En Marche in some polls.  Cooperation among the fractious far-right forces is far from assured, but those at the centre of an alliance Salvini is trying to craft with Le Pen, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Jarosław Kaczyński’s Law and Justice party (PiS) in Poland view climate action as a potential barrier to fossil fuel-led growth. With key decisions looming on EU emissions targets, fears are growing that rightwingers could block or water down EU climate action. Alexander Carius, the director of the Berlin-based Adelphi Institute thinktank, said: “Climate policy is going to be the new battleground between the democratic centre and rightwing populists attacking institutions and questioning the scientific foundation of decision-making. The challenge for democratic parties will be to find an answer to that.” The UK Labour party’s environment spokesman in the EU parliament, Seb Dance, said: “They [populists] will seek to be disruptors and saboteurs. If they return in sufficient numbers, my fear is that they will act as a magnet moving the political centre to the right.” A strong populist vote could also “lead to nasty nominations from member states for European commission posts”, he added. “That combination could be quite toxic.” A bigger number of populist MEPs would win greater visibility and access to resources. They would also have more leverage in battles to select commission officials, committee members, rapporteurs and legislative amendments. “The tone in discussions is going to change,” Carius warned. “EU climate policy and debate on the level of ambition in the next European parliament will be significantly lowered.” An Adelphi study in February found populist groups were using the electoral campaign trail to raise tropes of scientific dissent, sovereignty, economic loss and a multilateral global elite to oppose the Paris climate agreement. The extreme-right Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) bloc had the most negative voting record of any grouping in the last parliament on 22 climate proposals analysed in the study. Salvini’s League voted against almost all key climate proposals in the last parliament, while RN rejects the United Nations framework convention on climate change as a “communist project”. Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland, like Ukip in the UK, denies climate change, arguing that “CO2 is not a pollutant, but an indispensable component of all life”. The RN has adopted a green patriotism stance, prioritising a localism vision of Europe as “the first ecological civilisation” over emissions reductions. The party strongly opposes wind energy. Last week, French politicians demanded an inquiry into links between Le Pen’s RN and Donald Trump’s electoral strategist, Steve Bannon, who has described wind turbines as “bird-slicing, bat-chomping eco-crucifixes”. The backdrop to the EU poll has been one of escalating school climate strikes and protests by groups such as Extinction Rebellion. Surveys show more than three-quarters of Europeans want politicians to prioritise the climate crisis. But populists have profited from the backlash created when such action has targeted poorer constituencies. Many environmental NGOs believe the greater threat to climate policy comes from centrist and traditional hard-right parties, which have a weak climate record. The Dutch Green MEP Bas Eickhout said that although the climate crisis would become a more polarised debate in the next parliament, “the real challenge will be with the Christian Democratic right”. “The European People’s party usually does deals with the Socialists and Democrats but that will likely not be possible this time, as those two blocs won’t have a majority. That’s a good element. I think that the increase in right populists will more and more force the EPP to turn to us for a serious conversation on policy.” However, Stella Schaller, who co-authored the Adelphi study, said any realignment would take place in the context of far-right groups “trying to create a new culture war and line of conflict on climate change”. Greece’s neo-fascist Golden Dawn party views the environment as “the cradle of our race, it mirrors our culture and civilisation, and it is therefore our duty to protect it”. Orbán’s Fidesz party has also raised ecological issues, such as the threat posed by invasive species. Far-right strains in ecological thinking can arguably be traced back to Hitler’s Nazi party, which passed conservation laws and fetishised a natural order connecting blood and soil. Carius said: “Nature conservation and the protection of cultural landscapes that is rooted in the romanticism of the 19th century seems to be very appealing to far-right parties as a way of putting an ideological cloud around the countryside and nation.”"
"Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington state, is introducing a second portion of his climate change plan as most Democratic contenders for president have yet to officially roll out their own big-picture proposals. Inslee’s 38-page document is focused on creating jobs. It outlines a $9tn investment over 10 years and seeks to create 8m jobs aimed at decarbonizing the economy. In an earlier plan, he vowed to make the US carbon neutral by 2045.  Inslee wants to upgrade buildings, replace water and transit infrastructure, clean up manufacturing and quintuple spending on clean energy and climate research. Many of those efforts would require congressional legislation. The blueprint echoes progressives’ Green New Deal, but with far more details and fewer commitments to social programs. Inslee told the Guardian: “You think of the Green New Deal as saying, ‘We should go to the moon’ – but in my plan is how to build the rocket ship. They both have their value.” He suggested other candidates might not have the “spine” to take the bold action needed. The first paragraphs of his plan evoke the New Deal, noting that Franklin Delano Roosevelt laid out the details of that program 86 years ago this month. Inslee quoted Roosevelt and said: “We are working toward a definite goal, which is to prevent the return of conditions which came very close to destroying what we call modern civilization.” He added, in his own words: “Today, America faces a new threat to our modern civilization: climate change. This challenge also presents an unprecedented economic opportunity, to lead the world in building a clean energy future.” The campaign so far has focused mostly on climate change, but Inslee insists he is not a one-issue candidate. “This is not a single issue, it’s all the issues,” he said, adding that rising temperatures and extreme weather threaten the economy, public health and national security. He said his jobs plan could also fix wage stagnation. Inslee also touted his Washington track record on clean energy, a public health insurance option, teacher pay increases and legalized marijuana. Six senators running for president have endorsed the Green New Deal, and many frequently highlight the urgency of climate change. But only Inslee and the former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke have debuted their own specific plans with goals and deadlines. O’Rourke would invest $5tn in the effort and seek carbon neutrality by 2050. Inslee says his “Evergreen Economy Plan” would ensure “high-paying, high-skilled jobs building a stronger, healthier, more just, inclusive and sustainable future”, featuring more collective bargaining power for unions, jobs for fossil fuel workers and gender pay equity. Daniel Kammen, a University of California professor and contributor to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, called Inslee’s plan “just what we need”. Kammen, a former science envoy for the state department, said: “It is not only vital for our environment, but it is a recipe for more affordable housing and vibrant communities, good-paying jobs, corporate and municipal accountability, and global leadership for the United States.” Other candidates have endorsed specific policies in the past or discussed narrower proposals they would support. The former vice-president Joe Biden has come under criticism after an adviser suggested he would take a “middle ground” approach to tackling climate change, allowing the continued use of natural gas, which warms the planet. Biden has since defended his record and said his plan will come out soon. Another expected frontrunner, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, has heralded the Green New Deal, including at a Washington DC event this week with the youth-led Sunrise Movement and the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Sanders has previously drafted ambitious climate plans but has not expanded on them this election season. “You know and I know that the scientific community has been very clear,” Sanders said at the event. “If we do not act boldly and aggressively to transform our global energy system away from fossil fuels within the next few years – a very short period of time – there will be irreparable harm done to our planet.” Sanders said the US must lead the world with an approach emphasizing the Green New Deal, but he did not elaborate. The Green New Deal advocates a “10-year mobilization” to reduce emissions but does not specify an end date to make the country carbon-neutral. The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren this week called for the military to help fight climate change. Warren also advocates for banning new fossil fuel drilling and mining on public lands."
"On the hottest days, Leitu Frank feels like she can’t breathe any more. The housewife and mother of five decamps from her airless concrete home to catch the breeze in a simple wooden shack by the water’s edge. She folds washing and stares out at the unsettled turquoise sea, its moods and rhythms increasingly unpredictable, as its rising proximity threatens to strangle her family. “The sea is eating all the sand,” says Frank, 32, dressed in a pink stretchy T-shirt and faded sarong. “Before, the sand used to stretch out far, and when we swam we could see the sea floor, and the coral. Now, it is cloudy all the time, and the coral is dead. Tuvalu is sinking.” “Tuvalu is sinking” is the local catch-all phrase for the effects of climate change on this tiny island archipelago on the frontline of global warming. A Polynesian country situated in Oceania, Tuvalu is no more than a speck in the Pacific ocean, midway between Hawaii and Australia. The fourth smallest nation in the world, Tuvalu is home to just 11,000 people, most of whom live on the largest island of Fongafale, where they are packed in and fighting for space. Tuvalu’s total land area accounts for less than 26 sq km. Already, two of Tuvalu’s nine islands are on the verge of going under, the government says, swallowed by sea-rise and coastal erosion. Most of the islands sit barely three metres above sea level, and at its narrowest point, Fongafale stretches just 20m across. During storms, waves batter the island from the east and the west, “swallowing” the country, in the words of the locals. Many say they have nightmares that the sea will soon gobble them up for good, and not just as a distant fear in their slumber – but by the next generation. Scientists predict Tuvalu could become uninhabitable in the next 50 to 100 years. Locals say they feel it could be much sooner. Nausaleta Setani, Frank’s aunt, sleeps beside the lagoon at night in the wooden shack, using a float buoy as a pillow. Initially a non-believer in climate change, like many older people on the island, Setani has slowly become convinced of the science as her daily life becomes tougher with every erratic movement of the sea. Nausaleta Setani with her nephew in a makeshift structure they use for sleeping, near the Funafuti lagoon “The weather is changing very quickly, day to day, hour to hour,” says Setani, 54, paradoxically soothed and disturbed by the ocean lapping metres away from her hut. “I have been learning the things that are happening are the result of man, especially [from] other countries. It makes me sad. But I understand other countries do what is best for their people. I am from a small country. All I want is for the bigger countries to respect us, and think of our lives.” The United Nations Development Programme classifies Tuvalu as a resource poor, “least-developed country”, that is “extremely vulnerable” to the effects of climate change. Porous, salty soil has made the ground almost totally useless for planting, destroying staple pulaka crops and decreasing the yields of various fruits and vegetables. Starchy Pacific Island staples such as taro and cassava now have to be imported at great expense, along with most other food. Since the rising ocean contaminated underwater ground supplies, Tuvalu is now totally reliant on rainwater, and droughts are occurring with alarming frequency. Even if the locals could plant successfully, there is now not enough rain to keep even simple kitchen gardens alive. Scenes of Funafuti: a typical home, and freshly caught fish The Frank family spend around AU$200 (£105) a fortnight on groceries, a bill that keeps rising as the fruit on the trees that ring their modest home – breadfruit, bananas and pandanus – fail to ripen, and fall to the sandy ground, inedible and rotten. The fish too, the stuff of life here, have become suspect. Ciguatera poisoning affects reef fish who have ingested micro-algaes expelled by bleached coral. When fish infected with these ciguatera toxins are consumed by humans, it causes an immediate and sometimes severe illness: vomiting, fevers and diarrhoea. At the local hospital, a specialist department has been set up to study and manage climate change-related illnesses. Around ten Tuvaluans present with ciguatera poisoning every week, accounting for about 10% of the weekly case-load of climate-related illnesses. Suria Eusala Paufolau (left, or above on mobile), acting chief of public health, says cases of fish poisoning began to climb a decade ago; around the same time the weather really started to go haywire. Climate-related illnesses that have increased on par with the changing weather include influenza, fungal diseases, conjunctivitis, and dengue fever, according to the hospital’s research. Higher daily temperatures are also putting people at daily risk of dehydration, heatstroke and heat rashes, Paufolau says. “Generally the local population does not see the link between climate change and health. But there is always a sense of fear about what is happening to our home.” Tuvalu is heavily reliant on foreign aid, with most of its GDP made up from donations from the UN and neighbouring countries. Education and employment prospects on the island are limited, and the majority of young people whose families can afford it leave to study in Fiji, Australia or New Zealand – a “brain drain” that has been extensively documented. But as climate change batters the seashore, a trickle of young Tuvaluans are returning, even if coming home can feel claustrophobic after the freedoms of life beyond the islands. Tapua Pasuna, 24, was crowned Miss Tuvalu last year, and used her platform to campaign for women’s rights and education. The daughter of the country’s third female MP, Pasuna describes herself as “floating” since she returned from university studies in New Zealand, and says she was drawn back to the island by extensive family obligations, and a sense of responsibility to do what she could for the archipelago. Tapua Pasuna, 24, crowned Miss Tuvalu 2018 “I left in 2010. When I came back I immediately noticed the difference. The heat is sometimes unbearable now, and the erosion is also dramatic. Some of my favourite spots have disappeared,” says Pasuna, sitting in a stiff-backed wooden chair in her tropical garden, the barely constructed seawall just metres from her home. “I feel like this is a part of who I am and I shouldn’t just run away from it, even though it’s disappearing. To just abandon it at such a time as this, when it is hurting – I don’t feel comfortable. I don’t feel like I can do that.” If this sounds like a tidal wave of despair, the mood on the ground is far less acute. When planes aren’t expected, children ride their bikes and play volleyball on the country’s airstrip, while young courting couples take lazy laps on their motorbikes. In the afternoons, people snooze in hammocks for hours, and light campfires on the beaches to fry fish and keep the mosquitoes away. A sleepy, sanguine air permeates day-to-day life, as locals watch the lapping of the waves move ever closer. “Come what may,” locals say again and again, quoting the prime minister, “God will save us.” The largest building in the capital, Funafuti, is Government House, a three-storey white monolith that houses the offices of the country’s MPs. Tuvalu’s official government policy is to stay on the island – “come what may”. Plans for adapting to climate change include the ongoing – and much delayed – construction of a sea wall to protect the administrative centre of the capital, funded by  the UNDP. The local town council has a plan to dredge and reclaim land at the south of Fongafale, raise the land 10 metres above sea level, and build high-density housing. It is a plan that would cost US$300m (£233m), and that so far has no funding. Fongafale island, home to the Tuvaluan capital, Funafuti Other options – such as constructing a floating island – are also being explored, as is importing refuse from Australian mines to construct an energy wall to ring the atolls, breaking up the power of the sea as it smashes towards the islands. How the reef ecosystem would survive such a wall has not been explained. Evacuating the islands is the last resort, says Tuvalu’s prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, despite frequent talk from Pacific neighbours that Tuvaluans will become the world’s first climate-change refugees. Enele Sopoaga, prime minister of Tuvalu Many government officials openly express anger at the election of Donald Trump, saying his climate change scepticism has precipitated a huge step back for global cooperation on climate issues, and made Tuvalu’s small voice on the world stage even smaller. “I think they hate us,” says Soseala Tinilau (below), the director of the Environment ministry. Tinilau is referring to the cheerful burning of coal by the US and Australia, among others, despite a recent report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changewarning that global warming must be kept to a maximum of 1.5C over the next 12 years to avoid catastrophic climate affects. “During COP [climate] negotiations we had to stay up till 7am to ensure we were listened too,” says Tinilau. “The world want to ignore us. They want to keep behaving as if we don’t exist, as if what’s happening here isn’t true. We can’t let them.” Fiji has repeatedly offered land to the Tuvaluan government to relocate their population 1,200km south, an offer the Sopoaga government has not accepted. In a recent essay, former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd suggested Tuvalu’s citizens could be offered full citizenship in exchange for their country’s maritime and fisheries rights; a proposal rejected by Sopoaga as “imperial thinking”. “Moving outside of Tuvalu will not solve any climate change issues … If you put these people in the middle of industrialised countries it will simply boost their consumptions and increase greenhouse gas emissions,” says Sopoaga, a fierce advocate for global cooperation on climate change issues. “I am very worried about this very self-defeatist approach to suggest that people from low-lying, at-risk countries could be relocated. Because it fails to understand the implications of this issue for the entire world.” Sopoaga says there is “no plan B” for Tuvalu, and every government effort is concentrated on adapting to the changing weather patterns – and staying put. “We cannot just say, ‘Kick these people out.’ It is too simplistic and defeatist an approach,” says Sopoaga. “I think it would be a great shame for the world to allow that to happen. I believe we still have time to make this island very attractive, very beautiful, and continue to be inhabited by generations of Tuvaluans to come.” Seen from the air, Tuvalu looks like paradise: a slim scar of sand densely planted with coconut palms, and ringed by shallow emerald waters. But up close, the fragility of the land reveals itself. Beside the runway, golden sand spills on to the concrete, and scraggly green grass struggles to survive. The horizon is flat, and dominated by sea; sea that presses at you from every side. The air – ripe, over-cooked – pushes people into the dark interiors of their homes in the middle of the day, sticky and cloying. At Tuvalu’s Bureau of Meteorology, situated on the edge of the runway – with pig pens to its left and the country’s prison to its right (home to just six inmates) – Nikotemo Iona and his small team are working overtime as they crunch the latest rainfall measurements. They are hours away from declaring another drought. Nikotemo Iona at the Bureau of Meteorology According to local climate data, Iona says the biggest impacts of climate change on Tuvalu have been rising air temperatures, more intense and frequent storm surges and decreasing rainfall, as well as the total inundation of low-lying coastal parts of Funafuti – including, sometimes, the country’s lifeline, its runway. “Many people intend to migrate in response to climate change,” says Iona, sitting inside his squat, concrete office, designed to stay upright and continue broadcasting during cyclone season, which is intensifying year on year. “However, most of the older generation do not want to move as they believe the will lose their identity, culture, lifestyle and traditions. But I believe that younger generations intend to migrate for the sake of the future generations.” During storm surges or the highest tides, the Pacific Ocean bubbles up from the sandy soil under Enna Sione’s small yellow house. Fifty metres away, palm trees lie scattered across a rocky, coral strewn beach, turning grey in the hot sun, their twisted, decaying root systems facing skywards. Enna Sione, next to the ocean that frequently floods her home Sitting on a slayed coconut tree, Sione’s eyes are troubled as she stares at the ocean, beating its relentless path against her home. Sione, her husband and four children are planning to migrate to New Zealand in the next two years – to join more than 2,000 of fellow Tuvaluans already resident in the country; a migrant population that doubles every five years. “The weather has really, extremely changed. Sometimes I feel scared of the ocean,” says Sione, who adds that she is leaving for the sake of her kids. “Maybe one time Tuvalu will disappear. From what I can see a lot is already gone. I think one day we will disappear.”"
"A radical Green New Deal has the potential to unite progressives across Europe in the same way as nationalist and rightwing movements are mobilising around immigration and xenophobia, according to the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. Varoufakis, a co-founder of the Democracy in Europe Movement (DiEM25), which is standing candidates in Germany and Greece in Thursday’s European elections, told the Guardian a radical green agenda could act as the “glue and cement” for an alliance of leftists, greens and liberals. “I think this a very optimistic moment,” said Varoufakis, who is standing for DiEM25 in Germany. “The ultra right, the xenophobic right have a rallying call, they have glue and cement holding them together and that is racism, xenophobia, migration and narratives of gloom about Islamists coming to Europe and taking over.” Progressives, however, have lacked a similar “rallying cry”, according to Varoufakis, who has become one of the leading figures on the European left in the last decade. He argued that a Green New Deal, financed by green investment bonds issued by the European Investment Bank (EIB), could transform the economy, creating sustainable, secure jobs, and help tackle the unfolding environmental crisis while uniting young and old, socialists, Greens and liberals across the continent. “This is a great opportunity for progressives across Europe to unite around a doable, radical but at the same time moderate agenda,” he said. “It can be for progressives what immigration and racism is to the rightists.” The idea of a Green New Deal has gained traction in both the US and Europe in recent months. The European Greens have endorsed a version of it, and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, recently set out his vision for a similar programme. DiEM25 said that since the launch of its campaign for a Green New Deal for Europe this month, hundreds of politicians, MEP candidates and civil society leaders – including leading figures in the Labour and Green parties in the UK – had pledged their support. Varoufakis said he had been working closely with the UK Labour party, which has already committed to implementing a transformative “green industrial revolution”. The Labour grassroots groups Momentum and Labour for a Green New Deal are pushing the party to go further and commit to a comprehensive plan for the UK hit zero emissions by 2030 and create hundreds of thousands of well-paid, secure jobs. The growing awareness of a climate crisis is reflected in a surge of support for the Greens across Europe, who are on course for their strongest showing to date in the European elections and could find themselves kingmakers in a newly fragmented EU parliament. Varoufakis said he had been working on his plans since 2003, and the challenge now was to implement a coordinated, pan-European proposal that could be scaled up. “A Green New Deal for Europe will slingshot us out of this morass of under-investment, unemployment, and climate destruction and toward a future of sustainable, shared prosperity,” he said. DiEM25 is urging people across the continent to vote for MEPs who are committed to a radical Green New Deal – especially in light of the threat posed by the resurgent populist right to action on the environment. Under the DiEM25 proposals, 5% of Europe’s GDP would be invested in a green transition, financed via bonds issued by the EIB. Varoufakis said there was currently around €3tn “sloshing around” in the financial sector – held in bank accounts, being used by companies to buy back their own shares and in the insurance and derivatives sectors. He said the plan, which has already won the support of some bureaucrats, could be implemented “tomorrow without changing any of the existing European treaties”. “Think of the GND as a sponge that can soak up the excess liquidity in the financial sector that is currently doing a lot of damage,” he said. The momentum behind a Green New Deal follows protests by Extinction Rebellion and the school strikes movement, which have helped to push the climate crisis higher up the political agenda. Varoufakis said the protests were inspirational and he called on politicians and voters to take their cue from the younger generation. “This election is not a beauty contest. The future of Europe and the future of humanity rest on its outcome,” he said. “We stand with the climate strikers, because when the adults in the room fail to respond to the greatest threat that our species has ever faced, it is time for us to follow the children who have the courage to show the way.”"
"In the three years since Amitav Ghosh’s The Great Derangement berated literature for its failure to rise to the challenge of climate breakdown, fiction writers have made up for lost time. Indeed cli-fi, once a subset of science fiction, has been so quickly subsumed by realism that its days as a self-contained genre may be numbered. The mass extinction of species has taken longer to percolate. While threatened ecosystems have sparked an explosion of powerful, elegiac non-fiction by Helen Macdonald, George Monbiot, Kathleen Jamie, Robert Macfarlane, Katharine Norbury and others, novels about wildlife have stuck largely to their traditional habitat of the children’s and young adult shelves.  But here, too, change is afoot. Polly Clark was already a prize-winning poet when she published her 2017 debut novel Larchfield. Its successor, the unsettling, immersive Tiger, joins a small vanguard of novels – including Laline Paull’s The Bees, Jeff VanderMeer’s Southern Reach trilogy and Richard Powers’s tree epic The Overstory - which approach non-human life in diverting new ways. Evoking non-human minds demands a great deal of a fiction writer: the imagination to grasp and convey the instincts, habitats and characteristics of other species; the time, money, humility and charm to conduct deep research; and the restraint to avoid obvious pitfalls of anthropomorphism, zoological pedantry and romanticisation. Undaunted, Clark cut her teeth as a zookeeper in Edinburgh, then travelled to the forests of Siberia to track Amur tigers. The resulting novel is a startling, gore-splattered, nerve-racking exploration of how human and animal territories – both physical and psychic – collide. Here she is on a pregnant tiger, “always a tail tip away from catastrophe”, hunting: If the creature was breathing, in range, the Countess would see it. If it dared to lick its lips, if it thought to raise its snout, she would see it.  She oriented her right ear towards the shift in air pressure. She heard, some ten lengths away, a breath. Not a creature’s breath: it was the breath of the atmosphere when it sets a creature down. Bird. Coming in to land. Clark’s human protagonists are also fierce, wary, endangered creatures, either by nature or circumstance. Frieda Bloom is a British primatologist struggling to function in her research job in the wake of a mugging that has left her with a dented skull and at permanent risk of cranial haemorrhage. She pilfers morphine to relieve the sense of vulnerability that has heightened her attunement to non-human signals. “Lately I had become possessed of a prey animal’s radar and was unable to resist the assault of fine emotional details. These were mostly unprovable, rendering me more like a dazed pilgrim recounting a vision than a scientist.” This almost hallucinatory bewitchment prevails in Frieda’s animal encounters, first with bonobos and then - after her addiction betrays her and she loses her job - with the Siberian tiger acquired by the ramshackle zoo that offers her a shot at redemption. So compellingly does Clark summon the precariousness of Frieda’s hold on her professionalism and sanity that it is a wrench when the story shifts its focus to Tomas, a Russian conservationist battling personal and political demons. That she succeeds is partly due to her evocation of the Siberian wilderness as a character in its own right. “The winter forest creaks but does not sigh … Here, trees shoulder time like a burden. There is no fight, only labour.” Burning, it becomes a “great gobble” of flame, “the wind crying and the trunks screaming … Heat scowled through the snow.” It was Vladimir Putin who created the reserves that protect Siberia’s vanishingly rare tigers from poachers supplying the Chinese market with “remedies” for erectile dysfunction. But now the president’s envoy is to visit the vast territory that Tomas polices, and if he’s not impressed, the project itself is at stake. Having ratcheted up the tension with the discovery of a mutilated human body, in the third section Clark depicts the isolated, stubborn survivalism of Edit, an indigenous woman determined to reanimate the lost legacy of her tribe for the sake of her daughter. This sets the stage for a finale that is both satisfying and impossible to second-guess. Combining the propulsiveness of a thriller with the raw yet meditative tone of a memoir, Clark writes with a poet’s ear and a naturalist’s eye, and has a deep grasp of the profound contract between indigenous peoples and the beasts they revere. She never loses sight of the endangered creature that forms the beating heart of a passionate, remarkable and uplifting novel. • Liz Jensen’s The Uninvited is published by Bloomsbury.

"The shadow environment minister, Tony Burke, has declared Labor can no longer pursue a climate policy based on a market mechanism to reduce emissions. But he insists there can be no retreat from what the science says needs to happen to avoid dangerous warming.  In a significant piece of post-election positioning, Burke told Guardian Australia Labor needs to adopt new policies of regulation and spending – like the Green New Deal model pursued by some Democrats in the United States, or like the existing Australian Direct Action model – because that is the only way a majority of Australian voters will sign on to climate action. While Labor can compromise on the mechanism, Burke says there can be absolutely no compromise on the science. “The reason we can’t compromise on the science is this: there’s a limited time for the nations of the world to act to keep us within 2C. “There is a chance the tipping points are reached before you hit 2C, but if we work on the basis that we’ve at least got until 2C warming before the whole planet takes on its own spiralling cycle of heating up, then compromise on the science is completely unacceptable, perverse and no go,” Burke said in an interview with Guardian Australia. Burke said he was not sure where Labor’s revised climate policy framework would land after internal discussion once the new party leadership had been confirmed, but he said the model he had in mind would be part regulation, and part “direct government investment in different parts of industry, particularly storage technology”. “If a market mechanism is off the table, there are only two choices – you get into territory that in terms of policy purity you haven’t wanted to go to, or you give up, and if we are being true to being a Labor party, we can’t give up. “This issue is as much core business for Labor as anything we do in welfare or redistribution of taxation. This is about making sure we are looking after the disadvantaged, except the disadvantaged here isn’t between rich and poor, it’s between present and future.” The shadow environment minister said a market mechanism, like a carbon price or an emissions trading scheme, remained optimal policy, because it was an efficient way to deal with the challenge of reducing pollution. But he said Labor had to accept that after successive election losses, the voting public didn’t concur. “We’ve now spent 11 years using market mechanisms to deal with climate change, and for 11 years, the Australian public have been saying no. “Effectively we’ve based our policies on two principles, both of which are rock solid. The first is follow the science to set emissions targets, and the second is to provide a framework and allow businesses to make decisions within that.” Burke noted Labor had championed a market model for more than a decade in part because that’s what stakeholders, including major business groups, said they wanted, but he noted the same stakeholders never turned up to champion the reform when the fight got difficult politically. “They have never come to our defence when we have been under attack.” He said a market mechanism was efficient, but it left Labor politically exposed. “It leads you inevitably to a set of circumstances where you can’t answer questions about the costs to the economy, because the answer will always be it all depends [on market behaviour]. “The hard right went first to a Direct Action model and in a number of ways, so did the environment movement that wanted very specific measures, sometimes even calling for very specific decisions to be made in terms of environmental approvals.” He said Labor’s approach in this term should be looking at climate policy as an industry policy that would protect blue-collar jobs during the inevitable transition from emissions intensity to decarbonisation. “There may well be a pathway for us to shift to a more traditional industry policy but focused on those aspects of industry that help us meet the targets we need to be able to meet. “This may end up being particularly pertinent in Queensland, given a whole lot of the minerals required for renewables come from the Mt Isa region.” Burke said he wasn’t sure whether a 45% emissions reduction target would be the correct threshold at the next election. “Forty-five per cent reduction has been the threshold. I don’t know what that will mean by the time of the next election – whether the 2030 date shifts and the percentage shifts with it – I don’t know because the science will need to be updated. “It will be updated and the information that comes in – unless we get a massive surprise – will continue to be worse. For a long time climate scientists have projected a range of outcomes from modest shifts to more alarming outcomes, and consistently the lived experience has been at the more alarming end of those outcomes.” A number of senior figures have signalled Labor will go back to the drawing board on all major policies after losing the weekend election to the Coalition, including climate policy. While there will be solid internal support for continuing to pursue an ambitious policy within Labor ranks, there will also be a push in the opposite direction from regional MPs concerned about the party’s ability to hold coal regions when local communities are concerned about unemployment. Burke’s early positioning is an effort to swim across that rip and direct the internal recriminations towards a result that can square the two imperatives. Burke, from the New South Wales right faction, is backing leftwinger Anthony Albanese to replace Bill Shorten as the federal Labor leader."

"The environmental movement drew first blood on election night by helping independent Zali Steggall oust Tony Abbott but, in the end, the Coalition – which rated a miserable 4% on the Australian Conservation Foundation’s climate change scorecard – won. After the unexpected result environmentalists have questioned whether their campaign tactics need revision or whether the progressive side of politics was let down by other factors.   The Australian Conservation Foundation chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, told Guardian Australia climate “was definitely a top issue in the election … but it didn’t convert to votes in all the places it needed to”. The Wilderness Society national campaigns director, Lyndon Schneiders, said its campaign got swings in eight out of its nine target seats, despite Labor falling short in Reid, Flinders, Kooyong and likely Boothby. “I remember the 2004 forestry election, I know the feeling of ‘oh my god our issue sunk a party’ – I’m not feeling like that today,” Schneiders said. “I’m surprisingly optimistic – the last six months is the most we’ve talked about the environment for a generation.” But in Queensland, Nationals MPs including Michelle Landry and George Christensen are prepared to heap the blame – or more accurately, the credit for the conservatives’ strong vote in central Queensland – on campaigns like Stop Adani and particularly the convoy organised by the Bob Brown Foundation. “I never expected numbers like this,” Landry  told the ABC. “Thank you Bob Brown is all I can say. He came up here trying to tell Queenslanders what we should and shouldn’t be doing, and it actually drew together the agriculture and mining sectors – I’ve never seen anything like it.” Peter McCallum, the coordinator of the Mackay Conservation Group, rejects the suggestion, noting the LNP had made gains in places with no stake in coalmining, like Tasmania and Western Australia. But he said the “lie” that Labor would shut down the coal industry pushed by Clive Palmer and News Corp had hurt. O’Shanassy said the “myth” that there is a binary choice between jobs and the economy is persistent and was “a very strong part of the Coalition campaign”. But there were “too many moving parts” in the campaign to say that high-profile tactics like the Stop Adani convoy may have contributed to the disappointing result. O’Shanassy cites the Coalition’s negative campaign on tax, Bill Shorten’s unpopularity and Palmer injecting “millions and millions of dollars” into the campaign as other possible causes. “Outside those central Queensland seats, Australians don’t support the Adani coalmine. “So [the Stop Adani convoy in Queensland] doesn’t explain this election result – some people might want to spin it that way – but we need to look at what really happened rather than look for scapegoats.” Schneiders said the Wilderness Society will hold a review of its first national campaign in a decade but – far from the environment losing the election for Labor – it “in many respects was one of the real positives for them”. GetUp’s exit polling found climate change was the voters’ top issue in Warringah, where Tony Abbott lost to Zali Steggall, in Josh Frydenberg’s seat of Kooyong and in Menzies. Independents including Steggall and Helen Haines in Indi and the Centre Alliance’s Rebekha Sharkie in Mayo all want a better climate policy and there were swings to Labor in inner-city Melbourne. Paul Oosting, the national director of GetUp, said “the leading climate denier Tony Abbott was unseated”. “It’s clear the Coalition aren’t meeting the public’s expectations and need to change their approach or face more Warringahs.” Schneiders said it would be “unwise for the prime minister not to recognise his government is very vulnerable on the environment”. The Coalition may feel “they’ve had a happy day now – but the job just gets harder again as soon as they get sworn in”. “It’s a tactical win – the problem hasn’t gone away.” O’Shanassy said concern about climate change “goes across political lines”. During door-knocking in the electorate of Chisholm, eight out of 10 voters committed to consider the climate, including Liberal voters. So while the Liberal party retained most of its blue-ribbon seats, like Higgins and Kooyong, O’Shanassy said there is “rising concern from Liberal voters” that the party will need to take seriously – in the same way the state election drubbing in Victoria sparked a flurry of environmental policy announcements from Scott Morrison. “There’s no doubt the Morrison government needs to deal with climate and energy – and they won’t be able to continue to put it in the too-hard basket.” While the ACF and others rate the Coalition’s emissions reduction fund as poor environmental policy, part of the problem may be that one-third of the electorate still can’t say which major party has a better policy. “Climate change is complex issue and people are confused by it and where the parties stand – it’s up to the ACF to help Australians understand that better,” O’Shanassy said. O’Shanassy said the ACF will also need to “learn and adapt” and “seriously consider our strategies” but she believes rising concern about climate, particularly among the young, makes action inevitable. “We must continue to build people power – there’s no way we’re going to move politics unless people demand it.”"
"Two areas of Western Australia have been declared “water deficient” and will have supplies trucked in by the state government to keep farm animals alive. Farmers around the area of Mallee Hill in the shire of Lake Grace and Mount Short in the Ravensthorpe shire have run out of water for their stock and had been driving more than 40km to cart water back to their farms.  From Thursday, the state’s water and environmental regulation department will begin carrying 350 kilolitres a week to a centrally located tank near Mallee Hill in response to a petition by seven farmers for assistance. Water-carting to Mount Short began last week. It was the first time a water deficiency declaration had been made in eight years. The surrounding region, which stretches inland from the state’s south coast from Albany to Hopetown, had very low winter rainfall in 2018. Both areas have recorded about 30mm of rain so far this year, down from a January-May average of 70mm. Water minister Dave Kelly said the below-average rainfall in both regions was part of a long-term drying trend attributed to climate change. “Climate change has impacted rainfall across the south-west of WA,” Kelly said. “In particular, last winter there was very low rainfall and no follow-up summer rainfall in the mid-northern region of the shire of Lake Grace. “As a result, on-farm water supplies and strategic community water supplies are now depleted.” A water deficiency declaration can be made when five or more farmers within a 20km radius have to travel more than 40km to get water. Water provided by the government can be used only for animal welfare purposes. “This declaration will assist landholders to reduce the cost and stress of sourcing suitable water supplies for their animals,” the WA agriculture minister, Alannah MacTiernan, said. “We continue to work with landholders affected by below-average rainfall, providing information and support about how best to navigate the season ahead.” WA farmers president Rhys Turton said he expected more areas in the southern parts of the state would be placed on emergency water provisions before winter was over. “They have been through a pretty dry winter last year, very dry spring,” Turton said. “Most have not had a lot of summer rainfall so there has been very little run-off to fill water storage dams. They have been driving for some time to get water for stock.” Rainfall in WA has been drying up since the 1970s, but the trend is patchy. Some parts of the state, such as the wheatbelt, where Turton farms, experienced their best winter in living memory last year. He said that even if the drying trend was attributed to climate change, as it is by the Bureau of Meteorology, it did not mean that areas would become unviable for farming. “They are at no greater risk there than anywhere else in Australia,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessor Fritz Vahrenholt, author along with Dr. Sebastian Lüning of the skeptic German bestseller “Die kalte Sonne” had been invited to take part in the political talk show “hart aber fair” (tough but fair) on German public television, prime time Monday evening, March 12.
That was before the show caved in and disinvited the tough-debating Vahrenholt. That’s a pity because many viewers and I were really looking forward to this show. Instead we’ll have to be content with the boring topic of “electricity, gas, and fuel are getting more and more expensive – energy supply transition at our expense” with the usual blowhard dullard politicians blasting the same hot air we’ve been hearing for years.
The global warming religion is no longer able to withstand scrutiny. That’s how weak the whole science has become. Now the lock-stepping publicly-funded media have to shield the issue from public debate. They don’t fear the climate itself – it is debate itself that they truly fear. This is not the first time Vahrenholt gets disinvited from a major event. Last month the University of Osnabrück disinvited him, saying that his claim that the climate is 50% driven by the sun is “too provocative”.
I called hart aber fair studios in Cologne to get an explanation, but all I got from these publicly funded employees was “Nobody knows…I can’t tell you why” and “Maybe  because Vahrenholt is ill and can’t make it.” and “The person who could tell you is not available”. Unfortunately, they could not give me any names.  This is all absurd, of course. Perhaps German readers will have better luck. You can call the studios at 0221 2200, ask for “hart aber fair Redaktion”.
The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) published the news of the dubious disinvitation yesterday, but did not provide details as to why. The public is only left to speculate. The following are some reactions from readers:
Don Carlos writes: “Cancelled. Aha. Why am I not surprised?”
Friedrich Wildhagen writes: “They are afraid of the callers during the show. The Warmies show they are afraid. Hats off to Prof. Vahrenholt, Dr. Lüning. Job very well done!”
Alfred Casimir writes: “This report shows the insecurity that has arrived in the media. Take the disinvitation as a victory.”

Dear Mr. Gosselin,
Thanks for your interest in ‘hart aber fair’.
On the March 12, 2012 edition of ‘hart aber fair’, we will look at the topic of ‘electricity, gas, petrol are getting more and more expensive – energy transition at our expense?’ A change in the topic here is simply not the case, rather it is more of an adjustment based on editorial reasons.
The experience of many ‘hart aber fair’ editions has shown that with six participants it is not always possible to get a word in sufficiently. Moreover, there are quickly overlaps and doublings in the argumentation, which we naturally wish to avoid. In the concrete case this would likely have happened with Roland Tichy and Prof. Vahrenholt. Therefore we decided to reduce the number of participants to five guests, contradictory to the original plan.
You see: The preparation of a current talkshow like ‘hart aber fair’ is a constant development process which, for various reasons, can lead to topic changes and changes in the participants even right before the show begins.
We would be pleased if you tuned in on Monday to follow the discussion even without Prof. Vahrenholt.
Best regards,
 Matthias Radner
 Producer
 ‘hart aber fair’ (ARD/WDR)”
========================================
What I read from this is that they decided to make the show totally boring by presenting the same stale and moldy bread that everyone is sick of being served. Vahrenholt is the only one among them with a best-selling book with fresh new issues. Don’t bother watching. We’ve seen this crap dozens of times already.

"When I see a bee buzzing around my garden or in the park in early spring, I get a real thrill from being able to identify her. If she is black and darting among small, white tubular flowers with her long tongue protruding and her legs tucked under her furry, round body, I know she is a hairy-footed flower bee. A few years ago I wouldn’t have noticed her because, like most people, I thought all bees were striped. I also assumed they made honey, stung, and lived in a hive with a queen bee and her workers. But only honeybees fit this description, and they account for just a handful or so of the astonishing 25,000 bee species worldwide. Bumblebees – the plump, stripy garden visitors that have been voted the UK’s favourite insect – make up about 1%. The vast majority, like the hairy-footed flower bee, come in many different colours, don’t make honey, and live alone. These solitary bees are often named according to how they construct their nests: from plasterer bees, which line their nest with a waterproof substance, to mining bees, which excavate elaborate underground burrows, and leafcutter bees, which plug the entrance with small discs of leaves cut from rose bushes.  This month a landmark UN global assessment report warned that a million wildlife species were facing extinction, and at an unprecedented rate. Thousands of bee species will be among them. In Europe, 37% of them have experienced a recent decline in populations, and 9% face extinction; almost a quarter of those in North America are at increasing risk of becoming extinct. In other parts of the world, where data is limited, they all face similar threats from intensive farming, climate breakdown and invasive species. And their demise is potentially catastrophic for nature and humankind. A bee visiting a flower is an act of nature that has been playing out for more than 100m years. Flowering plants evolved with bees, developing rich perfumes, colourful petals and nectar to entice them to visit. As the bee moves from flower to flower, collecting nectar to fuel her flight and pollen to feed her family, she moves pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part, allowing the plant to produce seeds and reproduce. The poet Kahlil Gibran beautifully described this symbiotic relationship. “To a bee a flower is the fountain of life, and to the flower the bee is a messenger of love.” It makes bees a linchpin in nature and of modern agriculture. Not only do they pollinate trees, whose oxygen we breathe, and which mitigate the climate crisis, they also pollinate the flora that feed other insects, birds and mammals in the food chain and one in three mouthfuls that we eat. Bees boost the yield of 90 commercially produced crops. These include most fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and spices that we eat, as well as coffee, and fodder for livestock. The annual contribution of pollination services to the global economy has been estimated at $577bn (£453bn).  But there is a contradiction at the heart of our farming system. In the last five decades there has been a threefold increase in the volume of production of those 90 bee-dependent crops. This has turned farms into industrial food producers. As a result, wild-flower meadows that provided food and nesting sites for solitary bees and bumblebees have been wiped out. Europe’s largest bumblebee, the endangered Bombus fragrans, is just one example of a species seriously threatened by intensive farming, which is destroying its native habitat on the steppes of Ukraine and Russia.  Without food and habitat to sustain wild pollinators, modern farming has become reliant on trucking in managed honeybee hives when crops are in bloom, and flying in factory-bred bumblebees to pollinate tomatoes and other crops grown in greenhouses. This can spread lethal parasites and disease to wild bees, including the giant golden bumblebee of Patagonia, which is now threatened with extinction. Neonicotinoid pesticides have been linked to bee deaths, and a successful campaign to ban these toxic chemicals was orchestrated across Europe, leading to the EU introducing a total ban on the outdoor use of the most common ones last year.  But that alone won’t save bees. Now we need a similar campaign to ban herbicides and bring back wild flowers and wild bees. Research shows that the greater the diversity of bees attracted to a field of crops by the presence of wild flowers, the better pollinated those crops will be. In some trials, harvests doubled or even tripled, because solitary bees can pollinate some flowering plants 100 times more effectively than honeybees.  Yet subsidies over the past 70 years have encouraged farmers to use chemicals and fertilisers that destroy ecosystems and degrade the soil, and bring in managed honeybees where wild bees once flourished. We urgently need to bring nature back into the way we produce food. As taxpayers, voters and consumers, we can help make that change. The German state of Bavaria is leading the way. The state’s governor, Markus Söder, announced recently that a “save the bees” petition signed by 1.75 million people would be passed into law. The petition demanded 20% of farming land to be made bee-friendly within six years and 30% by 2030, to reverse the decline in flora and fauna. And Söder made it clear that farmers would be financially supported to carry out the transformation. In the UK, a farm that used to receive substantial subsidies to produce crops using conventional practices now uses £250,000 of taxpayers’ money to allow nature to do the work. A decade on, 62 species of bee have been recorded on the Knepp estate in West Sussex, including rare species such as the red bartsia bee, which feeds on the wild flower after which it is named. What if we demanded all farms were financially encouraged to rewild pockets of their land, and we ate only food that was grown using bee-friendly methods? Cities are also crucial to the future of bees. Not only can we make our gardens and roof terraces bee-friendly, we can lobby councils to make green spaces better for bees, and for all buildings to have bee-friendly roofs, which would also mitigate against flooding and improve air quality. Cities are also where people will learn to recognise and value bees. Monday is UN World Bee Day. If we all took a moment to stop and look at the small insect buzzing in our garden or park – as well as it being good for our wellbeing to reconnect with nature as an antidote to the stresses of city life – it might just help us to understand the bigger picture: that by saving bees, we are saving ourselves. • Alison Benjamin is a Guardian editor and co-author of The Good Bee: A Celebration of Bees and How to Save Them"
"One of the Liberals’ leading conservatives and Australia’s 28th prime minister, Tony Abbott, has lost his blue-ribbon Sydney seat of Warringah after moderate Liberal voters abandoned him in protest at the role he played in opposing climate change action. Abbott lost to the independent candidate and Olympian Zali Steggall, with thecount showing she was likely to win almost 60% of the vote on a two-party-preferred basis. But Abbott’s loss appeared to be the only black spot on a night when it appeared the Coalition would hold on to government. “I want to say to you: there is good news and bad news. There is every chance that the Liberal-National Coalition has won the election,” Abbott said in his concession speech, to chants of “Tony, Tony!” “This – this is a really extraordinary result. It is a stupendous result. It is a great result for Scott Morrison and the rest of the wider Liberal team, and Scott Morrison will now, quite rightly, enter the Liberal pantheon forever,” he said. “So its disappointing for us in Warringah. I can’t say it doesn’t hurt to lose. But I would rather be a loser than a quitter,” he said to wild applause. He said the Liberals had become the party who believed that “the most important thing is to raise people up.” “I think we can see that there is something of a realignment of politics going on right around this country. It’s clear that in what might be described as ‘working seats’, we are doing so much better. “It’s also clear that in at least some of what might be described as ‘wealthy seats’, we are doing it tough, and the green-left is doing better,” he said. Abbott said he had feared the worst after the result in the Wentworth byelection last year. Backed by a number of local community groups, Steggall was drafted as a candidate to advocate for more action on the climate crisis. She had run on a platform that was almost entirely focused on taking meaningful action to counter it, including adopting much tougher targets than the Coalition has embraced – a message that resonated with the middle-class voters of Warringah. Her support was especially strong in Mosman and Manly. The loss of one the most outspoken members of the conservative wing would normally send deep shockwaves through the Liberal party, but given the other results on Saturday night it seems less certain that Abbott’s defeat will prompt internal debate about the party’s positioning on the climate crisis. The survival of Peter Dutton in the seat of Dickson will also boost the conservative wing of the party. Abbott said the result showed that where climate change was a “moral issue, we do it tough. But where it’s an economic issue, we do very, very well.” Steggall’s campaign was supported by a number of grassroots groups which had formed out of disillusion with the Liberal party’s policy on the climate emergency. In her acceptance speech she paid tribute to Abbott as “a dedicated and long-serving local member”. “Nobody can doubt his community spirit, his work ethic, and his contribution to this community. And I wish him well.” But she said Warringah had “voted for the future”. “This is a win for moderates with a heart,” she said. “I will be a climate leader for you. And I will keep the new government to account, and make sure we take action on climate change. The Warringah result is certain to be analysed in terms of what a grassroots campaign can do against a seemingly invulnerable politician. Several high-profile former Liberal members from Mosman were behind the push to find a candidate to run against Abbott and the vote shows they were successful in their strategy to get family and friends to persuade other Liberal-leaning voters to lodge a protest vote. There is also likely to be a heated discussion, particularly from the News Corp publications, about the role of left-leaning and progressive organisations in the political process, with conservatives warning that progressive groups represent a threat to democracy because of their deep pockets. The seat was a hot spot for activism by GetUp, which door-knocked more than 20,000 households in the north shore and northern beaches seat, and Stop Adani, which was also active. Abbott had held Warringah for 25 years, having won it 1994 in a byelection. The former journalist and political adviser to John Howard became a public figure as the director of Australians for a Constitional Monarchy in 1992, a position he held until he ran for the seat. As an MP Abbott rose quickly in the Howard government and was appointed minister for employment services in 1998 after Howard won a second term. He later became minister for health, where he sought to prosecute a conservative agenda, including seeking to ban the abortion drug RU486, a move Howard ultimately did not embrace. After Howard lost in 2007, Abbott served in the shadow cabinets of Brendan Nelson and Malcolm Turnbull but he resigned from the frontbench in November 2009 in protest against Turnbull’s support for the Rudd government’s proposed emissions trading scheme. That set the stage for a decade-long battle within the Liberal party over climate . Abbott once branded the science of climate change “crap” and led the opposition internally to wipe out subsidies for renewables and any policy that attempted to put a price on carbon. After forcing a leadership ballot on the subject in 2009, Abbott defeated Turnbull by 42 votes to 41, to become the party’s leader and leader of the opposition. He led the Coalition at the 2010 election, which resulted in a hung parliament but Labor, led by Julia Gillard, formed government, with the support of one Greens MP and three independents. Regarded as fearsome campaigner, Abbott was re-elected as Liberal leader unopposed. He went on to lead the Coalition to victory in the 2013 election. But just two years later, on 14 September 2015, Abbott was defeated as Liberal party leader 54 votes to 44 by Malcolm Turnbull, who replaced him as prime minister the following day. Abbott was widely seen as a driving force behind the destabilisation of Turnbull’s leadership and the thwarting of the national energy guarantee, Turnbull’s policy to tackle global heating. In 2018 Turnbull was in turn challenged and replaced by Scott Morrison. Abbott appeared to leave open the door for a possible comeback, saying his public life was not over."
"Bob Hawke was the environmental prime minister of Australia. His legacy includes Landcare and the listing of the Queensland’s Daintree wet tropics, Shark Bay in Western Australia, Uluru-Kata Tjuta in the Northern Territory, the Gondwana rainforests of the New South Wales-Queensland border region and large extensions to both the Northern Territory’s Kakadu and the Tasmanian wilderness world heritage areas. The latter was in contention in 1989 after the “Whispering Bulldozer”, the Tasmanian Liberal premier Robin Gray, lost office to Labor’s Michael Field and myself, leading the five Greens holding the balance of power. We Greens negotiated the expansion of the Tasmanian wilderness world heritage area by more than 600,000 hectares to include such iconic wilderness as the Walls of Jerusalem, Central Plateau, Denison River Valley. At the end, Field had had enough and called a press conference to announce the outcome. I did not go. Instead, I was on the phone to Hawke’s office arguing that the eastern end of Macquarie Harbour – some 40,000 hectares – should also be included. Hawke agreed so that most magnificent part of the harbour, including Kellys Basin, the mouth of the Gordon River and the convict ruins on Sarah Island, is, these days, a natural delight free of otherwise inevitable industrial fish farming, for hundreds of thousands of people catching cruises out of Strahan. After taking over leadership of the Labor party before the election in 1983, Hawke committed to saving the Franklin River. The Wilderness Society’s peaceful blockade of Gray’s dam works threatening the river had seen thousands of people come to Strahan and more than 500 go to Risdon jail. In Melbourne, at a rally of 15,000 people, Hazel Hawke famously put on “No Dams” earrings and Bob made an ironclad commitment to stop the dam. On election night, 5 March, he made just one specific commitment: the dam would not go ahead but those affected would be duly compensated. He carried through on both promises. One US outdoors company recently put the Franklin at the top of the world’s 10 most desirable whitewater rafting adventures. Had Hawke and Labor not won that election the river would now, instead, be a series of dead impoundments. Hawke’s next masterstroke for the environment was to replace Barry Cohen, his first minister for the environment, with Graham Richardson. Never before or since has such a powerful figure on Australia’s political landscape held this portfolio. There could not be a greater contrast with the present minister, who has been absent from the 2019 election campaign. Richardson told environmentalists that if he was going to take action he needed to “hear the crowd roar”. So the late 1980s and early 1990s were perhaps the greatest period of public involvement and environmental advance in Australia. This was not without contention. Richardson faced a jeering anti-environmental mob at Ravenshoe in northern Queensland on the way to the Hawke government having the rainforests given world heritage status and protection. In Tasmania, Richardson, working with Hawke’s office, made repeated visits to back that 1989 extension of the Tasmania wilderness world heritage area against mounting opposition from loggers and miners and the state government. They stopped the polluting Wesley Vale pulp mill project after a huge campaign led by a farmers’ daughter, Christine Milne. Of course, Hawke did not please us all the time. He backed uranium mining and flirted with Ronald Reagan’s proposal to test MX missiles over the Pacific Ocean. He backed off on a treaty with Australia’s First Nations when the proposal came under fire from the Western Australia Labor premier Brian Burke. A Hawke masterstroke was to accept the proposal of the Australian Conservation Foundation’s Phillip Toyne and the National Farmers’ Federation’s Rick Farley to set up Landcare. This became a beacon of global interest in government-funded repair of rural lands and rivers. That Landcare and general environment spending has been gutted in recent years highlights the loss of vision in Canberra since the great environmental innovation era Hawke ushered in. Key to Hawke’s environmental success was his listening ear. He knew the Australian public was keen on protecting nature and he made himself open to direct liaison with environmental leaders. He was a tough negotiator but he and his staff opened an ear to the environment, which has been finally closed altogether by the Morrison government. Richardson was the first environment minister to alert cabinet to the onrush of climate change. Decades later, at the 25th anniversary of the saving of the Franklin in Hobart in 2008, Hawke lambasted the Coalition’s lack of concern for the heating planet: And as you look at the arguments and the positions of political parties today you see a complete replication of what we experienced back there in 1983. The conservatives: they never change, they never learn. What was their argument back then? You can’t do this, it will cost jobs. It will cost economic growth. You can’t do it, you mustn’t do it. Hawke did it and, were he prime minster in 2019, I reckon the very unpopular Adani coalmine proposal would be headed for the bin. With Paul Keating in the fray, Hawke joined the French government in leading the world – against Bush administration misgivings – to formulating the Madrid protocol which protects Antarctica from mining industrialisation. Perhaps Thursday night’s Southern Aurora, visible across southern Tasmania, was nature’s accolade for the life of a natural champion."
"Today marks the official launch of Covering Climate Now, a project co-sponsored by The Columbia Journalism Review and The Nation. Joined by The Guardian and others partners to be announced, Covering Climate Now will bring journalists and news outlets together to dramatically improve how the media as a whole covers the climate crisis and its solutions.  The following is an abridged version of the conference keynote speech by iconic TV newsman Bill Moyers, as prepared for delivery. A video version of the speech is available here. See here for more about the Covering Climate Now project.  * I have been asked to bring this gathering to a close by summing up how we can do better at covering the possible “collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world,” to quote the noted environmentalist David Attenborough, speaking at the recent United Nations climate summit in Poland.I don’t come with a silver bullet. And I’m no expert on the topic. Like you, I am just a journalist whose craft calls for us to explain things we don’t understand. There’s so much I don’t understand that journalism became my continuing course in adult education. The subjects were so fascinating, and the work so fulfilling, that I kept at it “full speed ahead” for half a century, until two years ago, at the age of 83, I yielded finally to the side effects of a long life and retired (more or less). This is the first opportunity I have had since then to be with so many kindred spirits of journalism, and the camaraderie reminds me how much I have missed your company.Many of us have recognized that our coverage of global warming has fallen short. There’s been some excellent reporting by independent journalists and by enterprising reporters and photographers from legacy newspapers and other news outlets. But the Goliaths of the US news media, those with the biggest amplifiers—the corporate broadcast networks—have been shamelessly AWOL, despite their extraordinary profits. The combined coverage of climate change by the three major networks and Fox fell from just 260 minutes in 2017 to a mere 142 minutes in 2018—a drop of 45%, reported the watchdog group Media Matters.Meanwhile, about 1,300 communities across the United States have totally lost news coverage, many from newspaper mergers and closures, according to the University of North Carolina School of Media and Journalism. Hundreds of others are still standing only as “ghost newspapers.” They no longer have resources for even local reporting, much less for climate change. “Online news sites, as well as some TV newsrooms, are working hard to keep local reporting alive, but these are taking root far more slowly than newspapers are dying,” observes Tom Stites of Poynter in a report about the study. And, alas, many of the news outlets that are still around have ignored or misreported the climate story and failed to counter the tsunami of deceptive propaganda unleashed by fossil-fuel companies and the mercenaries, ideologues, and politicians who do their bidding.But events educate, experience instructs, and so much destructive behavior has been caused by climate disruption that more Americans today than ever seem hungry to know what’s causing it, what’s coming and what can be done about it. We journalists have perhaps our last chance to help people grasp the magnitude of the threat. My friend and journalist-turned-citizen-activist Bill McKibben told me last week that because of the looming possibility of extinction, and in response to it from the emerging leadership among young people, we have reached a ‘climate moment’ with real momentum, and our challenge as we go forward is to dramatically change the zeitgeist—“to lock in and consolidate public opinion that’s finally beginning to come into focus.”So, while I did not come with a silver bullet—there’s no such thing—I do want to share a couple of stories that might help us respond to this daunting task.I’ll begin with how I first heard of global warming—before many of you in this room were born. It was 54 years ago, early in 1965, at the White House. Before I became President Lyndon Johnson’s press secretary (“over my dead body,” I might add,) I was his special assistant coordinating domestic policy. One day, two members of the president’s science-advisory committee came by the office. One of them was the famous oceanographer, Roger Revelle. Famous because only a few years earlier he had shaken up the prevailing consensus that the oceans were massive enough to soak up any amount of excess of carbon released on earth. Not so, Revelle discovered; the peculiar chemistry of sea water actually prevents this from happening.Now, he said, humans have begun a “vast geophysical experiment.” We were about to burn, within a few generations, the fossil fuels that had slowly accumulated in the earth over the past 500 million years. Burning so much oil, gas, and coal would release massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, where it would trap heat that otherwise would escape into space. Earth’s temperature could rise, causing polar ice to melt and sea levels to rise, flooding the earth’s coastal regions.President Johnson took scientists seriously; as vice president, he had been chosen by President Kennedy to chair the intergovernmental committee overseeing NASA’s charge to put a man on the moon. So Revelle and his colleagues got the green light, and by the fall of 1965 they produced the first official report to any government anywhere on the possible threat to humanity from rising CO2 levels. On November 6, Lyndon Johnson became the first president to mention the threat in a message to Congress.President Johnson urged us to circulate the report widely throughout the government and to the public, despite its controversial emphasis on the need for “economic incentives” to discourage pollution, including—shudder!—taxes levied against polluters. (You can go online to Restoring the Quality of Our Environment—1965 and read the entire 23-page section, headlined Appendix Y4—Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.)This was in 1965! Nearly six decades ago! The future in plain sight.But we failed the moment. One year later, largely preoccupied with the war in Vietnam, the president grew distracted, budgets for other priorities were squeezed, and the nation was fast polarizing. We flunked that first chance to confront global warming. Our failure to act—and the failure of administrations that followed us—metastasized into the crisis of today, the crisis journalists must figure out how to cover as if life on earth depends on it, which it does.Which brings me to the second story I hope will be helpful in confronting this daunting challenge.It’s about the Murrow Boys: Edward R. Murrow and the young men, none of them yet famous, Murrow hired to staff CBS Radio in Europe on the eve of the Second World War.I was a kid of about six in Marshall, Texas, when my parents bought a used console radio so they could listen to Franklin Roosevelt’s speeches and I could follow the Saturday serials—especially “The Green Hornet,” my favorite masked vigilante. That’s how we discovered the Murrow Boys, by listening to the news every evening on CBS. Although I didn’t yet know what to make of the events being reported, I showed up faithfully to sit on the floor between my parents in their chairs, all of us listening together.I can still hear the voices coming from that stained brown console in the corner of our living room; still see the pictures their words painted in my mind’s eye. Their names, hardly known when they started, became hallowed in the annals of journalism. Murrow of course, Eric Sevareid, William L Shirer, Larry LeSeuer, Charles Collingwood, Howard K Smith, William Randall Downs, Richard C. Hottelet, Winston Burdett, Cecil Brown, Thomas Grandin, and the one woman among them, Mary Marvin Breckinridge. You can read about them in The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism, a superb book by Stanley Cloud and Lynne Olson.These reporters spread across Europe as the “phony war” of 1939–40 played out, much like the slow-motion catastrophe of global warming plays out in our time. They saw the threat posed by the Nazis, and they struggled to get the attention of an American public back home exhausted and drained by the Great Depression.In September of 1939, with Europe hours away from going up in flames, the powers at CBS in New York ordered Murrow and Shirer to feature an entertainment broadcast spotlighting dance music from nightspots in London, Paris, and Hamburg. Here’s the account from Cloud and Olson: “‘They say there’s so much bad news out of Europe, they want some good news,’ Murrow [in London] snapped to Shirer [in Berlin] over the phone. The show, scheduled to be broadcast just as Germany was about to rape Poland, would be called ‘Europe Dances’ … Finally, Murrow decreed, ‘The hell with those bastards in New York. It may cost us our jobs, but we’re just not going to do it’.” And they didn’t. They defied the bosses—and gave CBS one of the biggest stories of the 20th century, the invasion of Poland.And still the powers in New York resisted. Through the rest of 1939 and into the spring of 1940, Hitler hunched on the borders of France and the Low Countries, his Panzers idling, poised to strike. Shirer fumed, “My God! Here was the old continent on the brink of war…and the network was most reluctant to provide five minutes a day from here to report it.” Just as the networks and cable channels provide practically no coverage today of global warming.In time I would meet Ed Murrow and follow him as senior correspondent for the documentary series he created after the war with Fred Friendly. Eric Sevareid became a mentor, before and after I succeeded him as commentator on The CBS Evening News. Howard K. Smith and I frequently corresponded and traded books. And I had casual conversations with Charles Collingwood at the little French café he frequented near our office on West 57th street. These men rarely talked details of the past. But I will never forget my debt as a journalist to their work, or what they did for our country.Never in my own long career have I been as tested as they were. Or as you will be. Our own global warming “phony war” is over. The hot war is here.My colleague and co-writer, Glenn Scherer, compares global disruption to a repeat hit-and-run driver: anonymous, deadly, and requiring tireless investigation to identify the perpetrator. There are long stretches of nothing, then suddenly Houston is inundated and Paradise burns. San Juan blows away and salt water creeps into the subways of New York. The networks put their reporters out in raincoats or standing behind police barriers as flames consume far hills. Yet we rarely hear the words “global warming” or “climate disruption” in their reports. The big backstory of rising CO2 levels, escalating drought, collateral damage, cause and effect, and politicians on the take from fossil-fuel companies? Forget all that. Not good for ratings, say network executives.But last October, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scientifically conservative body, gave us 12 years to make massive changes to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions 45 percent below 2010 levels and to net zero by 2050. On his indispensable site, TomDispatch.com, Tom Engelhardt writes that humanity is now on a suicide watch.Soon, some of you will be traveling to the ends of the earth to report on this Great Disruption. To Indonesia, where oil-palm growers and commodities companies are stripping away forests vital to carbon storage. To the Amazon, where President Bolsonaro’s government plans to open indigenous reserves to industrial exploitation, threatening the lungs of the Earth. To India, where President Modi pretends to be an environmentalist even as he embraces destructive development. To China, where President Xi’s Belt and Road initiative, the biggest transportation-infrastructure program in the history of the world, threatens disaster for earth systems. You will go to the Arctic and the Antarctic to report on melting ice, and to the shores of African cities, Pacific atolls, and poor Miami neighborhoods being swallowed by rising oceans. And to Nebraska, and Iowa, and Kansas, and Missouri, where this spring’s crop is despair as farmers and their families grieve their losses.And some of you will go to Washington, to report on the madness—yes, I said madness—of a US government that scorns reality as fake news, denies the truths of nature, and embraces a theocratic theology that welcomes catastrophe as a sign of the returning Messiah.Madness! Superstition! Destruction and death.Can we get this story right? Can we tell it whole? Can we connect the dots and inspire people with the possibility of change?What’s journalism for? Really, in the war, what was journalism for, except to awaken the world to the catastrophe looming ahead of it? Here’s the good news: While describing David Wallace-Wells’s stunning new book The Uninhabitable Earth as a remorseless, near-unbearable account of what we are doing to our planet, The New York Times reports it also offers hope. Wallace-Wells says that “We have all the tools we need…to aggressively phase out dirty energy…”; [cut] global emissions…[and] scrub carbon from the atmosphere…. [There are] ‘obvious’ and ‘available,’ [if costly,] solutions.”What we need, he adds, is the “acceptance of responsibility.”Our responsibility as journalists is to tell the story so people get it. I wish I could go there with you to tell it. This is a very exciting time for journalism, despite our beleaguered newsrooms, our diminished ranks, and the power arrayed against truth. And I really do think this project – Covering Climate Now – could be the beginning of our redemption.Over my long life I’ve seen things change quickly. After the Birmingham bombing. After Selma. Vietnam. Nixon and Watergate. The Berlin Wall. The pendulum can swing suddenly. The public can change its mind.Which brings us back to the Murrow Boys. Late 1940. The start of the Blitz, with bombs blasting London to bits. A Gallup poll that September found that a mere 16% of Americans supported sending US aid to beleaguered Britain. Olson and Cloud tell us that, “One month later, as bombs fell on London, and Murrow and the Boys brought the reality of it into American living rooms, 52% thought more aid should be sent.”Americans had taken one step toward defeating fascism, and the Murrow Boys helped us take it. Of course, the journalists were only part of the cast, and I don’t want to overrate their importance. But they were there. On the right side. At the right time. In the right way—reporting on the biggest story of all, the fight for freedom. For life itself.Reporting the truth is always the basis for any moral authority we can claim as journalists. Reporting the truth about climate disruption, and its solutions, could be contagious. Our gathering today could be a turning point for American journalism.With no silver bullet, what do we do? We cooperate as kindred spirits on a mission of public service. We create partnerships to share resources. We challenge media owners and investors to act in the public interest. We keep the whole picture in our heads—how melting ice sheets in the Arctic can create devastation in the Midwest—and connect the dots for our readers, viewers, and listeners. We look every day at photographs of our children and grandchildren, to be reminded of the stakes. And we tell the liars, deniers, and do-nothings to shove off: There’s no future in naysaying.As some of you know, I am president of the Schumann Media Center, a small nonprofit devoted to the support of independent journalism. The Center is the progeny of the Florence and John Schumann Foundation, founded in Montclair, NJ, in l961 by a civic-minded couple whose offspring were brought up with a strong commitment to democratic values. Their support of my journalism on public television led us to join forces, which is how I became president of the foundation and now of the center. The family resolved to give away their wealth in their lifetime, and we are just about there; our resources are modest now, and we’re almost done.One of our last major gifts will be a million dollars to launch the Covering Climate Now project of The Columbia Journalism Review and The Nation and to get the project through the first year. Other foundations and individual philanthropists will then have to step up to the challenge, and I believe they will.This has been a good day of talking and thinking—now must come action. My colleagues at the Schumann Media Center wish all of you and all of those you represent—in newspapers, radio stations, local news, and major corporations—we wish all of you, because it will take all of you, every success. Bill Moyers is a broadcast journalist. He has earned 37 Emmys, nine Peabodys, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Television. He is president of the Schumann Media Center Bill Moyers is grateful to the veteran environmental journalist Glenn Scherer for the research and ideas he contributed to this speech.

Study by Diodato and Bellocchi show that Little Ice Age was not restricted to North Atlantic region (Painting by Hendrick Barentsz)
The climate of the last 10,000 years has been everything except stable, and global mean temperatures fluctuated by more than 1°C. Today’s “Modern Warm Period” was preceded by the Little Ice Age (LIA), which lasted from 1300 to 1850.
The high point of the Little Ice Age occurred during a period of weak solar activity from 1645-1715, called the Maunder Minimum. During this time, Central Europe turned bitter cold, glaciers grew and the Thames River even froze over in the wintertime. During the cold winter of 1683/1684, the ground froze more than a meter deep in Southern England.
The Little Ice Age is widely known for the North Atlantic region of Northern Europe, and for this reason some scientists falsely assumed that it had been a regional phenomenon and it was balanced out by other areas on the planet being warmer. However, this hypothesis has not been confirmed as a growing body of scientific literature shows that all continents were hit by the LIA.

In the Mediterranean region there have been no reliable temperature reconstructions from during this period. The existing tree-ring temperature reconstructions for the last 500 years have been regarded as riddled with problems as tree rings in some cases in the Alps and upper northern latitudes are turning out to be an unsuitable method for climate reconstructions.
An Italian team of scientists led by Nazzareno Diodato and Gianni Bellocchi of the Met European Research Observatory has analyzed historical climate records from the Mediterranean region of Italy to see how temperatures developed in southern Europe during the Little Ice Age. In their study they reconstructed the temperatures for the winter months December-February . The Moio and Susanna Manuscript as well as the Corradi-Annals made up the core of their study. The chronicles of Giovanni Battista Moio and Gregorio Susanna contained a list of extreme weather events and famine in the region of Calabria. The Corradi-Annals consist of a collection of reports on climate extremes and their impacts on the environment from 5 AD to 1850. In addition the researchers used other data sources such as a catalogue of the Italian Agency for New technologies on environmental events. Indices were calculated based on historical information and were converted into temperatures.
In their study, the Italian scientists discovered that the winters in the Mediterranean area of study were several degrees colder than what had been earlier assumed by coarser simulations for Europe. The scientists were able to show that the known cold phase of the Maunder Minimums was also prevalent in the Mediterranean region.
Extreme cold with snow occurred in 16 of 25 winters between 1675 and 1700. Especially the years 1665, 1677, 1684, 1687 and 1692 temperatures fell sharply and rivers on the Italian peninsula froze. From 1682 to 1707 a number of flooding catastrophes occurred in Northern Italy. Extremely cold winters struck between 1684 and 1694 and an especially cold winter in 1709. The Venetian Lagoon froze over in 1684 and 1709. The lowest temperature was measured in 1684. In Sicily a series of catastrophic harvests hit in the 1690s. For the cold of the 1683/1684 winter, a statistical period of repetition of 1000 years was calculated.
The study’s authors say that the cold at the peak of the Little Ice Age was mainly due to the low solar activity of the Maunder Minimum. However they do point out that there was large regional variability for climate development during this phase of solar inactivity in the Mediterranean region due to below average atmospheric air pressure. An important atmospheric element during this period was a high pressure zone over Northern Europe while low pressure dominated the Central Mediterranean region. This resulted in protracted weather blocking in the winter and associated cold snaps striking Central and Southern Europe.
The study impressively shows that the Little Ice Age was much more than an event restricted to the North Atlantic region. The Holocene.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEvery year 600,000 households (2 million people) are getting their power switched off in Germany because they can’t afford the skyrocketing electric bills. At that rate the country (population 80 million) will become blacked-out like North Korea by 2050.

Renewable energy boom leaves Germans in the dark.
It’s one way of reducing carbon emissions – just catapult your population back to the Stone Age. Online German flagship daily Die Welt has an article on how skyrocketing electricity prices are making electricity unaffordable for a large number of Germans.
Many people in Germany are no longer able to pay their electricity bills. And energy prices continue to climb – rapidly. The president of the VdK social association Ulrike Masche, accuses the German federal government “of having neglected the social dimension of the energy transformation”.
Over 10 years ago Germany enacted the Renewable Energy Feed-In Act (EEG) which requires power companies to pay small producers of renewable energy exorbitant rates for their green power. The power companies in turn simply pass the higher prices on to their customers. Electricity prices rose 10% in 2011 alone!
So far Germany has committed over 100 billion euros to renewable energy, all to be paid for by the consumer. Little wonder that today almost a seventh of Germany’s population is now living in “energy poverty”.
The high costs are hitting the poor and retirees especially hard. Die Welt writes:
Klaus Müller, Chairman of the Consumer Office in North Rhine Westphalia estimates: ‘Ten to fifteen percent of the population are struggling to finance the constantly rising energy costs.” Every year 600,000 households are getting their power cut off.’

‘Earlier energy poverty was a fringe problem. However in the meantime it has become an every day problem,’ said Müller.
According to a survey by the consumer protection group, 600,000 households per year are getting their power cut off because of unpaid electricity bills. Foremost the rapid expansion of renewable energies has led to a 10% rise in electricity prices.”
As utilities are forced to buy the exorbitantly expensive renewable energy, even when they don’t need it, they are forced to increase the prices they charge consumers.
Die Welt writes that the prices are expected to rise unabated and that they likely will even accelerate. The feed-in tariffs will add up to 5.2 cents to the price of each kilowatt-hour.
The greens, the architects of the energy feed-in act, deny they are responsible for the disaster, and blame Germany’s current conservative, liberal-democrat coalition government for the skyrocketing prices. The truth is that all the politicians zealously supported the feed-in tariffs, especially the conservative CDU led by Angela Merkel, who was duped and spurred on by crackpot scientists in Potsdam.
Some leading politicians are beginning to return to their senses, however, and are calling for more coal and gas power plants.
Well, they’d better hurry up. Otherwise expect the pubs and beerhalls to come alive with angry political talk – and soon.
Happy May Day everybody!

"When my daughter was two years old, I found myself struggling to finish any article relating to the dire state of our environment. I would get halfway through the piece, then disengage and move on to something else. I assumed I wasn’t the only parent to feel this way. Curious to understand why I seemed incapable of persisting, I reached out to the environmental psychologist Renee Lertzman. She explained that when we receive information charged with fear, dread or anxiety, the limbic system in our brain can be activated, which can override the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain associated with creative thinking and problem solving. These days our news feeds are filled with images and stories of a bleak future. This is what we bombard our consciousness with, the images we expose our children to and they may also be why many of us feel paralysed when it comes to taking action on solutions to save our planet. The diagnosis and acceptance of our problems is crucial but – much like when visiting a doctor –along with wanting a clear, detailed diagnosis, we also want to know what we can do to improve or even cure our condition. This is what I wanted to offer up to my now five-year-old daughter. A story that focuses on the solutions to our environmental dilemmas and reveals a different version of the future. Because as the neurologist Viktor Frankl explained in his Auschwitz memoir, Man’s Search for Meaning, if hope or faith in a better future becomes absent, the human spirit rapidly deteriorates. Over the last three years I’ve been making a film called 2040. It’s a visual letter to my daughter showing her what the world could look like that year if we put into practice some of the best solutions that exist today. I call it an exercise in “fact-based dreaming”, as everything I show her in the future has to already exist today. In three years of research and interviews, what emerged were solutions that improve health, income inequality, security and communities with the bonus of drastically reducing emissions and regenerating ecosystems. These solutions include decentralised solar micro-grids in remote villages that allow the buying and selling of energy between homes and keep money in the local economy. They include regenerative agriculture practices which takes carbon from the atmosphere and returns it to the soil with the cascading benefits of water retention and nutrient-dense food. And also the turbocharged sequestering power of seaweed, which can grow up to half a metre a day while restoring marine habitats and providing communities with food, fibre, fertilisers and biofuels. But perhaps the most poignant solution I came across was the wide-reaching impact the education and empowerment of girls and women would have. It is clear we have everything we need right now to create a better 2040. In this solution-based approach, I had to be careful to avoid a Pollyanna offering. The realities of intensified weather events by 2040, blocks to progress by vested interests, lack of leadership, trade treaties that favour profit over environment and our addiction to endless growth all had to be navigated. But, although these are extremely important issues, they are not the provinces of the story I wanted to tell. This is a film highlighting what we can fight for rather than fight against. Determination and passion are the most important renewable energy resources we have. People working together with a common goal will shift vested interests and make implementing the solutions possible. A friend rang me on the morning the UN released its global assessment report which found that 1 million species now face extinction due to our activities. His 12-year-old son was in tears at the breakfast table, asking what could be done – and my friend wanted to know what to say to him. My first response was to tell his son that it is OK to feel very upset and important to express those feelings – perhaps not enough of us do. But it was also important to let him know that there are millions, likely billions, of people who care deeply about his future and are becoming galvanised to invent, share and implement the solutions to this crisis. They are the “hope in the dark” that Rebecca Solnit writes about in her book of the same title. The flurry of inspirational activity that is taking place right now in the shadows, largely unreported. The world is facing its shadow in a variety of ways – and we can remind ourselves, and our children, that a shadow cannot exist without a source of light always being present. The Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan described the way we move forward in society as being like driving a motor car using only the rearview mirror. We use our past experiences to inform us. It is here that we can also find legitimate hope for future generations. Just decades before the abolitionists achieved their goal, they were labelled “utopian” and mocked for imagining the economy could survive without slaves. The suffragettes were repeatedly derided for taking to the streets: “Sensible and responsible women do not want to vote,” said the former US president Grover Cleveland. It is hard not to look at the inspirational Greta Thunberg and all the student climate strikers today, plus the impacts of Extinction Rebellion in the UK, and not feel that we’re in the middle of another historical moment. I made this film for my daughter and for her generation. I made it for parents and for anyone feeling overwhelmed or losing hope. It offers up a reframing of our ecological predicament as an opportunity to draw on our ingenuity and to rise to the challenge with creativity and empathy. It is a call to all to share our visions and dreams of a better world. If we don’t, we are likely to become a part of someone else’s vision. "
" The floods of 2009 and 2015 in north-west England were the worst for more than 550 years, according to groundbreaking analysis of lake sediment in the region. Residents have long suspected that the devastating floods were the worst in living memory, but this confirmation – from an analysis of lake sediment layers – provides a unique window on to the history of flooding in one of the wettest parts of England, and reveals the global climate crisis.  Floods in the region in 2009 and 2015 – the latter the result of Storm Desmond – grabbed the headlines at the time, but are increasingly being linked to evidence of the UK’s vulnerability to the climate emergency. The new analysis shows that the most recent floods were unprecedented in key respects. In 2015, more than 50,000 homes in Cumbria were flooded or had severe impacts from flooding. While the loss of life was relatively small, the damage to local people is still being felt in many areas. Similarly, floods in 2009 left thousands of people displaced from their homes, which took years to be resolved. Richard Chiverrell, a professor of physical geography at the University of Liverpool, and the lead scientist conducting the research, said: “The convergence of information suggests a link with a warmer world and recent extreme flooding is likely.” He said factors such as the way land is managed and changing farming practices were likely to have only a small effect, compared with the overriding force of changing weather. He added: “The unprecedented nature of the recent phase of extreme floods accords with statements from the Environment Agency that climate changes and associated impacts on the frequency and magnitude of extreme events are one of the greatest challenges facing our society.” This is believed to be the first time such an analysis has been used to gauge recent flooding against historic norms in the UK, and the same technique could be used elsewhere to form a wider picture of flooding in Britain in recent years. The researchers studied Bassenthwaite Lake in Cumbria, where each flooding event leaves a distinct layer of sediment at the bottom. Flooding leaves much coarser sediment than normal deposits, because it washes in large amounts of material from the surrounding hills and streams. That left researchers with a much easier task in sorting out which layers came from particular events. In their paper, published in the journal Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, the team of researchers led by the universities of Liverpool and Southampton compared the evidence of lake sediment from the floods of 2009 and 2015 with the 558-year record from the sediment at the bottom of the Bassenthwaite lake. David Sear, a professor at the University of Southampton, said: “For the first time, we have been able to take sedimentary records from lake beds and convert them into the kind of data used by flood risk managers. These are the events that cause most damage and cost to society, so improving our ability to estimate their chance of occurring is important.”"
"A quarter of the UK’s land could be restored to nature, making a significant contribution towards cutting the nation’s carbon emissions to zero, under a new rewilding proposal. The plan, published by Rewilding Britain, calls for billions of pounds in farm subsidies to be redirected towards creating native woodlands and meadows and protecting peat bogs and salt marshes. The group says wildlife would benefit, farmers would not lose money and food production need not fall. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, is in favour of natural solutions to the climate crisis and huge losses of wildlife, and the government has pledged it will ensure “public money is spent on public goods” after the UK leaves the EU’s subsidy regime. Currently these subsidies total £3bn a year, with 13% going to environmental schemes. The new plan anticipates £1.9bn being used to support action on global heating and wildlife. The scheme would create 2m hectares (4.94m acres) of new woodland and 2m hectares of species-rich meadows, and ensure full protection of the UK’s 2m hectares of peat bogs and heaths. These ecosystems would absorb and store carbon dioxide equivalent to 10% of the UK’s annual emissions. The government’s official climate advisers reported this month that UK emissions must fall to zero by 2050. But the Committee on Climate Change said some activities, such as flying, would still cause emissions, meaning tree growing and other measures to suck CO2 from the air are vital. Rebecca Wrigley, the chief executive of Rewilding Britain, said 85,000 people had already signed a parliamentary petition backing natural solutions to the climate emergency, with support strongest in rural areas. She said being paid to plant woodlands and meadows or protect peat bogs could be important fresh sources of income for farmers. “Farmers will certainly not be worse off – it is about diversifying and providing alternatives,” she said. “No one is going to be required to do anything on their land that they do not choose to do.” The proposals would revive wildlife in the UK, one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. “The beauty of rewilding is that it could also benefit biodiversity,” Wrigley said. “People have forgotten what native habitats [such as forests] really look like, and how abundant they once were.” Wrigley said rewilding such a large proportion of the UK did not have to involve an overall reduction in food production. She pointed to examples such as the Knepp estate in Sussex and to millions of hectares of low-grade agricultural land, much of it in the uplands. There are 1.8m hectares of deer stalking estates and 1.3m hectares of grouse moor estates, the report notes. The report suggests rates of subsidy based on how many tonnes of CO2 are captured, multiplied by an indicative carbon price of £40 per tonne (about double the UK’s current price). This would make new woodlands the most valuable at £512 per hectare per year. Enhancing and restoring peat bogs, heaths and salt marshes would all earn about £300 per hectare per year. These rates are lower than current EU subsidies for planting winter food for seed-eating birds (£640) and a nectar flower mix for pollinators (£524). Rewilding Britain said more ambitious and expensive schemes for restoring habitats could be paid for with a nationwide carbon tax on emissions. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Climate change is one of the most urgent and pressing challenges we face today.” He said tackling the climate crisis was one of the “public goods” for which farmers would be rewarded in the future, and was also a key part of a long-term vision for a more productive, low-carbon farming sector. The National Farmers Union wants agriculture to reach net zero emissions by 2040. Guy Smith, the NFU’s deputy president, said this month: “Acting to tackle damaging climate change is vital. However, we will not halt climate change by curbing British production and exporting it to countries which may not have the same environmental conscience.” Wrigley said ministers were moving in the right direction but current schemes were far too small in scale. “The UK parliament has declared a climate emergency, [so] the response has to be decisive and rapid,” she said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis summer in Germany is yet another wet one. Everywhere the media are moaning about the ongoing rains, lack of sunshine, flooded basements, etc. It was the same story last year. German scientists are stumped, their models have been exposed as being completely wrong – again.
For years Germany’s “climate scientists” kept warning the German public and governments they had to prepare for drier summers with periods of drought – because of galloping climate change. That’s what the climate models of renown institutes like the Max Planck Institute and the Potsdam Institute showed. That cannot be denied.
For example the online Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung here warned “Climate change, according to the German Weather Service, will result in very rainy low pressure areas during the wintertime and more dryness with periods of drought in the summertime. The source of this projection is DWD Vice President Paul Becker, early May.
Not long ago, the online Der Tagesspiegel warned its readers of the same: “Wet winters, dry summers, less water, high temperatures, more hail, more storm damage.” Here they were using model projections from the Potsdam Institute of Bedwetters and Climate Neurotics (PIK).
In September, 2008, Der Spiegel here wrote: “More heat waves, no snow in the winter: After years of calculation work, the climate prognoses of the German government are complete. With unprecedented accuracy they predict how the climate will change by the year 2100 – region by region.” Unfortunately the “unprecedented accuracy” they’ve seen up to now is not what they had in mind.
Der Spiegel here also wrote: “Calculation made by Max Planck Institute scientists show that temperatures over Germany could be on average 1°C higher beginning already in 2021.” For sure we’ll be checking up on that in just a few more years.
Der Spiegel continues: “‘Every few years there will be heat waves like 2003,’ said climate scientists of the Max Planck Institute.”
Well, we’re still waiting for it. If anything, the summers in Germany have been getting rainier and cooler – not resembling anything at all the summer of 2003.
Not only have the summers been misprdicted with astounding failure, but so have the recent winters. Here Der Spiegel predicted increasingly snowless winters. By 2031, much of Germany could expect never to see snow again. However, the last winters have seen a large number of days with snow cover. Indeed the red-colored Germany needs to be repainted green or even blue!
Looking back at the much ballyhooed climate models, we see that they’ve made a complete string of major mispredictions:

1. Not a single model predicted the stagnant temperatures the globe has seen for the last 15 years.
2. Not a single model projected the recent slowdown in sea level rise.
3. Not a single model predicted harsh winters of the type many parts of the world have experienced.
4. Not a single model projected the disappearance of hurricanes striking the US. Not a single model prjected fewer cyclones globally.
5. Not a single model projected increasing sea ice at the South Pole.
Just to name a few.
Germany’s once highly renowned, prestigious and respected science institutes are slowly but surely turning themselves into laughing stocks with their pseudo-science. All thanks to a small group of closed-minded activist scientists.
Finally, here’s the 7-day forecast near where I live, from www.wetter24.de:

No barbecue days in sight…middle of July with high temps in the low 60s…unbelievable warming!

I’m not sure if other bloggers have written about this. If so, here it is again. The paper forecasts solar activity for the current Solar cycle 24, which they expect will peak in May, 2013 with a maximum sunspot number Rmax of 62 ± 12.
More importantly, the authors write (emphasis added):
The subsequent analysis, based on a phase diagram, which is a diagram showing the relation between maximum sunspot numbers and minimum geomagnetic aa index values leads to the conclusion that a new Grand Episode in solar activity has started in 2008.”
and
…we predict that this Grand Episode will be of the Regular Oscillations type, which is the kind of oscillations that also occurred between 1724 and 1924. Previous expectations of a Grand (Maunder-type) Minimum of solar activity cannot be supported. We stress the significance of the Hallstatt periodicity for determining the character of the forthcoming Grand Episodes.  No Grand Minimum is expected to occur during the millennium that has just started.”
That of course is good news, as the world can ill-afford climate conditions like the ones we saw during the Maunder Minimum – especially with governments racing to prepare for the exact opposite.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI got an e-mail from reader Thomas L. with a link to an opinion piece at Vermont Tiger titled “Fire On The Mountain“, written by Vermont state Senator Joe Benning.

Vermont disfigures, self-mutilates its scenic ridgelines and mountains for the sake of a blind obsession. Source: lowellmountainsnews.com/
It shows how public opinion on the issue of “green” energy is evolving in Vermont, and that (some) people are finally coming to their senses. Also read big-wind-moratorium/.
German readers will quickly see that Vermont is not leading the world in renewable energy, but is in fact now just a monkey imitating the failed energy policies we’ve already seen here in Europe and Germany. Vermont’s leaders are not visionaries; they have blindly hitched their wagon to a European train whose locomotive has already gone over the edge of a cliff. It’s time to unhitch.
=============================================
Fire On The Mountain
by Joe Benning
Recently I hiked up to the top of Lowell Ridge to see where twenty-one, four hundred foot wind towers will be placed. As I crested the mountain I came face to face with an energy policy that is at war with itself. The environmental destruction taking place there pits those seeking to reverse climate change against those who wish to preserve Vermont’s pristine natural resources. While that battle rages, the economic cost to Vermont has been pushed aside as irrelevant.

Our new energy policy calls for a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050. Targeting our entire energy spectrum (including transportation), it relies on instate renewables to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. At the same time we’re eliminating Hydro Quebec, nuclear power, fracked natural gas and less efficient biomass electricity as acceptable “renewables.” Industrial wind, currently the darling of the present administration, has become the power that now drives our legislative policy.
What price are we willing to pay for this new policy? Vermont currently does a better job than most states at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, so self-imposed mandates are not even necessary. And to those who believe Vermont will “lead the way” in reversing climate change, any hope that Vermont alone can cause a world-wide domino effect to achieve this lofty goal should be carefully balanced against the very real environmental destruction taking place right now in the cherished natural solitude of the Northeast Kingdom.
And more wind farms are coming as corporate investors, motivated by tax incentives and artificially inflated electric rates, seduce small towns with infusions of cash. Since wind is intermittent and has no storage capacity, our policy alone will require more wind farms and many miles of transmission lines to achieve our energy goal. If regulatory authorities fall short insisting on decommissioning plans, our ridgelines will end up littered with forty story rusting hulks when this technology becomes obsolete. These new wind farms are encroaching on our wildlife corridors, destroying pristine mountain environments and radically changing the aesthetics of our state. They pit citizens of towns against each other, and towns against towns in a given region.
In the meantime, we in the legislature have not been living up to the responsibility that comes with guarding Vermont’s Constitution. Article 18 urges us to be moderate and frugal when enacting only such legislation as is necessary for the good government of this state. At a time when Vermont already has more power than it can use, our new policy is not moderate, not frugal, and certainly not necessary. We haven’t even taken the time to ask ourselves what these policy goals will mean to our economy in the absence of similar goals in surrounding states.
I cannot support the raping of a pristine environment in exchange for intermittent power that has to be subsidized by both the taxpayer and the ratepayer. At a time when Vermont already has an ample power supply, this is no energy plan, it is a blind obsession. It’s time for Vermonters of every political stripe to join together in defense of ‘These Green Hills and Silver Waters.'”

Share this...FacebookTwitterProf. Augusto Mangini of the University of Heidelberg in Germany is an expert for temperature reconstructions using stalactites and stalagmites.
He was allowed to speak a whole 15 minutes at the World Extreme Weather Congress in Hamburg last moth, where he presented some sobering results. These in turn were reported by the print edition of a leading German science news magazine Bild der Wissenschaft.Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne website.
His presentation was called: “Climate Curves in Comparison– Why There Are Such Large Differences“.
In the current April 2012 issue of Bild der Wissenschaft, Klaus Jacob has a report “Klima in Kalk“ (Climate in Limestone) where he describes the method and climatological relationships of stalactites that Mangini uses. Jacob writes:
[Mangini] has been working with stalactites and stalagmites for 15 years – and has come to an amazing conclusion: The natural climate fluctuations are greater than what the science has previously assumed. This has consequences for the future as the fluctuations will superimpose the human impacts. Thus the continents will not necessarily always become warmer, rather the trend could take a break, or even a temporary cooling is possible.“
Don’t you love how the main stream media, after years of being stuck on CO2, are finally waking up to REAL SCIENCE. Jacob continues:

[Using stalactites and stalagmites] Mangini has reconstructed the central European climate over the last 9000 years. Clear to see are the stark ups and downs with differences of about 2°C. […] Already on multiple occasions over the last 8000 years the temperature shot up 1°C within just 200 years. The temperature appears to fluctuate naturally more starkly than what the IPCC shows in its reports […] Mangini’s curves now show […] the start of a cooling phase.“
Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s Die kalte Sonne site writes that Jacob’s article addressed some important points, which other German journalists are unfortunately too spineless to write about:
(1)  The pre-industrial, post Ice Age period was characterized by natural climate fluctuations without the involvement of CO2.
(2)  These natural fluctuations today still play a major role on our climate, which up to now has been played down.
(3)  The IPCC models are thus not as perfect as they are often claimed to be.
(4)  The warming stop since 2000 could continue, and even bring a modest cooling with it.
(5)  Ocean cycles such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) or the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) will suppress the temperatures over the coming decades.
Die kalte Sonne site then expresses some disappointment that Jacob did not mention the likely cause of these past, stark climate fluctuations – cyclic solar activity. Here skeptics will have to be patient with the mainstream media. We cannot expect them to change overnight. Rome, after all, was not built in a day.
Prof. Mangini’s presentation coincides with a recently released study that adds yet another straw to the camel’s back. The study Holocene climate variability in North-Eastern Italy: potential influence of the NAO and solar activity recorded by speleothem data, authored by Scholz et al (co-authored by Mangini) concludes from the data:
This suggests that climate variability in Northern Italy was influenced by both solar activity and the NAO during the Holocene.”
There we are once again: the sun and oceans dominate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJuliet Eilperin sees the “climate change” issue slipping away. It is no longer the number one environmental concern among Americans. When climate change is ranked among all problems that concern Americans, most polls show it as a mere asterisk, or bundled in with “other” or “misc.”
Eilperin starts her commentary:
Just 18 percent of those polled name it as their top environmental concern. That compares with 33 percent who said so in 2007, amid publicity about a major U.N. climate report and Al Gore’s Oscar-winning documentary about global warming. Today, 29 percent identify water and air pollution as the world’s most pressing environmental issue.”
That means the number of people who view climate change as a problem has been almost cut in half in just 5 years. Now about 60% more people are concerned about water and air pollution in the world – that’s good!
Clearly education on the issue of climate is spreading. People are becoming aware that climate change is natural and that the globe has not warmed in 15 years.
Eilperin writes that “the findings indicate that Washington’s decision to shelve action on climate policy means that the issue has receded” and that some “who feel passionately about the issue say they have noticed that President Obama is no longer pushing a bill that would limit greenhouse gas emissions.”
Don’t expect any politicians to make climate change a central issue in this year’s elections.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore on Sulfur Dioxide
By Ed Caryl
Nearly all of the literature about SO2 claims that it is not a greenhouse gas. This “consensus” opinion is based on the belief that SO2 residence time in the atmosphere is too short for the gas to have an effect.
In my last article on this subject it was asserted that the severe pollution from Norilsk in Siberian Russia moves out over the Arctic Ocean on the prevailing winds, preventing cooling, slowing the freeze-up. This is seen on the anomaly maps as warming. (It is now warmer than the 1998-2006 average.) As can be seen in Figure 1, the same thing happens in Arctic Canada, due to the SO2 from Canadian oil and gas fields that produce similar amounts of SO2.
There have been several estimates for the residence time of SO2 in the atmosphere. Keep in mind that residence time is the half-life of the substance in the air, that is, the time it takes for half of the material to disappear. If the residence time of SO2 is ten days, this means that, ignoring dilution, the 50,000 parts per million present at Norilsk, will be 25,000 parts per million 10 days later as the wind pushes that parcel of air over the Arctic Ocean, 12,500 parts per million after 20 days, 6,250 after a month, about 750 ppm after two months, etc. Because of inversions over the Arctic Ocean, there isn’t much vertical mixing to dilute the gas, so most of the mixing is horizontal in about a 100 meter altitude layer.
But, (and it is a big but) the residence time increases with a reduction in temperature. In the Arctic, at temperatures way below zero centigrade, the residence time may be more than 30 days, so multiply the time intervals above by three. That covers a whole season. And the SO2 is continuously being replenished. We are not describing an impulse in time like a volcanic eruption. Concentrations over the Arctic Ocean may build up and approach the concentrations at the source, if the wind blows steadily from south to north for an extended time. The residence time increases if there is nothing to remove the SO2.
Here are the things that remove SO2 from the atmosphere (read here).
1. Direct photo-oxidation (in the presence of oxygen and water).
But in the Arctic in the winter there is no sunlight, so that doesn’t function. The water vapor concentration is also very low. Below freezing, water vapor partial pressure is below 5 mbar; at -20°C it is below 1.5 mbar (below 0.5% and 0.15% of the atmosphere).
2. Indirect photo-oxidation (with O2, NOx, OH, organic oxidants).
Same problem as 1, no sunlight. And no sunlight to produce OH radicals.
3. Oxidation in liquid droplets (in the presence of liquid water).
There is no liquid water remember? The temperatures are way below zero.
4. Homogeneous aqueous phase oxidation.

Same problem as 3.
5, Catalyzed oxidation in liquid droplets (requires metal ions as well as water droplets).
This one might work, as there are lots of metal ions in the pollution from Norilsk, if there are super-cooled water droplets. But as in 1, the water vapor availability is very low because of the cold. What acid production that does occur happens in the smelter smokestacks where water vapor and temperatures allow 3, 4, or 5 to operate. Once the SO2 gets into the cold, dry, arctic air, all that stops.
6. Catalyzed oxidation on dry surfaces.
No joy here. Once it reaches the coast, the stuff is over open ocean or ice.
So, in winter, once SO2 leaves the smelter smokestacks, there is no mechanism to get rid of it. No wonder the Arctic is warming!
Is this what happens? Is the Arctic warming in winter? The climate scientists say it is, and in this regard they are correct.

Figure 2: Monthly maps of Arctic temperature anomaly for the last 7+ years. Source: Climate4You.
Note in Figure 2 the amount of red and orange (warm) areas in the October through April months. December and January have the most red in several of the years above. Most of the warm areas are right over Norilsk in Arctic Siberia. The warming happens only in the cold months. In Arctic summer there are mostly cool colors. In Arctic summer the humidity rises, sunlight produces OH radicals, and all the mechanisms 1 through 6 above begin operating, removing the SO2.
According to one source, 93.5% of the SO2 emissions in 1998 were in the Northern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere is where most of the measured warming is taking place. Circumstantial evidence would seem to point to SO2 as the culprit. Can SO2 act as a greenhouse gas? It has an infrared spectrum with two peaks at 7.27 and 7.345 µm. This is on the shoulder of one of water vapor’s absorbance peaks. In the absence of water vapor, in the Arctic cold, it can replace it as a greenhouse gas. In that role it can produce back radiation just as water vapor, CO2, and methane do. In past periods of high volcanism high volcanic emissions of SO2 have overwhelmed natural reduction mechanisms and have produced warming periods (see here).
The study of SO2, especially how it acts in the polar regions, has been neglected in favor of pushing CO2 as the ONLY cause of global warming. As is easily seen by looking at anomaly maps, the warming is not global. It is concentrated in the Arctic at certain locations, and to a lesser degree, the Antarctic, again, in the Southern Hemisphere winter. In the Antarctic, warming seems to be concentrated around the large research stations. All the stations in the Antarctic burn oil for heat, power, and transport. Is SO2 and the Antarctic winter the problem there?

"It is an almost perfect spring day. The sky is milky blue and there is barely a ripple on the mirror-flat expanse of Barmouth Bay. The sunshine is warm and the mountains are beginning to turn from slate-grey to luscious green. Bev Wilkins, a former businesswoman, launches a ball down the beach for her beloved German shepherd rescue dog, Lottie. In a blur of legs and black fur, the dog dashes into the frothy surf. “It is a lovely spot when the sun comes out,” she says, welcoming her dripping pet back with an affectionate rub. “Horrible when it rains.”  This is how Wilkins, 67, expected to spend her retirement when she sold her family home in Warwick and moved to Fairbourne, in north Wales, in 2002. For many years it was blissful: she spent her summers swimming in the sea and drying off in the back garden. Winters were harder, although she always had the views of Snowdonia’s rugged slopes to lift her spirits. But if Wilkins lasts nearly as long as her mother, who is 98 and also lives in the village, she could be among the first residents to be moved out: Gwynedd council has decided it can no longer defend her home from rising sea levels driven by increasing global temperatures. “This is a wake-up call for the country,” she says, making her way up the steep shingle bank to the wall that protects her white bungalow from the waves. “This is going to happen elsewhere. Sometimes you have to see someone else go through it – we just happen to be the first.” In 26 years – or sooner, if forecasts worsen or a storm breaches the sea defences – a taskforce led by Gwynedd council will begin to move the 850 residents of Fairbourne out of their homes. The whole village – houses, shops, roads, sewers, gas pipes and electricity pylons – will then be dismantled, turning the site back into a tidal salt marsh. It will become the first community in the UK to be decommissioned as a result of climate change; while other villages along England’s crumbling east coast have lost houses to accelerating erosion, none have been abandoned. It may also create hundreds of British climate refugees: the residents of Fairbourne are not expected to receive any compensation for the loss of their homes, and resettlement plans are unclear. It will not be the last village to meet this fate. Sea levels around the UK have risen by 15.4cm since 1900, and the Met Office expects them to rise by as much as 1.12m from modern levels by 2100, putting at risk communities in coastal floodplains and on sea cliffs, which are found around much of the east and south coast of England. The west of Wales and north-west England are also vulnerable. Even if the world’s governments succeed in reversing increasing emissions in line with their Paris climate commitments, sea levels are set to rise for centuries, as the impact of higher global temperature and warmer oceans takes effect. *** Fairbourne rises, somewhat improbably, from reedy mudflats that slide into the Irish Sea. A straggle of white bungalows, holiday cottages and Victorian apartments, the village spreads out between the brackish waters of the Mawddach estuary mouth and the pale uplands of the Snowdonia national park. On a bright day, with birdsong carrying on the warm breeze, it is easy to understand why the Victorian flour merchant Arthur McDougall chose this spot to build his ideal seaside resort in the late 1890s. Since then, it has developed sporadically into a thriving and joyously eccentric English-speaking village of about 410 homes, with a shop, deli, chippy, butchers, campsite and a popular model railway. Many retired couples moved here from industrial towns and cities in the Midlands, inspired by vivid memories of childhood holidays in north Wales. Others were attracted by the spectacular landscape and the uncrowded beaches – along with relatively affordable house prices. Gwynedd council decided it could not afford to defend the village indefinitely in 2013. But the first time most local people heard about the new shoreline management plan was the following year, when BBC Wales’s investigative television series, Week In Week Out, highlighted parts of it in the wake of ferocious storms. The village, which is barely above sea level, is protected by a sea wall, earth banks and a network of drainage channels. These defences were recently improved as part of a £6.8m scheme to extend the life of the village; but from the middle of the century, increasingly regular flooding could render Fairbourne unhabitable. A breach of the wall during a storm surge could sweep away houses and drown villagers. As word of the council’s decision spread, house sales fell through and prices collapsed. Some residents simply stopped maintaining their homes and gardens. Others formed a campaign group, claiming that the reporting of the plan was misleading, and that the village had been unfairly singled out by Gwynedd. They argued that flooding was much worse in Aberystwyth, Barmouth and Borth in 2014. The campaign petered out when key members moved away, but much of the bitterness remains. Wilkins, one of the original campaigners, feels the village has been badly treated. “There are hundreds of residents in Fairbourne,” she says, as we talk in her living room. “We’ve got the little railway. We’ve got the shops. We’ve got a post office. We are a thriving community, and that’s all going to be wiped out. I don’t like to think about it.” Houses have started to sell again, but only to cash buyers looking for bargains; some calculate they can make a profit from rental income in the time Fairbourne has left. However, many of the villagers cannot drop their asking prices £40,000 or £50,000 below the already depressed market rate for the area, because they could not afford to buy anywhere else. Halfway along a quiet, sun-dappled cul-de-sac, Cathy Bowen, 83, and George Bowen, 76, are struggling to sell their two-bedroom bungalow for £125,000. The couple moved to the village from Staffordshire 18 years ago after falling in love with the area on family caravan holidays. But they want to sell because George, a cancer survivor who has type 2 diabetes, needs to be near a hospital. “We want to move because George is not very well and I’m 83,” says Cathy, perched on a stool in their cosy lounge. “I won’t be able to look after him for long.” There has been no interest so far. “It’s been on for three months and not a soul has been here to see it,” she says, glumly. For Mike Thrussell, 64, a well-known angling journalist, this is the untold story of Fairbourne. Thrussell lives in one of the older, McDougall-era properties just below the sea wall, and claims the council has abandoned the villagers without any solutions. “There are a lot of people in my position. I’ve been here 38 years. My house is paid for. I’m two and half years away from retirement,” he says. “And then this comes along.” Thrussell, who used to co-present BBC Five Live’s Fish on Five, says houses in Fairbourne have lost a good 40% of their value – and are bound to drop further as the decommissioning date approaches. “People who want to sell are taking very cheap cash deals. I can’t do that. Where am I going to go? I wouldn’t get enough money to get another house,” he says, slamming his kitchen table in frustration. Many villagers, he explains, had been planning to use their homes to pay for their care. “How the authorities can sit there and push this forward with no solutions beggars belief,” he says. Elsewhere in the village there is a mixture of sadness, denial and confusion about the long-term threat. Standing at the bow of his boat, Barmouth’s former harbourmaster, Julian Kirkham, is adamant that he will not leave his home and says even scientists can’t agree on sea-level rises. “It is just panic,” he says. “There has been so much waffle that nobody knows what will happen.” Younger residents will almost certainly experience the decommissioning of the village – although many question the likelihood of flooding. Julia Walker, 32, who is buying groceries in the local shop, tells me she cannot move out. “Our house is nice, but the thought that you might be in negative equity isn’t great when you have a young family starting out.” She has three children, and is pregnant with a fourth. The villagers feel powerless, she says. “We don’t have options. We are just pawns.” Shane Healy, 27, is leaning on a post outside the shop. His mother moved to the village from Sutton Coldfield in the Midlands shortly before he was born. “It will be a shame to lose everything. It has been built up from scratch and to watch it go under water would be heartbreaking for a lot of people,” he says. Benjamin Winfer, 18, is walking his two dogs along the beach. He works in a nearby chocolate factory. He would like to buy, but banks refuse to lend in Fairbourne. “I love it here,” he says, over the crackle of the tide dragging the shingle back and forth. “I want to live here for the rest of my life, but I can’t get a mortgage.” Despite the uncertain future, some people are moving into Fairbourne. One of the new arrivals is Angie Brown, a retired tax officer. She parks outside the shop and dashes in to pick up some beer for an impromptu barbecue. “This is la-la land – flooding is not going to happen,” she says. “Yes, the prices will continue to drop, but we will get the pleasure of living here in the meantime.” Next day, the weather turns. The sea is wild and frothy. A bitter wind blasts the village and hailstones the size of boiled sweets pound the beach. The engineer responsible for maintaining Fairbourne’s flood defences, Gareth Evens, is sensibly waiting in his Natural Resources Wales van. He knows better than anyone the multiple risks the village faces. “At high tide you can see how vulnerable Fairbourne is,” he says. “There are not many places where the houses are almost lower than the level of sea. If the sea defence fails then people are at risk straightaway. It would be catastrophic.” Evens says that, while other areas along the coast might appear to have a worse history of flooding, rising sea levels make it hard to defend Fairbourne in the long run. “It is a low-lying area. It is kept dry by sea defences, tidal defences and a network of ditches,” he says. The tide is predicted to reach ever higher up the beach as the century progresses. This makes it more likely that waves could come over the top or break the concrete sea wall, which sits on a single bank that is steadily being swept away. “If the defence is breached, there would be an immediate torrent of water. We are talking about loss of life, because the houses are built just behind,” Evens says. The threat doesn’t just come from the sea. Rainwater pours off the mountains and water surges up and down the estuary. Higher tides mean the water cannot always drain away through tidal flaps and backs up in the village. “You have almost got a basin in Fairbourne. All the runoff water naturally wants to come here,” he says. Would Evens buy a house here? “Knowing what I know, I probably would not,” he says. As hail drums on roofs and wind rakes the beach, the council officer tasked with the decommissioning, Lisa Goodier, arrives in her car. She has grown to know the area well since she was appointed to work with the community in 2014, and is greeted warmly by a few brave dog walkers. “It is sad to think this will all be gone,” she remarks after taking cover in a seafront cafe. “But I hope it will be a big moment in this country for taking climate change seriously.” Goodier has been drawing up a masterplan covering the timetable for decommissioning the village. “Based on the current rates of sea-level rise, we are planning to start in 2045,” she says. This will involve removing all trace of human existence. “It means we would eventually return this land to the sea,” Goodier says. “We would have to move everybody out, and then every ounce of infrastructure to return it to a salt marsh over time.” However, the plan is on “a piece of elastic”: the process may have to be brought forward immediately if the sea wall is breached and inundated. “If we have an early breach in the next two years then we need to be able to condense that very quickly,” she says, cradling a cup of takeaway tea. Goodier says the villagers are “unlikely” to get any compensation but will receive help to resettle. “The idea is to work with the community to gradually move them out and provide solutions that we can all live with. They will not be great solutions, given where we are financially,” she says. Gwynedd council has been cutting spending for more than a decade and is facing a shortfall of £13m in 2019/20. Goodier is aware that the stakes are high for residents who may end up with no assets. “What we don’t want to do is create a bunch of climate refugees, because Fairbourne is at risk of that,” she warns. There are no plans to rebuild the village elsewhere, not least because there is no land available in the Snowdonia national park. Instead, residents are likely to be placed in existing towns and villages in north Wales. Goodier admits that this will be challenging: “Are those places capable of absorbing that number of people?” Added to this is the risk that Welsh-speaking communities may not accept them. “Do people want to go there, and do people want to receive people from Fairbourne? Fairbourne is unusual because it is an English-speaking community in the most Welsh county in the whole of Wales,” Goodier says. This is uncharted territory for local authorities. There has never been a similar decommissioning project in the UK, and there is no fund to manage the impact of climate change, Goodier says. She has searched in vain for international precedents, but found only a flood-prone Alaskan village that was voluntarily relocated in 2016. The Welsh minister responsible for flooding, Lesley Griffiths, is sympathetic to the villagers’ plight but says the government is under no legal obligation to provide compensation. “I know that sounds hard, but we don’t want to raise expectations that financial support could be available,” she says. Griffiths admits that rising sea levels could mean that other Welsh communities are given up to the sea. “There may come a time when it is not sustainable or safe to try to continue to defend low-lying areas, if our seas rise as predicted,” she says. Talk of decommissioning angers the Arthog community council, the equivalent of an English parish council. Stuart Eves, the council’s vice-chair, lives in a rambling stone farmhouse on the outskirts of Fairbourne. He arrived from Buckinghamshire 40 years ago and runs the 30-pitch caravan park, which fills up every weekend throughout the summer. “Goodier is wrong to say she is going to decommission the village. You decommission a factory or something like that. We are not a factory – the village is full of humans who have spent their life’s money to come and live here because it is such a beautiful place,” he says in his living room, which is infused with the rich tang of wood smoke. The community council is opposed to Gwynedd’s plans for Fairbourne. “We are going to object strongly to this masterplan. There are no hard facts,” he says, leaning forward in his chair. “Nobody can really say if the sea level is going to increase or decrease.” Other communities are likely to face similar battles in the coming decades. While cities and areas with important industries are likely to be defended, smaller coastal communities are most at risk. Norfolk villages such as Happisburgh, which has lost 35 homes to the sea, and Hemsby, which has lost 18 homes, are on the frontline of accelerating coastal erosion. But these are not facing decommissioning because only the outskirts are threatened at present; in a few cases, demolished homes have been relocated further inland. There’s no such option in Fairbourne, caught between the sea and the mountains. A report for the government Committee on Climate Change (CCC) last year found nearly 530,000 properties at risk along the English coast. By the 2080s, up to 1.5m homes will be at risk of flooding, with more than 100,000 homes at risk from coastal erosion. In Wales, 104,000 properties are at risk of coastal flooding. The lead author of the CCC report, Jim Hall, says existing plans to protect the coast are unfunded and unrealistic, and that the public are being kept in the dark about the real risks. “The situation on the coast is a timebomb,” he says down the line from Oxford University, where he is professor of climate and environmental risk. “About half the coast of England is protected with sea walls, promenades and other coastal defences. But many of these are reaching the end of their lives. It is just not going to be affordable to continue to protect large stretches of coastline.” Hall argues that the chancellor will have to foot the bill to defend densely populated areas with important industries; he says the CCC’s analysis shows councils are claiming wrongly that they can afford to protect at least 185km of England’s coastline. “Some coastal communities are being told by councils that they can hold the line for part or all of the century,” he says. “But funding for these locations is unlikely.” Hall would like local authorities to lead difficult conversations in these threatened communities, which could include the relocation of existing homes and limiting the approval of new properties. “We need to start making hard choices now,” he says. “This needs to be an inclusive process with some accompanying funding because communities need to be supported if they are going to adapt.” Instead of making impossible promises to build bigger defences, authorities should allow a new coastline to form, to protect communities further inland. “Coastlines are naturally resilient. They roll backwards. Beaches, wetlands, mudflats provide a natural buffer against storms and waves,” Hall says. The Environment Agency’s new flood and coastal erosion strategy for England, published earlier this month, admits its engineers cannot win a war against water and accepts some coastal communities will have to be moved. But it doesn’t propose any funding streams. While rising sea levels will be far more devastating for the millions living in low-lying regions in the developing world, British coastal communities still need help to adapt. “Poor, densely populated, coastal mega-cities like Lagos [in Nigeria] are less able to invest in defences and cope with flooding,” Hall says. “But climate change will create many victims in the UK, too – and we do not have those excuses.” The residents of Fairbourne never expected to be test cases for the capacity of climate change to tear a community apart, but in 26 years’ time they will witness the end of a village that has existed for more than a century. Mike Thrussell, the angling writer, takes a walk along the top of the darkening sea wall. The wind is searing, turning his skin red. He scans the line of homes below and searches for the right way to encapsulate the mood of the village. “It gives you an inner feeling of doom. It is despondency. Everything you do is futile,” he eventually says. “I cannot pass my home on to my son – it is lost. What have I worked for?” But Thrussell knows their pain will soon be felt by others on Britain’s rapidly changing coastline. “It is not just a Fairbourne problem. You’ve got all these other communities in Wales and England – where the hell are they going to go?” • If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).

Eventually the sham is going to give, and the latest letter signed by 50 NASA experts, with more than 1000 years of combined professional experience, is a sure sign the gig’s about over.
…..unproven remarks…..not substantiated…..hundreds of well-known climate scientists…..tens of thousands of other scientists publicly declaring their disbelief…..science is NOT settled…..unbecoming of NASA’s history…..advocacy of an extreme position…..damage to the exemplary reputation of NASA…..even the reputation of science itself…”
Letters to the top don’t get any more blunt than that.
And how many tens of billions have these crackpots at GISS cost the taxpayers?
Here’s the letter:
March 28, 2012
The Honorable Charles Bolden, Jr.
NASA Administrator
NASA Headquarters
Washington, D.C. 20546-0001
Dear Charlie,
We, the undersigned, respectfully request that NASA and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) refrain from including unproven remarks in public releases and websites. We believe the claims by NASA and GISS, that man-made carbon dioxide is having a catastrophic impact on global climate change are not substantiated, especially when considering thousands of years of empirical data. With hundreds of well-known climate scientists and tens of thousands of other scientists publicly declaring their disbelief in the catastrophic forecasts, coming particularly from the GISS leadership, it is clear that the science is NOT settled.
The unbridled advocacy of CO2 being the major cause of climate change is unbecoming of NASA’s history of making an objective assessment of all available scientific data prior to making decisions or public statements.

As former NASA employees, we feel that NASA’s advocacy of an extreme position, prior to a thorough study of the possible overwhelming impact of natural climate drivers is inappropriate. We request that NASA refrain from including unproven and unsupported remarks in its future releases and websites on this subject. At risk is damage to the exemplary reputation of NASA, NASA’s current or former scientists and employees, and even the reputation of science itself.
For additional information regarding the science behind our concern, we recommend that you contact Harrison Schmitt or Walter Cunningham, or others they can recommend to you.
Thank you for considering this request.
Sincerely,
(Attached signatures)

Not a peep from the German mainstream media on Scott Walker drubbing his opponent in the Wisconsin recall election yesterday.

Scott Walker rewins Wisconsin in a landslide. (Photo: Wikipedia, from 2010)
Now if this had been four years ago with the tables turned, I guarantee you the story would be plastered front page for days here in Germany. It’s no secret that the elitist MSM here are still very much in love with Barack Obama and blind to his every blunder.
Today the neo-eco-liberal German elitist media are shell-shocked, dazed, and have no idea what to make of it. It’s far worse than they thought.

And true to their tradition of if the news is inconvenient, then bury it, and if it’s really inconvenient, then ignore it altogether. This is what we are witnessing today. Under no circumstances is the German public to sense that Obama’s political Titanic has struck the dreaded iceberg. The election confirms the Tea Party is for real and is not going away; the political ground has shifted massively in USA and the Democrats are in huge trouble.
I listened to German NDR public radio this morning – not a peep about Walker’s landslide victory. Same goes for the online Die Welt, Der Spiegel, Die Zeit, FOCUS, TAZ, Bild, Süddeutsche, ARD, ZDF, and RTL.
I expect they’ll come out with something later today (It’s afternoon now), once they shrug off their stunned stupor and find a way to spin the story.
Flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), on the other hand, does have a story, half way down its site, titled: Erfolgreicher Stimmungstest für Romney (Successful test vote for Romney). The FAZ writes:
The outcome of the election was a national event, which is said to be of importance for the Presidential and Congressional elections on November 6. Scott Walker.”
And that is as far as the FAZ is going to take it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYou really have got to worry when the U.S. Secretary of Defense declares a major security threat that isn’t real. History shows that such declarations are often followed by the suspension of civil law to make way for martial law, rationing and curfews.
Casus belli refers to offenses or threats directly against a nation. It can be grounds for suspending elections and democracy until the crisis subsides and stability gets re-established.

Secretary Panetta has an imaginary enemy: developed human society.
Hat-tip: WUWT
Why is Panetta declaring Casus belli? According to Wikipedia’s definition:
Countries need a public justification for attacking another country. This justification is needed to galvanize internal support for the war, as well as gain the support of potential allies.

In the post World War Two era, the UN Charter prohibits signatory countries from engaging in war except 1) as a means of defending themselves against aggression, or 2) unless the UN as a body has given prior approval to the operation. The UN also reserves the right to ask member nations to intervene against non-signatory countries which embark on wars of aggression. In effect, this means that countries in the modern era must have a plausible casus belli for initiating military action, or risk UN sanctions or intervention.”
Human climate change is a national security threat says Secretary Panetta.
He apparently sees a climate Pearl Harbor and probably already has his generals in a war room making plans to seize control of the nation’s vast resources and direct them against the imagined enemy, which this time is domestic and is anyone who emits GHG without a permit or an offset. Martial law in this case would hardly be temporary – as the climate crisis is a long-term affair that will take decades and generations to fix, so we are told. That’s a long time to be under a state of emergency.
Yes, there’s a lot in it for the Secretary of Defense, and it is surely very tempting. Panetta is probably just itching by now to round up people deemed a threat (skeptics) and holding them in camps, like the US did with Japanese-Americans after the Pearl Harbor attack.
Panetta, the number one military man, is treading dangerous territory and anyone concerned about preserving democracy and the rule of law has got to be seriously worried by his paranoid view. It’s one thing to be concerned about climate change, but quite another to view it as casus belli. It’s time to question his psychological stability. When military leaders start fantasizing major threats and insist we mobilize to ward them off, it’s scary.
Clearly climate change is not the real threat to national security. The real threat are leaders who fantasize and have delusions of threats that aren’t real, and who react by publicly declaring a phony national emergency.
Folks, in most places it’s May, sunny, getting warm and the birds are singing and the flowers are blooming. People are outside enjoying themselves, sunbathing. Panetta, on the other hand, is obviously in a climate war room and thinks the sky is falling and the planet is imploding.
Congress needs to look into this.

"Few prospective MEPs will be in the middle of their first year undergraduate exams when hundreds of millions of people across Europe go to the polls later this week. But 19-year-old Londoner Daze Aghaji believes now is the time for her generation to make a stand. “We are at a turning point,” says Aghaji. “This generation can take leadership and make this change happen or we are facing a genuinely terrible future – so I am trying to do something, to be part of a new politics, part of the new world I want to see.”  Aghaji, who is studying history and politics at Goldsmiths University in south London, is standing as a Climate and Ecological Emergency Independent (CEEI) in Thursday’s European elections. The teenager – who has her sights set on breaking open the political system for the next generation, and maybe a new job as one of Europe’s youngest ever MEPs – is one of nine Extinction Rebellion activists who are standing as independents under the CEEI banner.  Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam The teenager is a ball of energy, conviction and warmth as she discusses her campaign over a cup of tea in a south London cafe. “Obviously it would be super cool to win a seat and I would make sure I made it count if that happens,” she says. “But to be honest the likelihood of me winning is pretty small.” When asked how she is managing to combine studying for exams and campaigning, she shrugs: “It is pretty full on. The course is amazing and this – well, this is a lot of work and stress on top of that.” After a brief pause, she adds: “But if not now, then when? What am I going to tell future generations – ‘I knew but I had other things to do, I was a bit busy?’” Born in north London, Aghaji started life in a small one-bedroom flat in Tottenham that she shared with her parents and two siblings. Aged 11, she went away to boarding school after her mum’s Afro-Caribbean restaurant took off. There, she fell in love with nature – and developed a vague but persistent concern that the natural world was struggling. “We are facing the breakdown of everything that we take for granted,” says Aghaji, who is a veteran of the school climate strikes as well as the Extinction Rebellion protests. “This is a chance to help create something really amazing. How could I let that pass by? Aghaji believes there is much more at stake in this week’s elections beyond who wins. The evidence of the scale and severity of the climate emergency is growing. Last year, the UN’s leading scientists warned that there were just 12 years to limit climate catastrophe. Earlier this month, another UN report warned that the widespread collapse of ecosystems was putting humanity itself at risk. Just last week it emerged that the Antarctic ice is melting much faster than previously feared. “I am here as a young black woman because I want to open that space, I want to show other young people from different backgrounds that we can make a stand, that we can seize this moment and make a difference. It is our future that is on the line.” A recurring critique of Extinction Rebellion and other environment movements has focused on their lack of diversity, both in terms of race and class. Aghaji, who says that since her mother’s restaurant took off she became part of a “new middle class” acknowledges there is a problem. “There is such an image here of black people not being involved in environmental stuff but if you look more globally then not only are they involved, they have been leading on this stuff for decades … We need to break that stigma of it being so white [in the UK].” She says the climate crisis is “an issue of class, of race, of age”, with “the poorest being hit the worst”. To get that message across, the CEEI has been holding workshops and events on housing estates across London – where seven out of the nine candidates are standing. “We are really trying to get out there into communities … starting conversations with people … people you wouldn’t see as ordinary environmentalists, but the reaction has been amazing, people really do care.” Over the past few months Aghaji says there has been a breakthrough in public understanding of the climate emergency, helped by the success of Extinction Rebellion, the school strike movement and the BBC’s David Attenborough documentary Climate Change – The Facts. And she says the younger generation – many even younger than her – are a growing source of hope and inspiration. “You can feel the soul, the passion running through the young people that are involved. Looking at the school strikes, I am happy that they are the next generation because they get this and they are on it … you don’t need to tell them how bad it is because they already know.” However, she acknowledges the challenges are huge. The climate crisis is not, she says, simply an environmental issue, it will have devastating consequences if unchecked, from food shortages to resource wars, the collapse of political and social systems to mass movements of people. But as she finishes her tea she insists there is still time to act. “I am a hopeless romantic,” says Aghaji with a smile. “This is a huge moment for this generation. If we get this right we can look back in 20 or 30 years and say we did a good job. We still have the chance to create something exciting out of this moment but that window is closing.”"
"The Guardian has updated its style guide to introduce terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world. Instead of “climate change” the preferred terms are “climate emergency, crisis or breakdown” and “global heating” is favoured over “global warming”, although the original terms are not banned.  “We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue,” said the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. “The phrase ‘climate change’, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.” “Increasingly, climate scientists and organisations from the UN to the Met Office are changing their terminology, and using stronger language to describe the situation we’re in,” she said. The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, talked of the “climate crisis” in September, adding: “We face a direct existential threat.” The climate scientist Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a former adviser to Angela Merkel, the EU and the pope, also uses “climate crisis”. In December, Prof Richard Betts, who leads the Met Office’s climate research, said “global heating” was a more accurate term than “global warming” to describe the changes taking place to the world’s climate. In the political world, UK MPs recently endorsed the Labour party’s declaration of a “climate emergency”. The scale of the climate and wildlife crises has been laid bare by two landmark reports from the world’s scientists. In October, they said carbon emissions must halve by 2030 to avoid even greater risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. In May, global scientists said human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating annihilation of wildlife and destruction of the ecosystems that support all life on Earth. Other terms that have been updated, including the use of “wildlife” rather than “biodiversity”, “fish populations” instead of “fish stocks” and “climate science denier” rather than “climate sceptic”. In September, the BBC accepted it gets coverage of climate change “wrong too often” and told staff: “You do not need a ‘denier’ to balance the debate.” Earlier in May, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who has inspired school strikes for climate around the globe, said: “It’s 2019. Can we all now call it what it is: climate breakdown, climate crisis, climate emergency, ecological breakdown, ecological crisis and ecological emergency?” The update to the Guardian’s style guide follows the addition of the global carbon dioxide level to the Guardian’s daily weather pages. “Levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have risen so dramatically – including a measure of that in our daily weather report is symbolic of what human activity is doing to our climate,” said Viner in April. “People need reminding that the climate crisis is no longer a future problem – we need to tackle it now, and every day matters.”"
"It’s safe to observe the 2019 election was not a good election for the climate. The basic facts speak for themselves. A government with a suboptimal policy was returned for another term, and Labor will now go through another, likely painful, round of recalibration of its climate offering. It’s unlikely Labor will stage a dramatic retreat from climate action, but there will certainly be an internal push to temper the current policy with an eye to regional sensibilities, and by regional sensibilities I mean the sensibilities of coal communities.  While Saturday night’s result isn’t what the country or the climate needs – a government, apparently without the will to tackle the problem, back in power for three years, and an opposition licking its wounds, wondering how long it can keep going to elections championing climate action, and losing – it would be a mistake to conclude the issue is now completely off the agenda. Climate change in Canberra remains a movable feast. Let’s examine the dynamics inside the government. It’s absolutely true that the pro-coal faction in Queensland will be emboldened, courtesy of Saturday’s positive election result, and will have zero interest in internal arguments in favour of strengthening the government’s existing climate policy framework. By some accounts, the north Queensland triumphalism currently extends to the resources minister, Matt Canavan, making a play to combine the energy and resources portfolios in Scott Morrison’s upcoming ministerial reshuffle, expected on Sunday. But Liberals in safe seats who suffered negative swings on Saturday night for two reasons – because of the government’s climate change policy, and because of concerns the party has pitched too far to the right – will want Morrison to use his authority to move the dial positively on climate change. We’ve heard a lot about the Queensland swing since Saturday night, but the fact is two things happened in the recent election campaign for the Coalition. The first is the government’s support for the Adani coalmine helped shore up the Liberal National party in central Queensland (even though if you look closely at the results, voters didn’t swing en masse to the incumbents, they parked a protest vote with One Nation and Clive Palmer that flowed back to the Coalition); and the second is voter concern about climate change forced the Liberal party to spend significant resources defending safe seats that could have been better directed to contests elsewhere. Morrison has to balance two political realities, not one, and some Liberals believe it would be a catastrophic mistake for the government post-election to imagine the whole of Australia possesses the resting sensibilities of coal communities in Queensland, when the campaign field evidence suggests otherwise. MPs who favour rebalancing believe Morrison has been handed a significant opportunity during this term in government to try to neutralise climate change as an electoral negative for the Coalition. The view is if Morrison can use his authority to execute the necessary pivot, that potentially sets the Coalition up for a long stint in government. Some colleagues say Morrison has the capacity to recalibrate not only because of his enhanced internal authority post-election but because he was not a frontline protagonist in the internal climate wars of the past decade. The spiritual leader of the internal opposition to climate action, Tony Abbott, is also out of the parliament, which improves the prospects of managing a shift; not immediately, but over the course of the coming term. Notwithstanding his explicit commitment on the hop during the campaign to keep Melissa Price in the environment portfolio post-election, Morrison would be smart to elevate a senior moderate to the portfolio who can carry the message – perhaps Simon Birmingham. It would also be smart to project more positivity about the transition to low emissions energy sources, the positivity the Coalition has been reluctant to project for fear of offending Alan Jones or the reactionary right rump. Some Liberals argue the government needs to reframe the transition to low emissions as an opportunity for Australia, not a cost – which was the negative territory Morrison prosecuted through much of the election in an effort to curb any momentum from the Labor campaign. Of course all of this is just talk at the present time. We are a distance short of any concrete action that would give anybody heart, and even if Morrison is inclined to see climate change as a frontline issue where the Liberal party can be seen to be pitching its tent in the political centre, or can be persuaded to that end – any movement on emissions reduction mechanisms would be heavily contested internally. When we move from the point of generalities to specifics, supporters of better policy in the government are completely candid. They don’t know what the new policy mechanism should be. It would be very hard to revive Malcolm Turnbull’s national energy guarantee, even though that would be sensible, given the implosion of 2017. It is also hard to propose more ambitious targets without all hell breaking loose internally. But it is possible, some think, to build in review structures over the coming term which point to a ratcheting up of ambition."

Share this...FacebookTwitterDear P Gosselin.
Thank you for your consideration.  I appreciate the opportunity to be heard. Due to the numbers of polar bears on land this season, I am busy with filming and away from the internet.  My reply is not as prompt as it otherwise could be.
When I read that zoos are to be considered the key to polar bears’ survival and at the same time find that there is no discussion of sanctuary, I have to seriously question the dollars, the funding and the intent behind the “zoo” message.
While polar bears that land on eastern Canadian shores are shot and killed, while the polar/grizzly hybrids are shot and killed as soon as they are discovered, while polar bears are hazed and harassed across the Alaskan coast (leading to extreme stress and mortality); in the absence of any sanctuary, alternative habitat, or effort to repopulate traditional polar bear-land habitats, I have to seriously question what kind of “conservation” is really happening.  Zoos?  If this is the present course and it remains unchecked, I have to think we all are in danger.
Just to be clear, my statement that polar bears can survive climate change but for man’s greed, does not translate to “… not threatened by climate change.”  Certainly, if not for the decline in sea ice, polar bears would have a better future.  The contraction of polar bear populations will indeed follow the loss of sea ice habitat.  The survival of a great many bears will be threatened.  This threat is a “clear and present danger” directly attributable to climate induced sea ice reduction.
Polar bear extinction, however, is not a climate issue but is electively driven by human, political, policy and government action.  If the true nature of polar bear ecology was acknowledged and pan-arctic land sanctuaries were established, polar bears would survive climate change and continue as a viable species on Earth.  As long as the current course of “drowning polar bears” and “sea ice or death” rhetoric preempts the truth, polar bears will have little to no chance for survival.
Re: Ed’s response
Nuclear Genomic Sequences Reveal that Polar Bears Are an Old and Distinct Bear Lineage , Hailer 2012 – is the most recent study of polar bear evolution. Polar bears are an older species, not of “recent origin”, and they are distinct from brown bears, not evolved from within the subset of brown bear genetics. While Hailer suggests a date range of 338,000 to 934,000 years ago for polar bear divergence, additional studies by Yu and Krause support a divergence date of 600,000 to 1.3 million years ago. The consensus resides in 600,000 to 1 million years ago.
What has confused some of the science and resulted in the “recent origin” theory, is the denial of hybrid events taking place between polar bears and brown bears.  I say “some”,  because not all scientists, as well myself, had discounted hybridization as the account for the “confusion”.  Coyne, in “Do Polar Bears Really Exist?”, stated the brown/polar bear mtDNA profile could likely be a result of hybridization and cautioned the interpretation of mtDNA as represented in Lindqvist.  The Lindqvist study of the Svalbard jaw bone fossil flat out refuted hybrid events as being relevant and incorrectly determined the answer to the mtDNA question to be resolved with polar bears to be of recent origin.  Well, five recently dead grizz/polar bear hybrids of various stages, speaks to a truth that Lindqvist would now have to consider.

The ABC brown bears of Alaska have yet to be addressed directly, but I believe they too are a population descended from the hybrid crossing of polar bears and browns as was the Irish brown bear population.  What we are seeing play out in real time, here in today’s Arctic, speaks to an insight into previous hybrid events and lends a credibility that far out weighs theory and speculation.  It is happening now, it happened in Ireland…
From Smith –  No Ice, No Choice   2012
“35,000 years ago, amidst the last great ice age, Ireland experienced a warming, an “interstadial,” that raised temperatures to within one degree of its modern day climate. Glaciers began to melt and the Irish Sea ice retreated. Polar bears came to land at 50ºN and survived a period nearly 20ºC warmer than today’s arctic. It was this warming, the Castlepook Interstadial, that forced the range of polar bears to overlap with that of Irish brown bears. Contrary to the notion that glacial periods represent a uniformly intact cryosphere, localized warming events can occur, leading to sea ice retreat, the “forced landing” of polar bears, and climate-induced species convergence.  In studying the fossil record of this period, researchers in Ireland recently confirmed that a 32,000-year old brown bear fossil was discovered to actually belong to a polar/grizzly hybrid.⁠  This hybridization challenges the idea that, during a glacial period, polar bears exist exclusive of land. The extent to which polar bears have experienced forced landings, and the extent to which this reflects upon their ability to cope with change, becomes directly related to their age as a species.”
More than one million years before the Castlepook Interstadial, the Mid Pleistocene Transition occurred, (700,000 to 1.2 million years ago).  This shift in glaciation periods from a 41,000 year to 100,000 year glacial-interglacial cycles, took place concurrent with the “polar bear emergence interval” of 600,000 to 1.2 million years ago.  CO2 records show that from +- 620,000 to 800,000 years ago, a glacial period of extreme cold and duration occurred, far exceeding any of the glacial periods that followed in the next 600,000 years.  It is the very nature of the Pleistocene cryosphere that led to the emergence of polar bears as a species.
While polar bears are here and have clearly survived, what may never be known is to what extent and frequency that “interstadials” took place within the glacial periods, similar to the Castlepook event in the British Isles.  When the cyrosphere occupied much of the northern hemisphere, arctic environments and polar bears existed in temperate latitudes, as did Ireland’s.  These bears and their environment were much more subject to localized and regional climate variation than an arctic confined to high latitudes as in today’s world (until now).  It is exactly the occurrence of these interstadials, along with interglacial periods that have repeatedly and continuously brought the polar bear to land and in contact with the brown bear.  This repeated contact and hybridization has led to the continued ability of the the two species to produce fertile offspring nearly 1 million years after divergence.  (This relationship does not preclude the polar bear from retaining its’ status as a distinct species.)
Despite the course of nature, natural selection and the process of evolution, polar/grizzly hybrids have been characterized as a threat to polar biodiversity, that species are “imperiled” by interbreeding.  Citing no studies, no facts, no “science” to support (an unnamed) science article, the significance of the hybrid genetic exchange between polar bears and browns seems to be less relegated to science than it is to personal opinion. (What would Darwin say?)  The forced landing of polar bears may lead to population “bottlenecks”, (referred to by Hailer).  But, the role polar bear/brown bear hybrids have played in the survival of polar bears as a species, and the answer to “bottlenecks” may never be known.  If the prevailing attitude is to replace science with opinion, and today’s polar/grizzly hybrids remain unprotected and shot on sight, then, maybe Zoos are the answer.
Thank you again.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy takes a look at how Germany’s experimental taxpayer-paid “energy-efficient home” is doing.  The home is a project by the German Federal Ministry for Transportation, Construction and Urban Development (BMVBS). As you can see, it leaves little to be desired aesthetically.

The ugly-duckling energy self-sustainable home that isn’t. Erected in Berlin. Price tag: € 2.2 million
The home was opened by Chancellor Angela Merkel late last year amid much media pomp and ceremony and is intended to serve as a model for clean, environmentally responsible living. Strangely, Merkel has recently cut back solar subsidies specifically designed to achieve the aims of the house.
==========================================
The energy efficiency home – the latest act of foolery
by Michael Clemens for EIKE
In the story of the fools of Schilda, the citizen fools built a city hall but forgot the windows. So they put sunlight inside bags and carried it inside. Now a new episode of the fools of Schilda has been written in Berlin. Today’s fools are in a state of panic over the world’s energy reserves and dangerous atomic radiation. And so they’ve built a house that produces more energy than it can use and is supposed to fulfill the dream of “100% supplied by renewable energy”.
When it comes to transforming its energy supply, no cost is too high for the German government. As a flagship project, the shimmering blue “Efficiency Plus with Electromobility” was ceremoniously opened on 7 December 2011 by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and a Federal Minsiter, and has been recently occupied by a test family.
Federal Minister Peter Ramsauer said, “We want to show people that a completely renewable energy supply is already possible today and is an every-day thing. Our motto: ‘My home is my petrol station.’ The house should not and will not stay a prototype: What we are presenting here is the home of the future.“
In a brochure issued by the Federal Ministry for Transportation, Construction and Urban Development (BMVBS), we find the following technical information, data and claims:
The surplus energy the house produces is stored in a house battery and in an electric car, which acts both as a storage and user of energy. Both home and mobility are thus independent of the power grid.
The house is ecologically sustainable, fully recyclable and highly energy-efficient. No fossil fuels based energies are needed and no CO2 emissions are caused.”

The monthly energy need is given by the following chart:

But a check of the data yields a different picture
Misrepresented in the chart of energy demand given by the BMVBS is the monthly power generation of the photovoltaic system. In the wintertime when you have the highest demand for electricity and power, only 10% of the energy needed is generated. Using the monthly averages for PV generation in the region of Berlin in 2011, the following monthly energy budget results:

Thus the house is not energy independent and self-sufficient. By taking a close look at the daily amounts one sees that in the winter months the photovoltaic system delivers no energy. The planned batereries with a capacity of 40 kWh barely suffices to cover the night in the summertime. The necessary capacity for the wintertime would have to be more than 100 times greater, i.e. 4500 kWh (approx. 30% of the annual need). For this no technology is in sight.
The heat pump and electromobility increase the winter peak demand for electricity by a factor of 4 with respect to purely conventional power need. The niche technology of photovoltaics cannot replace a single kilowatt of power plant output.
The price tag for the”energy efficiency home” is pegged at 2.2 million EUR.
With this BMVBS project, the day-in and day-out supply of energy and independence from the power grid is an illusion. A layman cannot recognize that it merely exists in a worthless annual energy balance and that there often shortfalls at various times of the year.
Indeed the house proves the opposite: it is not energy independent. Despite the massive deployment of resources and technology, the laws of physics could not be ignored and the supply of renewable energy suffices only for a shed in the summertime.
The energy efficiency house is a symbol of a failed energy policy. It represents misguidance and deception of the citizens by ideologues, lobbyists, media and politicians, as well as a huge waste of resources.

"Saving bees and other insects is indeed a vital goal for the world (Journal, 18 May). Farming practices do need to change and there are many innovative farmers in the UK who are working hard to improve biodiversity as they provide food for the nation. We need to ensure that new policies encourage good practice and support farmers. Regenerative farming using diverse crop rotations, no-till planting, use of indigenous seeds and management of livestock grazing to reproduce natural landscape management can reduce or eliminate the need for pesticides and artificial fertilisers while restoring healthy soil. But the transition can take years before the farmers reap the benefits.  We must fight not only for funding set-aside land for wildlife, but for research into natural management of pests like flea beetle and black grass, valorising agricultural waste more effectively, financing training and infrastructure for farmers, and rewarding innovation. This also means the willingness for consumers to buy more local and seasonal food, eat less but higher-welfare meat, waste less and pay premium prices for higher-quality food rather than cheap imports. If we value farmers as custodians of our land, they will respond by making it a better place for all of us, insect and human.Dr Jean McKendreeStockholm Environment Institute,University of York • Congratulations on your article on how the Guardian is changing the way it talks about climate (Report, 18 May). It is wise to use “climate emergency” and “global heating” instead of the usual weak wording. I prefer “global overheating”, which is even more explicit and easily understood.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen scientists drift away from research and involve themselves with religious groups in order to focus on the mission of reshaping society, then you’ve got to wonder. Was that the original idea of our tax money?
Today, scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) are claiming that the Green Economy has the potential of destroying the progress that has been made over the last 10 years, so writes alarmist site Klimaretter here. You read that right.
This does not mean the PIK has changed its mind. To the contrary, it simply views the current path to Green as being totally inadequate and that a much more radical one has to embarked on.
PIK chief economics scientist Ottmar Edenhofer has warned of failure for the upcoming Rio+20 conference, which is taking place in 2 weeks:
“We’ve got to start opposing the Green Economy.The Green Economy paradigm has the potential to destroy the progress of the last ten years. We’ve got to destroy the illusion that a few actions in energy efficiency and renewable energies at national levels will be enough to reduce the emissions to the necessary extent. We’ve got to oppose the ‘big proclamation’ of the Green Economy. What we need is a ‘big proclamation’ of Justice.”
For Edenhofer, the issue is not about climate change at all – it’s about social justice and redistribution. Edenhofer now demands:
The atmosphere must not be viewed as a free territory, but as a global common whose ownership and usage rights have to be negotiated. Distribution conflicts here are inevitable, and thus strong international agreements are needed.”
According to UNEP, global economic growth in the future must not be powered by fossil fuels fossil in order to stabilize the climate, protect the environment and to maintain species diversity.
But as Klimaretter writes, the opposite is now actually happening:
Indeed today we are experiencing a Renaissance in the use of fossil energies instead: The rising price of oil and gas has not only led to a Renaissance in coal, but is also making the tapping of unconventional oil and gas reserves lucrative. The international Energy Agency (IEA) is already celebrating the ‘Golden Age of gas supply’.”

So much for the shortage of energy we are always told about. The problem today is actually an oversupply of energy. Edenhofer criticizes:
Over the past years we have limited ourselves too much to the topics of energy efficiency and renewable energies. Here we have under-estimated the supply side of fossil energies.”
That energy surplus problem has to be dealt with. So Klimaretter chimes in:
With respect to the amounts of coal, oil and gas into consideration that are still in the ground, an effective restriction of their extraction is needed.”
For Edenhofer the whole climate issue gets down to one objective: justice. And to move to that target, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, an organisation that claims to be scientific, has taken an unusual step: working together with environmental NGOs and religious groups. Klimaretter reports that (my emphasis added):
…the PIK together with development aid organisation Misereor are asking that sustainability focus more on the questions of justice. Energy efficiency and renewable energies here are not enough. One thing is clear: If we are to take climate protection seriously, then the fossil fuel industry must lose.
To get the debate rolling, Edenhofer and his colleagues of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research have entered an unusual alliance. Over three years the scientists have been grappling with the relationship between climate change and development policy. To do this they brought NGO representatives on board – and also a partner of the Jesuit-founded Institute for Society Munich, Catholic development aid organisation Misereor and Munich Re reinsurer. The result of the cooperation: a book called “Climate Change, Justice, and Sustainability”. The book’s main message: The debate surrounding climate change must be carried out as a debate over global justice.”
The PIK charter has become religious. Edenhofer himself was  a member of the Jesuit Order from 1987 to 1994.
Obviously the PIK is not quite an organization of scientists, rather it is becoming one of religious zealots. What’s tomorrow? An alliance with jihad groups?
I don’t have anything against religious groups and faiths. But we do need to really worry when dogmatists start running institutes of science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenpeace says the “pollution” from the North Sea gas platform Elgin impacts our global climate the most. Hat-tip warmist site: CO2 Handel.
The gas platform, operated by French petroleum company Total, sprang a gas leak days ago and its crew had to be evacuated. According to Greenpeace chemist and activist Manfred Santen on Monday:
The greatest environmental impact is expected to be to the climate.”
That’s a green way of saying that there will be no significant pollution to water. Clearly he wants the public to believe that this small scale leak, which does not even come close to a volcano in magnitude, is going to have an impact on our climate. This is just plain silliness.
Santen is on board a Greenpeace vessel and is taking air samples near the defective platform.
The platform has been in the news in Europe, and activists are doing all they can to spin the gas leak into a sort of Deepwater Horizon scale catastrophe. This is a sign of desperation.

As no water is being polluted, all they are left to say is that it will impact the climate. Imagine that folks, one platform leak will impact the climate. This tells you something about the state of the climate movement today. Grabbing at any straws they can.
The warmist CO2 Handel here writes:
Gas has been flowing out above the water surface and into the air for one week. The gas contains climate-damaging methane as well as poisonous sulfur dioxide.”
According to the German news service DPA, Santen will measure the air near the platform using gas chromatography.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe mid-Atlantic of the USA has no power.
And so one really has to wonder about the sheer brilliance of Energy Secretary Chu’s latest idea – more electric cars for a country that can no longer provide its citizens with a steady supply of electricity.
I have a question for Secretary Chu: Even if electric cars were free, what purpose would they serve when your energy system cannot produce electricity for days and days? If people and emergency services had your electric cars, they would all be stranded by now with no means of getting around.
Secretary Chu, rather than calling for more electric cars, which very few people want, you need to focus on, well, energy. After all, you are the Energy Secretary, and not the Secretary of Golf Carts.
How about focusing on revamping the utterly dilapidated electricity grid, which has been allowed to go to hell over the years? The energy generation and distribution system has been so neglected that it can no longer withstand a summer storm or heat wave. What a joke.
It’s time for you to start focusing seriously on making the supply of electricity affordable and reliable. Why do you refuse to do that? As it now stands, Washington DC and surrounding area are looking like a banana republic.
It’s time to seriously invest in more coal, nuclear and gas power generation technology. These supplies are cheap and RELIABLE.
And only then can you start to think about electric cars.

The eco pow-wow includes Daimler, Deutsche Bank, Lufthansa and 197 other ecological companies who have pitched tents at the Schlossgarten to show how to rescue the planet.
According to the German Press Agency (dpa), President Gauck warned against forcing an energy supply transition through central planning measures:
‘We are not going to succeed with central planning regulations, and absolutely not with excessive subsidies,’ said Gauck .”
Moreover Gauck gave two thumbs up to free markets and competition, adding:
There’s no better way to solve problems than having a society with open markets and free competition.”
Miersch also adds Gauck delivered one of the most sensible speeches he has heard from a politician so far:

No apocalyptic scenarios, no tacky ecology prose, but a few sentences that got stuck in the throats of the audience. There was also a call to approach questions regarding the environment and climate reasonably and factually.”
Gauck also made another statement that surely irritated some in the audience:
Sustainability does not mean restriction or going without. Rather it means reason and responsibility.“
Gauck, who spent a large part of his life under the boot of Soviet/East German tyranny, ended with a call for “sustainable progress“. Surely he knows something about what that means, having seen little of that in the communist days.
Overall, a detectable shift in tone is taking place; alarmism is being ratcheted back. Gauck did not not cite a consensus of scientists. This year his speech mentioned only “leading scientists warn of a consequential global climate warming that can hardly be stopped.“
This is indeed a toning down compared to last year’s speech by then-President Christian Wulff who claimed that “THE climate scientists“ and even “THE climate research“ left “no doubt“ of an imminent huge warming.
Miersch writes:
Now its only ‘leading climate scientists’ who are ‘warning”. A diplomatic retreat from an all-party dogma.”
Let’s hope.

"A hurricane is a large rotating storm that forms over tropical or subtropical waters in the Atlantic. These low pressure weather systems draw upon warm water and atmospheric moisture to fuel their strength and will gather pace if not slowed by patches of dry air, crosswinds or landfall. “They are very tall towers of winds that move at the same speed, sometimes 60,000ft tall,” says Jim Kossin, a scientist at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “If they are unmolested by wind shear or run over land they will continue on their merry way.” Storms are given names once they have sustained winds of more than 39mph. Hurricanes are gauged by something called the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, which runs from one to five and measures speed. Once a storm gets to category three it is classed as a major hurricane, with winds of at least 111mph and enough force to damage homes and snap trees. Category five storms, of at least 157mph, can raze dwellings, cause widespread power outages and result in scores of deaths. This strongest class of hurricanes includes Hurricane Katrina, which caused the inundation of New Orleans in 2005, and Hurricane Maria, which flattened much of Puerto Rico in 2017. Both hurricanes and typhoons are tropical cyclones – the only difference is the location where they occur. In the Atlantic, the term “hurricane” is used, while “typhoon” is used in the Pacific. In the South Pacific and Indian Ocean, the term “tropical cyclone” is often deployed. Almost all hurricanes develop once the northern hemisphere approaches summer, with the hurricane season running from 1 June to 30 November. The season peaks between August and October. This is because wind shear, which can disrupt hurricanes, dies down during summer, while the temperature of the oceans rise and the amount of moisture in the atmosphere increases. These conditions are ideal for spawning hurricanes. The season isn’t strictly defined, however. “It can start earlier,” says Jennifer Collins, a hurricane expert at the University of South Florida. “Recall 2016, when Hurricane Alex (a storm that rattled Bermuda) formed in January.” It’s been a punishing past few years for people living in the path of hurricanes in the US and Caribbean. Last year there were an above-average 15 named storms, including Hurricane Florence, which brewed off the west African coast before barrelling into North Carolina, plunging much of the state into darkness and dumping up to 76cm (30 inches) of rain in places, resulting in flooding that killed dozens of people. This was followed by Hurricane Michael, the first storm to make landfall in the US as a category five event since 1992. The 160mph storm obliterated the town of Mexico Beach in Florida, caused more than 70 deaths and racked up an estimated $25bn (£19bn) in damage. These disasters came in the wake of the 2017 hurricane season, which caused a record $282bn in damage. Hurricane Harvey unloaded 33tn gallons of water on Texas, the astonishingly strong Hurricane Irma, which reached a top speed of 177mph, ravaged Florida and several thousand people died in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, another category five storm, tore across the island. The misery in Puerto Rico, in particular, is ongoing, with the US government strongly criticised by local elected officials for a sluggish and insufficient response to the catastrophe. While the overall number of hurricanes has remained roughly the same in recent decades, there is evidence they are intensifying more quickly, resulting in a greater number of the most severe category four and five storms. The proportion of tropical storms that rapidly strengthen into powerful hurricanes has tripled over the past 30 years, according to recent research. A swift increase in pace over a 24-hour period makes hurricanes less predictable, despite improving hurricane forecasting systems, and more likely to cause widespread damage. The devastation unleashed by recent hurricanes has led to warnings that premiums may rise as insurers face ballooning claims. A record $135bn was paid out by insurers in North America in 2017, mostly as a result of hurricane damages. “We have a new normal,” says Ernst Rauch, a senior executive at insurance company Munich Re. “We must have on our radar the trend of new magnitudes.” A range of factors influence the number of hurricanes smashing into land, from localised weather to periodic climatic events such as El Niño. Prior to 2017, the US had experienced a hurricane “drought” that had stretched back to Hurricane Wilma in 2005. But there is growing evidence that the warming of the atmosphere and upper ocean, due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels, is making conditions ripe for fiercer, more destructive hurricanes. “The past few years have been highly unusual, such as Irma staying strong for so long, or the hurricane in Mozambique that dumped so much rain,” says Kossin. “All of these things are linked to a warming atmosphere. If you warm things up, over time you will get stronger storms.” Climate breakdown is tinkering with hurricanes in a variety of ways. More moisture in the air means more rain, while storms are intensifying more quickly but often stalling once they hit land, resulting in torrential downpours that cause horrendous flooding. Rising sea levels are aiding storm surge whipped up by hurricanes – one study found that Hurricane Sandy in 2012 probably wouldn’t have inundated lower Manhattan if it occurred a century previously because the sea was a foot lower then. According to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the maximum intensity of hurricanes will increase by about 5% this century. The expanding band of warmth around the planet’s tropical midriff also means a larger area for hurricanes to develop, resulting in fierce storms further north than before, such as Florence. In the Pacific, this change means typhoons’ focal point is switching from the Philippines towards Japan. Researchers are currently attempting to ascertain if climatic changes will help bend the path of hurricanes enough that more will charge in the direction of the UK in the future. “This has implications for places that have historically been unaffected by tropical cyclones,” says Collins, who added these newly hit areas are likely to suffer a significantly higher risk of structural damage than traditional hurricane zones. “We are already seeing effects of climate change,” says Collins. “While there is not consensus on the frequency of hurricanes in a warmer world, there is a consensus that the hurricanes are becoming more intense, and hence their impact will be worse.” The forecasting of hurricanes has become a fine art, with scientists able to predict with sharp accuracy the anticipated path and ferocity of hurricanes. In the US, affected states have refined systems for warnings and evacuations and have a hefty federal agency, Fema, to plough billions of dollars into patching up shattered towns and lives. But planning is often haphazard, with flooded houses repeatedly rebuilt in the same locations despite the morphing risks posed by the climate crisis. The concreting of Houston’s green spaces removed key sponges for Harvey’s water, which sloshed into people’s homes. Meanwhile, natural buffers to hurricanes, such as mangroves and coral reefs, are being stripped away around the world as a result of coastal development, pollution and warming waters. There are more people in harm’s way, too – in the south-eastern US, for example, coastal populations grew by more than 50% from 1980 to 2003. Climate change adaptation rules have been scrapped by Donald Trump’s administration, making it easier to build critical infrastructure in risky coastal areas. “Coastal towns and cities are not currently prepared for the changes already occurring and will continue to occur,” says Collins. “We know that there are areas that are prone to flooding. We need to not rebuild on these areas, and build on higher ground. “Those who deny scientific findings in favour of magical thinking and other such fallacies will only leave the world a more unstable and dangerous place for future generations to come.” The situation is even starker for poorer Caribbean nations that will increasingly rely upon international help to deal with stronger hurricanes and rising sea levels. Hurricane Maria devastated the island of Dominica, leaving just 5% of the country’s buildings intact. Its prime minister, Roosevelt Skerrit, who lost his own roof in the storm, subsequently told the UN that he had come “straight from the frontline of the war on climate change”. “We as a country and as a region did not start this war against nature,” a visibly shaken Skerrit says. “We did not provoke it. The war has come to us.” Researchers have been poring over ocean temperatures and other data to ascertain what’s in store for the 2019 hurricane season, which starts on 1 June. US officials will unveil their best guess on Thursday in Washington. Meteorologists at Colorado State University have predicted there will be a slightly below-average Atlantic season of 13 named storms, five of which will become hurricanes. This prediction rests on the presence of a mild El Nino – a natural climatic event that periodically warms the Pacific Ocean, a process that tends to suppress the development of Atlantic hurricanes. There is still plenty of uncertainty in these early predictions. “Early forecasts can be a but sketchy,” says Kossin. “In general, it looks like it will be around average. But we will have to see.” Ninth Ward Jewell Parker RhodesEye of the Storm: a Book about Hurricanes Rick ThomasThirty-Eight: the Hurricane That Transformed New England Stephen LongTyphoon Joseph Conrad"
"All the raspy-voice myna birds have come here, to this old swamp, where the ghost swans now dance the yellow dust song cycles of drought. Around and around the dry swamp they go with their webbed feet stomping up the earth in a cloud of dust, and all the bits and pieces of the past unravelled from parched soil. The Swan Book, by Alexis Wright. A dense haze of smoke crawled over Melbourne and embraced us for a day in its lonely pilgrimage, inviting us to contemplate its mourning rite, its long prayer.  This smoke came from a cremation of the natural world - the bushfires from the Bunyip state forest that had begun during days of a major heatwave running across the country. The forest lies 65km east of Melbourne where mountain ash grow, prickly tea-trees, stringy barks and heathland swamps. In the Woiworung mythology of the Kulin nation, the Bunyip is a spirit that punishes bad people who disturb its home in the swamps of the Bunyip River, and according to the Parks Victoria information sheet on the park, local Aboriginal people avoided the area. Lightning strikes created the fires by igniting a tinder-dry forest that flared up into “insane” flames from out of control bushfires. The sky around the Bunyip bushfires quickly filled with ash-loaded clouds reaching up to 6km in height where it produced its own erratic weather system. This was another massive pyroconvection producing bushfire – a super cell thunderstorm that was perhaps similar to the cumulonimbus flammagenitus clouds associated with the 2003 Canberra bushfire, and the 2009 Victoria’s Black Saturday bushfires which created pyrocumulonimbus storms reaching heights of 15km and generated hundreds of lightning strokes. This is the new language of climate change. Words most of us have never heard before but we are now learning to understand from experiencing the extreme weather events affecting us more frequently. There were 2,000 firefighters risking their lives in fighting this “catastrophe” that had so far burnt 100,000 hectares of land. Homes were destroyed. The intensity of these forest fires was so great that many native animals perished, the beautiful birdlife including the lyrebird, and all the small animals – nothing caught in the way of the fires would have escaped. Most of these creatures were possibly still growing their populations after the 2009 bushfires where 40% of the Bunyip park was burnt. Nobody seemed to know when the fires would stop burning, and it was said it might continue burning for months. The Climate Council, Australia’s leading climate change communications organisation, called the 2018-19 continental-wide heatwaves and record-breaking hot days, as well as other destructive extreme weather events such as bushfires throughout Australia and heavy rainfall and flooding in northern Queensland, the Angry Summer, and the forecast is that we can expect this worsening extreme weather to continue. We have come to expect extreme weather events of the type that were previously considered as being a one in a hundred year event. We no longer think, Oh! that won’t happen again in a hurry, so there is nothing to worry about. There is not one among us in this country who is not feeling the heat of hotter and more extended summers. We smell the smoke of major environmental catastrophes and ask how safe we really feel in hotter summers, and we will become more anxious, as each extreme weather event comes by. *** When a slow-moving tropical low converged with a monsoon over the coast of north Queensland in February 2019, it dumped more than one metre of rain on Townsville within a week. So intense was the rain, it created horrendous flooding in this regional city, and it brought back memories of the 2011 flash flooding and lives lost in Toowoomba, Grantham and towns in the Queensland’s Lockyer Valley. In Townsville, it was said that some rainfall readings “were at levels probably recorded once every 2,000 years” and the rain created flood levels in the Ross River “that were greater than a one-in-500-years event”. Who knows if what happened will be a one-in-a-100-year flood, or 50 years, or less? How do we plan for the future? Many residents of Townsville thought that they lived in a flood-free area and were not insured for flooding. After this slow-moving extreme weather cell caused massive flooding in Townsville, it then moved further inland, almost travelling to the Northern Territory border before it petered out, as did Cyclone Yasi in 2011, which reached into the NT. There was so much rain dumped in this 12-day weather event in February 2019 that it created a vast inland sea stretching hundreds of kilometres over flat drought-stricken country stretching east of Cloncurry in north-west Queensland, and as far up north as Normanton in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The flooding was massive. Of approximately 5m head of cattle grazed in the region, nearly half a million head of cattle perished. The local people say it was the biggest flood ever seen in the Cloncurry River, that nobody remembers it flooding like this, where creeks became a 2km-wide torrent. Many of the pastoralists who run cattle on this land have spent their whole lives taking the risks of gambling with climate. They love the land, and show great bravery for taking these things on, and the back-breaking hard work they do. They risk everything by gambling on the climate in virtually a life or death situation, and suffer enormous consequences of loss and hardship when the weather turns, as it did this time. They see the consequences of climate change first-hand, and are the victims of it, and there is a shift of understanding going on – that manmade climate change and global warming is real, and that their lives on the land will only get harder if nothing is done about it. This was truly an unbelievable phenomenon that had horrific consequences. It looked like hell on earth. Among the media reports of the devastation, I saw a video clip of Brahman cattle standing in a sea of flooding waters almost up to their necks. Their eyes stared out to the world in horror, and I doubted that they would be saved. One life-long cattleman who lost over 80% of his cattle vividly described what happened in his heart-breaking words that, “There wasn’t much life stuff, you’d just see dead stuff lying everywhere. All the kangaroos, and bloody little marsupial mice and birds they couldn’t handle it.” There was nowhere to hide, so they were wiped out. This great north country was silenced by the flooding. I grew up in this country, and I learned to swim with all the other kids in this river when it flooded, at a time when Cloncurry held the record as the hottest place in Australia. We learned to wait for this fast-flowing brown water to flood the river a second time before swimming in it – after all the dead cattle and tree trunks and branches, etc had been carried away with the first flush. If you were a child who was afraid of drowning, or being carried downstream, you were considered by the other kids as not strong enough to run with them. You learned by swimming out into the deeper, fast-moving waters until you caught hold of the slippery second or third pylon of the bridge, and I do remember fearing that I would never reach it, of being unable to see where it was, and of being sucked under the water. Before my father died in the 1950s, he owned a cattle property that was around Mackinley, east of Cloncurry, and I know he struggled on this drought stricken property he loved until he died when I was a small child. I will never know, but it is quite possible that his cattle station was under water in this flood, part of the inland sea. Perhaps this land is now starting to bound with new life – all the grasses and pretty flowers bringing butterflies and birds on the breeze, something that he would never have seen in the droughts of the 1950s. I never saw his property. It is only a place of my imagining and did not give a lot of meaning to our childhood, but now, strangely, an imagining of its life under water, is similar to many of my dreams of marvellous watery wonderlands. I imagine the land green as far as the eye can see, and the flood water pouring into the Lake Eyre basin in another inland sea for the pelicans and other birds that will flock to the area. There are thousands of ghost butterflies with pastel coloured iridescent wings that each span the size of a human hand now swarming in my dreams. They are being flown through a dry wind circling around decimated drought stricken fruit trees languishing in red earth dust. Was this an extinction flight? The last doomed emergence of an ancient butterfly from wetter times in this country thousands of years ago, before the climate changed? *** How do you find the words to tell the story of the environmental emergency of our times? No one in this country escapes the realities of this manmade global warming catastrophe that is creating before our eyes unprecedented heatwaves, out-of-control fires, immense slow-moving rain systems, freakish cyclones, floods creating inland seas, warming seas, coral bleaching, and the fast pace of losing necessary ecosystems through the demise of native flora and fauna that cannot keep up with the changing environmental conditions. All in one year? But it is not only Australia. This environmental catastrophe is global. The UN’s intergovernmental science-policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services has just released a frightening 1,500-page official report on the state of biodiversity on Earth. The report, the UN’s first global assessment of the natural world in 15 years, was written by 145 authors from 50 countries and it sums up 15,000 scientific papers on the threats against life in the age of humans. It is a chilling report warning us that as many as one million of Earth’s 8m species of all kind – mammals, birds, amphibians, insects, plants, marine life and terrestrial life – are at risk of extinction within decades, and will be disappearing at a rate tens or hundreds of times faster than in the past. The report lists five major threats to biodiversity, including conversion of forests and grasslands into farms and plantations where half a million species on land now have “insufficient habitat for long-term survival”. A third of the world’s fish stocks overfished, and the dumping of extreme amounts of waste into the world’s oceans and rivers and killing many parts of these water systems. Add this to the damage caused by climate change, pollution and the spread of invasive species. The risk of an “annihilation” of one eighth of the world’s biodiversity is due to human activity that risks putting the planet on the “tipping point” of no return. All the governments of the world need to act now and act urgently to turn this planetary nightmare around before it is too late, because this warning of the magnitude and acceleration of biodiversity loss is a global crisis with dangerous implications not only for one million species but for human health and long-term survival. *** In this country there are sacred places holding enormous powers throughout this continent and reaching far out in the seas. But most non-Aboriginal people do not understand the powerful nature of this country and the forces of nature, or how the ancient law stories associated with each of these sacred places contain vital knowledge about the deep history of this land and caring for it. The Aboriginal caretakers of their traditional country have always understood its power, and why it is so important to care for the land through developing an important system of laws that created great responsibility for caring for the stories and powers of the ancestors. These narratives of great and old wisdom are the true constitution for this country, and urgently need to be upfront in the national narrative in understanding how to care for it. After the manmade catastrophe of a million dead fish in the Darling River – which was all about horse-trading at the expense of the environment – the elders came from different parts of the river system to the Walgalu high country, the birth place of Australia’s major rivers high in the Kosciuszko National Park in New South Wales. There, they performed a water ceremony, a Narjong, “to invoke the sacred duty of caring for the river systems, a tribal responsibility for thousands of years”. Perhaps this ceremony has existed for more than 120,000 years since there is new scientific evidence in southern Victoria suggesting that we have existed in our country for as long as we have always known, since time immemorial. The elders called the rivers – their relative, their relation – by their traditional names. Dear broken rivers that may respond to their caretakers calling them, and speaking to them gently. Just as we see our people work hard to take great care of country on our traditional lands, and much good work being done by people in this country, there are people across the world who are taking great ethical steps to care for their relatives - the rivers and mountains, the animals, birds and the natural world. In China, crops will be grown in the south-western province of Yunnan in a habitat area of Menghai county to feed the elephants, so that these animals might stop raiding the crops of local farmers. In Thailand and Cambodia, the monks find the oldest and largest trees in the forest to ordain and wrap in the traditional orange robes of a monk to save the trees from loggers who will not commit the taboo of harming a monk, even if that monk is a tree. India’s courts in 2017 ruled “that the Ganges and Yamuna rivers have rights to exist, thrive, and evolve”. In New Zealand, the government granted the same legal rights as a living person in 2017 to the sacred Mount Taranaki, as it also did in 2018 for the sacred Whanganui River, and as well, in the 2014 granting of legal personhood to the Te Urewera forest, and giving the local Māori tribes shared guardianship with the government. In America, the people of Toledo recently granted the same rights as a person to Lake Erie, to recognize the rights of the lake and its watershed to have the right to a healthy environment. All of these ideas begun with Ecuador’s 2008 constitutional acknowledgment of the Rights of Nature to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles. And we – the people – have the legal authority to enforce these rights on behalf of ecosystems. These are all special acts to protect holy places and creatures. This is the only planet we know that supports life. We would do well to see the world as a sacred site that is holy, speak to our planet with kindness, and protect it as such."
"One spring morning in 2014, before breakfast or even coffee, John All, 49, a Mount Everest climber and then a professor at Western Kentucky University, was walking near his tent on a remote Himalayan peak in Nepal called Himlung when he broke through a thin layer of snow and clattered 70ft down a crevasse. He would have kept falling, almost certainly to his death, were it not for a small ice shelf spanning the fissure, upon which he miraculously, if painfully, landed. Stunned and injured – it turned out he’d broken 15 bones, dislocated his shoulder, and was bleeding internally – All gathered himself in the icy crypt and then, like any good scientist, began to document the ordeal. He thought of his teammates on the mountain, his students back at school, his mother at home in Georgia. They would want to know what had happened to him should he not make it, which seemed likely. The trip had been fraught since the beginning. The five-member team’s initial expedition to Everest had come to an abrupt end when a massive avalanche struck the Khumbu icefall and base camp, killing 16 Sherpas, including one from All’s team. After much deliberation, they re-routed to Himlung, about 160 miles west of Everest. But his teammates were struggling with altitude and fatigue and had descended lower, leaving All by himself at Camp II, on a small snowfield at nearly 20,000ft. Now here he was in the crevasse, peering at a pinhole of sunlight far above. Using his one functioning arm, All fished his Sony Cyber-shot HX7 camera from his jacket pocket and aimed it at himself. “Well,” he said, his face speckled with blood, “I’m pretty well fucked.” All’s teammates had descended to base camp, at least a day away. He would freeze to death before anyone could reach him, even if he had some way to contact them. (All had brought a satellite phone to the camp, but it was in his tent.) Despite his injuries, and the vertical walls of blue ice surrounding him, he would have to try to extract himself. For the next four hours, All wormed and squirmed his way toward the surface, wedging himself between the walls, chimneying diagonally toward the surface. He hacked one ice ax ahead, then stabbed his cramponed feet upward, moving inches at a time. The pain was searing, causing him to stop often, hyperventilating, trying not to pass out. During breaks he would film himself, noting his progress. Improbably, he reached the top and punched through the snow, flopping into the horizontal world, the late-afternoon sky brilliant and blue in the thin air. It took him another two hours to crawl to his tent, where he managed to send a text message from his satellite phone, programmed to post automatically to the American Climber Science Program’s Facebook page: “Please call Global Rescue. John broken arm, ribs, internal bleeding. Fell 70 ft crevasse. Climbed out. Himlung Camp 2,” he typed. “Please hurry.” Group members promptly called to launch a rescue. By the next day, he was at Norvic international hospital in Kathmandu, having been plucked from the mountain by helicopter, itself a dicey operation at such extreme altitude. While recovering in the hospital, All uploaded an edited version of his crevasse videos to YouTube, where they quickly went viral. The survival story drew comparisons to Aron Ralston’s in 127 Hours and the Everest classic Into Thin Air. All would go on to write his own book, Icefall: Adventures at the Wild Edges of our Dangerous, Changing Planet. This April, All returned to the Himalayas for the first time since his accident, bound for Everest. His life has changed considerably since his last visit, but his mission is much the same as it was in 2014: leading a team of scientists into the mountain range, two of whom will ascend Everest, while three others, including All, will attempt Everest’s 27,940ft next-door neighbor, Lhotse. The team will gather bits of snow and ice along the way, each sample another data point in the growing story of climate change. The data is intended to shed an increasingly bright light on a complex science – particularly the impact of pollution and dust in high-alpine terrain, what it says about global warming, and how that is affecting water resources stored in big mountains as glacial ice. Black carbon, a sooty residue from coal-fired power plants and other fossil-fuel-burning sources, gathers easily on snowy slopes, accelerating warming and melting. “The Himalayas are the water supply to a billion people,” All told me recently. “What happens to these glaciers over the next couple of decades is going to have a huge impact.” Before people climbed for (type-two) fun, they climbed for science. The first ascent of 15,777ft Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in the Alps, was pulled off in 1786 by two Frenchmen, Jacques Balmat and Michel-Gabriel Paccard, largely because the pre-eminent Swiss geologist Horace Bénédict de Saussure, who was also a climber, had offered up prize money to the first people to reach the summit. Saussure was obsessed with mountains as a focus of his research; he believed they held the key to understanding the Earth. These initial summits – Saussure himself was the third person to ascend Mont Blanc, the following year – are widely considered to be the dawn of modern mountaineering. Few carry Saussure’s torch these days like John All. He, too, became fascinated with mountains and the stories they could tell about the natural world. Raised in Georgia, he made a false career start as an environmental lawyer before pivoting to science in the mid-90s. He moved to Tucson, Arizona, to pursue a PhD in renewable natural resources at the University of Arizona, where he hiked, climbed, and volunteered with search and rescue teams. His jones for mountaineering continued to expand, and in 2010, while spending a year in Nepal as a Fulbright scholar, he summited Everest via the North Col, in Tibet. As All’s life as a scientist grew and intensified, so did his adventures. He was held at gunpoint by marijuana farmers in Mexico and nearly mauled by a hyena on the African veldt. He traveled to South America and pulled off perilous ascents in Peru’s Cordillera Blanca, conducting climate research all along. At six foot five, with long blond hair, blue eyes, and a charming hint of southern drawl, his exploits weren’t devoid of romance; as Icefall mentions, various girlfriends joined him in the field. During one early trip, his partner at the time proposed to him after their car got stuck, stranding them in the desert. He said yes. (They had a son, Nathaniel, now 14, but the marriage didn’t last.) If you’re thinking that All sounds like the Indiana Jones of climate science, you wouldn’t be far off – though the reality is less glamorous than the Hollywood version. All’s journey back to Nepal’s high peaks has been long and arduous. Despite the modest celebrity he attained in the months after his accident, away from the cameras and reporters, he gulped painkillers to help his body remember how to move again; the narcotics erased entire swaths of memory, and he couldn’t work or do much of anything. In the fog of his debilitation, a serious recent girlfriend left him for someone else. “I was supposed to be this active, lively, adventure guy,” All said, “and I was just this broken-down dude on the couch.” All eventually got back on his feet, but after the difficult year-long recovery, he needed a reboot. In 2016, he left his teaching job in Kentucky for a full professor position at Western Washington University. At his new gig in Bellingham, All founded the Mountain Environments Research Institute. The organization would help formalize and institutionalize scientific expeditions to study climate change at high altitude. The team in Nepal includes two geology students from Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, who will return to school when the team heads up to Everest. The Everest climbing squad includes Morgan Scott, a grad student at WWU, and James Holmes, from New York, treasurer for the American Climber Science Program, a Colorado-based not-for-profit organization that helps support science-based climbing trips. (All is its co-founder and executive director.) Joining All on Lhotse – the climbs share the same route until about 25,250ft – are Chris Dunn, a PhD student at the University of Colorado, and Graham Vickowski, a paramedic from Washington DC. The science program is twofold: during the approach to Everest, the team will collect plant data from more than 850 locations, repeating a study All directed in 2009. Higher on the mountain, they’ll gather glacier samples of snow, ice, and rock in order to analyze deposits of dust and black carbon. The glaciers play a vital role in what’s known as the planet’s albedo, the reflectivity of the earth’s surface. The more pollutants and dust that cover a glacier, the less reflective it becomes, absorbing solar energy and creating a feedback loop that gradually raises temperatures, accelerating glacial melt and recession. A 2019 report titled The Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment noted that by 2100, temperatures in the northwest Himalayas are expected to have risen nearly 50% faster than the global average. Another study, from 2013, indicated that glaciers around Everest have shrunk by 13% since the 1960s, and the rate is increasing. Some scientists predict that at least one-third of glaciers in the Himalayas will be gone by the end of the century. Because the range is sandwiched between China and India, All hopes it’s possible to distinguish the source of various pollutants, and, in turn, influence conservation efforts in the planet’s two largest countries. The team arrived in advance base camp (ABC) on 16 April and began sorties above camp. Its summit attempts will take place this month, when appropriate weather windows open up and the team is rested and ready. Meanwhile, conditions appear to be quiet and stable on the mountain. They are, however, as All recently recounted on the team’s blog, quite warm. “The morning is clear and bright and the sun beats us unmercifully,” he wrote. “Hats, sunscreen, long sleeves, sunglasses, and lip balm. The snow melts more and more quickly.” This story was originally published by Outside, the leading publication for those who love the outdoors"
"As I write, metropolitan journalists are doubtless making their way to north Queensland, whose voters have been cast as a principal actor in Labor’s defeat. I’m from Townsville, my family still lives there, and I visit as often as I can. I can easily imagine the articles coming our way. Reporters will certainly find people who are less guarded in expressions of racism than white Australians in metropolitan areas. Others will utterly deny global heating, or perhaps talk in dark or conspiracy-minded terms about opponents to Adani’s Carmichael coalmine.  This kind of quasi-anthropological trekking to conservative rural areas is depressingly familiar fare in Trump-era America. Calling it fetishism won’t stop it happening. But this prospect has some people offering a pre-emptive defence of Queenslanders. On Twitter, some have insisted that these people are no different to other Australians, sharing similar attitudes and anxieties. It seems to me that both of these perspectives are wrong but in complex ways. There clearly is something quite specific going on in north Queensland. It’s obviously partly related to the mine, which local media obsessively highlighted as the only real issue. Just look at the numbers. Labor easily lost Lindsay and other suburban swing seats in the south. But in Herbert, centred on Townsville, the loss was of an unprecedented scale. Their incumbent received lowest primary vote in the seat since the first national election 1901, when north Queenslanders sent Labor’s Fred Bamford to Canberra after he campaigned on excluding South Sea Islander workers from the sugar cane fields. In Herbert only one in four voters gave Labor a first preference. Labor also recorded its lowest primary votes in nearby Capricornia (24.7%) and Dawson (20.6%), where the controversy-plagued incumbent George Christensen got an 11.3% swing in his favour. All three electorates have returned Labor members in recent times, and Capricornia in particular was, until recently, a relatively reliable Labor seat. In Dawson and Herbert the combined total of the far-right and populist-right parties — One Nation, Clive Palmer’s United Australia party and the Katter Australia party — eclipsed Labor’s tally. In Capricornia Labor only just edged out that combined tally. And now One Nation, in particular, looks comfortable and established as a part of the mix in these electorates, which have contributed significantly to the election of their Queensland senators. North Queensland politics have always been volatile and subject to the lure of populism and protest votes but this is new. Some – from the Coalition and Labor camps – have pointed to the Stop Adani convoy, organised by the Bob Brown Foundation, as a direct cause of this heavily depressed Labor vote. This is a convenient but unsatisfying explanation that leads us directly to a dead end. If Labor’s electoral prospects are this dependent on Bob Brown no longer doing the kind of thing that Bob Brown has always done, it is more fragile and hapless than even I could have imagined. Also, this suggests that transient intrusions by national figures are more decisive than local factors – bearing down hard on these lets us put the results in national context in more convincing and disturbing ways. One thing that has been so far underplayed is News Corp’s newspaper monopoly throughout the region. Those newspapers have mounted a sustained propaganda campaign in favour of the new mine. On the reef coast they have downplayed the damage to the Great Barrier Reef owing to the climate crisis. And if anyone can be blamed for turning Bob Brown’s visit into a harbinger of doom, it’s these papers. The virtual collapse of other regional news media means that News has an outsized agenda-setting role in the area. This resembles an exacerbated version of News’s national position, which became a subject of broader debate during the campaign. News’s malign influence is fractal — it distorts debate at the local level just as surely as at the national level. But there’s a far bigger problem – historical, existential – which can’t simply be laid at News Corp’s, or even wholly at north Queensland’s feet. A friend, artist and researcher Rachel O’Reilly said on Facebook on Sunday that “Queensland is not a discrete geography but a dominant mode of production”. O’Reilly is from Gladstone and some of her artistic practice has focused on the destruction of its national environment in the operation and extension of its port. That port in turn serves a hinterland dominated by extractive industries. Her point is about Australia’s present and its history, which from a certain distance has been a series of extractive land grabs, starting with the foundational, violent dispossession of Indigenous people, continuing through immigration exclusion, and through to the present of blind, heedless and reckless coalmining. People in the southern cities have been able to maintain some psychological distance from this – from what goes on in whatever they imagine Queensland to be. But they too – as financiers, realtors, landlords, lawyers, state functionaries, speculators – have always been complicit in what happened on the frontier of extraction. All of us have benefited from theft and environmental degradation, all of us have depended on new mines, new finds. North Queensland is just at the sharp end. There’s a real question after this election as to whether Australia knows any other way to be. The country has foundered for so long on the issue of the climate emergency because no one has a clear, politically salient vision for a post-extractive, post-carbon, post-colonial economy. The Liberals and those to their right deny that any such thing is necessary, just as many of them deny Indigenous dispossession. They nurse lumps of coal in parliament, or claim that the science of climate emergency is a globalist plot, or personally plan yet more mines. Labor has dithered between half-hearted action and half-hearted agreement with the right for years, as if the climate can be met halfway, and is constantly punished for whichever emphasis it chooses. Bill Shorten’s equivocations on Adani exemplify this perfectly. The Greens, so far, are incapable of persuading sufficient numbers of people that their proposals are viable, or can incorporate just transitional arrangements for the people dependent on extraction. And none of the parties are connected with, or pressured by, a climate-focused social movement of sufficient size or force. Climate change policies are mostly experienced as triennial retail offerings to atomised voters who are encouraged to think in terms of their own individual economic interests. People in a district which was rich during the boom and presented with no real alternative prospects voted transactionally. At one level this is unsurprising, and all the safari journalism that southern media can muster may not yield deeper insights. This is not to absolve the voters in my home region, or elsewhere in majoritarian white Australia. It is high time to stop pretending, for example, that people vote for One Nation out of any other sentiment than racism; or that extractive industries have not been connected with colonialism, environmental destruction and racism from the beginning; or that coalmines are not directly connected with the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, which is happening under north Queenslanders’ noses. But while racism is a more or less permanent factor in Australian politics, what has dramatically eroded, clearly, is any confidence in the idea that Australia’s political system can generate ideas and viable plans for addressing the crisis in our midst. Many people appear to have opted to derive what they can from the status quo, while they can – north Queenslanders as much as anyone else. Perhaps our political system as it’s now constituted will never frame an adequate response to the climate crisis. And elections probably cannot save us in the absence of popular pressure, resilience and creativity. But we can be certain that if north Queensland and Australia cannot remake themselves on a wholly new basis, they will nevertheless be remade. • Jason Wilson is a Guardian Australia columnist"

Climate science skepticism in Germany now has spread from a few once marginalized groups over to the junior member of Germany’s coalition CDU-FDP government, the Free Democrats Party (FDP). Hat tip: Ökowatch.

Coalition government FDP party invitation questions climate dogma – announces skeptical climate and energy conference.
The FDP is holding a skeptic conference at the end of this month. This is the first time any political party in Germany holds a “skeptic” conference, and thus marks a watershed event in Germany when it comes to climate science skepticism. Make no mistake – it’s a clear signal.
It used to be that every political party in Germany, from the communists to the conservatives, accepted the science underpinning the man-made climate catastrophe. But that’s changing now. Germany’s Free Democrats (FDP) party appears to be breaking away from the blind, stampeding herd and is holding a conference that casts serious doubt on global warming dogma, which has gripped Germany for over 2 decades, and the direction of Germany’s environmental and energy policy.
Of course skeptical conferences have been held in Germany, but never has one been sponsored by a political party, let alone one that is in power.
Ökowatch writes that “a conference on the topic of climate organized by a political party is taking place for the first time in Dresden on June 30, 2012“. It is one that will offer an alternative view in the debate: The state faction of the FDP Saxony is holding together with ALDE, the Alliance of Liberal Parliamentarians in the EU, a climate conference titled: “Are we beyond rescue? Between climate catastrophe and eco-hysteria.”
Here’s what the above pictured invitation says:
Whether it is the ban of the incandescent light bulb, the mandating of E10 ethanol fuel, the planned energy renovation obligation for residential buildings, which was set up at the end of December 2010, or the attempt by a few overzealous communities to impose the mounting rooftop solar systems: Starting with the European Union and extending to the administration of German towns, eco-bureaucrats are always waiting to impose new, excessive demands and environmental standards.
Here no one seems to care that the energy-saving light bulbs will have to disposed of as toxic waste at a high cost, that the manufacture of a single electric car requires an additional amount of energy consumption that would be enough to fuel a compact car over its entire lifetime. Ecological hysteria and symbolism have come to dictate our everyday life. Just the requirement to renovate residential buildings could lead to costs of over 10,000 euros for each single family home. For many German homeowners, this will mean financial ruin. Apparently every mean is justified when it comes to protecting the climate, no matter the cost. The ends justify the means. Economic sense? Ecologic sense? – Don’t ask!

Among all this, the question of whether or not there is climate change, a global warming, and if so, is it really caused by man, plays no role.  Today a number of serious scientists seriously doubt the increase in global temperature, let alone the anthropogenic causes.
The FDP faction of the State Parliament of Saxony has decided, together with the Saxony FDP European Parliamentarian Holger Krahmer, to offer an alternative to the media-driven hysteria by holding a climate conference.
Our primary objective is to give scientists, economists and journalists, who view the green activism with skepticism and warn of incalculable consequences, a chance to speak out.
The speakers will include scientists Prof. Dr. Knut Löschke, Leipzig; Prof. Dr. Josef Reichholf, Munich; environmental economists Prof. Dr. Bodo Sturm, HTWK Leipzig; Dr. Benny Peiser, London; as well as journalist and publicist Michael Miersch of Munich.
See event website“
Of course no one expects the mainstream media to cover this event, nor is that important in the end.
The skeptic movement in Germany is growing just fine without them. For years eco-activists, scientists, politicians and the media have tried everything to marginalize the skeptics: The result: the skeptics are winning and are stronger than ever.
Look at the progress: EIKE has held 4 independent international conferences in Germany, a number of blogs have sprung up, a new best-selling book by one of the founders of the eco-movement, Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, came out earlier this year, and now the FDP party is is joining in and holding a skeptic conference – a first ever. So do we need the elitist media?
Don’t waste a single minute fretting about the absence of our drugged-up-on-green media. They live on another planet.
The blogs and Internet sites will report on this event and you know where to come to get informed. I do hope it will be possible to view the conference via webcam, or later on Youtube.

"Drowned cities; stagnant seas; intolerable heatwaves; entire nations uninhabitable… and more than 11 billion humans. A four-degree-warmer world is the stuff of nightmares and yet that’s where we’re heading in just decades. While governments mull various carbon targets aimed at keeping human-induced global heating within safe levels – including new ambitions to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 – it’s worth looking ahead pragmatically at what happens if we fail. After all, many scientists think it’s highly unlikely that we will stay below 2C (above pre-industrial levels) by the end of the century, let alone 1.5C. Most countries are not making anywhere near enough progress to meet these internationally agreed targets. Climate models predict we’re currently on track for a heating of somewhere between 3C and 4C for 2100, although bear in mind that these are global average temperatures – at the poles and over land (where people live), the increase may be double that. Predictions are tricky, however, as temperatures depend on how sensitive the climate is to carbon dioxide (CO2). Most models assume that it is not very sensitive – that’s where the lower 3C comes from – but a whole new set of models to be published in 2021 finds much greater sensitivity. They put heating at around 5C by the end of the century, meaning people could be experiencing as much as 10C of heating over land. Such uncertainty isn’t ideal, but for our purposes let’s plump for an entirely feasible planetary heating of 4C by the end of the century. If that seems a long time away, consider that plenty of people you know will be around then. My children will be in their 80s, perhaps with middle-aged children and grandchildren. We are making their world and it will be a very different place. Four degrees may not sound like much – after all, it is less than a typical temperature change between night and day. It might even sound pleasant, like retiring from the UK to southern Spain. However, an average heating of the entire globe by 4C would render the planet unrecognisable from anything humans have ever experienced. The last time the world was this hot was 15m years ago during the miocene, when intense volcanic eruptions in western North America emitted vast quantities of CO2. Sea levels rose some 40 metres higher than today and lush forests grew in Antarctica and the Arctic. However, that global heating took place over many thousands of years. Even at its most rapid, the rise in CO2 emissions occurred at a rate 1,000 times slower than ours has since the start of the Industrial Revolution. That gave animals and plants time to adapt to new conditions and, crucially, ecosystems had not been degraded by humans. Things look considerably bleaker for our 2100 world. Over the past decade, scientists have been able to produce a far more nuanced picture of how temperature rise affects the complexities of cloud cover and atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns and ecology. We’re looking at vast dead zones in the oceans as nutrients from fertiliser runoff combine with warmer waters to produce an explosion in algae that starve marine life of oxygen. This will be exacerbated by the acidity from dissolved CO2, which will cause a mass die-off, particularly of shellfish, plankton and coral. “We will have lost all the reefs decades before 2100 – at somewhere between 2C and 4C,” says Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Sea levels will be perhaps two metres higher and, more worryingly, we will be well on our way to an ice-free world, having passed the tipping points for the Greenland and west Antarctic ice sheets, committing us to at least 10 metres of sea-level rise in coming centuries. That’s because as ice sheets melt, their surface drops to a lower altitude where it is warmer, speeding up melting in a runaway feedback loop. Eventually, dark, heat-absorbing land is exposed, speeding the melting process even more. By 2100, we will also have lost most low-latitude glaciers, including two-thirds of the so called third pole of the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalayan mountains and Tibetan plateau that feeds many of Asia’s important rivers. However, most rivers, especially in Asia, will flood more often, according to research by Richard Betts, head of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre, because the hotter atmosphere will produce more intense monsoons, violent storms and extreme rainfall. His studies predict a wide equatorial belt of high humidity that will cause intolerable heat stress across most of tropical Asia, Africa, Australia and the Americas, rendering them uninhabitable for much of the year. Tropical forests of heat-tolerant species may well thrive in this wet zone with the high CO2 concentrations, especially with the disappearance of human infrastructure and agriculture, although the conditions will probably favour lianas (vines) over slower-growing trees, Betts says. To the south and north of this humid zone, bands of expansive desert will also rule out agriculture and human habitation. Some models predict that desert conditions will stretch from the Sahara right up through south and central Europe, drying rivers including the Danube and the Rhine. Our best hope lies in cooperating as never before: decoupling the political map from geography In South America, the picture is more complicated: increased precipitation could enhance the Amazon rainforest, leading to mightier river flow. Other models predict a weakening of the easterlies over the Atlantic, drying the Amazon, increasing fires and turning it from forest to grassland. The tipping point for the Amazon could well be triggered by deforestation; while the intact forest could cope with some drought because it generates and maintains its own moist ecosystem, areas that have been opened up through degradation allow moisture to escape. “A combination of climate change and deforestation could push it into a savannah state,” Rockström says. All of nature will be affected by the change in climate, ecosystems and hydrology and there will be plenty of extinctions as species struggle to migrate and adapt to an utterly changed world. Daniel Rothman, co-director of MIT’s Lorenz Center, calculates that 2100 will herald the beginning of Earth’s sixth mass extinction event. But what about us? This is undoubtedly a more hostile, dangerous world for humanity, which by 2100 will number around 11 billion, all of whom will need food, water, power and somewhere to live. It will be, in a giant understatement, problematic. The good news is that humans won’t become extinct – the species can survive with just a few hundred individuals; the bad news is, we risk great loss of life and perhaps the end of our civilisations. Many of the places where people live and grow food will no longer be suitable for either. Higher sea levels will make today’s low-lying islands and many coastal regions, where nearly half the global population live, uninhabitable, generating an estimated 2 billion refugees by 2100. Bangladesh alone will lose one-third of its land area, including its main breadbasket. From 2030, more than half the population will live in the tropics, an area that makes up a third of the planet and already struggles with climate impacts. Yet by 2100, most of the low and mid latitudes will be uninhabitable because of heat stress or drought; despite stronger precipitation, the hotter soils will lead to faster evaporation and most populations will struggle for fresh water. We will have to live on a smaller land surface with a larger population. Indeed, the consequences of a 4C warmer world are so terrifying that most scientists would rather not contemplate them, let alone work out a survival strategy. Rockström doesn’t like our chances. “It’s difficult to see how we could accommodate eight billion people or maybe even half of that,” he says. “There will be a rich minority of people who survive with modern lifestyles, no doubt, but it will be a turbulent, conflict-ridden world.” He points out that we already use nearly half the world’s ice-free surface to produce food for 7 billion people and thinks meeting the needs of 11 billion in such hostile conditions would be impossible. “The reason is primarily making enough food, but also we would have lost the biodiversity we’re dependent on and be facing a cocktail of negative shocks all the time, from fires to droughts.” Others are more sanguine. “I don’t think that humans as a species or even industrial civilisation is seriously threatened,” says Ken Caldeira, climatologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in California. “People live in Houston, Miami and Atlanta because they live in air conditioning through the hot summers. If people are rich enough to air-condition their lives, they can watch whatever is the successor to Game of Thrones on TV, as the natural world decays around them,” he says. But he points out that while richer people risk a loss to their quality of life, the poorer risk their actual lives. So how might we give all of humanity the best chance? Our best hope lies in cooperating as never before to radically reorganise our world: decoupling the political map from geography. However unrealistic it sounds, we’d need to look at the world afresh and see it in terms of where the resources are and then plan the population, food and energy production around that. It would mean abandoning huge tracts of the globe and moving Earth’s human population to the high latitudes: Canada, Siberia, Scandinavia, parts of Greenland, Patagonia, Tasmania, New Zealand and perhaps newly ice-free parts of the western Antarctic coast. If we allow 20 sq m of space per person – more than double the minimum habitable space allowed per person under English planning regulations – 11 billion people would need 220,000 sq km of land to live on. The area of Canada alone is 9.9m sq km and, combined with all the other high-latitude areas, such as Alaska, Britain, Russia and Scandinavia, there should be plenty of room for everyone. Food production will need to be more intensive. This will be a mostly vegetarian world, devoid of fish and livestock These precious lands, with tolerable temperatures and access to water, would also be valuable food-growing areas, as well as the last oases for many species, so people would need to be housed in compact, efficient high-rise cities with reflective roofs and resource-recycling systems. That risks raising local temperatures to intolerable levels, because compact cities function as heat islands, so solar-powered cooling or even artificial winds would be needed to counteract this. There is also an increased risk of epidemics in such densely populated spaces. Peter Cox, a climatologist at the University of Exeter, thinks this is viable, but would require a massive programme of infrastructure to manage waste, air quality and water needs. City-scale underground reservoirs could supply domestic needs and efficient recycling would keep water – and other resources – circulating in the population for years rather than hours. Post-fossil fuels, we will require unprecedented electricity production. This could come from vast arrays of solar- and wind-power plants in a belt across the uninhabitable desert regions. High-voltage direct current transmission lines could relay this power to the cities or it could be stored as thermal energy in molten salts and transported in hydrogen – after solar energy is used to split water to provide hydrogen for fuel cells. Hydrogen production will be on an industrial scale and it could be used for nonelectric transport, for instance. Wave farms, nuclear fission (and potentially fusion) and solar power will help meet our electricity needs. In the meantime, the effective capture from the air of today’s carbon emissions will with luck be a reality; they can be stored or used in the manufacture of materials. Food production will need to be more intensive, efficient and industrial. This will be a mostly vegetarian world, largely devoid of fish and without the grazing area or resources for livestock. Poultry may be viable on the edges of farmland and synthetic meats and other foods will meet some of the demand. Heat-tolerant, drought-resistant crop varieties, such as cassava and millet, will replace many of our current unmodified staples such as rice and wheat and they will grow faster and with greater water efficiency because of the high CO2 levels. One problem is that almost all of our agriculture will need to be at higher latitudes, because the tropics will be too dry or too hot for farmworkers. And that means less land and less sunlight in winter. “Global agriculture could be limited by the geometry of Earth’s orbit around the sun,” Cox says. “However, studies have shown that crops thrive with artificial light delivered by LEDs at exactly the right frequencies for photosynthesis. This means we could grow crops through the winter months, hydroponically in smaller spaces, stacked up in warehouses or even underground, leaving valuable land surfaces for other uses.” Cultivation of algal mats and crops grown on floating platforms and in marshland could also contribute, while crops could potentially be grown in uninhabitable regions, farmed and processed remotely by artificial farmers. Either way, we would need to use far more precise nutrient and irrigation systems to avoid polluting more fertile ecosystems and reduce food loss and waste. A 4C warmer world may well be survivable, but it would be eminently poorer than the one we currently enjoy. Rockström believes it takes us beyond our adaptation capabilities. Delivering our children to such a deadly home is a horrifying proposition. Given what’s at stake, it may be worth deploying geoengineering tools, which reflect the sun’s heat away from Earth, and so keep global heating to safe levels. This wouldn’t address the problem of dissolved carbon killing oceanic life, but it could buy us more time to decarbonise and achieve negative emissions. Crucially, keeping Earth cooler for longer would help the poorest people to adapt. “We have come to a point where different forms of geoengineering cannot be excluded,” admits Rockström, “but SRM [solar radiation management] is a very dangerous geopolitical tool to deploy: who decides which part of the globe to shade? How would we govern it?” he asks. We’ve already warmed the world by 1.1C, and we’re experiencing the effects: the International Federation of the Red Cross estimates there are as many as 50 million climate refugees. Once we reach 4C, most models agree it will be impossible to return to today’s abundant world. “For me, the issue is that we are transforming (and simplifying!) our world for many thousands of years into the future with millennia of rising sea [levels], acidified oceans and intolerable tropical temperatures, just because we weren’t willing to pay the small differential between fossil-fuelled prosperity and prosperity fuelled by non-greenhouse-gas-emitting energy systems,” says Caldeira. We are now making the climate of 2100 and however hard it seems to meet our emissions targets, it’ll be far harder for our children if we don’t. With international cooperation and regulation, we can make it livable. • This article was amended on 28 November 2019. Due to an apparent misunderstanding, the quotation “It’s difficult to see how we could accommodate eight billion people or maybe even half of that” was originally published as “It’s difficult to see how we could accommodate a billion people or even half of that.”"

What Do Polar Bears Dream While They’re Dying?
Dear Ed, P,
If this were only the Pleistocene, your factual errors, outdated science references and unfounded conclusions aside, you are right, polar bears would come to land and survive.
However, this is not the Pleistocene, it is the Holocene. For the first time in polar bear evolution, the decline of sea ice now places the bears’ turn to land in direct conflict with an animal with which it has never before had to compete: man.
Polar bears are most certainly more threatened now than in any time in their history, and we are to blame. Behind the screen of climate change, the world has been duped; polar bears do need land, a fact and reality that is being denied.

Behind this denial, there exists no sanctuary for polar bears in Alaska and no one seems to mind, much less care. “Critical Habitat” here in the US, is 96% melting sea ice. While only 4% is land, that land is still available for development.
When the sea ice melts, and it is melting, and the polar bears come to land (they are already doing so), 2,000+ polar bears will have no choice but to come ashore with no land set aside for them.
When 2000+ polar bears find no sanctuary, no refuge from development, no home, no peace, they will not survive. You say they they are in no danger, the fact is that they have never faced a greater danger.
Like Mr. Gore, your misguided position only serves to further public confusion, and further damage the future of polar bears.
Polar bears can survive climate change, but not human greed. If we continue to wage the politics of climate change on the backs of polar bears, they will never have a chance.
Polar bears need sanctuary, and until they get it, they have no future as a species on this planet.
Respectfully,

"As global warming has worsened in recent years, environmentalists and union members have often protested against each other, whether over fracking, oil pipelines, coal production or the Green New Deal. But an innovative new labor-environmentalist effort in New York – to build offshore wind turbines to power up to 6m homes – is a sharp departure from all that feuding and shows that these two groups can work together to advance renewable energy and reduce dependence on carbon-based energy.  Giving this plan a vital boost, New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has announced plans to have the state’s energy authority invest billions of dollars to build hundreds of offshore wind turbines. For Cuomo, this plan is key to New York state’s ambitious mandate to obtain 70% of its energy from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, by 2030. Pushed by a professor at Cornell University, more than a dozen unions came together to develop what they call Climate Jobs New York, a plan that they say will create more than 10,000 jobs; jobs that they agree should be middle-class, union jobs. “We brought together more than a dozen unions, and said things are not good at the national level in terms of how unions are relating to environmental organizations and the climate movement,” said Lara Skinner, the labor relations professor at Cornell who spearheaded this effort. She noted that several unions were furious at environmentalists for opposing fracking and the Keystone and Dakota Access oil pipelines, which many unions viewed as a boon for job creation. “Climate change impacts working people,” Skinner added. “There are some major opportunities here for labor if we can get ahead of this thing. What we’ve done is a very investment-led strategy, a very jobs-led strategy.” The offshore wind turbines are at the heart of the climate plan the unions developed, but it also calls for installing more solar panels, improving and expanding mass transit and renovating buildings to make them more energy efficient. The unions’ plan talks repeatedly of a “just transition” so that workers who lose good-paying jobs when, for instance, coal-fired power plants close could be trained for good-paying new renewable energy jobs. “This is a very practical approach in that we’re not going to the extreme saying tomorrow there should be no fossil fuel. We understand that an immediate transition is not going to happen,” said Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, a federation of construction unions. “We recognize that our climate is in danger and climate change is real. We’re certainly concerned about future generations.” In an unusual move, more than a dozen unions and labor federations developed the climate plan, without inviting environmental groups to participate in the early discussions. One fear was that if the two sides were together from the start, there might be fights over fracking and pipelines that blew up and prevented progress on other fronts. One union leader involved in the effort said: “The labor movement and environmental community agree on probably 90% of things, so we shouldn’t focus on the things that are going to destroy goodwill.” In the US at present, just 30 megawatts of energy are obtained from offshore wind – a wind farm with five turbines off Rhode Island. Cuomo plans to go far behind that, calling for New York to obtain 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind, 300 times what the US now obtains from that source. What Cuomo calls his Green New Deal calls for building hundreds of huge turbines about 15 miles off the Long Island and New Jersey coasts. As a first step, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority has solicited bids for 800 megawatts of offshore wind. One bid calls for turbines that are 850ft tall, nearly three times the height of the Statue of Liberty, with blades that are as long as a football field. “Offshore wind is poised to be the next major clean energy resource for the United States,” said Alicia Barton, president of the energy development authority. The project will require welders, plumbers and pipefitters to install the turbines, carpenters and millwrights to build the foundations, utility workers to connect them to the power grid, painters to paint them to prevent rust and myriad construction workers to build a new seaport to handle the colossal turbine parts. New York officials have agreed all these workers will receive a prevailing wage, the amount paid to a majority of workers in their field in a particular region. The state also agreed to have project labor agreements for the turbine work before workers are hired that set the terms and conditions of employment and help avoid strikes. The construction unions that developed the plan included the electrical workers, laborers and operating engineers. “If we were going to reposition unions on the issue of climate change, we had to start with the unions that had traditional concerns about it,” Skinner said. “We’re trying to figure out how to reposition unions on this issue so they’re an engine to tackle the climate crisis.” Skinner said the New York effort could serve as a model for labor-environmentalist cooperation in other states. Among the other unions that have joined the New York effort were the Transport Workers Union, the New York State Nurses Association and large New York locals of the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. “I have been an advocate for 20 years, and this is one of my proudest moments,” said Lisa Dix, who heads the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign in New York and has often clashed with unions. Dix worked with Skinner and the unions in finalizing their plan. “We have a huge opportunity ahead of us if we can focus on all the great things we’re going to do to build this economy together,” Dix said. She noted that 30 environmental groups have embraced and are pushing the Climate Jobs New York plan.  “This will be a huge economic driver,” said Doreen Harris, director of large-scale renewables for the New York State Energy and Research Development Authority. “We will see significant benefits coming to New York from these investments. A broad, new industry will be set up in the north-east with New York as a hub.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThank you Sweden for not acting like duped, non-thinking zombies, blindly marching behind activists who claim to be cool, educated and hip. Thank you for exercising critical and open thinking.
Sweden’s English language The Local  has a report titled: Swedish politicos ‘don’t buy climate change’. What on Earth happened to politically correct Sweden? Are they getting tired of enduring bitter, long winters and have they given up hope on the warmer times that were once promised? The Local starts with:
Six of ten local politicians in Sweden doubt whether human activity is to blame for global warming, a new study has found.
In addition, one out of ten municipal politicians and local government managers totally deny that the phenomenon of global warming even exists, according to a survey carried out by the Swedish Defence Research Agency (Försvarets forskningsinstitutet – FOI).
‘This is clearly not good. These people feel like they don’t have to take responsibility for environmental work in their municipalities,’ FOI’s head of climate and energy research, Annika Carlsson-Kanyama, told the Dagens Nyheter (DN) newspaper.
The findings come from a survey carried out by FOI looking into how local decision-makers in Sweden view the issue of climate change.”
Continue reading here.
Don’t expect the rest of the western media to even mention a peep about this survey, which completely embarrasses climate science. Note how they make belief in climate change sound like a part of our “environmental responsibility”.
But what about our responsibility to truth and reality? Oh, I forgot. There’s now a Ministry for Truth and Science for that!

The Local goes on to quote the Defense Research Agency: “It’s a threat to national security” and that the results of the survey “took them by surprise”. Such is the life of those who live in climate-catastrophe fantasyland. Annika Carlsson-Kanyama, head of climate and energy research, says:
It makes me angry that there are groups that spread the idea that research on the climate can’t be trusted.
In essence, the survey indicates that 70 percent of Sweden’s local politicians don’t believe in the science.”
There goes Ms Carlsson-Kanyama’s obsession – up in smoke. The fact is that much of the science has long been revealed as a hoax – a fraud that never held water. I can see the Agency trying to load the survey questions to get the answers they want, and getting all frustrated. Next time they’ll be wiser and just make up the results. That’s what everyone else involved in the climate-catastrophe science does. But it’s the reason no one takes it seriously.
Now comes the funniest part. According to Carlsson-Kanyama, “climate change-doubters are often men from small, conservative-leaning municipalities, while it is often women from larger municipalities who are champions of the need to act to combat climate change.”
So there you have it.  They’ve given up on concensus and have moved on to claiming that the science of climate change is now endorsed by “hip people”.
Carlsson-Kanyama should know, however, that Sweden’s leading skeptic climate blog is operated by a cosmopolitan woman, Maggie Thauersköld Crusell, who, if I am not mistaken, lives in hip Stockholm. And what about Donna Laframboise in Toronto? Or Judith Curry at Georgia Tech? Jo Nova in Australia, to name a few?
Attempting to marginalize “doubters” as narrow-minded male hicks instead of presenting scientific arguments shows precisely why people no longer believe the climate bedwetters.

"The EU is disregarding the climate emergency by continuing to give out billions of euros in subsidies to climate-intensive livestock farms at the same time as promising to cut emissions, say campaigners. Under the Paris climate agreement, the EU and its member states have committed to reduce emissions in the European Union by at least 40% by 2030. The EU’s farming sector has shown no decline in emissions since 2010, with meat and dairy estimated to be responsible for 12-17% of total greenhouse gas emissions.  Yet the EU continues to pay out an estimated £24bn of taxpayer money – nearly a fifth of the EU’s total budget – to support livestock farms across Europe, the majority of which are climate-intensive. “Instead of pouring billions of euros into industrial farms that drive climate change, the EU must support farmers to produce less and better meat, and to provide meat and dairy alternatives,” said Greenpeace’s EU agriculture policy director, Marco Contiero. The EU’s subsidy payouts to farmers are due to be replaced by next year. The EU Commission’s draft Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform proposals, published last year, include an objective to take action on climate change. However, they set no targets for reducing livestock numbers. The EU agricultural commissioner, Phil Hogan, has previously been reported as dismissing the sector’s emissions footprint. Compassion in World Farming campaigner Peter Stevenson said the EU was “deaf to the scientific arguments” that a reduction in EU production and consumption is necessary to tackle climate change. Former EU Environment commissioner Karl Falkenberg pointed the blame at MEPs in the EU Parliament’s all-powerful agri-committee for blocking reforms. More than half the politicians on the committee have declared interests as farmers, former farmers, CAP payment recipients in another capacity, current or former partners in agricultural businesses, or have spouses who own farms. “It is mainly made up of farming or rural MEPs who want to be members of the committee because it gives them a way to get re-elected. The entire EU Parliament might not take the same line as the committee, but if we get a bad policy from them it is harder to change,” Falkenberg told the Guardian. The thinktank Rise Foundation has said Europe’s meat and dairy production would need to halve by 2050 to meet global targets for reducing climate emissions. MEPs from the European Parliament’s environment committee proposed earlier this year to restrict subsidy payments for livestock farms that don’t cut their stocking density – the number of animals they keep in the space available. Greenpeace says the move would help incentivise farms to turn towards less intensive farming. The EU Commission has argued that greenhouse gas emissions at global level could increase if EU production was replaced by imports. It has also pointed to research showing that the least intensive farms are more reliant on EU farm subsidies than more intensive ones. “We should be using the CAP to lower emissions, but there is a danger of scaring off EU production to other countries,” said Allan Buckwell from the Institute for European Environmental Policy, who called for measures, including a meat tax, to tackle meat and dairy consumption as well as production in Europe. The EU farming lobby group Copa-Cogeca said livestock farmers contributed to preserving grasslands, keeping rural communities strong and helping provide consumers with a balanced diet. “Many of the studies that call for a reduction of livestock do not consider the actual implications that a shift in production would have. Land would be abandoned and other benefits for the environment would be lost. “Farmers are already looking into how to reduce emissions from livestock farming and working with research to come up with viable solutions – such as reducing livestock enteric methane emissions through special feed supplements – that do not jeopardise livestock production in the EU and are also sustainable for farmers,” said a spokesperson. The EU Commission said the next CAP would require member states to show how they will be using it to bolster climate action, including from the livestock sector. It said it was also supporting research into ways of reducing emissions from livestock and promoting alternative protein crops."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German left-wing online TAZ here has a report bemoaning how industrial countries are all shirking their responsibilities when it comes to helping the poor countries develop sustainable societies.

Sorry – no money for climate protection.
If there is a sure sign of just how serious countries really are when it comes to the “grave problems of climate change”, then look no further than money. If climate change was an imminent catastrophe, you wouldn’t know it from the money that countries are pledging. In fact, you’d think they’ve stopped taking it seriously.
The TAZ writes:
And today, 20 years later? Never has there been a UN climate conference where so little is being said about money, even though it is so urgently necessary,’ wonders Jens Martens, development expert of the international non-governmental organisation Global Policy Forum. The industrial countries wish to avoid costly promises and the South has given in to resignation.”
There are two reasons for that: 1) Many industrial countries are teetering on the brink of financial disaster, and 2) the same countries (e.g. Japan, China, Russia, Canada, USA) are beginning to wake up to the FACT that man-made climate catastrophe is a hoax.
At the 2010 Cancun Conference, industrial countries pledged $100 billion for so-called green climate funds. However, according to the TAZ, only about 10 billion have been paid.
With the financial markets in Europe and North America in worsening disarray, expect the supply of money for climate projects to get even more scarce. It’s back to 1992: “It’s the economy, stupid!” Climate change is just a hoax.

"  Surging concern among Americans about an overheating planet has done little to shift a political polarization that has now reached a stunning extreme: climate breakdown divides Democrats and Republicans even more than abortion does. When voters were asked to rank topics important to them for the 2020 presidential election, conservative Republicans put global warming last out of 29 issues. Liberal Democrats placed the issue third, behind only environmental protection and healthcare. This yawning gap in priorities between the two voting groups, highlighted in new Yale University data, is more stark than traditionally divisive topics such as abortion and gun control. Abortion ranks fifth and gun policies sit in seventh for conservative Republicans, with these issues coming in at number 13 and number seven, respectively, for progressive Democrats. There is also a large, although slightly narrower, gap between moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans on climate. These more centrist Democrats put global warming in eighth position, with moderate Republicans putting it in 23rd place. “Climate change is now more politically polarizing than any other issue in America,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale program on climate change communication. “The issue has climbed and climbed in importance for the Democratic base since the 2016 presidential election to the point that it’s now a top-tier concern. We have never seen that in American politics before. “And yet it’s dead last for conservative Republicans. The issue has flatlined for them over the past five years. In the US, your political party is the greatest indicator to your view on climate change – more than race, age or gender.” This growing alarm within Democratic ranks has already stirred the party’s presidential candidates, with contenders such as Elizabeth Warren and Beto O’Rourke releasing policies to slash planet-warming emissions and one hopeful, the Washington governor, Jay Inslee, running solely on the issue of the climate emergency. Joe Biden, the early frontrunner for the nomination, has been put under pressure over his lack of a climate plan to date. It remains to be seen whether climate will fizzle out as a topic once a Democrat emerges to challenge Donald Trump, who has engaged in conspiracy theories about climate science and sought to dismantle regulations aimed at lowering emissions. But polling does show the overall American electorate is now more alarmed about the climate crisis than ever before, with Yale’s latest survey finding that nearly four in 10 of all voters consider global heating policies as very important when choosing a candidate. This total includes 64% of all Democrats, a third of independents and 12% of Republicans. “The crystal ball is cloudy because politics has entered an era of chaos,” said Leiserowitz. “But it’s safe to say climate will be important in the Democratic primaries and then you won’t hear much about it beyond that. The differences with Donald Trump will be enormous, whoever the candidate is.” The two major parties in US politics experienced a major split over climate breakdown a decade ago, when the Tea Party helped drive a rightward shift among Republicans and candidates started to routinely dismiss mainstream science, aided by fossil fuel-funded groups that aimed to spread misinformation. This scenario has helped scupper any sweeping federal action on climate breakdown, although some Republicans are now modifying their position in the face of growing public concern over dire scientific warnings and a string of punishing wildfires, storms and flooding. Voters are prepared to back rapid action, too. Nearly seven in 10 Americans support the Green New Deal, a set of goals to radically reduce emissions, the Yale polling finds. This total includes 44% of Republicans, although this number has dropped sharply in recent months. “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (the New York Congresswoman behind the plan) has been turned into the boogyman by Fox News but if my party wants to win back the House it needs an alternative to the Green New Deal,” said Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman who now runs a group advocating conservative climate solutions. “Republicans in competitive districts are starting to think: ‘Gee, we need to push away from the president on this issue.’ We are starting to see new talking points from Republicans where they talk about realistic solutions to climate change. It’s a huge change from where we’ve disastrously been for the last decade.” Inglis said a shift among grassroots Republicans will be enough to convince about a dozen of the party’s lawmakers to back a tax on carbon dioxide emissions after the next election. “A price on carbon is rock-solid conservatism that is, wonderfully, also shared by many progressives,” he said. “But we’ve got a long way to go yet.” Reaching out to conservatives on climate change remains a conundrum for activists and scientists. But there are now clearer avenues to talk about renewable energy, such as solar and wind, as well as adaptions to climate-related disasters, according to Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University. “There’s nothing about the thermometer that gives you a different answer depending on who you vote for,” she said. “I’ve had many conservative groups say to me ‘Hey, it does look like something is happening, how do we prepare for this?’ “The whole idea we can do this without everyone has fallen flat on its face; the Australian election is the latest example of this. But we’ve been doing it ass backwards by trying to get people to accept the science first. “We don’t have to agree on humans being to blame to agree on the importance on building resilience and weaning ourselves off fossil fuels. There are strong arguments for doing those things anyway.”"
"Moderate Conservatives including Nicky Morgan and Amber Rudd are urging contenders for their party’s leadership to put the battle against the climate emergency at the forefront of the contest. The 60-strong One Nation group of senior Tories, created as a bulwark against what they perceive as their party’s lurch to the right, is calling for the environment to form a central part of the leadership debate.  Morgan said: “The people of the UK know that climate change is an emergency and young people are desperately worried about the future of the planet they will inherit. “There are huge opportunities for the UK to lead the way in green finance and environmental innovation and to show that decarbonising an economy doesn’t mean it has to stop growing – let’s get on with it.” The Tory leadership campaign is already well under way, despite the fact Theresa May has not yet announced an exit date. With her authority shattered, several MPs, including Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and the development secretary, Rory Stewart, have said they will run. Many others have declined to rule it out, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, the chief secretary to the treasury, Liz Truss, and the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, joined their number on Sunday. Asked by Sky’s Sophy Ridge whether he would run, he said: “I am focused on the job.” The prime minister has promised the backbench 1922 committee she will meet them in early June, after MPs have been given a fourth opportunity to vote on her Brexit deal. If the bill is rejected, as many in government anticipate, the 1922 Committee would be expected to announce a formal leadership contest, which could run through the summer. Boris Johnson is the clear favourite. A YouGov poll for the Times conducted last week suggested he is the first choice for 39% of Conservative members, with Dominic Raab the only other candidate making it into double figures, with 13%. However, candidates must first appeal to MPs, who have the opportunity to whittle the field down to two before members are given the final choice. The One Nation caucus of Conservative MPs, which is relaunching in parliament on Monday, has urged contenders to pledge to tackle pressing issues aside from Brexit and in particular, bring environmental issues to the fore. Led by Morgan, Rudd, former cabinet office minister Damian Green and veteran MP Nicholas Soames, the group plans to hold a series of leadership hustings, in an attempt to act as a counterweight to the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG). Other supporters of the caucus include the justice secretary, David Gauke, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, who form part of a group inside cabinet dubbed the “Gaukward Squad” for their role in trying to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The group has announced it will not back any candidate who advocates a no-deal Brexit. Moderate Tories are concerned about the contest turning into what one cabinet minister called a “virility contest” on Brexit. The climate emergency has shot up the political agenda in recent months, aided by the Extinction Rebellion protests and the campaign spearheaded by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, who is also widely expected to run for the leadership, referred to the situation as a “climate emergency” during a debate called by Labour to demand more urgent action from the government. “Every Conservative must feel that this is a cornerstone policy,” said Green, who was sacked as first secretary of state after admitting he lied about the presence of pornographic images on his House of Commons computer. The sacking occurred during an investigation into sexual harassment allegations, which were found to be “plausible”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that the mainstream media are hyperventilating over global warming being responsible for the heat wave, fires and thunderstorms hitting the US, it is a good time to check if they are applying the same science they used to explain winter cold snaps, like the one we saw just 2 years ago.
If they were serious, you’d at least think their science would remain consistent when explaining weather extremes. Anything else, after all, is just quackery.
Two years ago, the AP and scientists blamed the unusually cold winter weather on “natural variability”; they began:
Beijing had its coldest morning in almost 40 years and its biggest snowfall since 1951. Britain is suffering through its longest cold snap since 1981. And freezing weather is gripping the Deep South, including Florida’s orange groves and beaches.
Whatever happened to global warming? experts say the cold snap doesn’t disprove global warming at all  ‘It’s part of natural variability,’ said Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. With global warming, he said, ‘we’ll still have record cold temperatures. We’ll just have fewer of them.’
Scientists say man-made climate change does have the potential to cause more frequent and more severe weather extremes…and even cold spells.”

The AP then quoted scientists to explain the cause of the cold snap of 2010, saying that it was just a “big outbreak of Arctic air over populated areas of the Northern Hemisphere“, and then went on to provide the details about natural variability, which of course is reasonable.
But to explain the current 2012 heat wave near DC, they completely abandoned the reasonable science and went off and blamed CO2 witchcraft and Big Oil sorcerers summoning a heat wave.
So it’s up to us to use the rest of the AP’s 2010 story to explain the heat wave, changing only a few words:
‘We basically have seen just a big outbreak of Arctic tropical air’ over populated areas of the Northern Hemisphere, Arndt said. ‘The Arctic tropical air has really turned itself loose on us.’

In the atmosphere, large rivers of air travel roughly west to east around the globe between the Arctic and the tropics. This air flow acts like a fence to keep Arctic tropical air confined.
But recently, this air flow has become bent into a pronounced zigzag pattern, meandering north south and south north. If you live in a place where it brings air up down from the south north, you get warm cold weather. In fact, record highs lows were reported this week in Washington state and Alaska West Coast.
But in the eastern United States, like some other unlucky parts of the globe, Arctic tropical air is swooping down in from the north southwest. And that’s how you get a temperature of 3 104 degrees in Beijing Washington DC, a reading of minus-42 +104 in mainland Norway Norfolk, and 18 inches of snow rain in parts of Britain the South, where a member of Parliament Congress who said the snow heat ‘clearly indicates a cooling warming trend’ was jeered by colleagues.
The zigzag pattern arises naturally from time to time, but it is not clear why it’s so strong right now, said Michelle L’Heureux, a meteorologist at the Climate Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The center says the pattern should begin to weaken in a week or two.
Jeff Masters, director of meteorology for Weather Underground, a forecasting service, said he expects more typical winter summer weather across North America early next week.
That will be welcome news in the South, where farmers have been trying to salvage millions of dollars’ worth of strawberries and other crops.

Why Borenstein and the quack scientists he interviewed didn’t use the same 2010 cold-snap science to explain the general atmospheric dynamics behind the current heat is sort of a mystery. Now that we are dealing with heat, they are blaming it all on CO2 without even citing a single paper to back it up.
So what are we left with? We have to assume that it’s a few fringe charlatans trying to fan the flames of fear. It’s as sad an example of sham science as you’ll ever find.
For these catastrophe-mongers, warm weather in the winter means global warming, cold weather in the winter also means global warming, heat in the summer of course means global warming, and so does cold in the summer. It is nothing more than the irresponsible perpetuation of an increasingly obvious fraud.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper has been published by Twila Moon et al titled: 21st-Century Evolution of Greenland Outlet Glacier Velocities appearing in the journal Science.

Lead author Twila Moon finds that claims of rapid Greenland glacier acceleration are massively overstated.
The study contradicts all the bedwetting projections made by the crackpots at NASA or the PIK in Potsdam.
The paper’s abstract concludes:
Observed acceleration indicates that sea level rise from Greenland may fall well below proposed upper bounds.”
The German online daily Die Welt also reports on the story in an article today called Greenland Glacier Disappearing More Slowly Than Thought.
Die Welt writes that the behavior of 200 glaciers was evaluated over 10 years and that they accelerated on average only 30% instead of the often ballyhooed doubling. Die Welt writes (emphasis added):

The large glaciers ending on land or in fjords have on the other hand hardly changed or have even become slower, the scientists reported in the Journal ‘Science’.
Sea level rise resulting from Greenland ice melt therefore could end up being far less than what climate scientists predicted.”
Gee, like we’re even surprised.
A series of scientists like expert Nils-Axel Mörner have been telling us for years that the bedwetters had been hyper-exaggerating and that there has not been, is not, and will not be an acceleration in sea level rise. How many experts and how much more real, observed data is it going to take before people realize the models are sheer crap?
Moreover, the scientists are simply just not sure how much sea level is rising. Moon admits that. Die Welt writes:
Just how much, remains unclear however, say Twila Moon of the University of Washington in Seattle and her colleagues.”
The tide gauges show zero acceleration. And Die Welt adds:
‘In some respects our results produce as many new questions as they answer,’ said Ian Joughin, co-author, of the Applied Physics Laboratory of the the University of Washington.”

"People across Europe will need to work drastically fewer hours to avoid disastrous climate heating unless there is a radical decarbonising of the economy, according to a study. The research, from thinktank Autonomy, shows workers in the UK would need to move to nine-hour weeks to keep the country on track to avoid more than 2C of heating at current carbon intensity levels. Similar reductions were found to be necessary in Sweden and Germany.  The findings are based on OECD and UN data on greenhouse gas emissions per industry in the three countries. It found that at current carbon levels, all three would require a drastic reduction in working hours as well as urgent measures to decarbonise the economy to prevent climate breakdown. Will Stronge, the director of Autonomy, said the research highlighted the need to include reductions in working hours as part of the efforts to address the climate emergency. “Becoming a green, sustainable society will require a number of strategies – a shorter working week being just one of them,” he said. “This paper and the other nascent research in the field should give us plenty of food for thought when we consider how urgent a Green New Deal is and what it should look like.” The paper focuses on the emissions produced per industry in each economy but does not take into account other environmental advantages of reducing working hours, from less commuting to fewer goods produced and resources used. There is growing support in the US and Europe for a so-called Green New Deal, which aims for a rapid decarbonisation of the economy, creating secure, well-paid sustainable jobs. Accelerating automation has also led to increasing calls for a reduction in the working week. Emma Williams, a spokeswoman for the 4 Day Week campaign, said Wednesday’s report highlighted the link between automation, reduced working hours and the climate emergency.“We welcome this attempt by Autonomy to grapple with the very real changes society will need to make in order to live within the limits of the planet,” she said. “In addition to improved wellbeing, enhanced gender equality and increased productivity, addressing climate change is another compelling reason we should all be working less.” Stronge said technological advances and the climate emergency meant a shorter working week was now not only viable but essential. “The rapid pace of labour-saving technology brings into focus the possibility of a shorter working week for all, if deployed properly,” he said. “However, while automation shows that less work is technically possible, the urgent pressures on the environment and on our available carbon budget show that reducing the working week is in fact necessary.”"

Based on data from a few carefully selected tree rings, dogmatic warmist scientists like to insist that the Medieval Warm Period really did not exist globally and was only a local North Atlantic phenomenon.
The climate, they tell us, was pretty much steady over the last couple thousand years – until man began to prosper a hundred years ago.
However, yet another new study, one by Michael Shawn Fletcher and Patricio Iván Moreno, has been published and adds more to the growing mountain of evidence that the Medieval Warm Period was indeed a global phenomenon. This in turn means that natural climate drivers are dominating the development of the climate, and not CO2.
Yeah, like we’re really surprised.
The authors did an analysis of pollen and charcoal from Laguna San Pedro, a small closed-basin lake located in the Andes of Chile. Their results reveal centennial-scale changes in vegetation, climate and fire regime since 1500 cal yr before present.
According to the study’s abstract, they found periods of relatively low summer moisture and increased fire activity between 1500–1300 and 1000–725 cal yr BP. The period  1000–725 cal yr BP (i.e. Medieval Warm Period) is characterised by remarkably rapid bulk sediment accumulation, from which they infer prolonged annual sedimentation resulting from a decrease in the duration of lake freezing under a warmer climate. Before the Medieval Warm Period, i.e. 1300–1000, they found relatively moist conditions during summer and low fire activity. After the Medieval Warm Period, from 725–121 cal yr BP, there was slow bulk sediment accumulation implying a cool and wet climate. Adios Hockey Stick!

The abstract concludes (emphasis added):
Our results suggest that the Medieval Climate Anomaly chronozone was relatively warm and dry, followed by a cool-wet climate during the Little Ice Age chronozone, before a substantial modification of the vegetation landscape by Europeans occurred in the mid 1800’s. The timing and direction of changes in the Laguna San Pedro record bear a striking resemblance to multiple independent tropical Pacific precipitation reconstructions, areas where precipitation is governed by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and with the modern influence of ENSO over the climate in the region. We conclude that ENSO was the main driver of changes in growing season moisture in this part of the Temperate-Mediterranean Transition in south-central Chile over the last 1500 years.”
Here the authors lost it in the last sentence. I’m not at all convinced by their attribution to the ENSO, which is an internal oscillation occurring over annual and decadal scales. But the changes that the two authors have observed actually occur over decades, centuries and likely millenia. They really need to compare their results to solar and ocean cycle data, which today are readily available. Of course, they may not like what they find. But as scientists, they’ll surely put aside any prejudices that may exist.
If they do that, then they’ll reach a different conclusion. One thing is sure: the observed climate cycles have nothing to do with GHGs and man. That hypothesis can be fed to the shredder and dustbin.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s a new study out titled: A public health frame arouses hopeful emotions about climate change – A Letter in the Journal Of Climatic Change. It is a rare and precious glimpse at the warmists’ future strategy.
The study’s conclusion:
Framing climate change in terms of public health and/or national security may make climate change more personally relevant and emotionally engaging to segments of the public who are currently disengaged or even dismissive of the issue.
Don’t expect the results of this study to be made very public. But do expect them to be made very well known to the mainstream media, and watch them zealously apply the results with abandon soon in future communication with audiences.
As for the public, expect to be massively bombarded by all sorts of scare stories about the dangers of climate change to public health soon enough. I can see it now: climate change induced influenza, mental illness, epidemics, widespread allergies, rheumatism, malaria, cancer, depression…you name it!
The authors used a nationally representative online survey of U.S. residents (N = 1,127) conducted in December, 2010, and randomly assigned six previously identified audience segments on climate change to one of three experimental conditions.
The results: “across audience segments, the public health focus was the most likely to elicit emotional reactions consistent with support for climate change mitigation and adaptation.”
The introduction of the paper frames what the challenge is all about:
Effectively engaging the American public on climate change—including its causes, impacts, and solutions—remains both a major research question and a communication challenge.”
Clearly even though the public is growing more and more skeptical, the warmist bunch is a long way from giving up.

While many of us may scoff at the notion that a 1°C rise in temperature threatening public health, expect this dastardly scheme to scare will be aimed particularly at schoolchildren and students – the most emotionally vulnerable among us. Again, it’s the warmists resorting to the dirty tactics of scare-mongering and mass psychological manipulation.
The paper adds:
People’s emotional reactions to messages about climate change are an important consideration, yet to date they have often been overlooked both in research and in communication efforts. […] Emotions serve as affective prompts for engagement with an issue and lead to forming predispositions for action when a relevant situation arises.”
But the authors warn that there’s a risk of producing an unintended angry backlash, and that caution is needed:
However, eliciting anger against the claims or proposed recommendations emphasized in a communication strategy also has the danger of inciting action counter to the communicator’s intent. […] the very claim of climate change’s reality might elicit anger among people dismissive of the issue. Thus, a given message could generate an angry backlash by some recipients, leading to an unintended social response, while provoking an equally angry—yet intended—social response by other recipients.”
Us skeptics must work to educate the public about the true intentions of this budding campaign. We need to feed that legitimate backlash.
The authors end by saying the “research demonstrates the potential of the public health frame to inspire hope in the context of the climate change discussion while demonstrating the possibility that certain frames may be poorly received within some interpretive communities. More research is needed to understand how frames both set the context for perception on the issue and interact with emotions in guiding public decisions and behavior.”
It’s a good idea to print this study out and to read it carefully. In my view it’s a playbook for one of the next rounds of the manipulative mind games they intend to play on the public.
The study was supported by a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Investigator Award and by the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment.

"Environmental activists Extinction Rebellion have turned their fire on the advertising industry in a public letter, encouraging it to use its expertise in manipulating public opinion for good or risk mass public protests against it. Speaking to the Guardian, one of the authors of the letter, which was written by Extinction Rebellion members with decades of experience of the advertising industry, said the group was not “singling out advertising, as we previously disrupted fashion week and are systematically challenging all industries who have the platform, influence and skills to tackle this epoch-defining crisis but are failing to do so in any meaningful way”.  “Though our letter is addressed to the boardroom, we ask everyone within the industry to ‘Tell the Truth’ about the climate and ecological emergency,” he continued. “This is the first of Extinction Rebellion’s demands, to business and governments; the vital step required to wake everyone up and drive action to deal with this crisis. “Advertising has helped promote high-carbon lifestyles and hyper-consumption. However, if we’re to survive, this must change rapidly.” In particular, “as mediators between the public and brands, the advertising industry is uniquely capable of driving rapid behaviour change across society, around the world and should take the lead rather than be driven. This isn’t a hippy pipe dream. “Advertising will increasingly be seen alongside oil and logging as obviously toxic industries and those with the job title ‘creatives’ will soon find themselves rebranded as ‘destroyers’.” In the letter which was released on Friday, the group addresses itself to “founders, CEOs, CCOs, CMOs, CFOs, MDs and CDs of the advertising industry”, playfully chiding them: “You didn’t think we’d forget about you?” Addressing industry executives, it reads: “What can I do, you’re thinking, I’m just the founder/CEO/CMO/CCO/CFO/MD/CD of a global advertising agency.” The letter continues: “The answer is: you can do anything you want and you can shift mass behaviour in a heartbeat. One of the reasons we’ve got here is because you’ve been selling things to people that they don’t need.” It ridicules some of the ways that advertising companies currently show their green credentials, saying that “making a small campaign to give up drinking from plastic straws is not going to cut it … neither is doing some pro-bono for an anti-palm oil initiative.” The group demands companies “declare a climate & ecological emergency and act accordingly. Persuade your clients and their audiences to do the same.” It cautions: “If you don’t make this change, consumers will insist you do. Look at the streets of London in the last month. People are beginning to see where the problems lie, and soon they will see you.” A spokesman for the Advertising Association said that “every business knows it has a role to play in tackling issues such as climate change and advertising is a powerful tool to shift behaviour and change the way we do things as a society. “We are seeing challenging advertising emerging on climate change – the recent Ovo Energy ‘Get Mad’ campaign being a prominent example. “Responding to climate change is already on many advertisers’ and agencies’ minds in every aspect of their businesses so we expect to see many more campaigns tackling this in the months and years ahead.” "
