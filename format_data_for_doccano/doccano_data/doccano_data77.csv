"Theresa May has said the UK will be a global leader in free trade after the vote to leave the European Union, as she headed to Hangzhou in eastern China for the G20 summit on Saturday.  May also declared it a “golden era” for UK-China relations despite the impending row with Beijing over the delayed decision on the Hinkley Point C power station. She suggested she wants to use her first major global summit to prove the UK remains dependable in the wake of the June referendum result.   Speaking at Heathrow before boarding an RAF plane, May said: “The message for the G20 is that Britain is open for business. As a bold, confident, outward-looking country we will be playing a key role on the world stage.” The prime minister will have a meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on Monday, after the two-day summit. “This is a golden era for UK-China relations and one of the things I will be doing at the G20 is obviously talking to President Xi about how we can develop the strategic partnership that we have between the UK and China,” May said. “But I will also be talking to other world leaders about how we can develop free trade around the world, and Britain wants to seize those opportunities. My ambition is that Britain will be a global leader in free trade.”  May is due to hold talks with leaders including Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin and Narendra Modi.  But despite a face-to-face meeting with Xi, she is not expected to make an announcement on the Hinkley Point C project, which is backed by Beijing’s state-owned nuclear firm. Although a decision on whether the project in Somerset will go ahead is expected this month, UK officials indicated it would not be announced on Monday – fuelling speculation the plan would be scrapped or significantly altered.  “We have set out the government’s approach to Hinkley. We are currently considering all the component parts of that,” a UK source told the Press Association. “We have said we will make a decision this month – that remains the plan. I don’t expect one in the next few days and I don’t expect our Chinese or French partners are expecting one in the next few days.”  The French energy company EDF, with support from China General Nuclear, had expected to build the £18bn plant, but in a surprise move May’s administration delayed a final decision on the project amid reports of security concerns about Beijing’s involvement and the high cost of energy from the power station. The former security minister Pauline Neville-Jones said on Saturday that reassurances were needed from China before a decision could be made. “The issue, I think, is much more day-to-day security implications of having an investor of that kind who isn’t an ally – not an enemy – but isn’t an ally in the way most investment hitherto in to this country has been from the west,” she told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. Any final decision on Hinkley Point is expected to have major diplomatic implications for relations between the UK, France and China.  May’s talks with Obama follow his warning that the UK would be at “the back of the queue” for a trade deal if it voted to leave the EU. But amid reports that the planned US-EU trade deal TTIP has stalled, the UK hopes for talks on a transatlantic agreement of its own with Washington.  During Sunday’s summit May is also reported to want to push for action on tackling terrorism, including stopping the flow of money and foreign fighters to extremist groups such as Islamic State. She will press for action to make sure that Isis fighters are not able to find new safe havens in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa once they are forced out of strongholds."
"Stephen Conroy has named factional powerbrokers Don Farrell, Richard Marles and David Feeney as those who “have got Bill Shorten’s back” after his resignation as the senator apologised for catching colleagues by surprise. In an interview on Sky News on Tuesday Conroy defended his policy legacy in media reform.  Conroy resigned from the Senate on Thursday evening, tabling a speech explaining that he did so for family reasons. When the news broke on Friday it caught the acting Labor leader, Tanya Plibersek, by surprise mid-press conference. On Sky on Tuesday, Conroy said he had “apologised profusely” to Plibersek. “I have to say I am embarrassed about poor Tanya –she’s a very dear friend of mine and I did embarrass her,” he said. Conroy explained that the other senior figure in the Labor left, Anthony Albanese, knew of his resignation because he had told him during a conversation about Labor’s national executive and the appointment of its next secretary. He said he had informed Shorten by text message because the Labor leader was in Canada at the time. Conroy said he hadn’t known Plibersek was holding a press conference but hetook “full responsibility”. Asked whether his resignation could weaken Shorten’s leadership, he said: “There are a whole range of people that have got Bill Shorten’s back. “Don Farrell is a passionate Bill Shorten supporter and has been for a long period of time … And Richard Marles will be working within the Victorian group along with David Feeney and a whole group of other people.” Farrell is in the box seat to replace Conroy as deputy Senate leader despite his history of tension with Labor’s current Senate leader, Penny Wong. Reflecting on his policy legacy, Conroy conceded he had “made some mistakes along the way” but trusted his impact was on the whole positive. He defended failed media law reforms, rejecting the characterisation that Labor had attacked free speech when it proposed the creation of public interest media advocate to oversee media mergers and the Press Council. “I still believe that Press Council is a fairly irrelevant organisation,” he said. “It has improved but due to the pressure that there could be some regulatory reform.” Asked whether he was or had ever been a global warming sceptic, Conroy replied: “I’ve always said publicly that I think humans are affecting the temperature and there’s a big scientific debate about how much – that’s always been part of the debate.” Reflecting on advice he would give a young person considering entering politics, he said: “I’m not sure I could put my hand on my heart and say go for it – because it’s a pretty tough, fierce media environment. “That’s a little sad. Being in politics is a noble profession. You can make a difference – I’d like to think I made a difference. “It is getting harder and harder, with the rise of right and leftwing extremists and the demands of the media cycle – even when there’s not much happening you’ve got to make it sound like something’s happening.”"

"Many small developing countries are so administratively stretched that they cannot fill in all the complex forms needed to access climate money to help them to reduce emissions and adapt to increasing global temperatures, rising sea levels and extreme weather. Although billions of dollars of climate money is theoretically available, in practice red tape and paperwork makes it is extremely hard and slow to get hold of, says the Commonwealth Secretariat, the central institution of the 53 Commonwealth countries, who are among the hardest hit by climate change.  Fiji’s high commissioner in London, Jitoko Tikolevu, said the process of applying for climate funds was “very cumbersome”. “We need to be trained how to access the money. It’s one thing having it available, it’s another getting access to it.  “We have many climate adaptation projects identified, to move villages and other settlements, but they depend on getting climate money. We know what we need to do, but to do it we need to understand the process,” he said. Rich countries together pledged to mobilise $100bn (£77bn) a year by 2020 in last year’s Paris climate talks. But, according to new analysis by the Commonwealth Secretariat, since 2009 only $726m has been received by the smallest 31 small Commonwealth states, including Dominica, Guyana, Namibia, Nauru, Solomon Islands, St Kitts and Nevis, Tonga and Vanuatu. Low institutional capacity, convoluted forms, and a complex and slow approval process all but denies small countries, says the secretariat, which is to pay for experts to work with small Commonwealth countries to help them access money.  The secretariat will on Wednesday launch in Mauritius a central “hub” offering small Commonwealth countries advice and technical assistance. In addition, advisers will work in ministries to help them identify and apply for money. “Donors are at last creating climate funds, but too often they are tied up in red tape and [are] tremendously complicated to access, especially for small countries with limited capacity. The money isn’t getting to those who need it nearly fast enough. This Commonwealth initiative will make the difference in unlocking much needed capital for adaption and mitigation,” said the Commonwealth secretary general, Patricia Scotland. “There are a lot of finance mechanisms which have sprouted up over the years but the issue is accessibility, particularly for small countries like ours with small administrations,” said Makurita Baaro, Kiribati’s ambassador to the UN. “In a lot of cases, whether the submission is for a $100m project or a $20,000 project, the paperwork is still the same, and that needs to change. It doesn’t make sense at all. “Multilateral funds for climate change mitigation or adaption measures can be costly and cumbersome to access, meaning many small islands states are put off by the enormity of the task.” Money is theoretically available from the Green Climate Fund, the Adaptation Fund and climate investment funds, as well as private sector finance. The Green climate fund (GCF), which is based in South Korea and will become the world’s main channel for climate finance, has been pledged about $10bn so far by rich countries, but has only approved investments of about $424m in 17 projects (pdf) since November 2015.  It has an “aspirational goal” to commit $2.5bn this year, which many observers say it is unlikely to meet.  The first countries expected to receive assistance from the hub are: Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Guyana, Jamaica, Mauritius, Namibia, Nauru, Solomon Islands, St Kitts and Nevis, Tonga and Vanuatu."
"It’s been three years since we’ve had new material from Sting – and while many would like to think his time has been spent crossed-legged in a Goan yoga retreat, the reality is quite the opposite. Sort of. According to a new interview with the singer, the songwriting featured on his 12th album – named 57th & 9th, after the intersection in New York he travelled through on his way to the studio – revolves around world events he absorbed during his time out, such as the deaths of David Bowie and Prince, and the mounting catastrophe of climate change.  “If you sit at home, you get anxious, but that anxiety is a sort of engine for you. It makes you think, “OK, what am I going to do?” The first single [I Can’t Stop Thinking About You] is about looking at a blank sheet of paper and seeing what looks like a field of snow, with no clues as to what’s underneath,” the star told Entertainment Weekly.  On one song, 50,000, he sings about the deaths of rock stars, inspired by the passing of Motörhead’s Lemmy, David Bowie and Prince, as well as his friend the actor Alan Rickman, in quick succession. ‘It was a strange time because you think that these people are immortal, but then suddenly they’re like the rest of us, they die. It intrigues me that great success is this brilliant light, but also every brilliant light creates a dark shadow. I think wisdom only comes when you can navigate both. I’m getting philosophical.” On One Fine Day, meanwhile, Sting addresses global warming sceptics. “I pray that climate sceptics are right. I’d like the scientists to be wrong! But I think it’s happening. This is my ironic take on that whole thing.” 57th and 9th is out on 11 November, and follows the 2013 concept album The Last Ship, which featured artists with connections to north-east England, including Brian Johnson from AC/DC, Jimmy Nail and the Unthanks. A tribute to the closed yards in the shipbuilding town of Wallsend, where Sting grew up, it was made into a musical on Broadway, which closed three months after launching. In an email quoted in the New York Times, its producers Jeffrey Seller and Kathryn Schenker acknowledged: “We have been bewildered and saddened by our inability to sustain an audience for this musical that we deeply love.”"
"The Australian Conservation Foundation has renewed its legal challenge to Adani’s Carmichael mine, appealing against a federal court ruling that endorsed its approval by the commonwealth. The ACF on Monday lodged an appeal against last month’s decision, which found the then federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, was entitled to find the impact on global warming and the Great Barrier Reef from the Queensland mine’s 4.6bn tonnes of carbon emissions “speculative”. The president of the ACF, Geoff Cousins, said Australia’s national environment protection laws were “broken” if the minister could approve “a mega-polluting coalmine – the biggest in Australia’s history – and claim it will have no impact on the global warming and the reef”. “If our environment laws are too weak to actually protect Australia’s unique species and places, they effectively give companies like Adani a licence to kill,” Cousins said. “Be in no doubt, Adani’s Carmichael proposal is massive and will lock in decades of damaging climate pollution if it goes ahead, further wrecking the reef. “The science is clear that we can have coal or the reef – but we can’t have both.” The Queensland Resources Council applauded the court’s rejection of the original ACF challenge, saying it was a “nonsense case” akin to holding the Saudi Arabian government responsible for emissions from Australian cars running on their oil. The ACF argued Hunt had made an “error of law” by not factoring in the impact of overseas “combustion” of the coal over the 60-year life of the mine. Hunt had found it was “not possible to draw robust conclusions on the likely contribution of the project to a specific increase in global temperature”. It was therefore “difficult to identify the necessary relationship between the taking of the action and any possible impacts on relevant matters of national environmental significance”. Justice John Griffiths ruled it was “plain that the minister did give consideration to greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the combustion emissions and made an express finding that the proposed action would not have an unacceptable impact on the world heritage values of the reef”. Cousins said Griffiths had acknowledged “considerable public interest” in the case and ACF was “in no doubt that we represent the concerns of the majority of Australians”. He referred to a ReachTel survey of 2,600 Australians around the same time as the federal court ruling showing 81% backed stronger national environment laws and 75% backed environment groups’ right to bring legal challenges to mining projects. “And 75% support environment groups’ right to use legal avenues to uphold existing environmental laws. “It comes down to this. The planet-warming pollution from Adani’s coalmine threatens the reef and all living things. The [ACF] does not accept this future – and we will take all reasonable steps we can to stop this mine.” The ACF awaits a hearing date."

"        Scientists working on a Nasa-led project are scanning large swathes of the Great Barrier Reef as part of the biggest assessment of the world’s coral reefs ever undertaken. The US$15m three-year coral reef airborne laboratory mission promises to solve outstanding mysteries of what drives coral reef health and provide reef managers with better information about how to protect them. Reefs around the world are still reeling from the worst global bleaching event in recorded history. On the Great Barrier Reef almost a quarter of the coral was lost, mainly in the remote northern sections. Using a Nasa plane decked-out with a cutting-edge image sensor, Eric Hochberg from the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences and colleagues will examine how much of the area is covered by coral, sand and algae, then repeat the survey at three other locations around the world. The state-of-the-art image sensor, called the portable remote imaging spectrometer (Prism) was developed by Nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory and is able to capture data across the ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared spectrums, at a level of detail similar to what can be captured from a boat. From 8.5km above the water, the scientists will be able to see what is happening on reefs at a huge new scale, which would produce a “step change” in how we understand the factors influencing the health of reefs, Hochberg told Guardian Australia. “Our current surveys, even though we’re doing our very best, it’s easy to miss things,” he said. “You look at a point here and a point there but what’s in between? What we’re after is to get the complete picture.” Hochberg said pollution was known to hurt coral reefs but researchers had had trouble pinning down the connection. He said part of the impetus for the new survey came from an analysis he had done of reef health and human impacts, which could not find a clear link. “That’s part of what convinced Nasa to support this project,” he said. Hochberg said by studying vast sections of reefs at once the team would be able to compare a lot of different areas without missing sections. Part of the research has involved developing an algorithm that lets scientists using the image sensor see through the water as if it wasn’t there. Tim Malthus from the CSIRO has been working on it for 10 years. “If you want to see the corals, the intervening water is an influence, and we’ve been developing algorithms to remove the influence of that water,” Malthus told Guardian Australia. The planes will fly through six regions of the reef, stretching from Heron Island near the southern end all the way to the Torres Strait. The team has already completed survey flights over Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii as a test and will fly over the Great Barrier Reef by the end of October. After that they will survey the main Hawaiian islands, Marianas islands and Palau.  The biggest promise the work holds out is in its future applications on satellites, Hochberg said. A better way to understand reef health than a snapshot is to see how they change over time. Several groups plan to launch satellites with sensors that could produce this type of data. The Japanese space agency Jaxa is planning to launch HISUI in 2018 and the German Aerospace Laboratory is due to launch EnMap in 2019. Nasa is considering one called HyspIRI, which is still in the conceptual stage. According to Malthus, that will change the way coral reefs are studied. “This is really a precursor for the next generation of satellites that will be in space,” he said. “It allows us to prepare and explore new algorithms for when these types of sensors are routinely operated in space.”"
"After lab-grown meat, get ready for animal-free cow’s milk. A San-Francisco startup believes it has found a solution for the guilty conscience of consumers who love eating dairy ice-cream, cheese and yoghurt, but oppose factory-style farming and its environmental footprint. Through a combination of yeast, cow DNA and plant nutrients, Perfect Day claims to have created a product identical in taste and nutritional value to cow’s milk, but without any udders involved.  Sales of milk alternatives such as soy, coconut, almond and more recently pea milk are expected to be worth more than $10bn by 2019. But until now they have not cut traditional milk and dairy production. “The alternatives for yoghurt, cheese and ice-cream are so bad that people don’t even want to try them,” says Perfect Day co-founder Ryan Pandya. “Many have been switching to more plant-based diets but when you have to give up cheese you think ‘oh my god my life sucks I love pizza’. If you try to make cheese out of pea milk you will be sorely disappointed.” The missing ingredient in plant-based alternatives is milk protein. To make the animal-free cow’s milk, Perfect Day insert cow DNA – which is readily available thanks to decades of research by the dairy industry – into yeast and add sugar to create milk proteins through fermentation. These milk proteins are then combined with sugar, fats and nutrients to create the final product. “We’re taking plant nutrients and transforming them into animals proteins the same way that cows do, using the same milk proteins as found in cow’s milk, but much more efficiently, because we’re using a yeast cell not a 2,000lb animal,” said Pandya. Although comparisons have been made with lab-grown meat, Pandya said they are not using novel technology. “Many people initially go ‘oh is this like lab or test-tube milk’, but that’s wrong. There are no test tubes in our fermentation process it’s just like brewing craft beer. The meat folks are trying to invent technology that doesn’t exist today, but our milk is made through techniques in use for more than three decades.” While there is no sign yet of a commercial lab-grown meat product, Perfect Day said it plans to launch a cheese, yoghurt or ice-cream product by the end of 2017, with milk following later. It will be priced similar to organic dairy, but the company expects to quickly have a lower cost of production than milk. The startup has already raised $4m from investors and been in talks, perhaps surprisingly, with a number of traditional dairy companies. “The assumption was that we’d be hated by the dairy industry but it’s actually the opposite. They see us as the long-term solution to problems they didn’t even know were solvable,” said Pandya. Those problems include water pollution and climate change. The world’s quarter of a billion dairy cows are responsible for just under 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. A study commissioned by Perfect Day found its animal-free milk uses approximately 24­-84% lower energy use, 98% lower water use, 77-­91% lower land use, and 35­-65% lower emissions. Rather than bringing to an end traditional dairy farming, Pandya expects their milk product to help negate the need for ever more intensive dairy farm systems. “We’re here to create another option for people. There is more and more demand for dairy and that is causing increasing factory farming. Everyone agrees we should do less of that and that’s something we’ll actually be able to do.” However, it seems unlikely they will be able to call their new product cow or dairy milk.  A spokesperson for the US Food and Drug Administration said a product labelled as dairy milk needed to involve the “complete milking of one or more healthy cows”. If a food does not meet these standards then it must be labelled “with a common or usual name or an appropriately descriptive term, and the labelling must be truthful and not misleading”."

"It is less than a week since the International Geological Conference declared that we should recognise that we entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, in around 1950. The changes that we have made to the planet are now irreversible and their effects will continue for millennia to come. None the less, this may prove to be the shortest of all geological epochs, since there is no guarantee that humans, who made it, will survive the results of their own activity. Not for the last 2.5bn years or so, since the cyanobacteria filled the earth’s atmosphere with free oxygen, poisonous to almost every other form of life at the time, has any one species had such an effect on the environment as we have done. But we are not bacteria. We are the only species capable of reflecting on our impact. We have moral agency. We can foresee the likely consequences of our actions, consider them, and then make choices. In relation to the environment, these choices have frequently been wrong and show little sign of being right in time to save us from very large and damaging climate change.  The problem is a classic one of game theory and it is one that liberal democracies are ill-fitted to handle. Trust and co-operation would lead to the best result for everyone, but each player or nation state will benefit more in the short term from a policy of selfishness and treachery. The shortness of electoral cycles in the rich world means that almost all governments need economic growth today, whatever the cost to be repaid with cruel interest in the future. That will be someone else’s problem, just as the effects of climate change now appear to be someone else’s problem, until these other people start fleeing war, starvation and disease and turn up at the edges of the richer world. Climate change is a global problem, and it can only be countered by some kind of global consciousness and a sense of the common good that embraces the whole of humanity. This is where the efforts of the world religions become important. Edmund Leach, the great British anthropologist, said in his Reith lecture in 1967: “Men have become like gods… Science offers us total mastery over our environment and over our destiny.” But this confidence looks hollow today. Even if “science” were offering us this total mastery – and phenomena like antibiotic resistance suggest that it is not – Leach assumed a world in which scientists were authorities acknowledged above all political squabbling. The rise of climate change denialism shows just how wrong he was to do so. Perhaps, then, we need the help of people who are clear about the distinction between humans and gods. Enter Pope Francis, who has swung the weight of his papacy behind the environmental movement in an unprecedented way. He is not alone. All of the organised world religions now have a strong environmental consciousness. All of them are affected. To be a world religion is by definition to have adherents among both the unimaginably poor and the unimaginably wealthy. However, Pope Francis has devoted considerable effort and political capital to the attempt to construct a coherent theory that can show how damage to our environment also harms us, and not just our hypothetical descendants. This really matters. Self-interest will only work to the common benefit if it is understood that we ourselves are mutually dependent creatures who harm ourselves when we harm one another. As the pope puts it: “Human beings are deeply connected with all of creation. When we mistreat nature we also mistreat human beings.” The difficulty is to link such sentiments with practical action, and this is what his latest initiative imaginatively suggests. Care for the environment is henceforth to be considered by faithful Catholics as a “work of mercy” – what the outside world would call a charitable act. They are called to “a grateful contemplation of God’s world” as a spiritual discipline, but also to the kind of small, slightly inconvenient gestures like recycling, using public transport, or even just turning off unneeded lights, which by themselves are almost meaningless, but when practised by billions of people make a real and very necessary change. All of these, he says, are to be understood as “simple daily gestures which break with the logic of violence, exploitation and selfishness”; and while the world undoubtedly needs huge and dramatic actions to break the cycle of exploitation and climate change, it also needs ordinary people to play their part with just such simple acts."

"Brexit has happened before – around 7,500 years ago, when Britain was severed from mainland Europe by rising sea levels. That separation from Europe also happened at a time of higher temperatures, melting glaciers and rising sea levels. And even though climate change then was entirely natural, driven by the Earth’s orbit around the sun, it still carries a warning in the changing climate of the 21st century. At the end of the last ice age, Britain was a peninsula of northwest Europe, connected by a vast plain called Doggerland. This fertile land was larger than the current UK, covered in rivers and lakes, with plenty of fish, birds and other animals and a place where stone age people thrived.   But as the huge ice sheets thawed, sea levels rose and flooded Doggerland until it eventually vanished.  Today Doggerland is our Atlantis, a drowned landscape under the North Sea only visible from seismic surveys of the seabed and occasional finds of ancient tree stumps, the remains of ancient animals, stone age tools and human bones. This story is more than just a mere curiosity, though. The people of Doggerland must have suffered as their land vanished, especially during occasional catastrophic floods. But the survivors would have adapted and moved to dry land.  Today’s climate warming is entirely unnatural, from manmade pollution, but sea level rises over the next century are expected at a similar rate to those that sank Doggerland. One big difference, though, is that today’s populations are vastly larger and nothing like as mobile as the stone age people, and so it’s very uncertain how we will adapt to the encroaching sea.   "

"Hillary Clinton has dropped the words “climate change” from most of her public addresses since winning the endorsement of her party rival Bernie Sanders, according to Climate Home analysis. While the presidential candidate talks regularly about her plan for the US to become a “clean energy superpower”, in recent months she has rarely made reference to the planetary crisis that necessitates it. On Monday, when she launched her pitch to millennials online, she could find no room for an issue that will affect that voting cohort more than any other. The rhetorical shift undermines hopes that climate change might emerge as a key campaign issue in 2016. Boosted by the disparity between Clinton and her Republican opponent Donald Trump, a self-professed non-believer in climate change. Indeed, the signs were there. During the last six months of Clinton’s primary campaign against Sanders, the transcript log of her speeches shows she was talking about climate change at one out of every two speeches she gave. But since Sanders endorsed Clinton on July 12, the full focus of the Clinton campaign has swung to Trump. In 38 speeches since that date, Clinton mentioned climate change specifically eight times. Just once every five public addresses. “As Bernie reminds us so powerfully, we owe it to future generations to work together to combat climate change,” said Clinton as she accepted Sanders’ endorsement.  Without action on climate change, the average 21-year-old college graduate in the class of 2015 will lose over $126,000 in lifetime income. The overwhelming priority for progressive Americans is to avoid a Trump presidency. This has necessitated a change in tone, said Prof Robert Stavins, director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program. “The Clinton campaign needs to target its messages to independent, undecided voters at this point. Speaking to her own constituency on the left would not be a productive use of her time and effort.” Research from Yale released in July indicates that even during the hottest year ever recorded, only the 17% of voters who describe themselves as “alarmed” about climate change rank it as a top tier election issue. Meanwhile, Trump has framed Clinton’s climate change response as a “poverty-expansion agenda”. The economy ranks in the top two defining policy areas for all other voters. The Democratic primary season was altogether different. Clinton, the overwhelming favourite for the nomination, was ambushed on the left by her socialist rival. To tackle climate change, Sanders had promised to declare legislative war on fossil fuel companies. For her part, Clinton announced a plan to increase US solar capacity seven-fold by 2020. In the spring, she rolled out a wider platform on environmental justice and protection. After a sometimes antagonistic campaign, Sanders and Clinton appeared together in New Hampshire and Sanders offered her his endorsement. Speaking to a crowd that contained some vocal and disaffected Sanders supporters, Clinton accepted her opponent had done much to frame climate change as a battle for justice. “As Bernie reminds us so powerfully, we owe it to future generations to work together to combat climate change,” she said. In the days before the endorsement, Sanders’ team had worked to extract every concession possible from Clinton in the text for the Democratic Party platform. The resulting draft was “the most aggressive plan to combat climate change in the history of the Democratic Party”,according to his policy director Warren Gunnels. “But we are not finished. We have got to follow through on the promise of this agreement.” The most notable insertion was a call for a price on carbon, which Clinton has never publicly backed. “It’s not her plan,” her energy policy advisor Trevor Houser told AP. David Axelrod, a former senior political adviser to president Barack Obama, told the New York Times he would advise Clinton to avoid playing into Trump’s hands on the issue of carbon pricing. “If I’m in her campaign, I don’t want to hand a cudgel to the other side,” he said. Making the wrong choice on climate change would be a disaster for our kids and grandkids. pic.twitter.com/dhc0OABqml Climate coyness was a feature of Obama’s first term (when Axelrod was at the White House). According to analysis of speeches from 2008 to 2011, climate change was hardly mentioned even as Obama began to ramp up funding for climate-related projects. “He was doing more than he was talking about because he was going incognito to avoid attacks from the Republicans,” said Timmons Roberts, Ittleson professor of environmental studies at Brown University, who conducted the analysis. Obama has since emerged as something of a climate warrior, but even in the election campaign for his second term he barely spoke about climate change, said Roberts. “I think he’s careful to not whack the hornets nest of the ideological and fossil fuel interests on the right.” John Podesta was the silent architect of Obama’s climate policy. He is now Clinton’s campaign chair. A spokesman for the Clinton campaign told Climate Home: “Hillary Clinton believes climate change is an urgent threat and a defining challenge of our time. That’s why she’s been discussing her bold and ambitious plan to transform US energy and combat the harms of climate change throughout this campaign.” “The most important data point is that Hillary Clinton is running on the strongest clean energy and climate platform of any candidate in history and Donald Trump is running on the absolute worst,” said Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune. “We’re always eager to see this difference talked about more… because more conversation makes it more clear just how obvious the choice for climate voters is this election.” Nevertheless, Clinton’s realpolitik has left some Sanders supporters worried about how she will represent their issues as president. Roberts, an avowed feeler-of-the-Bern, said: “It’s not a core issue for her, it’s an add-on. I think her positions have really been lacking an understanding of the depth and breadth of the transformation that’s necessary. Her position has always been that we can build 500 million solar panels, but she never really addresses actively shutting down the fossil fuel side.” On carbon pricing and fracking he believed Clinton had failed to take the stance necessitated by the climate crisis. “In fact there is a big haemorrhage of her supporters over to Jill Stein of the Green Party and she’s got to win those people back,” he said. Climate Home searched for the words “climate change” in all speech transcripts published on the Clinton campaign website between the beginning of 2016 and early-September. Results can be accessed here. The majority of recent mentions were jabs at Trump’s climate scepticism. On 30 July in Johnstown, Pennsylvania she lampooned him for applying for help to protect a golf course from climate change whilst “he dismisses it as a Chinese hoax”. Throughout the year there is a clear regional trend, with Clinton restricting herself to mentioning climate change only in the north east, California and on one trip to Florida. A search for the word “environment” reveals just how little weight Clinton’s campaign considers broader environmental issues to have with voters. In the 78 speeches for which Clinton’s campaign have logged transcripts in 2016, she mentions the word in just four. “Hillary Clinton’s silence on the issue of the depth of the ecological crisis is deafening,” Greens presidential candidate Jill Stein, who had a warrant issued for her arrest after participating in a protest against the Dakota Access pipeline, told Climate Home. “While she makes the occasional passing nod to the environment, I have made it the very cornerstone of my entire campaign.” Note: The article was amended to clarify it was Clinton’s online pitch to millennials that does not mention climate change, not her speech on Monday, which did."

" The destructive power of the typhoons that wreak havoc across China, Japan, Korea and the Philippines has intensified by 50% in the past 40 years due to warming seas, a new study has found. The researchers warn that global warming will lead the giant storms to become even stronger in the future, threatening the large and growing coastal populations of those nations. “It is a very, very substantial increase,” said Prof Wei Mei, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who led the new work. “We believe the results are very important for east Asian countries because of the huge populations in these areas. People should be aware of the increase in typhoon intensity because when they make landfall these can cause much more damage.” Typhoons can have devastating impacts in east Asia. In 2013, typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines, killing at least 6,300 people and affecting 11 million. Typhoon Nina struck China in 1975, dumping 100cm of rain in a day and leading to 229,000 deaths and 6m destroyed buildings. Last week typhoon Lionrock left 11 people dead in northern Japan and caused power blackouts and property damage, while in July typhoon Nepartak hit Taiwan and China, killing at least nine people and leaving a trail of destruction. In the new research, published in Nature Geoscience, the scientists took data collected independently by centres in Japan and Hawaii and, after accounting for differences in the way it had been collected, showed that typhoons in the north-west Pacific had intensified by 12–15% on average since 1977. The proportion of the most violent storms - categories 4 and 5 - doubled and even tripled in some regions over that time and the intensification was most marked for those storms which hit land. The intensity of a typhoon is measured by the maximum sustained wind speed, but the damage caused by its high winds, storm surges, intense rains and floods increases disproportionately, meaning a 15% rise in intensity leads to a 50% rise in destructive power. The researchers showed that the intensification of typhoons making landfall occurred because warmer coastal seas provided more energy to growing storms, enabling their wind speeds to increase more rapidly. Scientists are not yet able to determine whether manmade climate change or natural cycles are to blame for the warming seas in the region because 40 years is a relatively short time span for such phenomena. But Wei is clear that the future global warming, as projected by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, would heat the oceans in the region and lead to even more intense typhoons. Mei said: “We want to give the message that typhoon intensity has increased and will increase in the future because of the warming climate.” He said action was needed to both prepare for future typhoons and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to curb warming: “Understanding intensity change is very important for disaster preparation.” Prof Kerry Emanuel, an expert on tropical cyclones at MIT and not involved in the new research said: “The results leave little doubt that there are more high intensity events affecting south-east Asia and China, and these are also intensifying more rapidly.” “This is significant for these nations because what matters, in the end, is landfall size and intensity,” he said. “Stronger storms cause higher storm surges, which often cause the most destruction and loss of life.” Previous work by Emanuel showed tropical cyclones are likely to become more frequent and stronger if climate change is not curbed."

"The Paris climate agreement is on the brink of coming into force after 31 nations officially joined the landmark accord, with the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, predicting it will be fully ratified by the end of the year. On Wednesday, 31 countries formally signed up to the Paris deal at the UN general assembly in New York. They include Brazil, the world’s seventh largest emitter of greenhouse gases, Mexico, Argentina and Sri Lanka. Oil-rich United Arab Emirates also ratified the deal, as did nations considered particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, such as Kiribati and Bangladesh.  The pledges mean that a total of 60 countries, representing 47.7% of global emissions, have now formally joined the Paris agreement. The deal aims to limit the global temperature rise to 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration of keeping it to 1.5C.  A total of 55 nations representing at least 55% of global emissions need to sign up for the deal to come into force. The first of these thresholds has now been reached, with Ban and the US secretary of state, John Kerry, both predicting that the agreement will be fully implemented within months. “I’m ever more confident that the Paris agreement will enter into force this year,” Ban said. “I appeal to all leaders to accelerate domestic arrangements to join this year.  “What once seemed impossible now seems inevitable. When this year ends, I hope we can all look back with pride knowing that we seized the opportunity to protect our common home.” Video messages from Germany, France, the EU, Canada, Australia and South Korea among others all promised to ratify the Paris accord in the coming months. Should these promises be fulfilled, the agreement will pass the second threshold and come into force. Australia, one of the largest per capita emitters, will make its “best endeavours to ratify” in 2016, said the country’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. Barbara Hendricks, the German environment minister, said her country planned to ratify the deal “well ahead” of the next UN climate meeting in Marrakesh in November. The UK has made a similar commitment. Kerry said it was an “exciting moment” but warned that the threat posed by climate change grows every day. “The problem we continue to confront is growing,” he said. “Each day the planet is on this course, it becomes more dangerous.  “If anyone doubted the science, all they have to do is watch, sense, feel what is happening in the world today. High temperatures are already having consequences, people are dying in the heat, people lack water, we already have climate refugees.” Kerry added that international climate negotiations have been a “long and frustrating path” since 1992 but that the Paris deal means that they are “finally becoming a story that we are proud to tell our grandchildren and future generations”. The UN climate change chief, Patricia Espinosa, said: “This is an extraordinary momentum by nations and a clear signal of their determination to implement Paris now and raise ambition over the decades to come.” A total of 195 nations put their name to the Paris deal and submitted promises to curb their greenhouse gas emissions. Several analyses have cast doubt over whether the pledged emissions cuts will be sufficient to prevent a 2C temperature increase, with concerns exacerbated by record-breaking heat experienced over the course of 2016  The warmest August on record was recorded last month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirmed on Tuesday. The US government agency said last month was the 16th month in a row where temperature records were broken, with July being the single warmest month since modern record keeping began in 1880.  The soaring heat, which has retained much of its intensity despite the end of the El Niño climatic event, is unprecedented in at least 1,000 years and probably much longer, scientists have said. But climate campaigners have said that the speed of the Paris deal ratification raises hopes that the world is finally swinging behind efforts to reduce emissions and prevent the worst ravages of a warming planet.  “The global community is rallying behind swift and ambitious action to combat climate change,” said Paula Caballero, global director of the World Resources Institute’s climate program.  “The fact that the Paris agreement will likely enter into force this year took everyone by surprise. This rapid pace reflects a spirit of cooperation rarely seen on a global scale.   “Today we pause and celebrate the important progress towards bringing the Paris agreement into force. Then we again pick up our shovels and continue the hard work of creating a safer and more prosperous planet.”"
"A far-reaching global trade deal being negotiated in secret could threaten the goals of the Paris climate deal by making it harder for governments to favour clean energy over fossil fuels, a leak of the latest negotiating text shows. The controversial Trade in Services Agreement (Tisa) aims to liberalise trade between the EU and 22 countries across the global services sector, which employs tens of millions in Europe alone.  But a new EU text seen by the Guardian would oblige signatories to work towards “energy neutrality” between renewable energy and fossil fuel power, although amendments proposed by the EU would exempt nuclear power from this rule. The document, marked “limited distribution – for Tisa participants only”, would also force member states to legislate against “anti-competitive conduct” and “market distortions” in energy-related services. This is viewed by campaigners as code for state support for clean power sectors, such as wind and solar.  A right to regulate is explicitly mentioned in the paper, but governments would first have to prove the necessity for regulations that legally constrain multinationals.  The same clause was used in the World Trade Organisation’s Gatt and Gats treaties which entered into force in 1995, and led to 44 complaints by multinationals via their governments. Of these, 43 were upheld. Susan Cohen Jehoram, a spokeswoman for Greenpeace, told the Guardian: “We fear the same thing will happen with Tisa but on a much larger scale, when legislation is proposed to keep temperature rises to 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels, as agreed at the Paris climate summit]. “If we want to reach that target, governments will need a toolbox of measures that can give incentives to cleaner energy. Tisa, like the proposed TTIP and Ceta trade agreements, would increase the power of multinationals to prevent governments taking desperately needed measures to decrease CO2 levels.”  The Paris climate agreement called for “making finance flows consistent with a pathway to low greenhouse gas emissions” but the deregulatory thrust of the negotiating text, which was obtained by Greenpeace Netherlands, seems to run counter to this.  Its energy annex says that the trade rules will apply to all legislative measures covering power generation services, “whether the energy source is renewable or non-renewable”.  It also contains a “standstill” clause freezing in perpetuity the high watermark of liberalisation in certain sectors, and a “ratchet” clause to stop countries reintroducing trade barriers that had been previously removed. Both mechanisms have been proposed by Australia.  Under their tenets, any government elected on a ticket of reversing the liberalisation of services contained in the treaty would thus be unable to do so, campaigners claim.  The UK’s shadow international trade and energy spokesman, Barry Gardiner, Labour MP, told the Guardian: “Whilst every effort should be made to promote business and trade, this must not be at the expense of the protection and enhancement of workers’ rights, environmental safeguards and the wider interests of the British people.”  While Brexit could prevent the UK from being bound by the planned trade treaty, any agreement allowing access to the EU’s single market would probably oblige it to follow the new rules.  Opposition to the proposed text from Theresa May’s government is thought unlikely. David Davis, the minister for Brexit, recently described the similar Ceta trade agreement with Canada as his preferred model for a trade arrangement with the EU.  Gardiner said: “The British people have voted to come out of the European Union to preserve the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, it cannot be right then that secret trade deals are currently being conducted entirely outside the scrutiny of national parliaments and law-makers.” “The structure of such deals are like a lobster pot – once you have gone through and given power to the commercial interest it is no longer possible to recapture democratic control. What we do hear, through leaks and rumours, are terms which clearly prevent the ongoing capacity of governments to govern in the public interest.”   Before coming into effect though, any finalised Tisa text will most likely need to be approved by all EU member states – which currently includes the UK – and will also require approval from the European parliament.  Earlier this year, MEPs voted to back the deal, on the proviso that public services were excluded and that the deal legally secured the right to regulate at European, national and local authority level.  Parliament’s rapporteur, the former EU justice commisioner, Viviane Reding, has previously said that the assembly will “never consent” to any trade pact that diminished the EU’s right to regulate on climate, health and social laws. Reding refused to comment on the leak but informed sources said that neither she nor the European parliament would consent to provisions which prevented public authorities from supporting renewables. Reding, a conservative politician from Luxembourg, has also called on the Luxembourg government to demand an end to negotiations on the EU-US free trade deal known as TTIP, over the use of controversial secret investor courts, and threats to the environment and food safety.  Unlike TTIP, Tisa deals with the less tangible trade services sector that nonetheless constitutes more than half of the global economy, and could impact on an estimated 1.8 billion people. As well as energy, any Tisa deal will apply to financial services, e-commerce, information and communications technology services, international maritime transport services, computer related services, postal and courier services, and government procurement of services.  A report by the UN conference on trade and development later this week is expected to say that mega-trade deals such as TTIP and Tisa are becoming increasingly politicised, and failing to provide a solution to the slowdown in global growth.

" Scientists and tour operators on the Great Barrier Reef have extended a “non-political” offer to show Leonardo DiCaprio the impacts of coral bleaching, after the Queensland government responded to the actor’s comments on bleaching by inviting him to visit the reef. Dean Miller, a marine biologist and science director of the non-profit group Great Barrier Reef Legacy, said he wanted to say to DiCaprio: “We would like to take you to the Great Barrier Reef and show you firsthand what we see, no political or media spin, just the facts from the scientists themselves to show you what is really happening here.” At the US State Department’s Our Ocean conference in Washington, Leonardo DiCaprio made an impassioned plea for policymakers to save coral reefs by addressing climate change. He highlighted recent bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. “This year, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef suffered what is thought to be the largest bleaching event ever recorded,” he told the meeting, after being introduced by the secretary of state, John Kerry. “Over 600 miles of reef previously teeming with life is devastated. We are seeing this level of impact to coral reefs around the world from Hawaii to the Florida Keys, from Madagascar to Indonesia.” He said what he saw in other reefs around the world took his breath away: “Not a fish in site, colourless, ghost-like coral, a complete graveyard.” In response, Queensland’s deputy premier, Jackie Trad, invited DiCaprio to come and see the reef for himself. “He can come any time he likes, he’s absolutely welcome to come to Australia, to come to Queensland and to come to the Great Barrier Reef,” she said in Brisbane. In response, Great Barrier Reef Legacy – a non-profit organisation of scientists, tourism operators, filmmakers, educators and conservationists – made its own offer. “All of us at the GBR Legacy live and breath the Great Barrier Reef every single day and are seeing firsthand the damage that climate change is doing here,” said Miller, who is also a documentary filmmaker. John Rumney, a veteran tourism operator on the reef and the managing director of GBR Legacy, said he wanted to take DiCaprio out to see the reef’s largest single coral colony – a 1,000 to 2,000-year-old boulder coral he said was called “the monolith”. “If Leonardo can see the current health of the Great Barrier Reef for himself, especially the largest and possibly the oldest coral colony here on the reef, he will be as shocked as we all are,” Rumney said. “Rather than being ushered and controlled by a government agency that has demonstrated it will do anything to put a spin in their favour, the reef needs to be first.” It wasn’t clear how serious the government’s offer to DiCaprio was but GBR Legacy’s offer is backed by Aroona Luxury Charters, which said it would put up $54,000 to fund DiCaprio’s trip. He could dive the reef from its luxury ecotourism boat, said Ross Miller, Aroona’s captain and manager. “If Leonardo can assist in any way, then we would be honoured to take him to the reef on a week-long expedition into the northern and more remote sections to show him why the reef is so special to us all, and why we need act now,” Ross Miller said. He said the boat could offer a more remote and adventurous tour than others that were available. The Great Barrier Reef was hit hard by the global coral bleaching event this year. With a strong El Niño adding to global warming, reefs around the world turned white and died. On the Great Barrier Reef, 93% of reefs were affected by bleaching and almost a quarter of the coral is thought to have died. GBR Legacy is hoping to soon launch the first “independent” privately funded research vessel on the reef, which would offer free space to scientists, students and media, Dean Miller said.  “We are opening our arms and our doors to anyone on the planet that can help us overcome the great barriers to save our reefs and Leonardo DiCaprio is most certainly someone who can help us make significant and positive changes for the future health of the Great barrier Reef.” Postscript: After this article was first published, Indigenous traditional land owners in north Queensland, the Yidindji nation, also extended an invite to DiCaprio. Yidindji foreign minister, Murrumu Walubara Yidindji, said on Twitter that his government was “more than happy” to give DiCaprio “a unique perspective” on the Great Barrier Reef."
"Fires have returned once again to the forests and peatlands of Riau province on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The annual environmental disaster devastates millions of hectares (pdf) in the archipelago and has been linked to the clearing of forest and peatland for oil palm and paper pulp plantations. Last year south-east Asia experienced one of the worst forest fire outbreaks in the region’s history. A thick, acrid smoke covered large areas of Indonesia and neighbouring countries, and more than 500,000 cases of acute respiratory tract infections were reported between July and October 2015. Riau is often one of the hardest hit by the fires, due in part to its high concentration of peatland. Dry peatland is like gasoline for fires, says Woro Supartinah, coordinator of the NGO Riau Forest Rescue Network which monitors fires in the region. Yet Dosan, a small village in the province surrounded by palm plantations, has not recorded a single fire since 2012, according to those who live there, thanks to a concerted local effort to tackle the problem. The question is whether such success can be replicated. In 2003, the regional government began a poverty-alleviation programme, giving three hectare plots of land to smallholders – including those in Dosan – to plant oil palms. On receipt of the land, the villagers drained the peat to make the land more productive by dissecting it with a labyrinth of canals. And then the land started to burn. Six years later, after a particularly destructive fire ravaged 11 hectares around Dosan, a farmers’ collective known as Cooperative Bungo Tanjung launched a programme to protect peatland, prevent fires and promote better cultivation practices. Most significantly, the programme promotes canal blocking. “We build the dams to keep the level of the water stable at a minimum of 30cm. At this level, palm oil can grow but it is humid enough to avoid fires,” explains Pak Dahlan, a senior farmer in the village. Although it is relatively simple to build the dams, the 20m Indonesian rupiahs (£1,150) that each costs – mainly thanks to the price of cement – is a handicap to scaling up. “The community pays for the dams,” says Dahlan, who adds that the village is trying to raise money to increase the number of dams from 13 to at least 25. As part of their money-raising efforts, the cooperative organises festivals and gatherings where they ask for donations. In addition to the dams, the Dosan smallholders have made a common agreement to stop the practice of slash-and-burn. The technique, widely used in Indonesia to clear forest quickly and cheaply, significantly increases the risk of uncontrolled fires. While slash-and-burn is illegal under Indonesian law, there is an exemption for smallholders which Dosan’s smallholders are urged to ignore. The final core part of the fire-prevention project is the Masyarakat Peduli Api, a community-based firefighter unit funded by the Indonesian government and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) that patrols Dosan several times a day. In addition to the funding from the government and UNEP, a number of local NGOs are supporting Dosan in its efforts to stop forest fires. Perkumpulan Elang, a conservation and community development NGO in Riau, for example, has provided smallholders with the knowledge to build the dams and keep the water level stable in the peatlands. Other villages are now starting to follow Dosan’s example. In Jatibaru, located 40km from Dosan, villagers started to dam the canal which runs through their oil palm plots earlier this year. “We have problems with fires every year. Three years ago there was a big fire and we had a warning from government saying [...] that if any other fires happened they would arrest whoever was responsible,” says Maman, a community leader. He has supervised the construction of eight dams built since January, but says they are not enough to protect the whole village. Dosan, which is not part of a bigger concession, sets an example for larger palm oil producing regions, says Adhy Prayitno, a researcher at the Center for Disaster Studies at the University of Riau. However, while the principle of blocking canals can be replicated, each place has unique requirements so the design of solutions must be adapted to suit local hydrology characteristics, he added. Dosan people know the village and their land inside out, says Prayitno: “Companies can learn from this. They have to build a mutual relationship with local communities and give them more opportunities to participate in the [palm oil] supply chain.”  However, Rachel Carmenta, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for International Forestry Research, says the current flurry of forest fire prevention schemes in Riau – both through the government’s Peatland Restoration Agency as well as through communities such as Dosan – need to take stock of past lessons. “They are operating largely in the absence of a systematic evidence base”, she says.  In addition, evidence suggests the most effective fire management interventions – such as peatland rewetting – are also the most controversial, she says, and deploying these “will therefore require significant negotiation and stakeholder dialogue to bring about consensus, in turn requiring expertise, money and time – as well as monitoring.”"
"The launch of the world’s first large-scale tidal energy farm in Scotland has been hailed as a significant moment for the renewable energy sector. A turbine for the MeyGen tidal stream project in the Pentland Firth was unveiled outside Inverness in the Scottish Highlands.   After the ceremony, attended by Nicola Sturgeon, the turbine, measuring about 15 metres tall (49ft), with blades 16 metres in diameter, and weighing in at almost 200 tonnes, will begin its journey to the project’s site in the waters off the north coast of Scotland between Caithness and Orkney. The turbine will be the first of four to be installed underwater, each with a capacity of 1.5 megawatts (MW), in the initial phase of the project.  But the Edinburgh-based developer Atlantis Resources hopes the project which has received £23m in Scottish government funding will eventually have 269 turbines, bringing its capacity to 398MW, which is enough electricity to power 175,000 homes.  Maf Smith, the deputy chief executive of the lobby group RenewableUK, said: “New technology like this will be powering our nation for decades to come.” The first minister called on the UK government to end the uncertainty around subsidies for similar schemes, warning that a failure to do so risks causing irreparable damage to the marine power industry.  Sturgeon said: “I am incredibly proud of Scotland’s role in leading the way in tackling climate change and investment in marine renewables is a hugely important part of this.  “MeyGen is set to invigorate the marine renewables industry in Scotland and provide vital jobs for a skilled workforce, retaining valuable offshore expertise here in Scotland that would otherwise be lost overseas.” Tim Cornelius, the chief executive of Atlantis Resources, said: “Today marks a historic milestone not just for Atlantis and our project partners, but for the entire global tidal power industry.  “It gives me enormous pride to have reached this juncture after 10 years of tireless work, preparation and planning by everyone associated with this project. This is the day the tidal power industry announced itself as the most exciting new asset class of renewable, sustainable generation in the UK’s future energy mix.  “This is an industry that is creating jobs and Scotland is the undisputed world leader of this high growth sector.”  Smith said the MeyGen project is a “major step forward in terms of scale” and provides “a great boost in maintaining Britain’s pole position” in the renewables sector.  “The fact that the first turbine was assembled at what was an oil and gas fabrication yard illustrates the opportunities offered by renewables,” he said.  “The official launch of the largest tidal stream energy project in the world marks a significant moment in the commercial development of marine power.” Jenny Hogan, the policy director for the trade body Scottish Renewables, also highlighted the “potential of tidal generation to make a significant contribution to the UK’s growing need for clean electricity, and to deliver further investment and jobs to the UK”.  She added: “However, this is still an incredibly young technology, and future development is absolutely dependent on continued support from Holyrood, Westminster and Brussels, who have all played a vitally important part in the growth of the sector to date.”  Meanwhile Fabrice Leveque, the climate and energy policy officer at the environmental body WWF Scotland, said: “It’s great that Scotland is now home to the world’s first large-scale tidal stream farm. It comes hot on the heels of Shetland tidal devices exporting power to the National Grid for the first time and the testing of the world’s most powerful tidal turbine off Orkney.  “This underlines what we already know, that Scotland has 25% of the EU’s offshore wind and tidal power potential.”"

"We are on course for a climate catastrophe. 2016 is set to be the hottest year on record. Unless the Paris agreement’s target of limiting the rise in temperatures by 1.5C is met, heatwaves like that in 2003, which killed tens of thousands of people in Europe, will become the norm. And that is before considering rising sea levels and desertification that will sink cities, and kill and displace millions, or the fact that the Earth has already lost half its wildlife in the past 40 years. The task for politicians is to propose real solutions to the single most important issue facing humanity. Too often, the environment is considered a matter for scientists, enthusiasts and activists. To increase public understanding and energise the political debate, we need more than facts – we need a programme that resonates with people’s everyday experiences, offering not just warnings but opportunities and improvement.   No issue better connects the environment to people’s lives than energy. In Britain today, seven million households struggle to pay their bills because of spiralling costs, while the big six energy companies have seen their profits rise by more than tenfold since 2007. The energy market is not just expensive, inefficient and polluting – it is, above all, undemocratic. In order to deliver clean, affordable heating and electricity we need to change the whole system of energy supply. When energy is driven by the needs of people, it will be greener – because saving the planet is in the interests of everyone. That is why I am today announcing a bold new set of policies which will pioneer a democratic, community-led system of energy supply. Over the course of the next parliament, we will use public investment and legislation to promote the creation of over 200 local energy companies, giving towns, cities and localities the powers they need to drive a clean, locally accountable energy system with public, not-for-profit companies. At the heart of this policy will be a new generation of community energy co-operatives. We will create 1,000 of these co-operatives with the support of a network of regional development banks, and legislate to give them the right to sell energy directly to the communities they serve.  At the same time as building a new publicly run, locally accountable energy system, we will invest in the high quality homes and insulation needed to make Britain environmentally sustainable. We will create a National Home Insulation programme to insulate at least 4m homes to energy efficiency standard B or C. In the private rented sector, we will set compulsory standards at the same level and end the misery of cold rented accommodation. This would save millions of people money on their bills as well as saving energy that is currently wasted on poorly insulated homes. In order to have any hope of keeping the rise in temperature to 2C – let alone meeting our Paris agreement target of 1.5C – we need to keep 80% of fossil fuels in the ground. This can and must be done. Scotland is already on course to generate 100% of its electricity from renewables, and Britain has an ample supply of wind and water. In government, I will commit to generating 65% of Britain’s electricity from these sources by 2030. All of these measures will create secure, skilled employment for hundreds of thousands of people. As part of our transition to a low-carbon economy, we estimate that we will create 316,000 jobs in wind, solar and wave power. We will use a £500bn national investment programme, with a National Investment Bank and a network of regional development banks, to ensure that these jobs and opportunities are created in places where they are most needed – in coastal towns and areas with high unemployment. Too often, environmental catastrophe is explained in the same terms as an asteroid hitting the earth. But the problems and the solutions are political – they are about the prioritisation of profit over the needs of people and, at the heart of it all, a lack of democracy in how decisions are made. By democratising our energy supply, and giving people power over their own destinies, we can rebuild and transform Britain so that no one and no community is left behind."
"Speaking at a literary festival in Bhutan, the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh recently predicted that Himalayan regions, for no fault of their own, will face a catastrophe as climate change takes hold. So chilling was Ghosh that the local paper reported – only half in jest – that a disturbed audience had to be soothed by a subsequent talk by Buddhist monks. Ghosh, best known for his historical novels, has been travelling the world talking about his new book, The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable, born out of a series of lectures at the University of Chicago.    One of its central themes is that writers, artists and filmmakers, including himself, have largely ignored climate change – “he great derangement” of the title – simply because it seems too far-fetched and terrifying.  But does it really make a difference if authors write about climate change? “Making a difference isn’t the point; the point is to examine the meaning of the arts. If we believe that the arts are meant to look ahead, open doors, then how is this huge issue of our time, absent from the arts? It’s like death, no one wants to talk about it,” Ghosh said. He is deeply critical of the global carbon-dependent economy, and believes we need to return to traditional methods of agriculture. He talks about the current drought in western India, partly caused by a shift to water-hungry crops, which has caused thousands of farmers to migrate to the cities.  “The desires of people everywhere are now to do with carbon. That farmer in India, who once knew how to cultivate drought resistant crops like millet and barley, he is better equipped to dealing with climate change than your city dweller eating rice. Meanwhile, you and I are going to be dead in the water.”  The book traces the paths to development taken by India, China and the west. Ghosh is a supporter of climate justice – which looks at the historical responsibilities of nations for climate change, and is quite clear that India and China deserve reparations for choosing more sustainable paths – India by choosing a spartan Gandhian model of development for years, China by choosing the one child policy, even at the cost of inflicting great suffering. Meanwhile, the west pursued a consumerist, carbon-intensive economy, unimpeded. He is also scathing about the Paris climate deal, which he calls “tepid” in its approach to climate justice, and leaves poor nations dependent on the charity of richer nations.  But he is also critical of India’s current mulish stance on climate change: refusing to compromise on growth until climate reparations are made. Instead, he thinks India needs to do both. “It is pretty clear from the Paris agreement that climate justice is not going to happen. We need to keep that issue alive, work for it, but also work towards preventing a catastrophe. When the great wave comes, are you going to say, hey don’t take me, I am Indian?” In the book, Ghosh grimly predicts a “politics of the armed lifeboat” where the poor of the global south will be left to their doom while the rich go on unscathed. Nevertheless, he also wonders if the poor may well be more resilient.  “In 2003, the European heatwave caused 46,000 deaths,” he muses. “When the power goes out in New York, there is a crime wave. When the power goes out in India, several times a day, no one even notices. It’s quite possible the middle class will be the most affected, and the really poor and rich will survive.” Worryingly, Ghosh has few solutions to offer. In the book, he hopes religious figures will get involved in climate change, governments having failed. “I am not sure there are solutions. The problem is of such a scale that we are dwarfed by it,” he said."
"Is it still true to say you can’t point to any single extreme weather event and claim you can’t link it to human-caused climate change?  Plenty of people seem to think this is still the case. But a rapidly evolving field of climate science suggests that it’s not.   Take Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, for example, who was touring Tasmania after the devastating flooding there in June. Turnbull pointed out that “larger and more frequent storms” were predicted by climate scientists, but then followed up with that stock standard caveat:  But you cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming, so let’s be quite clear about that. The same scientists would agree with that point. But in fact, climate scientists are finding ways to examine the influence of increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere on extreme events. This is a field of science called attribution research. Dr Andrew King, at the University of Melbourne, has been involved with several attribution studies. So is it time to throw out that old stock response that you can’t blame climate change for any single event? He says: I would reframe the question – has climate change altered the likelihood of an event happening, like a flood in Louisiana or a heatwave in Melbourne? We can usually say with those types of events that climate change has increased the likelihood of an event happening. When extreme weather events do strike, questions about human influences are coming up more and more. Some scientists want to be able to respond quickly with more relevant answers, before the news cycle turns elsewhere. For example, King joined colleagues to look at the record warm sea temperatures that caused the mass bleaching of corals on the Great Barrier Reef last summer. The results were out in April while the reef’s plight was still making headlines. “We found that the warm sea temperatures were made at least 175 times more likely because of climate change,” King says. To carry out the research, King looked at two sets of climate models. One was set up to reproduce the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that we have now and the other had those human influences removed.  In short, the models showed the kind of conditions that eventually killed about a quarter of the corals on the reef are now expected to come around once every four years. But in a world without the extra greenhouse gases, you might expect to see those ocean temperatures once every 1,000 years, if at all. The reef research is about to be submitted to a journal and so the results could change. But King says the methods being used had been peer-reviewed.  King also looked at the heatwave that had world leaders sweating during the November 2014 G20 summit in Brisbane. Getting a 38C day in November was “at least 44% more likely” thanks to climate change, his study found. From torrential downpours to record ocean temperatures, heatwaves and the monotonous breaking of monthly and yearly global temperature records, more and more studies are finding a distinct human fingerprint on events.  There have been a bunch of attribution studies looking at heat records in Australia. A study of its consecutive run of record warm springs in 2013 and 2014 found it would have been almost impossible without all that extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Another study found that without the added greenhouse gases, Australia’s record hot 2013 would only have come along once every 12,000 years. But now, thanks chiefly to the burning of fossil fuels since the industrial revolution, we might expect a record breaker every six years. Dr Sophie Lewis, at Australian National University, was involved in both those studies. She says climate attribution is a “fast-evolving field” thanks to quicker computers, better collaborations and established methods.  But like King she’s not a fan of simply asking if climate change “caused” something, or was “to blame” for particular events. She says:  A better question is to ask if climate change has influenced a particular event. That’s an important distinction. An example she gave is 2015 – the planet’s warmest year on record that coincided with an El Niño climate system. El Niños are natural events that tends to deliver hotter temperatures, but they are happening over the top of human-induced warming that pushes temperatures to record-breaking levels. Lewis says: We know that both natural and human-caused climate change have impacts on events and we don’t want to lose that complexity. People do understand that the environment and the climate system are complicated. Getting results out faster gives the media, the public and policymakers more informed answers soon after events hit. In early August, for example, Louisiana was struck by torrential rains that caused severe flooding – killing 13 people and damaging about 60,000 homes. Less than a month later, a team of scientists concluded that human-caused climate change had probably doubled the chances of Louisiana being hit by downpours like that. The lead author of that study, Dr Karin van der Wiel, of Princeton University and the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told me:  Extreme events have always happened and this could have happened a hundred years ago. But it would have been much more rare. Van der Wiel says researchers managed to carry out the analysis quickly because the data from the climate models was readily available and they had good had rainfall data for the area. The Louisiana study has been submitted to a journal where the peer-review process happens out in the open so, again, the conclusions could change. Now, some scientists are uneasy about research being publicised before it has been through peer review, for obvious reasons. What if, for example, there’s a mistake in the analysis that completely changes the conclusions? Both Van Der Wiel and King say they can have a degree of confidence in their results because the methods have already been tested. I’ll leave you with King’s thoughts on this.  As far as I see it, one purpose of event attribution is to communicate to the public and policy makers that climate change is altering how extreme events are occurring – both their frequency and how bad they are. That’s why we’re moving towards doing this work more quickly. If we can better inform the debate, then that provides some useful information that’s grounded in science, when often there has been just speculation."

"Earlier this summer, I found myself in the middle of a lively debate because of my work on climate change and the ethics of having children. NPR correspondent Jennifer Ludden profiled some of my work in procreative ethics with an article entitled, “Should we be having kids in the age of climate change?,” which summarized my published views that we ought to consider adopting a “small family ethic” and even pursuing fertility reduction efforts in response to the threat from climate change. Although environmentalists for decades have worried about overpopulation for many good reasons, I suggest the fast-upcoming thresholds in climate change provide uniquely powerful reasons to consider taking real action to slow population growth. Clearly, this idea struck a nerve: I was overwhelmed by the response in my personal email inbox as well as op-eds in other media outlets and over 70,000 shares on Facebook. I am gratified that so many people took the time to read and reflect on the piece. Having read and digested that discussion, I want to continue it by responding to some of the most vocal criticisms of my own work, which includes research on “population engineering” – the intentional manipulation of human population size and structure – I’ve done with my colleagues, Jake Earl and Colin Hickey. In short, the varied arguments against my views – that I’m overreacting, that the economy will tank and others – haven’t changed my conviction that we need to discuss the ethics of having children in this era of climate change. Some comments – those claiming climate change is a hoax, devised by those who wish to control the world’s resources – are not worth responding to. Since 97% of all relevant experts cannot convince climate change skeptics of the basic scientific facts, then nothing I say will change their minds. Other concerns, however, do require a response. Many people reacted to my work on procreation ethics by saying climate change will not be so bad, and so curbing individual desires, such as having children, in its name is unnecessary fear-mongering. In my work, I suggest that 1.5-2 degrees Celsius warming over preindustrial levels will be “dangerous” and “very bad”, while 4 degrees C will be “catastrophic” and will leave large segments of the Earth “largely uninhabitable by humans”. Here is a very brief survey of the evidence for those claims based on what I consider reputable sources. At 1.5-2 degrees C, a World Bank report predicts an increase in extreme weather events, deadly heat waves and severe water stress. Food production will decrease, and changing disease vectors will create unpredictable infectious disease outbreaks. Sea levels will rise, combining with increased storm severity to place coastal cities at risk. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that from the years 2030-2050 – as we reach this level of warming – at least 250,000 people will die every year from just some of the climate-related harms. Perhaps many of us in rich countries (the “us” who might be reading this) will be largely protected from these early harms; but that doesn’t make them less real to the vulnerable citizens of, say, Bangladesh, Kiribati or the Maldives. In fact, it escalates the injustice, as the global wealthy have benefited from and contributed to climate change the most, while the global poor will be hurt first and worst. At 4 degrees C warming, the World Bank predicts that every summer month will be hotter than any current record heat wave, making the Middle East, North Africa and the Mediterranean deadly during the summer months. Many coastal cities will be completely under water, and all low-lying island nations will likely have to be abandoned. Hundreds of millions, if not billions of people could become climate refugees, as their homelands become uninhabitable. Based on these descriptions, I stand by my predictions. Other critics have argued that advocating for a lower birth rate equals hating babies or being “anti-life”. Obviously I don’t hate babies! I’m pretty wild about my own kid, and small humans in general. This anti-life charge is more interesting, but equally wrong. The premise seems to be that those who wish to lower fertility rates must be misanthropic, or fail to see the value of humans. But that gets things exactly backward: a radical concern for climate change is precisely motivated by a concern for human life – in particular, the human lives that will be affected by climate disruptions. A valuable philosophical contribution here is the distinction between “making people happy” and “making happy people”. When I feed a hungry person, or prevent a harm from befalling someone, I improve a person’s well-being. But when I create a person whom I will then feed and prevent from harm, I make a person who will predictably be well off. In the first case, I added happiness to the world by helping an existing person; whereas in the second case, I added happiness by creating a person who will be happy. See the difference? I, like many philosophers, believe that it’s morally better to make people happy than to make happy people. Those who exist already have needs and wants, and protecting and providing for them is motivated by respect for human life. It is not a harm to someone not to be created. In fact, I would argue that it is more “anti-life” to prioritize creating new life over caring for, or even not harming, those who already exist. Another opposing argument: people are not only consumers – they are also producers, and so will make the world better. Yes, humans are producers, and many wonderful things have come from human genius. But each person, whatever else they are (genius or dunce, producer or drag on the economy) is also a consumer. And this is the only claim needed in order to be worried about climate change. The problem here is that we have a finite resource – the ability of the Earth’s atmosphere to absorb greenhouse gases without violently disrupting the climate – and each additional person contributes to the total amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. So although humans will hopefully save us (we do, in fact, desperately need brilliant people to develop scaleable technology to remove carbon from the air, for instance), the solution to this cannot be to have as many babies as possible, with the hope that this raises our probability of solving the problem. Because each baby is also an emitter, whether a genius or not. Lastly, there’s the view that lowering fertility rates will kill the economy. Several commenters point to low-fertility countries such as Japan, Italy and Germany, and argue that problems experienced by such countries are proof that the “real” population crisis is our dropping fertility rate. We need more babies to grow into healthy young producers to keep our economic engine humming. The truth in this objection is the following: an economy that requires infinite growth to be healthy will be harmed in a world of finite resources. But if it’s true that our economies can’t survive slowing or even reversing population growth, then we’re in some trouble no matter what. Why? It’s simple logic that we cannot grow our population forever. We can either reflect now on how to protect our economy while working toward a sustainable population, or we can ignore the problem until nature forces it on us, perhaps violently and unexpectedly. I’ll conclude with one, final thought: I don’t enjoy arguing for a small family ethic, or a population engineering scheme. Despite snide accusations to the contrary, I get no research funds or any other incentive for making this case. I’m arguing these points because I’m genuinely worried about the future of our planet, and the people who will inherit it, and I believe difficult yet civil discussion is the crucial first step to making that future one we won’t be condemned for creating.

"In what has become a common refrain this year, last month ranked as the hottest August on record, according to NASA data released Monday. Not only that, but the month tied July as the hottest month the world has seen in the last 136 years. August came in at 1.76˚F (0.98˚C) above the average from 1951-1980, 0.16C above August 2014, the previous record holder. The record keeps 2016 on track to be the hottest year in the books by a fair margin.  That August continued the streak of record hot months this year and tied July as the hottest month was somewhat unexpected. The seasonal temperature cycle generally reaches a peak in July, as it did this year. But August was so anomalously warm — more so even than July — that it tied that month’s overall temperature. It was also thought that July would likely be the last record hot month of the year, given the dissipation of El Niño. In NASA’s dataset, August marks the 11th record-setting month in a row. That streak goes back 15 months through July in data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Each agency handles the global temperature data slightly differently and uses a different period of comparison, leading to slight differences in the monthly and yearly temperature numbers. Overall, though, both datasets show clear agreement in the overall warming trend. That trend is what Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and other climate scientists emphasize. It is that excess heat that has accumulated over decades thanks to rising levels of greenhouse gases that accounts for the bulk of this year’s record warmth, with El Niño providing only a small boost. “Monthly rankings, which vary by only a few hundredths of a degree, are inherently fragile,” Schmidt said in a statement. “We stress that the long-term trends are the most important for understanding the ongoing changes that are affecting our planet.” International negotiators hope to curtail that long-term trend by limiting warming to less than 2˚C (3.6˚F) over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. There have even been discussions to aim for an even more stringent target of 1.5˚C. To show how close the world already is to surpassing that goal, Climate Central has been averaging the NASA and NOAA temperature data each month and comparing that number to the average from 1881-1910, closer to preindustrial times. Through July, the global temperature for the year was 1.31˚C (2.36˚F) above the average from that period. A new average will be calculated through August when NOAA releases its temperature data on Sept. 20. Whether September will continue the record streak is uncertain, but regardless of where it falls, there is already a greater than 99 percent chance that 2016 will take the title of hottest year, Schmidt has said."

"The UK’s new flood defence plans anticipate significantly higher extreme rainfall, after new research was published as part of the government’s National Flood Resilience review.  The government, which had been criticised for not taking full account of the impact of climate change in driving up flood risk, will now plan for 20-30% more extreme downpours than before.   The review, prompted by severe flooding in recent winters, also found that 530 critical infrastructure sites, such as water and telecoms, are at serious risk from floods, each potentially affecting at least 10,000 people. Utility companies have pledged to have new protection in place by the end of the year.  The government’s official climate change advisers recently warned that flooding could cause a cascade of emergencies by knocking out energy, transport, water and communications links. The review allocates £12.5m for more temporary defences, such as barriers and pumps, at strategic locations around the country. By this winter, the government said, four times more temporary barriers will be available. “Last winter we saw just how devastating flooding can be. This review sets out clear actions so we are better prepared to respond quickly in the event of future flooding and can strengthen the nation’s flood defences,” said the environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom. Ben Gummer, Cabinet Office minister, said: “The government has made clear that we expect water and telecoms companies to work ever closer together to improve their preparation and response to flooding, making sure lifelines such as mobile phone masts and water treatment works continue to function.”  Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: “This review was launched because the government was caught out by [recent] flooding. It deserves credit for admitting that ministers have previously misunderstood and significantly underestimated the probability of flooding. “However, it is disappointing that the government chose to ignore surface water flooding during the review, even though it poses a threat to more properties in the UK than does coastal and river flooding,” he said. Lord Deben, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s official advisers, welcomed the review but said it fell short of what was needed: “As well as implementing short-term measures, such as better protecting key sites, we need a new and comprehensive, long-term strategy to address flood risk in this country.” Friends of the Earth campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: “This review suggests a sea-change in government understanding of floods, but its recommendations are a wash-out. £12.5m for temporary flood defences is a drop in the ocean when the review concludes that winter rainfall could increase by up to 30% in future in parts of the UK, [which] will put thousands more homes and businesses at risk.” Paul Cobbing, chief executive of the National Flood Forum, which represents flood communities, welcomed the review but said its narrow scope did not tackle the community-level work required. He said preventing every flood is impossible and adapting homes to cope is vital: “It is really important to engage with people about the residual risk in the right way, so that they own that risk. There are elements of government that understand this and there are other elements that clearly don’t.” Councillor Martin Tett, from the Local Government Association, said: “Councils will need significantly more support from government to help prepare for the possibility of further flooding.” Council flood funding was cut by 50% in 2015. The review asked the Met Office to develop new plausible extreme rainfall scenarios. It added 20-30% to recently recorded extreme events, a figure it expects will mean only a 10% chance of worse rain in the next 10 years. “When we used the Environment Agency’s detailed models to predict the flooding associated with these extreme rainfall scenarios, we discovered (unsurprisingly) that it, too, was worse than anything we have seen to date,” the review states. The Met Office modelled over 11,000 monthly rainfall scenarios, many times more than the set available from real-world observation in recent decades. “This allowed us to identify several hundred extreme monthly rainfall events that are greater than current existing rainfall records, but are regarded as plausible for the current climate - what might be termed ‘black swan’ events,” it said in a statement. The review found that a 20% heavier extreme rainfall event in Carlisle would lead to 280 more homes flooding, on top of those that were inundated last winter, while 400 more homes would flood in Mytholmroyd and a similar number in Hebden Bridge. A “stress test” in the review of a plausible extreme tidal surge affecting Great Yarmouth found that “it would mean an additional 1,700 properties would flood compared to the December 2013 tidal surge, when 20 properties were flooded”.  One approach little mentioned by the review is to use natural methods to slow the flow of water and tree planting has been shown to have prevented flooding at Pickering in North Yorkshire over Christmas, at a time when heavy rainfall caused devastating flooding across the region. A separate back-to-nature trial in Holnicote, Somerset, has also showed promising results. Brenda Pollack, from Rewilding Britain said: “The government has missed an opportunity. With the focus on cities, valuable work in rural areas to mitigate against floods will take a back seat. But restoring natural, varied landscapes helps absorb flood waters and is more cost effective than expensive flood barriers.” Speaking before the report’s publication, former floods minister Richard Benyon said farmers could to be paid to hold back floodwater under a post-Brexit rural payments system: “There is an opportunity now to completely rethink rural policy, and flood protection can come in as part of the way we support farmers and see farming as doing a public good when it protects communities from flooding.” Flood defence spending was cut sharply by David Cameron’s coalition government but partly reversed after severe floods in the winters of 2013-14 and 2015-16. In March’s budget, a £700m boost was pledged, meaning some English cities and towns that had been left without planned flood defences by the cuts are now getting the projects. The north of England, devastated by winter floods, is getting at least £150m of the new money, giving better protection for thousands of homes. The Guardian revealed in 2012 that 294 projects in line for funding were left stranded after the heavy cuts and exposed a series of places that were later flooded. These included Leeds and Kendal, which were submerged in last winter’s storms. Both places will now get improved defences. The new money is being funded by an increase in insurance premium tax. The government had been warned by a series of official bodies in recent years that flood risk was rising due to inadequate spending and was costing billions of pounds in damages. Government scientists have long warned that more severe flooding is the greatest impact of climate change in the UK. Floods already cause £1bn of damage every year on average but the risks are rising as climate change leads to more intense rainfall, bringing floods to places not currently in danger. The number of households at significant risk of flooding will more than double to 1.9m by 2050, if the global temperature rises by 4C."
"London Mayor Sadiq Khan has joined forces with city leaders from around the world to call on governments to take urgent action on climate change. Ahead of a meeting of the G20 group of leading nations in Hangzhou, China, 30 mayors from cities including London, Paris, Tokyo, Sydney, New York, Cape Town and Rio de Janeiro called on national leaders to work with them to “build a low carbon, climate safe world”.  They welcomed government moves to secure the Paris Agreement, the world’s first comprehensive global deal to tackle climate change, in December last year, and efforts to ratify it as soon as possible so it could come into force rapidly. But they warned “this is only the first step along the road towards our low carbon, climate safe future”. In an open letter, the mayors from the C40 group of cities championing climate action said: “To limit the global temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak by 2020. “Achieving such a rapid shift is probably one of the greatest political, economic and practical challenges faced by every national leader, but you do have great allies in this task: we, the mayors of the megacities of the world.” They said they were already dealing with the consequences of climate change in their cities, battling floods to heatwaves. But city leaders were also taking action such as banning the most polluting cars, rolling out fleets of electric buses and improving energy efficiency, which also had benefits for health, well-being and economic growth, they said.  “For the major cities of the world it is already clear that the faster we move to a low carbon economy, the greater will be the improvement in urban citizens’ standards of living, and the stronger and more sustained will be the economic development that makes that possible.” The leaders have committed to setting out concrete plans for how they will deliver the greenhouse gas cuts in their cities needed to help meet the goals of the Paris Agreement to avoid dangerous climate change. “We want our citizens, markets and other political leaders to know that we are serious about making the Paris Agreement a reality. We call on the heads of states from our respective nation states to do the same,” they said."
"Rob Callender is talking about cheese. “My dad loves cheese, really loves it. So I’ve had to persuade him to cut down. Instead of leaping on every two-for-one in the supermarket, buy one really nice cheese once a week. Dairy farming is such a horrible industry.” Callender’s passionate advocacy of veganism has made him an object of fun and curiosity on film sets, but he is now turning his environmentalism into art. In just over a month’s time, he he will begin shooting a short crowd-funded feature film on climate change.  The British actor, whose credits include Sherlock, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and the Guy Burgess character in the National Theatre revival of Another Country, has been chiefly famous among online fans for his appearance in Game of Thrones earlier this year. A close-up of his penis - “no, it wasn’t a body double,” he says, blushing - as his character Clarenzo examined himself for genital warts caused a stir. Callender prompted the scene himself. Kidding around on set while filming a very different episode, he said it was about time for a male nude shot. Writers David Benioff and Daniel Weiss took him at his word, and the script was delivered soon after. “I thought it was quite amusing,” he says. “I don’t think we should be embarrassed about nakedness. And I had a wig, so no one would recognise me.” There will be no reprise of this scene in his climate change film, however. A thriller that takes a series of dams as its backdrop, The Incentive revolves around a “sort of Steve Jobs/Elon Musk” figure of an ambitious and charismatic entrepreneur taking on global warming. But is he all that he seems? Combining elements of action and disaster movies with spy conspiracies and flashes of comedy - including Simon Amstell in a “celebrity vegan cameo” -the film aims to portray the perils of climate change without preaching or bludgeoning audiences. It will be shown initially at film festivals, with the hope of a general release or a bigger budget remake if successful. Callender has been working on the script for two years, and is now in the final stages of raising funds for the production via Kickstarter. Shooting will be at the Cruachan dam in Scotland in November. This is a personal quest for Callender. A vegan who has converted all his immediate family to the cause, with the exception of his father’s cheese habit, he believes “in embodying the change you want to make”. Making a film about climate change was a natural fit because he believes the problem is now growing so urgent that we only have a few years, “a very short window”, to make the differences to the economy and our consumption patterns that are needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Winchester-educated Callender has an unusual perspective on the issue, having been born in Japan and brought up largely in Hong Kong and Los Angeles. His father was an executive at Cathay Pacific – “I think I have a deep guilt at having taken so many flights,” he says – and his experience of other cultures encourages him to think that if people can be persuaded there are different ways of living without our overweening dependence on fossil fuels, we can switch rapidly to those other modes. “Young people see this,” he says, as their exposure to the internet gives them a broader viewpoint of other cultures. “My grandfather doesn’t believe in it.” His sense of urgency has deeply personal roots as well. While Callender, now 25, was at the Guildhall school of drama, his motherdeveloped cancer in her early 50s and died. “She was incredibly healthy, she had no vices,” he says. “It showed me that you can’t wait around. There is no time to waste,. All the social worries just melt away… you’re not thinking about how you ‘should’ behave, you just show what you are thinking, very directly.” Films about climate change do not, in general, have a happy history. Al Gore’s 2006 An Inconvenient Truth won an Oscar, but was a documentary, beautifully paced and shot, but essentially the filming of an hour-long standup lecture. The Age of Stupid looked and sounded different, but underneath was much the same format, with Pete Postlethwaite narrating an impassioned polemic against rampant consumerism. Others have been less successful. The Day After Tomorrow employed conventional disaster movie tropes, while 1995’s Waterworld, starring Kevin Costner with gills, put paid to the genre for a decade. Arguably the best job was done by The Simpsons Movie. Callender believes turning climate change into watchable filmic form is vital if people are to be persuaded to change their behaviour. “It’s this massive issue, this huge part of our lives, and it is missing [on film],” he says. A documentary was out of the question, he says. The defining question of our times, that of whether we deal with climate change or fail to do so, must and should be a subject of art. “We are failing otherwise,” he says. Above all, Callender says, his film must work on its own terms. “I want people to be awake while they watch it,” he says. “I want them to be watching to see what happens next, just like any other film. It’s not a lecture.”"

"One of the reasons climate change is such an important topic is that it will affect (and already is affecting) the natural biological systems. Both plants and animals will have to respond to the changing climate. In some cases, this means adapting to higher temperatures. In other cases, the changes may be alterations in the precipitation, length of growing season, availability or resources, or other influences.  While some animals can adapt, others will have to migrate. Obviously migration can be apparent in mobile animals that will move to maintain a more or less similar climate to that to which they are accustomed.  But animal and plant movement does not occur in just a changing climate. It also has to navigate changes to the landscape that humans create. For instance, increased land allocation to agriculture or urbanization can create barriers for free migration. So, what scientists really want to know is how these two factors (climate change and land use change) will collectively affect the patterns of animal and plant movement. A study that actually was published a few years ago but is only now getting press looked at this issue. The publication was authored by Julian Olden and his colleagues from the University of Washington and the Nature Conservancy. What they researchers found was very interesting. The study was published in the journal Ecology Letters and is titled Projected Climate-Driven Faunal Movement Routes. First, they projected changes in the distribution of climatically suitable zones for projected future climates. They considered nearly 3,000 vertebrate species. Using a computer model, the projected how and when the species would migrate and they tracked the migration routes. The study incorporated a resistance to movement based on the amount of human alteration to the landscape. The analysis was similar to how the flow of electrons through a wire circuit is calculated. In fact, electronic circuit theory formed a basis for the calculations.  From their analysis, the authors identified several locations in North and South America that will be crucial for species movement in a changing climate. Large movements are expected in the southeastern US, the Amazon region, and parts of Brazil. Some of the areas where migration is expected have intact biological regions. Others, in particular the southeastern US and Brazil, have pathways that are heavily impacted by human activities, which may create a barrier to the migration routes. In the study, the team of scientists first identified what they term “climatically suitable” conditions for each of the species under a changing climate scenario. They plotted routes for the species from areas that were projected to be unsuitable to these suitable areas. The routes were plotted so that they avoided the most heavily human-impacted regions. They then plotted the paths on a map for easy of visualization. Some concrete and specific examples were provided. For instance, in the southeastern US, species are projected to move northward into the southern Appalachian Mountains. In South America, species are expected to migrate from central Argentina in the Pampas, Sierras de Cordoba, and Andes. The authors identified 14 biological regions and calculated the average direction of movement across each biome. Great visualizations are shown of paths of migrations, for instance, in the southeastern US. I wrote to Dr Olden and he replied: Facilitating species movements by increasing connectivity is perhaps the most often-cited adaptation strategies for conserving biodiversity in a changing climate. Our work identifies critical dispersal conduits for thousands of vertebrate species, and highlights how human activities on the landscape have the potential to greatly promote or inhibit these movements. This is another one of those exciting papers that doesn’t look at the basic physics of climate change. That topic is really settled and the science is on the edges of how fast climate change will occur. Rather this study helps us assess what the impacts of climate change will be."
"Arctic sea ice this summer shrank to its second lowest level since scientists started to monitor it by satellite, with scientists saying it is another ominous signal of global warming. The National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado said the sea ice reached its summer low point on Saturday, extending 4.14m sq km (1.6m sq miles). That’s behind only the mark set in 2012, 3.39m sq km.  Center director Mark Serreze said this year’s level technically was 10,000 sq km less than 2007, but that’s so close the two years are essentially tied. Even though this year didn’t set a record, “we have reinforced the overall downward trend. There is no evidence of recovery here,” Serreze said. “We’ve always known that the Arctic is going to be the early warning system for climate change. What we’ve seen this year is reinforcing that.” This year’s minimum level is nearly 2.56m sq km smaller than the 1979 to 2000 average. That’s the size of Alaska and Texas combined. “It’s a tremendous loss that we’re looking at here,” Serreze said. It was an unusual year for sea ice in the Arctic, Serreze said. In the winter, levels were among their lowest ever for the cold season, but then there were more storms than usual over the Arctic during the summer. Those storms normally keep the Arctic cloudy and cooler, but that didn’t keep the sea ice from melting this year, he said. “Summer weather patterns don’t matter as much as they used to, so we’re kind of entering a new regime,” Serreze said. Serreze said he wouldn’t be surprised if the Arctic was essentially ice free in the summer by 2030, something that will affect international security. “The trend is clear and ominous,” National Center for Atmospheric Research senior scientist Kevin Trenberth said in an email. “This is indeed why the polar bear is a poster child for human-induced climate change, but the effects are not just in the Arctic.” One recent theory divides climate scientists: Melting sea ice in the Arctic may change the jet stream and weather further south, especially in winter. “What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic,” Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said. “It looks increasingly likely that the dramatic decrease in Arctic sea ice is impacting weather in mid-latitudes and may be at least partly responsible for the more dramatic, persistent and damaging weather anomalies we’ve seen so many of in recent years.”"
"United Airlines Flight 880 was carrying more than 200 passengers from Houston, Texas, to London’s Heathrow airport two weeks ago when it was battered by turbulence that threw people on to the cabin ceiling. Twenty-three people were injured. “We were flying along as smooth as can be and then were just slapped massively from the top as if someone had torpedoed us,” one passenger told journalists. The aircraft, a Boeing 767-300, made an emergency landing at Shannon airport and the injured were taken to University Hospital, Limerick. No one was seriously hurt but all went through a terrifying experience and one, say experts, which will increasingly affect flights.  “It is predicted there will be more and more incidents of severe clear-air turbulence, which typically comes out of the blue with no warning, occurring in the near future as climate change takes its effect in the stratosphere,” Dr Paul Williams, a Royal Society research fellow at Reading University, said last week. “There has already been a steady rise in incidents of severe turbulence affecting flights over the past few decades. Globally, turbulence causes dozens of fatalities a year on small private planes and hundreds of injuries to passengers in big jets. And as carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere keep on rising, so will the numbers of incidents.” Williams said that at heights of around 10 to 12km (6-7 miles), a typical cruising altitude for a modern passenger jet plane, temperature changes caused by increased amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have the effect of making different layers of airflow move at increased speeds relative to each other. When this unstable airflow produces clear-air turbulence – and there are no visual clues to give a pilot warning of what lies ahead – then the aircraft is thrown about with considerable force. “If the effect is severe, it will overcome the force of gravity and fling people out of their seats. Turbulence of this severity is being encountered by planes thousands of times a year now,” Williams added. In the United States alone, it is estimated that the damage, delays and disruption from turbulence already cost more than $500m (£374m) a year. And all studies suggest that incidents are getting more frequent. For example, in 2006, the US Federal Aviation Administration reported that the number of incidents in which turbulence caused serious accidents in US flights more than doubled between 1982 and 2003. Crucially, that figure includes adjustments made for the rise in numbers of flights produced by the growth of the aviation industry. “Several other studies have produced the same, consistent pattern of a considerable rise in incidents of turbulence – even after adjusting for the aviation industry’s growth,” added Williams. As to actions that should be taken, Williams is clear. “Always keep your seat belt fastened. I never used to bother until I started studying incidents of turbulence and the injuries involved. Of course, that won’t protect you from someone else getting thrown in the air and landing on you, but it will substantially minimise your chances of getting hurt.” As to tackling turbulence, limiting carbon dioxide emissions would be an obvious move, he added, though this remains a problematic political goal. More direct measures would be to improve the science of turbulence prediction and to find better meteorological algorithms for forecasting such incidents. Williams said that at present, the science involved had not reached the required precision for forecasting where and when turbulence might strike, but it was improving all the time. “Engineers are also working on a technique that involves shining ultraviolet light along the path that a plane is taking,” added Williams. “Then you analyse the reflections that come back to the craft. From that, it has been found you can tell when you are likely to hit a turbulence pocket of air that is going to give the aircraft a severe buffeting.” The problem is that retrofitting all the passenger aircraft currently in operation with ultraviolet detection systems would – at present – cost more than the expense that turbulence imposes on the air travel industry. “It is currently too expensive for airlines. However, as more carbon dioxide is pumped into the atmosphere, more turbulence disrupts flights, and more passengers get hurt, then we might see some action,” added Williams. “This problem is not going to go away.”"

"The Climate Change Authority will be moved from Melbourne to Canberra within the next fortnight, putting its independence from government under the spotlight. A spokesperson for the Department of Environment has confirmed the move in “mid-September” to Guardian Australia, and said it was being done “in order to improve its operating efficiency”.  Guardian Australia understands none of the authority’s staff, besides the chief executive, will stay with it after the move, which has been known about in relevant circles for some time. The move has raised concerns it will bring the authority, which was set up in 2011 in Melbourne as an independent statutory agency, closer to government and limit its independence. The Department of Environment spokesperson said the authority would continue to have “its own staff”. But whether those staff would be on secondment from the department is not yet known. Several people close to the authority warned that since the expert staff of the authority did much of the agency’s work – including writing the reports that are directed and signed off by the board members – how close they were to government could affect the degree of independence it maintained. Bernie Fraser, former chair of the Climate Change Authority and former chair of the Reserve Bank of Australia, told Guardian Australia that “the independence is one of the great features of bodies like the Climate Change Authority”. Fraser said the personnel – both the staff and the board – need to work to uphold the independence of the authority. He said when he was head of the authority, the staff were “tremendously impressive”. “Unfortunately that started to erode, after the change of government, and the talk of abolishing the authority – those good people thought the government isn’t going to listen and is going to get rid of the authority at the first opportunity,” Fraser said. He said there was “something to” the concerns about independence if it was moved to Canberra, and particularly if the staffing turned out to be seconded from the department rather than hired independently. Ian Chubb, a former member of the authority and the former chief scientist of Australia, said if the board was expert enough, then the independence of the staff shouldn’t impact the independence of the authority itself. “I don’t think moving the secretariat to Canberra is moving the authority closer to government, other than literally,” he told Guardian Australia. “There are lots of organisations in Canberra at arm’s length from government. The independent board ought to have enough knowledge collectively not to let the wool get pulled over their eyes.”  The Coalition attempted to abolish the Climate Change Authority in its last term in government but failed to get the legislation through the Senate, and continues to maintain its policy that it should be abolished. In the Coalition’s 2016-17 budget, the Climate Change Authority was provided with an operating budget from existing Department of Environment funds until the end of 2016 only. The move follows a dispute between members of the authority over a report on whether Australia should have an emissions trading scheme, leading to two members releasing a “minority report” and receiving a sharp rebuke from the authority’s chair, Wendy Craik. Craik released a statement saying their report was “misleading”. She said while it “purports to be a minority report to the authority’s third and final report of its special review”, it “was not released or endorsed by the authority, and has no status as an authority report”. Asked about whether the two dissenting members would continue on the board of the authority, a spokeswoman for the Climate Change Authority told Guardian Australia: “Whether the two members who wrote the dissenting report continue as members of the authority is a matter for them.” Both dissenting members, the economist Clive Hamilton and the climate scientist David Karoly, said they would not resign over the matter, and they didn’t believe there were any grounds for them to be dismissed. Fraser said he had read both the majority report and the minority report. “I thought the points in the minority point were very well made and deserve serious consideration, he told Guardian Australia. Asked about the dispute and the future of the organisation, the environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the disagreement was a matter for the authority but the government had no plans to commission any further reports from it. The authority is still required to complete two more reports: a review of the carbon farming initiative legislation and a review of the national greenhouse and energy reporting legislation."

"The United States and China, the world’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, have announced they will formally ratify the Paris climate change agreement in a move campaigners immediately hailed as a significant advance in the battle against global warming.  Speaking on Saturday, on the eve of the G20 summit in Hangzhou, US president, Barack Obama, confirmed the long-awaited move, the result of weeks of intense negotiations by Chinese and American officials. “Just as I believe the Paris agreement will ultimately prove to be a turning point for our planet, I believe that history will judge today’s efforts as pivotal,” said Obama, who was speaking in the presence of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. “Where there is a will and there is a vision and where countries like China and the United States are prepared to show leadership and to lead by example, it is possible for us to create a world that is more secure, more prosperous and more free than the one that was left for us,” added Obama, for whom the commitment is part of a final push to secure a green legacy for his presidency. Earlier China had announced it would formally ratify the Paris accord with President Xi vowing to “unwaveringly pursue sustainable development”.  “Our response to climate change bears on the future of our people and the well-being of mankind,” Xi said, according to the Associated Press.  Obama said the joint announcement showed how the world’s two largest economies were capable of coming together to fight climate change.  “Despite our differences on other issues we hope that our willingness to work together on this issue will inspire greater ambition and greater action around the world,” he said.  “We have a saying in America that you need to put your money where your mouth is,” Obama told an audience at Hangzhou’s West Lake state guesthouse. “And when it comes to combating climate change that is what we are doing … we are leading by example.” If the Paris agreement comes into force this year as hoped, it means the nearly 200 governments party to it will become obliged to meet emissions-cutting pledges made before the deal last December. For example, the EU has a “national determined contribution” of cutting emissions by 40% by 2030 on 1990 levels, and the US by up to 28% by 2025 compared with 2005.  The deal coming into force would also commit the countries to aspire to keep temperatures below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – a tall ask and one that will require those country pledges to be ramped up – and for rich countries to continue giving climate aid to poorer countries beyond 2020. David Waskow, the international climate director of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based thinktank, described the US-China announcement as a sign the world’s two largest economies had moved from “making commitments to delivering action”. “When the two largest emitters lock arms to solve climate change, that is when you know we are on the right track,” Waskow said. “Never before have these two countries worked so closely together to address a global challenge. There’s no question that this historic partnership on climate change will be one of the defining legacies of Obama’s presidency.” Ranping Song, the group’s China expert, called the announcement “a tremendous milestone” in the fight against climate change. “[This is] the two big countries coming together to acknowledge the challenges and then working together to tackle them,” Song said. “It’s good news.” “The world finally has a global climate agreement with both the US and China as formal parties,” said Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International. “This signals a new era in global efforts to address climate change.” In Washington, the Republican-controlled Congress has questioned Obama’s legal right to ratify the accord by decree, noting that the constitution grants the Senate a role of “advice and consent” in making treaties. But the chamber does not ratify treaties, and the US also has increasingly relied on “executive agreements” since the second world war. Those agreements are not submitted to the Senate but are also considered binding in international law.  The Paris agreement, sealed last December after two weeks of frantic negotiations, must be ratified by 55 countries, representing 55% of global emissions, in order to come into force. The news that the world’s top two emitters – who are together responsible for about 38% of emissions – would formally ratify the deal is therefore a major step towards achieving that.  Before Saturday, only 24 countries – responsible for about 1% of global emissions – had ratified the agreement, while 180 had signed it.  Shortly before Obama landed in Hangzhou, China became the 25th country to ratify the agreement. It said the move would “safeguard environmental security” and was “conducive to China’s development interests”.  Song said the move increased the likelihood that the Paris deal would be implemented by the end of this year, possibly even before November’s UN climate summit in Marrakesh. “This would not be happening without the US and China ratifying the agreement,” he said. Climate campaigners now expected a ratification “surge” in September, with other major emitters such as Brazil, the world’s seventh largest emitter, following suit, Song added.  Li Shuo, Greenpeace’s China climate policy adviser, said that if the international community did succeed in bringing the Paris deal into effect by the end of 2016 it would have been achieved “at lightening speed” compared with most international treaties.  Under Obama and Xi, US-China relations have been blighted by friction over issues such as the South China Sea, cyber espionage and, more recently, a planned missile defense system in South Korea.  But Sam Geall, the executive editor of China Dialogue, a bilingual website dedicated to environmental issues, said the announcement underscored how Beijing and Washington had managed to find common ground on climate change.  He said a breakthrough towards a UN deal on climate change had been on the cards since November 2014 when Obama and Xi jointly announced a secretly negotiated agreement to slash greenhouse gas emissions. Geall said: “Certainly in terms of US-China relations, it is the one area where they have created a proper, active, cooperative relationship … [There are] a lot of flights back and forward, a lot of cooperative projects on coal, on renewables, on energy-efficient buildings, on innovation. There is a lot of substance beneath the announcements that come out. Geall added: “I do think it is part of Obama’s legacy and it’s surprising that it hasn’t been talked about all that much in that context actually. He managed to help get something really constructive going after the failure of [the 2009 climate summit in] Copenhagen.”  Geall said China’s leaders, who have vowed to cut coal consumption and draw 20% of the country’s energy from non-fossil fuels by 2030, also deserved praise for their commitment to cleaning up. “Not only is it the one area where there is productive US-China cooperation, but it is the one area where China is actively behaving like a superpower and they are actually taking on the responsibility of having that immense weight in the emissions talks. They really have shown some leadership and that has been reflected through the UN climate process.” Beijing’s resolve was the result of a growing awareness of the dangers of pollution and climate change and how “there is a national interest in China in the low carbon transition and in being the leading suppliers of the clean technologies that we will need in a carbon-constrained world”.  Jake Schmidt of the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council said: “Only a few short years ago, countries were trying to drag the US and China into the global climate agreements and now these two countries are among the first to join the new legal regime. That is an important shift in the dynamic.” Nick Mabey of the UK-based environmental thinktank, E3G, said: “US and Chinese ratification sends a strong signal to investors and businesses that they can continue investing on the assumption that the Paris climate deal will be delivered.” Bob Ward of the London School of Economics said the move would encourage other countries to move quickly and added: “Importantly, it should also make it more difficult for Donald Trump to renege on the Paris agreement if he becomes president of the US.” The announcement came on day one of what is likely to be Obama’s last visit to Asia as president. Nick Bisley, an international relations professor from La Trobe University in Melbourne, said the pre-G20 Obama-Xi summit was part of a final “love-in” between the two leaders. The upbeat farewell was symptomatic of the “really complex relationship” that now existed between the two powers. “On the one hand, the geopolitics of it is really becoming fraught. And yet around economic areas and a few other policy sectors there is actually quite a reasonable amount of cooperation and positive connections going on,” Bisley said. “It’s not a simple: we’re either involved in an arm wrestle or we are not.” Li, the Greenpeace activist, described the announcement as “an important political move [that] completes a cycle in the cooperation between these two countries”.  But with US elections on the horizon and the possibility of Donald Trump, who has dismissed climate change as a Chinese conspiracy, becoming president, Li said there were fears political change might undo the progress achieved by the US and China. “We simply can’t afford any backsliding,” he said, adding: “Here I think I worry definitely more about the US side.”"
"The Climate Change Authority has advised the Australian government to institute two emissions trading schemes and strengthen regulations in order to meet Australia’s 2030 emission reduction targets and to allow it to lift those targets in line with international climate change obligations. The move is expected to put pressure on the new environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, to strengthen Australia’s climate policies but it has received a mixed response.  Some commentators are critical of the report for making recommendations on how the government can reach its existing 2030 emissions targets yet not considering how it can meet its obligations made in Paris last year to keep warming “well below” 2C. As Guardian Australia revealed on Tuesday, two members of the authority were so outraged by the lack of ambition that they vowed to produce a dissenting “minority report”. Wendy Craik, the chair of the Climate Change Authority, said: “The authority found that one size cannot fit all of the many opportunities that exist to reduce emissions across our economy. Australia needs a set of measures – in other words, a policy toolkit – that is well calibrated to capture reductions in different sectors.” The “special review” and associated electricity modelling report recommended an intensity-based scheme for the electricity sector, where dirtier operations are more heavily penalised. It said the baseline should be reduced over time, and reach zero “well before 2050”. Generators would have access to credits to help them stay within the baselines, making the system a type of emissions trading scheme. The review also recommended the government strengthen its “safeguards” policy, which sets limits on how much greenhouse gas Australia’s biggest polluters can emit but is now so generous it doesn’t act to reduce emissions. It says the baselines should decline over time, “in line with Australia’s Paris commitments”, and be extended to apply to more facilities. The review said facilities covered by the safeguards mechanism could trade carbon credits to help reduce emissions, making the system a second emissions trading scheme. “We also think that an enhanced safeguard mechanism offers a pragmatic and durable way of reducing emissions across a range of industrial, manufacturing and resource sectors,” Craik said. For sectors not covered by those two policies, the review recommended a suite of regulations, including emissions reduction standards for light vehicles, and recommended a “cost-benefit analysis” be conducted to examine carbon dioxide standards for heavy vehicles. Energy efficiency information and regulations for buildings and homes should be continued and strengthened, the review recommended. It also called for an examination of the policies to be conducted every five years, starting in 2022. In a media release, Craik said the report did not seek to reassess Australia’s 2030 targets, instead focusing on “policy actions that Australia should take to meet its Paris obligations”. But since Australia’s 2030 targets are widely acknowledged as inconsistent with agreements made at Paris, some people – including two members of the authority –think the organisation has not met the terms of reference for its review. The review was commissioned by the government in December 2014 to advise it as to whether Australia should institute an emissions trading scheme, and was ordered to consider any international agreements Australia has entered into. In December 2015 Australia signed the Paris agreement, in which governments agreed to limit global warming to “well below 2C” and to aim to limit it to just 1.5C. That imposes a global carbon budget beyond which the world must move to zero net carbon emissions. The government now has a target to reduce carbon emissions to between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by 2030 – and the authority has made recommendations on how to meet that goal.  The Climate Institute released a report last week showing if Australia stuck to that target it would need to then reduce emissions to zero within five years to stay within its carbon budget. The Greens’ climate and energy spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the government needed to listen to the authority’s call to strengthen policy, which he said it had made despite being “stacked” with Coalition appointments. But Bandt was critical of the authority’s recommendations not being aimed at meeting Australia’s Paris obligations. “The final report of the special review backs the renewable energy target and outlines a range of potentially useful policies but they fail to add up to what the authority last year said is needed,” he said. “Since original chair respected former RBA Governor Bernie Fraser resigned and the Abbott appointees took their position, we’ve seen less of the ‘frank and fearless’ advice expected of an independent institution.” Erwin Jackson from the Climate Institute said his initial impressions of the report were that it had some valuable recommendations. “But the package as a whole is not balanced against the need to deliver what it has signed up to in Paris,” he told Guardian Australia. “The emissions pathway that is implied in the report will use up 90% of the carbon budget by 2030,” Jackson said. “Paris has a number of objectives that the authority was required to consider. Those objectives are to limit warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees.  “The fundamentals of climate science say that if you emit a lot in the short term, you need to emit a lot less in the long term. So if these policies are implemented as they currently stand, after 2030, to meet the Paris objectives, carbon prices would need to skyrocket, coal plants would need to be closed in a matter of years and renewables investments would need to be scaled up beyond reasonable levels.” The review periods of five years wouldn’t be enough to help Australia ratchet up its ambitions, Jackson said, since the first review would happen in 2022, two years after the government will be expected to update its targets. Jackson was critical of the authority for “second guessing” the politics rather than producing objective advice."

"The decision by China and the US, the world’s two biggest greenhouse gas emitters, to ratify the landmark Paris accord on climate change heralds a new era of global cooperation on limiting emissions. Only a few years ago, such a commitment looked like a pipe dream. Today, with the two most powerful nations on board, the United Nations can celebrate a victory on this world-changing issue that has been more than 20 years in the making. President Obama’s commitment is particularly significant in its timing. The presidential contender Donald Trump has vowed to unpick the Paris accord if elected, but if it were to come into force before he came into office, that would become difficult if not impossible under US law and political conventions. But vital though the joint declaration is, it is not yet enough to bring the Paris agreement into force, nor halt the impacts of human activities on the climate. Making this work in practice will take much more. First is the task of getting more nations to ratify. The US and China make up about 39% of global emissions. Under the foundation treaty, the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, at least 55 countries must ratify for the agreement to enter force, and countries accounting for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions must be represented. With China, the US and a host of smaller countries signed up, the biggest emitter left outstanding is the EU, which negotiated the agreement as a bloc. The EU is unlikely to be able to ratify the accord any time soon, because of the mechanics of getting legal surety from its 28 member states. There is a way around this. Nicholas Stern, chairman of the Grantham Institute on Climate Change and author of the landmark 2006 report on the economics of climate change, called on EU member states and the UK to ratify the agreement individually, through their national parliaments, to speed up the process. EU members are legally parties to the accord at a national as well as a bloc level, so if enough major countries – including the UK and Germany – were to enact the necessary processes then the accord could pass the final hurdle. “This is a tremendous opportunity,” Stern told the Guardian. “It’s very important for the credibility of the process [of gaining global agreement on climate action through the UN] to get the treaty ratified this year. EU countries can and should ratify as soon as possible. It’s not sensible to hold back, when they could make a big difference.” The second, and more important, problem is that the agreement itself – the first that is both legally binding and likely to cover all countries – is just the beginning. The document, reached at a historic conference last December after 20 years of tortuous stop-start talks, commits countries to holding global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, which scientists regard as the limit of safety, beyond which climate change is likely to have catastrophic and irreversible effects. It does not specify what actions countries must take. Nearly all signatories set out targets on cutting their future greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2020, when current commitments expire. But the cuts in carbon dioxide implied by those targets will not be enough to hold to the 2C threshold, let alone limit the world to the 1.5C of warming included as an “aspiration” and required to save the globe’s most low-lying areas.  In addition, though the framework is legally binding, the commitments on emissions are not. National governments will be relied upon to flesh out their targets themselves, through policies that could be controversial and perhaps expensive in the short term, such as pursuing renewable energy and leaving fossil fuels unexploited. That process has barely begun for many. Green campaigners called on national governments to act urgently both to fulfil the legal pledges of the Paris accord, and the moral promises made to their people to halt dangerous climate change. Li Shuo, senior policy advisor for east Asia at Greenpeace, said: “Political ambition must keep up with rising sea levels faced by vulnerable communities. Touting the Paris ‘triumph’ while handing out money to the fossil fuel industry is simply not compatible with the Paris agreement. Governments must keep coal, oil and gas in the ground, and urgently focus on a just transition to renewables. The G20 meeting must be the moment when leaders lay out a timetable for eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, a practice which the Paris agreement has made all the more hypocritical.” Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, added: “Countries need to commit to even deeper cuts than they promised in Paris and they need to enact policies to turn warm words into meaningful action.” Early ratification would give governments the spur needed to formulate new policies on limiting carbon, and give businesses a clear signal that they should invest in reducing their impact on the climate, said Nick Mabey, chief executive of the E3G thinktank. “[The US and China announcement] sends a strong signal to investors and businesses that they can continue investing on the assumption that the Paris [commitments] will be delivered,” he told the Guardian. “At a time of increasing geopolitical turbulence this sends a welcome signal that cooperation to tackling climate change is resilient to worsening relations among the world’s superpowers.” Jake Schmidt, director at the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council, added that other governments must take note. “The US and China are sending a powerful signal to other countries that the time for action is now,” he said. “It shows to countries and investors that the world’s two largest economies and biggest polluters are preparing to help lead the shift to a low-carbon economy. Only a few short years ago, countries were trying to drag the US and China into the global climate agreements, and now these two are among the first to join the new legal regime. That is an important shift, which reflects the reality that countries now realise acting on climate change is in their own self-interest and failing to act is no longer a smart choice.” The UK’s position, as the government negotiates exit from the EU, is of particular concern, as UK support over the course of more than two decades of UN climate negotiations has been a key influence.  Childs told the Guardian that the prime minister should not delay, saying: “It’s up to Theresa May to make sure that the UK ratifies the agreement too, and quickly. Otherwise the UK will go from being leader to laggard on climate change.”"
"Malcolm Roberts promised, and Malcolm Roberts delivered. After announcing on Facebook that he would address the threat to Australian sovereignty from “Agenda 21”, he raised it in his first speech as an Australian senator. After extended remarks intended to refute the scientific consensus on climate change, and a comparison of himself to Socrates, Roberts said that:  people are waking to the UN destroying our national sovereignty through implementation of the UN’s 1975 Lima declaration and 1992 Rio declaration for 21st century global governance, often known as Agenda 21 – more recently as Agenda 2030.  Roberts said that following the then-Keating government signing the Rio Declaration in 1992, it has been “sneakily implemented by ministers of every government since under the guise of biodiversity to steal property rights, sustainability to pass regulations controlling people and climate change to push foreign control using unlawful agreements like the Paris sham”. For these and other reasons, Roberts wants Australia to leave the UN.  What is he talking about? In reality, the Rio Declaration is an entirely nonbinding and voluntary agreement which 178 countries entered into at the Rio Earth Summit almost a quarter of a century ago.  Its aim was to promote a vision of sustainable development by combatting poverty, disease and overpopulation; fostering conservation, atmospheric protection, pollution controls and biodiversity; and by establishing a greater role in all of this for non-state actors like women’s groups, young people, NGOs and business.  It also promoted local participation – many cities and local authorities around the world have signed up to ICLEI – also known as Local Governments for Sustainability – which encourages their participation in implementing Agenda 21 initiatives.  It’s not a treaty, does not override national sovereignty and does not allow the UN to dictate what governments do. It has no legal force and is not intended to be implemented in a top-down way.  Nevertheless, almost as soon as it was inked, Agenda 21 became the focus of conspiracy thinking, which at first mostly came from the far right.  The main thrust of most of those conspiracy theories echoes Roberts’s remarks to the Senate: Agenda 21 is in fact a UN plan to deprive nations of their sovereignty, and individuals of their property rights.  On the fringes of the right, a benign agreement encouraging social and environmental stewardship became a disguised attempt to impose global communism on free citizens.  Tom DeWeese, an American rightwing activist who heads up the American Policy Center, was one of the earliest critics of the agreement, and has remained consistent in his claim that sustainable development is a “utopian, socialist nightmare”.  Like Roberts, DeWeese wants his country to pull out of the UN, and also cites the erosion of national sovereignty and property rights as the main dangers posed by Agenda 21, which is voluminously attacked on his website.  The John Birch Society – infamous for its decades-long crusade against imagined communist conspiracies – also played a key early role in pushing the idea that Agenda 21 was communism in another guise.  During the late 1990s, the burgeoning militia movement in the US took the view that Agenda 21 was part of a grand plan to institute one world government – the plan for sustainable development was the first step on a road that would lead to the UN’s black helicopters landing on the White House lawn to dismantle the Republic.  This belief has persisted on the armed, radical right – the Bundy occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge last January was driven in part by the idea that local ranchers were being deprived of grazing rights under the aegis of Agenda 21.  In recent years, though, paranoia about Agenda 21 has become mainstream via rightwing media stars and politicians. Probably the most important advocate has been Glenn Beck, who has spruiked the conspiracy theory on television and radio.  He even authored a dystopian science fiction novel which envisaged an America under the yoke of global, environmentalist government.  The blurb provides a neat summary of the fear at the heart of anti-Agenda 21 activism:  Just a generation ago, this place was called America. Now, after the worldwide implementation of a UN-led program called Agenda 21, it’s simply known as “the Republic.” There is no president. No Congress. No Supreme Court. No freedom. As usual, the real danger in far right beliefs is the way in which they cross over into mainstream conservative politics.  Mainstream political figures in the US – among them former presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Newt Gingrich – have warned in dark terms about the danger posed by Agenda 21.  As the theory caught on among the Republican grassroots in the last decade, several US state houses passed resolutions condemning it, and Alabama even passed a law specifically aimed at its imagined danger to property rights.  And in Australia, Nick Minchin, a former Howard government minister and mentor to current rightwing powerbroker Cory Bernardi, voiced similar sentiments to the anti-Agenda 21 movement without naming the agreement.  On efforts to combat climate change, Minchin told the ABC’s Four Corners in 2009 that:  For the extreme left, it provides the opportunity to do what they have always wanted to do, which is to sort of de-industrialise the western world. The collapse of communism was a disaster for the left and, really, they embraced environment as their new religion. Malcolm Roberts couldn’t have said it better.  In general, the debate about climate change in Australia has been poisoned by a belief – shared by the far right and some mainstream conservatives – that climate science is basically a leftist plot. Roberts continues this tradition.  Some will dismiss him as a harmless kook, and point out that One Nation are nowhere near the levers of power. But in a finely balanced Senate, in which Roberts’ beliefs are effectively shared with some members of the Liberal party, it’s not a stretch to think that Roberts will be able to act to prolong delays in this country coming up with an effective response to climate change.  The danger of the far right, as always, is in their relationships with ostensibly mainstream actors, and the way in which their conspiracy thinking affects policy. "
"The UK must immediately kickstart an industry to capture and bury carbon emissions in order to save consumers billions a year from the cost of meeting climate change targets, according to a high-level advisory group appointed by ministers. This requires the setting up of a new state-backed company to create the network needed to pipe the emissions into exhausted oil and gas fields under the North Sea, the group said.   With this government backing, carbon capture and storage (CCS) could deliver clean electricity at a lower cost than an expanded Hinkley Point nuclear power station and almost all renewables, the group’s report states. A CCS industry could also provide thousands of jobs, particularly in industrial heartlands such as Teesside and Grangemouth, and help reverse the fortunes of the declining North Sea fossil fuel industry. It could even tackle the major problem of cutting emissions from gas boilers, by enabling clean-burning hydrogen to be pumped into the grid. Failing to deliver CCS would hugely increase the cost of tackling climate change, according to the government’s official climate advisors, the National Audit Office and the UN’s climate science panel.  But in November the government made a shock decision to cancel a £1bn CCS development competition at the last minute, citing high costs. The new report, commissioned in the aftermath by then energy secretary Amber Rudd, says using a state-backed company would slash the price. “Money spent now will save money later,” said Lord Ron Oxburgh, an independent member of the House of Lords and former chairman of Shell Transport and Trading, who led the report. “CCS is a priority for Britain if our 2050 climate goals are to be achieved at least expense. Government intervention and leadership is crucial and, in common with major projects such as the delivery of the London Olympics, the role of the public sector will be crucial in the early years.” “There were a number of people in our group that were sceptical that this really was the least-cost way forward, but even our hard-nosed bankers and businessmen agreed,” he said. Lord Oxburgh said, despite the technology being ready, no commercial company could justify investing in the CCS pipe network by itself: “There is no serious commercial incentive and it will stay that way unless the state demonstrates there is a business there.” Prof Stuart Haszeldine, a CCS expert at Edinburgh University and a member of the advisory group, said another crucial immediate action is to take into temporary public ownership the offshore pipelines to the gas fields of Atlantic, Goldeneye and Hamilton, which are imminently due to be decommissioned but would be ideal for transporting CO2 to storage sites. The report will be presented to Rudd’s successor, Greg Clark, who is secretary of state at the new Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). A spokeswoman for BEIS said the recommendations of the report would be carefully considered, but that the costs of CCS had to be competitive if it was to play a part in the long-term decarbonisation of the UK’s economy.  “We will need a range of technologies as we create a clean energy future but above all we must ensure they are affordable,” she said. The report argues this can be achieved for CCS if the government immediately sets up a state-backed company which would then build gas-fired power stations with CCS technology and develop the network to transport and bury the CO2.  With the pipes in place, the company would then be able to take and store CO2 from other power and industrial plants, charging for the service. Income would come from the levies on consumer energy bills that currently support low carbon electricity such as renewables and nuclear power. The report says support of £85/MWh would be sufficient, cheaper than all renewables bar onshore wind – now virtually halted by the government – and Hinkley Point C. The company would need £200-£300m of government seed funding, the report says, with private investors providing the rest. Once established, the power plants could be privatised and the transport and storage enterprise run as a regulated utility with prices capped, like a water company.  “It is not government subsidy, this is government investment, and with any luck the government will get its money back and better as time goes on,” said Lord Oxburgh. CCS could capture 40% of the UK’s emissions by 2050, according to the report, saving up to £5bn a year compared to alternative strategies. CCS could also potentially enable hydrogen to solve the problem of cutting the emissions from the nation’s gas boilers and stoves, currently 25% of all emissions and a major factor in the UK’s imminent failure to meet clean energy targets. Natural gas can be converted to hydrogen and the CO2 produced buried using CCS. The hydrogen, which produces only water when burned, could then replace the gas in the national grid. This could also provide fuel for hydrogen-powered cars, as well as cutting the significant air pollution caused by gas boilers. Lord Oxburgh said he only partly blamed the big fossil fuel companies for not developing CCS themselves, in order to protect their businesses from climate change laws: “Ultimately you have to answer to your shareholders. As far as they are concerned, if you have a company that is doing alright and making money, why waste time and money doing something that may or may not pay off?  “It really has to do with how convinced people were that the government was serious about climate change. Once the government really shows its commitment, CCS will take off.”"
"A new study by scientists at Stanford University, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, tested whether hotter temperatures and higher carbon dioxide levels that we’ll see post-2050 will benefit the kinds of plants that live in California grasslands. They found that carbon dioxide at higher levels than today (400 ppm) did not significantly change plant growth, while higher temperatures had a negative effect.  Those who benefit from the status quo of burning copious amounts of fossil fuels love to argue that more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will benefit plant life. It’s a favorite claim of climate contrarians like Matt Ridley and Rupert Murdoch. World growing greener with increased carbon. Thirty years of satellite evidence. Forests growing faster and thicker.  It seems like a great counter-argument to the fact that carbon dioxide is a dangerous pollutant – a fact that contrarians often dispute. However, reality is far more complicated than the oversimplification of ‘CO2 is plant food.’ Unlike in the controlled environment of a greenhouse, the increasing greenhouse effect on Earth causes temperatures to rise and the climate to change in various ways that can be bad for plant life. We can’t control all the other variables the way we can in a greenhouse. So far, as contrarians like Rupert Murdoch love to point out, the plant food effect has won out. Earth has become greener in recent decades (although that trend may now be reversing). The situation is not unlike a human diet – at relatively low calorie levels, more food is beneficial. But as calorie intake continues to rise, at a certain point it’s no longer benefiting the human body. More food is good, but only up to a certain point, as the global obesity epidemic makes clear. The Stanford scientists set up 132 plots of flowers and grass in California and introduced varying levels of carbon dioxide, temperature, water, and nitrogen. The scientists conducted the experiments over 16 growing seasons between 1998 and 2014. They found that only higher nitrogen levels resulted in higher plant productivity, while higher temperatures caused it to decline.  While this experiment was specific to California grasslands, other studies have similarly undermined the ‘more CO2 is great’ myth. For example, a 2012 paper found that higher temperatures are detrimental to French corn yields. While French corn production has increased steadily in recent decades due to a combination of technological improvements and CO2 fertilization (the former far more than the latter), yields have leveled off in recent years, and were particularly low when struck by heat waves. A significant reduction in maize yield is found for each day with a maximum temperature above 32°C, in broad agreement with previous estimates. The recent increase in such hot days has likely contributed to the observed yield stagnation. Another study published in Nature Climate Change last week concluded that higher temperatures will cause wheat production to decline. Just a 1°C rise in global temperature will decrease wheat yields by about 5% (approximately 35 million tons). Climate change is bad news for several of our staple crops. The evidence thus suggests we’re at or near the point where rising atmospheric CO2 levels will no longer benefit overall plant growth, while the rising heat that comes along with that carbon are generally detrimental to plant productivity. There are also many ways in which dumping more carbon pollution into the atmosphere has negative effects, on plants and also animal species. Climate change is causing increased heat waves, flooding, and other extreme weather events; national security threats; ocean acidification; sea level rise; wide-scale species extinctions; and so on. There will certainly be some positive climate change outcomes as well, but all evidence suggests the negatives will far outweigh the positives. Cherry picking one possible positive outcome and ignoring all the negatives as an excuse to maintain the status quo is simply a failure of basic risk management. And with a threat as dangerous as global climate change, engaging in proper risk management is incredibly important. Failure is simply not an option."
"More than one in 10 of the UK’s wildlife species are threatened with extinction and the numbers of the nation’s most endangered creatures have plummeted by two-thirds since 1970, according to a major report. The abundance of all wildlife has also fallen, with one in six animals, birds, fish and plants having been lost, the State of Nature report found.   Together with historical deforestation and industrialisation, these trends have left the UK “among the most nature-depleted countries in the world”, with most of the country having gone past the threshold at which “ecosystems may no longer reliably meet society’s needs”. The comprehensive scientific report, compiled by more than 50 conservation organisations, spells out the destructive impact of intensive farming, urbanisation and climate change on habitats from farmland and hills to rivers and the coast. It found that the fall in wildlife over the last four decades cannot be blamed on past harm, but has continued in recent years. “It wasn’t just all back in 70s and 80s, it is still happening now,” said Mark Eaton, at RSPB and the lead author of the report. “We are getting ever more efficient in our farming. In a way it is something to be celebrated, how good our farming science and technology is, but it does squeeze nature out.” Eaton said that there were good examples of wildlife and habitat recovery, but such projects were too few to turn the tide, with public funding for biodiversity having fallen by 32% from 2008 to 2015. “The ability to do it is within our grasp, it is just about resources and the willingness,” he said. Sir David Attenborough, who wrote the foreword to the report, said: “The natural world is in serious trouble and it needs our help as never before. We continue to lose the precious wildlife that enriches our lives and is essential to the health and well-being of those who live in the UK.” “But the State of Nature 2016 report gives us cause for hope too,” he said. “Landscapes are being restored, special places defended, struggling species being saved and brought back. But we need to build significantly on this progress if we are to provide a bright future for nature and for people.” Nature provides economic and health benefits of about £30bn a year, according to a 2011 government analysis. Overall, the new report found that 56% of species declined between 1970 and 2013, and 53% between 2002 and 2013. While the rest of the species were increasing, Eaton said: “We are seeing a lot of turmoil, some species going up really, really fast and some going down equally fast. It does not look like a healthy, natural situation. If that carries on, you end up with just 50% left.” Insects and other invertebrates, which make up 97% of all animal species, are particularly struggling, with 59% in decline since 1970. These provide vital services such as pollination and keep soils healthy, said Eaton: “The work they do for us is just immense. If they were to disappear, I think we’d see environmental breakdown very quickly. They are about the most important things out there.” Among the species in decline, great crested newts, hedgehogs and corn marigolds have suffered from changes in farming practices. The draining of bogs has harmed the large marsh grasshopper, while the degradation of heaths has caused the sand lizard population to fall.  Urbanisation is a cause of falling water vole numbers, while bottom trawling offshore has harmed the ocean quahog, a bivalve which can live for 500 years. Climate change has brought both hazards and opportunities, with the mountain ringlet butterfly seeing its range contract, while new fish are migrating into warmer UK waters, perhaps filling a gap left by overfishing in previous years. The toad, skylark and beetles such as the wormwood moonshine are among the species of special conservation concern in the UK that have fallen in number by 67% since 1970 overall, and by 12% between 2002 and 2013.  However, some bats, including the soprano pipistrelle, have increased thanks to new legal protection and the creation of new reedbeds has enabled bitterns to recover from just 11 booming males in 1997 to 156 in 2015. Some species have also been reintroduced, including the hazel dormice, the large blue butterfly and the short-haired bumblebee. The report includes a new “biodiversity intactness index”, which analyses the loss of species over centuries. The UK has lost significantly more nature over the long term than the global average, the report said, with the UK the 29th lowest out of 218 countries.  “It is quite shocking where we stand compared to the rest of the world, even compared to other western European countries: France and Germany are quite a way above us in the rankings,” said Eaton. “The index gives an idea of where we have got to over the centuries, and we are pretty knackered.” A spokeswoman for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said: “Our natural environment is cleaner and healthier than at any time since the industrial revolution - woodland cover in England is at its highest level since the 14th century, we have improved water quality in 9,000 miles of rivers since 2010 and in the last five years almost 19,000 miles of hedgerow have been planted.” The government’s own assessment, published in August, found that much of England’s best-loved wildlife remains in serious decline, with 75% of over 200 “priority” species across the country falling in number. The Defra spokeswoman said: “Protecting our precious environment and supporting our world-leading farmers, a cornerstone of our economy, will form an important part of our EU exit negotiations,” she said. Eaton said the EU referendum result presented an opportunity for change: “There was a lot of nervousness about Brexit on the conservation side, but the opportunity to take control of where public money goes on farming is huge. It’s public money, so let’s see a wider range of public benefits from it, including wildlife, water quality and flood prevention, other than just food.” The National Trust and a group of Conservative MPs have made similar calls. About 75% of the UK’s landscape is classed as agricultural, with 40% consisting of arable fields and grasslands. The report found “agricultural change was by far the most significant driver of declines”, as a result of switching from spring to autumn sowing, which reduces food and habitat for many species, intensification of grazing, increased use of pesticides and fertilisers and loss of marginal habitats, such as ponds and hedgerows.  The report said environmental stewardship schemes carried out by some farmers were beneficial but remained at a small scale: “At present, the hoped-for widespread recovery of farmland wildlife is yet to be seen.” NFU vice-president, Guy Smith, said intensification of farming had ended in the early 1990s: “Therefore it makes little sense to attribute cause and effect to ‘the intensification of agriculture’ in the UK in the last quarter of a century when there hasn’t been any. Other causes acknowledged in the report, such as urbanisation, climate change or increasing predator pressure need greater attention.” He said two thirds of farmers have signed up for agri-environment schemes. “Above all we need to remember farming is here to provide one of the fundamental staples to life: food,” said Smith. “If we undermine British farming’s competitiveness or its ability to produce food, we risk exporting food production out of Britain and increasing Britain’s reliance on imports to feed itself.”"

"On a balmy evening last week in north Wales, the bats were flitting about, the blackberries were as large as grapes, the little winberries on the Berwyn hills were as sweet as sugar and the rowan trees were bowed down with berries. It was nearly as warm at 9pm in Chirk as it was in Lagos. Welcome to early autumn 2016. After a very wet and notably mild winter, a soggy spring and a warmer-than-average summer, much of Britain has been basking in tropical-style humidity and temperatures.  That combination of a mild winter, early rain and late summer warmth could result in fine autumn colours as well as splendid fruit, nut, mushroom and seed harvests, say ecologists, farmers and producers. “The autumn should be spectacular for fruit and nuts,” says Matthew Oates, a conservationist with the National Trust. “It’s been an extraordinarily good year for beech nuts, and also for rowans and hawthorns.” There will be plenty of holly for Christmas, he says, and anyone hoping to make a crab apple jelly to accompany their Sunday roasts will be spoilt for choice as the fruit look set to be particularly good this year. The mild wet winter and the resulting vegetation growth will have a downside this autumn, however, says Oates. “It’s a serious slug year. They could do a lot of damage to the mushrooms.” Mycologists say this year’s mushroom harvest is promising, but in some areas slugs may be the only things enjoying them this autumn. Many foragers reacted in horror to the total ban on picking imposed in the New Forest last week by the Forestry Commission. An autumn harvest traditionally enjoyed by hundreds of local people is to be stopped for the first time in centuries on the premise that gangs of commercial foragers are sweeping the woodland clean of all fungi. “There is absolutely no evidence that picking fungi causes harm, and no evidence of these ‘gangs’,” says Daniel Butler, a mycologist and forager from mid-Wales. “In the end a mushroom is just a fruiting body. Picking no more harms future crops than harvesting apples damages the tree. If the authorities are still determined to limit mushroom harvesting, why stop there? What makes a mushroom different from a blackberry? “Since the Norman conquest we have all had certain foraging rights. Provided we are in a place where we are entitled to be, like a footpath, nature reserve, Forestry Commission woodland or urban park, we can gather flowers, foliage, fruit and fungi for personal consumption.” Blackberry pickers in some parts of the country may have a wait before they can fill their plastic boxes with fruit. Oates says blackberries have generally been later this year: “In the Cotswolds they are only just getting going because the bushes flowered late. Since then the weather has generally been too dry for them, but they are coming now.” While some householders may have already noticed a sudden abundance of house spiders scuttling across their floors as mating season gets under way, reports in some areas of the press of billions of “daddy-longlegs”, or crane flies, about to invade Britain may not be quite accurate, according to Matt Shardlow of conservation charity Buglife. “I don’t know where that idea comes from but this hasn’t been a brilliant year for insects,” he says. “The government’s State of Nature report, which is published next week, will show 60% of invertebrates in decline and a huge loss of bio-abundance.” He says the situation of bumble and solitary bee species this year is really shocking and worse than expected. “A new paper by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology looked at 60 species and found that 40% have distribution declines greater than 10% as a result of a group of systemic pesticides called neonics,” he says. “This is worst-case-scenario stuff.” Hundreds of volunteer observers working with the Woodland Trust’s nature’s calendar survey have so far recorded little autumn leaf colour compared with 2015. Kate Lewthwaite, the trust’s citizen science manager, says: “Beech, silver birch, ash and oak trees are all significantly behind where they were last year.” But she says there are already signs that migratory birds are preparing to leave earlier than they did in 2015. “There have been more recordings of house martins, swifts and swallows [leaving] compared with this time last year.” When the leaves do begin to change, the colours are expected to be stunning. A mild autumn could mean prolonged colour well into November, says Andrew Smith, director of the Forestry Commission’s Westonbirt national arboretum in Gloucestershire. “The abundant rain we experienced in spring, coupled with above-average amounts of sunshine, has meant a great growing season, which allows trees to build up plenty of sugars in their leaves,” he says. Joe Daniels of the Forestry Commission’s Grizedale forest, in the southern Lake District, says that while birches and sycamores are just changing, the oak is a bit behind. “We’re hoping there will be good colours this year,” he says. “If we get some nice crisp mornings it will be really lovely.” The owners of Britain’s 500-odd vineyards, which last year produced nearly five million bottles of wine, are among those hoping the heat lasts a few more weeks. “We are quietly optimistic. Grape picking will start probably in two weeks’ time … but the bulk will be in mid-October,” says Julia Trustram Eve of marketing body English Wine Producers. “The next few weeks are crucial. The grapes are healthy, and the vines are healthy. It may not be a vintage year after the poor start we had, but a few weeks’ warmth now will help.” The apple industry thinks 2016 will see growers match last years’s record haul. “There’s been a huge renaissance in the English apple,” says Adrian Barlow, chair of trade body English Apples and Pears. “We will have record crops of Gala, the most popular apple in the UK by far, but we could do with some cold nights to put colour into the skins. The sunshine has been great for the sugar content.” Farmers report a mixed year but the prolonged hot, dry weather in Norfolk has resulted in one of the earliest ever cereal harvests, says Kit Papworth, a large Norfolk farm contractor. “We had an extraordinary run of weather and plenty of combine capacity. Our costs have been lower – we’ve cut all the winter crops without having to start the drier, which has never happened before – and probably won’t happen again in my lifetime.” One of the best British harvests this year will be sunshine, says the Solar Trade Association (STA). New government figures show there is now a total installed capacity of 9.79 gigawatts of solar power, making the UK, which now has 800,000 homes generating solar electricity and 200,000 solar hot water, the sixth-biggest generator in the world – ahead of much sunnier France and Spain. STA head of external affairs Leonie Green says: “Total generation from solar rose by 41% between January and March compared with 2015. It peaked in August at 23.9% of UK electricity demand, which was a new record.” James Madden of forecasting service Exacta Weather says: “Hot air built up on the near continent will continue to drift across our shores to bring bursts of warm to hot weather in among some other weather types into October. “These bouts of Indian summer-type weather will also be enough to continue the several-month trend of above average temperatures for the next several weeks.” But the Met Office is more cautious. “There will be some drier, brighter periods, particularly in the south and south-east,” says its long range forecast. “Temperatures will be perhaps very warm at first in the south-east, but in general are averaging out close to normal.”"
"It’s getting hot out there. Every one of the past 14 months has broken the global temperature record. Ice cover in the Arctic sea just hit a new low, at 525,000 square miles less than normal. And apparently we’re not doing much to stop it: according to Professor Kevin Anderson, one of Britain’s leading climate scientists, we’ve already blown our chances of keeping global warming below the “safe” threshold of 1.5 degrees.  If we want to stay below the upper ceiling of 2 degrees, though, we still have a shot. But it’s going to take a monumental effort. Anderson and his colleagues estimate that in order to keep within this threshold, we need to start reducing emissions by a sobering 8%–10% per year, from now until we reach “net zero” in 2050. If that doesn’t sound difficult enough, here’s the clincher: efficiency improvements and clean energy technologies will only win us reductions of about 4% per year at most. How to make up the difference is one of the biggest questions of the 21st century. There are a number of proposals out there. One is to capture the CO2 that pours out of our power stations, liquefy it, and store it in chambers deep under the ground. Another is to seed the oceans with iron to trigger huge algae blooms that will absorb CO2. Others take a different approach, such as putting giant mirrors in space to deflect some of the sun’s rays, or pumping aerosols into the stratosphere to create man-made clouds. Unfortunately, in all of these cases either the risks are too dangerous, or we don’t have the technology yet. This leaves us in a bit of a bind. But while engineers are scrambling to come up with grand geo-engineering schemes, they may be overlooking a simpler, less glamorous solution. It has to do with soil. Soil is the second biggest reservoir of carbon on the planet, next to the oceans. It holds four times more carbon than all the plants and trees in the world. But human activity like deforestation and industrial farming – with its intensive ploughing, monoculture and heavy use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides – is ruining our soils at breakneck speed, killing the organic materials that they contain. Now 40% of agricultural soil is classed as “degraded” or “seriously degraded”. In fact, industrial farming has so damaged our soils that a third of the world’s farmland has been destroyed in the past four decades. As our soils degrade, they are losing their ability to hold carbon, releasing enormous plumes of CO2 [pdf] into the atmosphere. There is, however, a solution. Scientists and farmers around the world are pointing out that we can regenerate degraded soils by switching from intensive industrial farming to more ecological methods – not just organic fertiliser, but also no-tillage, composting, and crop rotation. Here’s the brilliant part: as the soils recover, they not only regain their capacity to hold CO2, they begin to actively pull additional CO2 out of the atmosphere. The science on this is quite exciting. A study published recently by the US National Academy of Sciences claims that regenerative farming can sequester 3% of our global carbon emissions. An article in Science suggests it could be up to 15%. And new research from the Rodale Institute in Pennsylvania, although not yet peer-reviewed, says sequestration rates could be as high as 40%. The same report argues that if we apply regenerative techniques to the world’s pastureland as well, we could capture more than 100% of global emissions. In other words, regenerative farming may be our best shot at actually cooling the planet. Yet despite having the evidence on their side, proponents of regenerative farming – like the international farmers’ association La Via Campesina – are fighting an uphill battle. The multinational corporations that run the industrial food system seem to be dead set against it because it threatens their monopoly power – power that relies on seeds linked to patented chemical fertilisers and pesticides. They are well aware that their methods are causing climate change, but they insist that it’s a necessary evil: if we want to feed the world’s growing population, we don’t have a choice – it’s the only way to secure high yields. Scientists are calling their bluff. First of all, feeding the world isn’t about higher yields; it’s about fairer distribution. We already grow enough food for 10 billion people. In any case, it can be argued that regenerative farming actually increases crop yields over the long term by enhancing soil fertility and improving resilience against drought and flooding. So as climate change makes farming more difficult, this may be our best bet for food security, too. The battle here is not just between two different methods. It is between two different ways of relating to the land: one that sees the soil as an object from which profit must be extracted at all costs, and one that recognizes the interdependence of living systems and honours the principles of balance and harmony. Ultimately, this is about more than just soil. It is about something much larger. As Pope Francis put it in his much-celebrated encyclical last year, our present ecological crisis is the sign of a cultural pathology. “We have come to see ourselves as the lords and masters of the Earth, entitled to plunder her at will. The sickness evident in the soil, in the water, in the air and in all forms of life are symptoms that reflect the violence present in our hearts. We have forgotten that we ourselves are dust of the Earth; that we breathe her air and receive life from her waters.” Maybe our engineers are missing the point. The problem with geo-engineering is that it proceeds from the very same logic that got us into this mess in the first place: one that treats the land as something to be subdued, dominated and consumed. But the solution to climate change won’t be found in the latest schemes to bend our living planet to the will of man. Perhaps instead it lies in something much more down to earth – an ethic of care and healing, starting with the soils on which our existence depends.  Of course, regenerative farming doesn’t offer a permanent solution to the climate crisis; soils can only hold a finite amount of carbon. We still need to get off fossil fuels, and – most importantly – we have to kick our obsession with endless exponential growth and downsize our material economy to bring it back in tune with ecological cycles. But it might buy us some time to get our act together. Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians. Follow @GuardianGDP on Twitter. "

"The Brazilian government has ratified its participation in the Paris agreement on climate change, a significant step by Latin America’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases that could spur other countries to follow suit. With a landmass larger than the continental US, Brazil emits about 2.5% of the world’s carbon dioxide and other polluting gases, according to United Nations data.  “Our government is concerned about the future,” said President Michel Temer during a signing ceremony in Brasilia. “Everything we do today is not aimed at tomorrow, but rather at a future that preserves the living conditions of Brazilians.” Temer said Brazil’s ratification would be presented formally to the UN later this month. The Paris agreement will enter into force once 55 countries representing at least 55% of global emissions have formally joined it. Climate experts say that could happen later this year. Countries set their own targets for reducing emissions. The targets are not legally binding, but nations must update them every five years. Using 2005 levels as the baseline, Brazil committed to cutting emissions 37% by 2025 and an “intended reduction” of 43% by 2030. In the last decade, Brazil has achieved significant emissions cuts thanks to efforts to reduce deforestation in the Amazon and increase in the use of energy from hydropower and other renewable sources including wind, solar and biomass. The Paris accord got a boost earlier this month when the US president, Barack Obama, and China’s President Xi Jinping sealed their nations’ participation. “Brazil is now the next major country to move forward. It will add even greater momentum,” said David Waskow, director of the International Climate Initiative at the Washington, DC-based thinktank the World Resources Institute."
"Professor Colin Green (Letters, 7 September) makes a classic first-world myopic error in believing that the rise in human population is mainly responsible for the impending ecological crisis. It is not numbers of people per se damaging the planet, but frenetic consumption in the wealthy world that lies behind anthropogenic climate change. You can curb family sizes in poor countries all you like – if you have the moral stomach for such gross colonialism and denial of essential human freedoms – but the ecological crisis will remain as long as we live the way we do in the rich world. As Pope Francis puts it in his ecological teaching document, Laudato Si’: “To blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues. It is an attempt to legitimise the present model of distribution, where a minority believes that it has the right to consume in a way which can never be universalised, since the planet could not even contain the waste products of such consumption.”  He does not, however, deny population is a factor in the environment, noting that “attention needs to be paid to imbalances in population density, on both national and global levels, since a rise in consumption would lead to complex regional situations”. But the general point is clear: you do not heal the damage to the planet by eliminating the poor. As Francis says: “a true ecological approach always becomes a social approach; it must integrate questions of justice in debates on the environment, so as to hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor.”Dr Austen IvereighCoordinator, Catholic Voices • While I am enthused by Pope Francis’s recent calls for environmental destruction to be classified as a sin (Report, 1 September), I do wonder if a more nuanced perspective is required. Is it right to classify certain behaviours that cause ecological harm as sin, if there is a lack of knowledge, capacity and choice to take alternative, more environmentally friendly courses of action? For example, is it fair to say I have sinned if I have to drive my gas-guzzling car in the city because of an absence of safe and coordinated cycle infrastructure? Is it fair to say I have sinned if I have to deal with the vast amounts of waste forced upon me by retailers? Or if I depend on oil because alternatives are not provided, or are too expensive? Perhaps the sin lies not with the individual, but instead with the failure by government and policymakers to adequately inform on the issues, and provide structures and incentives for pro-environmental behaviour.Catherine DevittJesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, Dublin  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"
"When Storm Desmond broke the UK’s 24-hour rainfall record with 341.4mm (13.4in) of rain in 24 hours in the Honister Pass in Cumbria on 5 December last year, it did extraordinary damage to the Lake District.  The headlines were about homes and businesses flooded, roads collapsed and bridges washed away. But across this beautiful landscape, one fifth owned by the National Trust, there were many problems.   Rivers moved their courses, paths, fences and historic gardens were swept away, and wildlife havens destroyed. It has taken a whole summer of hard work to repair just some of the havoc caused, with each of the 14 historic bridges on Trust property that needed repair costing more than £10,000 to fix. Because most of the damage caused in this way is uninsurable, the Trust launched an appeal for funds to help with the repair work, and so far, £330,000 has been donated. Since much of the labour is done by volunteers this goes a long way, but according to the Trust, is still nowhere near enough to make the Lake District resilient to future storms. With the rain now falling in ever-heavier downpours, adaptations are being made with large pieces of stone being used that will not be washed away, but culverts are also needed to divert flash flood from vulnerable areas. Sections of path are being rebuilt over pipes to create mini-bridges.  With continuing climate change the Trust predicts an ongoing battle with the elements to keep the Lake District both safe for visitors and to conserve its natural beauty and wildlife. "
"The rains are not what they once were in Kitui County. As climate change bites, the wet season is more erratic and drought has become an all-too-common phenomenon in this rural corner of eastern Kenya. This year, the community’s produce of peas, sorghum and other staples failed to reach maturity because the rains arrived one month late, says Onesmus Mwangangi, an agricultural expert at the charity Farm Africa. “Farmers in this region have lost more than 80% of their crops due to lack of rain,” he adds.  They are not alone. Much of southern Africa is currently suffering consecutive seasons of drought, prompting the Southern African Development Community to declare a regional disaster and to request $2.7bn in aid. If donors were to follow the recent advice of the UN, a proportion of that funding should be spent on so-called drought-resistant seeds. Seeds have been conventionally bred to be more tolerant to low water levels for decades. Plants are either conventionally crossed and then screened to identify those with optimum gene patterns or, more recently, they have been genetically modified (GM) to include the desired DNA traits.  Among the early pioneers of conventional cross-breeding for drought resistance are organisations such as the non-profit International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre and AGRA (supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation). In Kitui County, Farm Africa is already encouraging farmers to adopt drought-tolerant hybrids of traditional crops, with evidence suggesting these seeds use water more efficiently and, in many cases, mature over shorter periods. The big guns of the biotech world are also moving in, with seed giants such as Monsanto, Syngenta and DuPont investing heavily in GM strains of drought-resistant crops for the US, but not yet Africa. The evidence in favour of drought-resistant seeds is strong, says Kate Fehlenberg, from the Drought Tolerant Maize for Africa Seed Scaling project (DTMASS), funded by USAID. Over a five-year period, a total of 2.9 million farmers in 13 African countries covered by an earlier version of the DTMASS project saw their yields increase by 20% to 30% after sowing a variety of drought-tolerant hybrids.  Fehlenberg says that the hurdle has less to do with science and more to do with distribution. “The challenge is to get [the seed] out to the farmers … You can have the best corn in the world but it’s no good if it’s sitting in the freezer.” Some inroads are being made. The Water Efficient Maize for Africa programme, involving Monsanto, for example, saw sales of its drought-tolerant hybrid non-GM seed variety increase by more than 300% last year [pdf], with around 200,000 farmers having used its seeds. Such successes remain relatively isolated, however. In reality, most smallholder farmers in Africa have yet to hear about drought-resistant seed technology. And those that have are still to be convinced. According to an as yet unpublished survey of more than 4,000 farmers by DTMASS, common concerns include the cost, reliability and productivity of these novel seed varieties.  The seed market also needs better regulation, says Fehlenberg. In countries such as Kenya and Tanzania, for example, the sale of fake and falsely labelled seeds is widespread. DTMASS recently set up a seed scaling programme to increase awareness and demand for drought-tolerant varieties among small farmers in Africa. Part of its strategy will be to look beyond formal market channels such as seed companies’ local salespeople and try to access informal farmer networks. There are, however, reservations. Seed sovereignty in particular has become a red-flag issue for many farmer groups in Africa. The drought-tolerant seeds have to be purchased anew every year, unlike traditional seeds, which can be regularly recycled. If seed companies like Monsanto end up controlling the sale of drought-tolerant seeds in Africa in the future, many farmers fear becoming locked into cycles of financial obligation as well as losing control over local systems of food production. The solution, says Clare Oxborrow, senior food and farming campaigner at Friends of the Earth UK, is an approach to seed development, including drought-tolerant seeds, that prioritises local-led breeding and local knowledge.   Seeds are also only one piece of the puzzle, says Fehlenberg. Other important steps to increase resilience to drought include good farm management, effective irrigation, suitable crop insurance, and the use of crops suited to the local climate and soil. With this advice in mind, Farm Africa currently trains farmer groups in agricultural best practices such as manure-based fertility management, water conservation and proper tillage. The charity is also working to provide improved early warning of potentially extreme weather conditions so farmers can better prepare for drought conditions. • This article was amended on 12 September 2016.

"The election of Malcolm Roberts as a One Nation senator has put Australia’s media in a difficult spot. In his first speech to Parliament on Tuesday, Roberts made many false claims about climate change. He said that climate change was a “scam” and implied that it was some sort of conspiracy between all the major international research agencies. “ ... there is no data proving human use of hydro-carbon fuels affects climate,” he said.  Most news outlets had stopped covering the views of climate science deniers in regular reporting. There is a clear scientific consensus that the world is warming and that human carbon emissions have caused it, so reporting the views of a few non-experts who push fanciful theories with no credible evidence is seen as “false balance”. But journalists are in a different position when someone in an important office holds such views.  Discussing whether the Guardian would publish letters from climate change deniers, the readers’ editor wrote in 2013: “Sometimes the identity of a person expressing an opinion is as interesting as the thing being expressed. If a member of the royal family wrote a letter denying that climate change exists the Guardian would almost certainly run it.” Some have argued the media should ignore the views of Roberts. But as a senator his views may affect legislation and the terms of the debate that influence it. So those views are newsworthy, particularly in the early part of his term when many Australians will be becoming aware of him for the first time. Guardian Australia will report them when that is warranted on grounds of public policy debate.  But to avoid repeatedly having to debunk Roberts’ views, we have produced a handy reference list of his main arguments, as outlined on the ABC’s Q&A program on 15 August. This list may be updated if he introduces new elements to back his claims. Another inconvenient fact, temperatures statistically have not been warming since 1995 One main strategy used by climate change deniers is to argue that there is no trend in warming, or that the recent trend is not at all unusual. They often point to what has been called by some a “pause” in global warming – also sometimes called the “hiatus” or “slowdown”. They point to temperatures in 1998 (or sometimes a bit earlier) and say they were similar to today’s temperatures. They conclude that therefore global warming has stopped. If you look just at the temperatures in the graph below, ignoring the red trend line which is averaged over longer time periods, there doesn’t seem to be much warming.   The most obvious thing wrong with this argument is that no climate scientist thinks global warming means temperatures will always increase at the same rate. The climate has many natural sources of “variability”, which push temperatures up and down over months, years and decades. Superimposed over global warming, that variability can speed up or slow down the warming trend we see. Short periods of slower cooling are expected as a result of weather events such as La Niña. This probably happened between 1998 and about 2013 (although some scientists have controversially suggested it may not have happened at all). 1998 was a record hot year, and if you look only at the 15 years that followed, temperatures didn’t increase much.  Of course, choosing a record hot year as your starting point is cheating – just as choosing a record cold year would be. When you zoom out and look at the longer-term picture, there is a clear trend. And since 2013, temperatures have skyrocketed, with 2014 and 2015 (and almost certainly 2016) each setting new records. Understanding the precise causes of that short period of slower warming was of interest to scientists but it was not a challenge to the general picture that the globe was warming – and continued to warm – on larger timescales. For what it’s worth, a lot of work suggested the “hiatus” was a result of an extended La Niña-like period in what is called the Pacific decadal oscillation, in which heat from the atmosphere was being stored just under the surface in the Pacific Ocean. That process now looks as though it has reversed, releasing the heat and causing a sharp temperature rise. MALCOLM ROBERTS: Yeah, 1930s and 40s were warmer than the current decades … The original records are … first of all, that the data has been corrupted and we know that the 1930s were warmer than today. BRIAN COX, fellow Q&A panellist and physicist: What do you mean by corrupted? Corrupted? What do you mean corrupted? ROBERTS: Been manipulated. COX: By who? ROBERTS: By Nasa. COX: Nasa? ROBERTS: Yes.  This is an example of two strategies in one. The first is to deny there is a warming trend, or that it is unusual, as in the “hiatus” claim. When scientists point out that the data contradicts the claim, climate change deniers sometimes resort to conspiracy theories. In this case, Roberts argues that all the major science organisations around the world have collaborated, manipulating climate data to suppress temperatures in the 30s and 40s, thereby making today’s temperatures look unusual. The weird thing here is that Roberts isn’t even getting the conspiracy theory right. The theory he is thinking of – which even most climate change deniers now reject – is not that global temperatures were higher in the 30s and 40s, but that specifically temperatures just in the US were higher than today. Climate scientists used to believe that was the case. Even then, they knew the world as a whole was warming, so the scientific discussion revolved around trying to explain the spatial variation – why temperatures in the US were different. It was in no way a challenge to the clear observation that global temperatures were rising sharply. The chart below is from a paper published in 1999 discussing this issue and comparing the known global temperature rises with the understanding of US temperatures at the time.   The problem was, records going that far back are based on all sorts of measurements that are difficult to compare – some are taken at different times of day or at different altitudes. And many locations or times change over the period. Figuring out how to put them all on the same scale involves complex calculations. More than 15 years ago, Nasa’s method of doing so resulted in the conclusion that US temperatures were unusually high in the 30s and 40s. Then Nasa expanded the data set it used to include information about ocean temperatures and corrected for the then well-documented “urban heat island” effect. The changes didn’t alter the trend much but did mean that the hottest year on record in the US became 1998 rather than 1934. As data and understanding improved, further adjustments were made by Nasa in 2011, which revealed more of a warming trend across the US. All the changes were discussed by Nasa at the time but more than a decade later climate deniers picked this up and claimed it was a conspiracy. There is no such thing as meaningful raw data when it comes to historical temperature records – they must be interpreted. With more data and better understanding, that interpretation will change. And since several different organisations around the world do their own interpretations of the data and agree on the outcome, confidence in their results can be high. In any case, Roberts’ claim that global temperatures were higher in the 30s and 40s is not even a conspiracy theory that is held by anyone. And the claim that Nasa secretly manipulated data to hide the fact that those decades were warmer than today in the US is plainly false. Even if temperatures in the US were higher then than they were recently – as scientists thought in 1999 – it wouldn’t change the global picture, which for a long time has clearly shown increasing temperatures. The models have already been proven wrong, hopelessly wrong.  The truth is that climate models have been shown to work remarkably well.  Models predict trends in climate, not particular events. So a few years – even up to a decade or so – that isn’t quite what a model predicted is not evidence the model is flawed. But the performance of climate models over the past few decades has been amazingly accurate. The image below comes from the latest report of the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change. It shows how observations of temperatures have compared with climate models since 1990. There are a lot of graphs floating around the climate denier corners of the internet that cherry-pick some of the observations and compare them with just some of the model simulations, and usually don’t include the shading to show the uncertainty in those projections. Between 1998 and 2013, the observed temperatures were towards the lower end of the models’ predictions. That is not surprising, and it doesn’t mean the models aren’t working – the temperature rise has still been within the expected range. But a paper last year showed the difference between prediction and observation has been exaggerated, since while models are all about surface air temperatures, the observations they were compared with have traditionally been a combination of air temperatures over land and sea surface temperatures, which are warming more slowly than the air above the seas. Correcting for that created a model that let scientists to compare apples with apples, which showed the difference between the simulation and observations shrank considerably. That can be seen in the image below, where in the lower panel the shaded area drops a bit lower, putting the observed temperatures closer to the centre of the modelled temperatures. The difference that was left was likely to be simply a result of natural variability, which caused warming to slow slightly and temporarily.  The latest warming cycle in the 17th century going into the 18th century was faster and greater than the latest warming … It’s not clear what Roberts is talking about here. In the northern hemisphere there was a period of relatively cold weather between about 1550 and 1800, known as the “little ice age”. No recent or even outdated studies suggest it was warmer around 1700 than it is today. One book from 1965 – one of the first works to suggest there was a “little ice age” – did suggest some rapid warming towards 1700 in the northern hemisphere as the world emerged from the cold period. But that was based on very limited data and, even in that work, temperatures were not thought to have risen to unusual heights. And newer work based on much more detailed records suggests any cool period at roughly that time was much less pronounced than previously thought. This statement highlights another strategy used by climate deniers. Making a spurious claim about temperature records attempts to put the onus of proof on the interlocutor. It is so unclear what Roberts is talking about that it is hard to make a case against him. It is basic. The sun warms the earth’s surface. The surface, by contact, warms the moving, circulating atmosphere. That means the atmosphere cools the surface. How then can the atmosphere warm it? It cannot. That is why their computer models are wrong. It’s honestly just not clear where to start with this quote. Is he doubting that the sun can warm the atmosphere? If so, then why is the atmosphere not freezing? Is he arguing that because the earth’s surface is warmer than the air above it (which is true over land), that the atmosphere can’t warm?  A few people on twitter attempted to understand what he meant by this: @MJIBrown @MikeySlezak Shhh! My mortgage is paid by an international woollen jumper conspiracy network operating out of Canberra. Media outlets are drawn in two competing directions when deciding how to cover Robert’s false claims. On the one hand, it has become common practice not to report climate change denier views as a matter of course. And so editors might be drawn to ignore his claims. But as discussed above, his views could now have relevance and importance – not because they are potentially true, but because they could influence the workings of parliament. On the other hand there can be the opposite drive too. His views can be such good fodder for headlines, that there is a temptation to cover everything he says. But taking that path allows politicians to manipulate the media, driving them to say even more outrageous things to garner even more headlines. Roberts’ views should simply be reported when they are newsworthy, no more and no less. Of course this can be a tricky thing to judge, but newsrooms should be experienced at making such decisions."
"The decisions reached at the recent Coag energy council meeting are reminiscent of a long series of failures to understand the impacts of powerful business on the health of the community.  The failures extend historically from tobacco, to asbestos to the health scourges of coal, and now to the health and community impacts of the unconventional gas industry.  It is too much to believe that governments fail to understand the implications. Just 30 years ago, Australia was awash with tobacco advertising and promotion by tobacco companies and their agents through multiple media outlets and sporting organisations, supported by newspaper editorials opposed to any restrictions.  Major political parties readily accepted large donations, and some individual politicians were not immune to personal gifts and favours. Tobacco lobbyists had ready access to legislators to ensure that measures to deal with the health consequences were thwarted. While over 20,000 Australians were dying each year because of tobacco smoking, and children were being actively enticed into smoking addiction, their lives were valued less than an increasingly discredited industry. It remains a stain on governments of those days. The tragedy of asbestos mining, transportation and usage in Australia is another cautionary tale still being played out. Mining continued, with active government support, well past the time when there was unequivocal medical evidence of lethal harm being caused by asbestos elsewhere in the world. Political intervention began far too late to prevent the deaths of thousands, with hundreds of distressing deaths still occurring. Another cloud of preventable misery is gathering in our land and beyond our shores with the dangerous push to tolerate and expand coal mining and unconventional gas extraction. The reasons for political short-sightedness are similar to those that prevailed with tobacco and asbestos. The fundamental reason has been the distortion of the political process that has enabled powerful commercial interests to buy political favours to crush health and environmental concerns and work against the wider public interest. There are glaring examples where the mining industry has gained political favours through large direct and indirect donations to political parties and favours to individual public servants and legislators. There also continues to be a revolving door of appointments from the mining sector to pivotal public service positions and political careers, and the reverse. The industry has had, and continues to have, extraordinary access to policy makers and legislators. A report by the Australia Institute and the Australian Conservation Foundation analysing this process in Queensland has laid bare the extent of this distortion of good governance in that state, and exposes the failure of successive Queensland governments to allow sufficient scrutiny. Genuine health and environmental concerns, and their associated financial consequences, are given minimal weight compared to that given to the proponents of exploration, mining, transportation and combustion of coal and of unconventional gas extraction and usage. By comparison, access by organisations and individuals who have real expertise in the health effects of coal mining go unheeded. This is nothing short of outrageous. It is estimated that air pollution in Australia already causes around 3000 deaths annually, more than the motor vehicle accident toll. Most of those deaths are from particulate matter released by mining, transport and combustion of coal. The recognition of black lung disease in coal miners in Queensland is a vivid reminder of the dangers involved. The inadequacy of regulatory standards and enforcement has led to debilitating illness and death. The same could have been said of the asbestos tragedy on a much larger scale, and will eventually be said about coal mining. Climate change resulting from the cumulative effects of global fossil fuel combustion is already causing multiple health consequences, including deaths, from heat stroke, dehydration, bushfires, floods, typhoons, storm surges, vector borne diseases, cardio-pulmonary diseases and allergies. All of these problems will worsen as climate changes become more pronounced. Australia continues to lead the world in tobacco control and has saved the lives of thousands by doing so. It has protected its children in the process. It has belatedly learned some painful lessons on asbestos. By comparison, Australia is ignoring the overwhelming evidence that fossil fuels must be rapidly phased out in the early part of this century. Australia is blessed with abundant solar, wind and wave resources but it has been deceived into becoming a laggard rather than a leader in harnessing them. It appears that the Coag decisions in their subservience to fossil fuel interests asked for information on the additional costs of renewable energy imposed on the national electricity market. There was no mention of the much greater costs imposed by coal on the health services by coal pollution and by gas on the health of communities from global warming. Australia must avoid hurtling headlong into further coal mining and destructive unconventional gas extraction. It needs to have vision and true leadership; a focus on innovation and employment; and to be conscious of its responsibility to protect the natural environment and the health of its citizens. This country has the intelligence, technological expertise, enterprise, workforce, space and moral obligation to make this possible. It will just take political wisdom and will to turn it into reality. If federal and state governments do not do so, it will be at the clear expense of the people they serve. As with asbestos, history will judge the responsible governments very harshly indeed."

"The sea ice covering the most northerly part of our planet shrank last week to its second lowest level on record. Once stable at around 7.5m sq km in summer, the Arctic ice cap has been dwindling for several decades and dropped to an area of 4.1m sq km a few days ago, a victim of the rising fossil-fuel emissions and increasing temperatures that now beset the Earth. At the same time, the US space agency Nasa announced that August 2016 had tied with July 2016 as the hottest month globally ever recorded. Our world is heating up dramatically. As winter returns to the far north, its ice cover will slowly return, of course, though it will certainly not be restored to its former glory. The overall trend of summer Arctic sea-ice cover has been a steadily downwards one for the past 30 years, an inexorable decline that has deeply worrying implications for the region, and for the rest of the planet, as we report today. An Arctic that is regularly free of sea ice in summer – a real prospect for the middle of the century – will open up that fragile, pristine wilderness to all sorts of potential woes: overfishing; pollution related to oil drilling and mineral extraction; the eradication of indigenous species; and the destruction of native communities. In addition, with little or no ice left to reflect solar radiation back into space, and its dark waters absorbing more and more of that radiation, the Arctic will heat up even further, enhancing the global warming that has already taken a grip on the planet. As Professor Gail Whiteman, of Lancaster University, remarked last week: “Forget the FTSE: Arctic sea ice is the real barometer of global risk.”  Urgent action is clearly needed, a point that is not lost on international climate negotiators. In a few weeks, they are scheduled to assemble in Marrakech in order to discuss the ratification of the Paris agreement, which was hammered out late last year and which seeks to limit the burning of fossil fuels in order to restrict carbon dioxide emissions and so limit global temperature rises to around 2C since pre-industrial times. To date, a total of 27 nations – including Brazil, China and the United States – have formally backed the plan, and a further 20 countries are expected to add their names in the next few days. Crucially, the United Kingdom has made no commitment to back the Paris accord. Yet the agreement needs the formal support of 55 nations before it can come into force. The fact that the Britain still refuses to put its name to the treaty is therefore deeply worrying. The government claims that it is committed, ultimately, to backing the agreement but the longer it delays, the more it is likely to lose the leadership it once commanded when it came to climate change issues. Even if Britain misses the legislative deadline set for the Marrakech meeting, an announcement now that it is committed to the Paris agreement would send a much-needed message to the world. It would let them know that the current UK government still realises the urgency of the situation and the perils that face the planet. The problem is not one that should be viewed as being vague and global, however. It is a precise danger and it is a local one as well. As the planet heats up, so the United Kingdom is also becoming warmer and wetter. Our eight warmest years on record have occurred from 2000 onwards, and during that time we have also experienced six of our seven wettest years. The atmosphere, as it heats up, is holding on to more and more water which it then releases as bursts of intense rainfall. This point was emphasised by the National Flood Resilience Review, published earlier this month, which admitted that we are now facing a greater threat of flooding due to heaver rainfall and rising sea levels than ever before. Monthly rainfall totals in winter could be up to 30% higher than recent past extremes, it stated. Last December’s record flooding – which saw 341mm of rain fall in 24 hours at Honister Pass in the Lake District, for example – is certainly likely to be surpassed in the next few years. Yet the government is so far committed to making only the most rudimentary of infrastructure improvements in order to combat the problem, and has pledged a mere £12m of extra cash for anti-flooding measures. That level of response is simply insufficient. There is a real need now for the government to assure the public that it understands the risks we face from climate change and commit itself fully to this urgent and pressing issue."
"The GOP has become the Grand Oil Party. The fossil fuel industry has now managed to dictate Republican Party actions on climate change in attorney generals offices, Congress, and for the party’s presidential nominee.  Last month, Donald Trump added Brooke Rollins and Kathleen Hartnett-White to his economic advisory council. Rollins is president and CEO of the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), while Hartnett-White has worked for the TPPF and the CO2 Coalition (formerly the George C. Marshall Institute), all of which are part of the “web of denial” receiving funding from the fossil fuel industry. Hartnett-White told POLITICO in an interview that rather than listen to the conclusions of the world’s foremost climate science experts as summarized in the IPCC reports, she favors a commission that would develop an “alternative scientific methodology” and would include the voices of the less than 3% of climate scientists who reject the consensus on human-caused global warming.  She believes “the sun had a powerful role” in global warming. However, the sun has had an overall cooling effect on global temperatures over the past 60 years, as the IPCC reports have shown. She also loves fossil fuels and seems entirely opposed renewable energy and efforts to cut carbon pollution. Hartnett-White co-authored a book with Trump’s senior economic adviser Stephen Moore, as part of a TPPF effort to “explain the moral case for fossil fuels” and undermine the Obama Administration’s Clean Power Plan. Moore has compared fracking to the cure for cancer, is a frequent Fox News and Wall Street Journal contributor, and was a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation – another fossil fuel-funded member of the web of denial. Moore has been encouraging Trump to push hard in favor of fossil fuels and against renewable energy. As a result Trump’s “economic vision” includes goals like: Cancel the Paris Climate Agreement (limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius) and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs. And in the 2016 Science Debate, although he did pay brief, vague lip service to renewable energy, Trump entirely dodged the question about climate science, devoting a single dismissive sentence to one of the most important issues we face today: There is still much that needs to be investigated in the field of “climate change.”  Hillary Clinton’s detailed answers provided a stark contrast to Trump’s brief and vague responses. Meanwhile, investigative journalists at the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) uncovered a blatant example of the fossil fuel industry buying influence to undermine government efforts to tackle climate change: Fossil fuel giants Murray Energy and Southern Company paid for meetings with Republican attorneys general to discuss their opposition to the Clean Power Plan less than two weeks before the same GOP officials petitioned federal courts to block the Obama administration’s signature climate proposal, according to private emails Coincidentally, Trump’s newest adviser is a former lobbyist for Southern Company. These fossil fuel companies were offered the opportunity to meet with GOP attorneys general in exchange for financial donations to the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) to help fund their re-election campaigns. The documents revealed that the attorneys then discussed “the future of the fight to stop the Clean Power Plan.” According to materials reviewed by CMD, since 2015 RAGA has received at least $100,000 from ExxonMobil, $350,000 from Koch Industries, $85,000 from Southern Company, $378,250 from the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE), and $250,000 from Murray Energy. In total, fossil fuel interests, utilities and their trade groups have given more than $2.25 million to RAGA since 2015. Subsequently, 15 Republican attorneys general took the Clean Power Plan to court to stop the Obama Administration’s efforts to cut carbon pollution. As CMD research director Nick Surgey put it: State attorneys general are supposed to enforce the law and serve the public interest, but instead these Republican officials have hung a ‘For Sale’ sale on their door, and the fossil fuel industry proved to be the highest bidder. It’s no coincidence that GOP attorneys general have mounted an aggressive fight alongside the fossil fuel industry to block the Clean Power Plan – that appears to be exactly what the industry paid for. Together, these documents reveal a sustained pattern of collusion between the fossil fuel industry and the Republican attorneys general on climate change obstructionism. The situation is not dissimilar to Trump’s donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who soon thereafter decided against pursuing an investigation into Trump University’s allegedly fraudulent activities. The Miami Herald suggested that Bondi was “bought and paid for” in the Trump University case. Bondi is also among the Republican attorneys general taking the Clean Power Plan to court. And of course just a few months ago, Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a Resolution condemning a carbon tax for no apparent reason, except for possible pressure from fossil fuel industry campaign donors. Big Oil thus appears to be calling the shots for Republican Party leaders at their highest levels in all three branches of US government – the executive (presidential nominee), judicial (attorneys general), and legislative (members of Congress). And the attorneys general are trying to stop the efforts of the current executive branch (Obama Administration) to cut carbon pollution and tackle climate change. This may be a contributing factor to the historically low approval of Congress today, even among Republican voters. Just 21% of Americans think the US should emphasize more fossil fuel production, as opposed to 73% who favor a focus on renewable energy. 82% of Americans favor government limits on carbon pollution. Yet the positions of Republican Party leaders in all branches of government are the polar opposite. The only reason they haven’t paid the electoral price is that Republican voters don’t yet view climate change as a priority, due in large part to conservative media bias. However, as climate change impacts become increasingly undeniable, sooner or later the GOP will be held accountable for selling out the wellbeing of the American people to Big Oil."
"Australia’s emissions will remain at the same level through to 2030, despite the federal government paying polluters billions to lower greenhouse gas emissions and some states having ambitious renewable energy targets, according to new analysis by the energy advisory firm RepuTex. Combining the effect of current policy settings with expected growth in liquefied natural gas exports and land clearing, Australia’s emissions were modelled to end up at just 2% below 2005 levels by 2030.  To meet current targets, which are at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2030, a total of about 1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide will need to be avoided. The current emissions reduction target has widely been considered to be too weak. In August, the Climate Institute found it would result in Australia needing to reduce its emissions to zero in just five years, in order to stay within its carbon budget, determined by our commitment to keep global warming at “well below” 2C. To meet even that weak target using existing mechanisms – like the safeguard mechanism in the Coalition’s Direct Action policy – the cap on pollution from large emitters will need to tighten dramatically from 2020, at rate of about 5% each year, RepuTex found. And if the government tried to meet the 2030 target without tightening the safeguard mechanism, they would need to take radical action in other areas, said RepuTex’s executive director, Hugh Grossman. “A lot of the policy measures become extreme if you exclude safeguard sectors,” Grossman told Guardian Australia. “That could include the tripling of funding for the emissions reduction fund and generation from rooftop photovoltaics, while rates of electricity and vehicle efficiency would need to double from current levels.” Grossman said that was “theoretically possible” but likely to be impractical, especially if Australia’s targets are scaled up, which is the expectation of all countries after the Paris agreement. Surprisingly, the analysis found that if emissions reductions were achieved by scaling up the safeguards mechanism, much of the burden would fall on the transport sectors and coal seam gas industries, while large coal-fired generators would avoid the impact of the tightening baselines. “With emissions baselines declining from high point levels, we anticipate many large coal-fired generators would remain under their baseline due to factors such as falling electricity consumption,” Grossman said. The results showed that climate and energy policy needed to be properly integrated at a federal level, Grossman said. RepuTex came to their conclusions using their new energy and climate policy tool, which allows users to measure how much CO2 Australia will need to avoid by 2030, and explore different pathways to achieve that. The analysis comes just weeks after the Climate Change Authority released its controversial report on Australia’s climate policy requirements, recommending a “toolkit” of policies, which two dissenting authority members described as a “dog’s breakfast”. It was commissioned to report on the policy settings needed to meet our international obligations, which includes a commitment to keeping global temperatures “well below” 2C of warming. But, instead, it made recommendations based on Australia’s current targets, which are widely considered to be inconsistent with our international obligations. It also made recommendations based on assumptions about what was politically feasible, rather than what was the best policy. Even then, the details of the exact policy settings to needed to meet the 2030 targets were lacking. In a statement, RepuTex said its analysis attempted to fill that gap."

"As the sun begins its seasonal descent in the Arctic sky and temperatures drop, the summer melt of sea ice is slowing down. In the next few weeks, the span of the Arctic Ocean covered by ice will reach its annual low. But despite beginning the summer at unprecedentedly low levels, this year’s minimum won’t break the stunning record of 2012, experts say, thanks to cloudy weather that slowed the rate of melt.   Depending on how the weather plays out over the next few weeks, that minimum is likely to fall somewhere between second and fifth place, they estimate — still a remarkably low level that shows how precipitously sea ice has declined in recent decades. “There hasn’t been any recovery in any ice at all,” Julienne Stroeve, a senior scientist at the National Snow & Ice Data Center, said. The area of the Arctic Ocean covered by sea ice naturally waxes and wanes with the seasons, reaching its peak at the end of winter and its nadir at the end of summer, usually in mid-September. But the steady increase in heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere has fueled an intense warming of the Arctic region; temperatures there are rising at twice the rate as the global average. That has caused a dramatic melting of the sea ice that floats atop the frigid ocean waters. Since the beginning of satellite records in 1979, the winter peak has declined by 3.2 percent per decade, while the summer minimum has declined by 13.7 percent per decade. That loss of ice has significant ramifications for the animals that depend on it for access to food and coastal communities that need it for protection from intense Arctic storms. The loss of ice has also fueled interest in opening shipping routes through the region, as well as exploiting natural resources, such as oil, found beneath the seafloor. But the effects of melt aren’t confined to the Arctic: Ice reflects the sun’s rays, so as it disappears, more ocean waters, which absorb those rays, are exposed, intensifying regional and global warming. Some research also suggests that the loss of ice could be impacting extreme weather in Europe, Asia and North America. This winter, Arctic weather stayed remarkably warm, to the extent that it surprised even veteran sea ice researchers. That balmy weather stymied sea ice growth and caused sea ice extent to hit a record low winter peak for the second year in a row. As the sun rose with the coming of spring, that meant more open ocean was exposed and ready to absorb the sun’s rays, fueling an early start to the melt season. By May, the melt season was two to four weeks ahead of schedule andfar below the previous record low for the month. But even such a huge head start didn’t guarantee a record low come summer’s end, because weather plays a key role in summer melt. Beginning in June and lasting through July — the peak months of sun exposure — Arctic weather turned cloudy and somewhat cooler. “So that dropped us off the pace pretty quickly,” Walt Meier, a NASA sea ice scientist, said. Exactly where this summer’s minimum falls depends on what the weather does over the next few weeks. For example, winds could influence where sea ice flows, potentially compacting what is left, or further breaking up already tenuous chunks. With the sun dropping ever lower in the sky, it has less influence over that melt, but the warmth retained in the ocean will continue to eat away at the ice for a few weeks. A record low is virtually out of the question, though. “I don’t see how we could catch 2012,” Meier said. “There’s not enough time left in the season.” He does think it’s possible that this year could overtake 2007’s low, the second lowest extent on record. The potential to take the second place spot, despite the fact that “the summer was just not really conducive to extreme melt” shows just how far sea ice has fallen, Meier said. “That’s just in a lot of ways kind of remarkable.” Sea ice levels as low as current ones would have stunned scientists even a decade ago. Now it has effectively become a new normal. “Things have really changed,” Meier said. “The Arctic is very different.” In a recent study in the journal Geographical Review, researchers compiled historical records of sea ice from ships’ logs and other sources and found that sea ice hasn’t been this low in at least the last 150 years. The rate that sea ice is declining is also unprecedented over that timespan. However, despite some recent reports that the Arctic would be ice-free in the summer in the next year or two, that is not the case, Stroeve said. Most projections suggest that that point will be reached sometime in the middle of the century, and, as another recent paper found, scientists’ ability to pin down that date is limited by the natural variability of the sea ice system to within a couple of decades. Any prediction of ice-free conditions in the next few years doesn’t take into account the physics of the system, Stroeve said. “I agree it’s going to go away eventually,” she said. “But it’s not there yet.” "
"Australia is the worst country among the G20 when it comes to action on climate change, according to a comprehensive assessment before the G20 summit in China. Under China’s leadership, this weekend’s G20 in the eastern city of Hangzhou has had a strong focus on climate-related issues. By analysing the policies and actions of each of the 20 countries, which together produce 75% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, Climate Transparency produced a report, scorecard and series of country profiles detailing their findings, revealing Australia was not pulling its weight. On the scorecard, Australia was the only country to receive a rating of “very poor” in a majority of categories. Australia was given the worst possible rating of “very poor” for its performance on emissions trends, carbon intensity, share of renewables in its energy supply and overall climate policy. It was rated as “poor” in every other category: for its energy intensity, share of coal in energy supply and electricity emissions intensity. Alvaro Umaña, co-chair of Climate Transparency and a former Costa Rican environment minister, said: “The G20 has proven that it can be nimble and take action on economic issues, so we are looking to these countries to do the same for the climate.” Along with half the other G20 nations, Australia’s 2030 emissions reduction targets committed to at Paris – making up Australia’s intended nationally determined contribution – were given the worst possible rating of “inadequate”. However, none of the 20 nations’ commitments were labelled as “sufficient” or “role model”, with the remaining 10 scored as “medium”. The report notes that if every country emulated Australia’s level of ambition, global warming would likely exceed 4C. It also said that Australia’s currently implemented policy measures were not set to achieve even those inadequate targets and instead would rise to about 27% above 2005 levels by 2030, rather than the targeted 26 to 28% below 2005 levels. The report comes one day after Australia’s Climate Change Authority produced its long-awaited “special review”, recommending that the country should institute two emissions trading schemes. The review also highlighted that Australia’s current policies were not able to achieve the existing inadequate targets. But the report was heavily criticised by commentators – and also by two of the authority’s members – for not making recommendations about how the country can meet international obligations to do its part in keeping global warming “well below” 2C. Australia’s support for financing the transition to renewable energy was rated as “medium” by Climate Transparency, noting there had been “prolonged policy uncertainty resulting from volatile political support for substantive climate change policy”. Those findings are expected to be underlined in another report being released on Thursday by WWF France and WWF China arguing that a global energy transition is already under way and the G20 countries need to simply accelerate action towards that goal. WWF Australia will say the report serves as a wakeup call for Australian policy makers. Last week international investors controlling $13tn worth of funds urged the G20 to accelerate investment in clean energy, saying countries that ratified the Paris agreement early would benefit by attracting investment in low-carbon technology. Those calls were particularly timely, coming as the the Australian parliament considers the effective abolition of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, and one day after Guardian Australia revealed that new uncertainty had already caused at least two renewable energy projects to be suspended."

"Despite its brevity, the dissenting report from two members of the government’s supposedly independent Climate Change Authority has landed with a dull and uncompromising thud. Last week the CCA published its report advising the government what it should and shouldn’t do in the wake of the Paris climate agreement. In short, the report recommended the government keep the chief pillars of its current policies, but make a few tweaks here and there.  But it emerged that two members of the 10-strong authority would not be endorsing the report, namely Clive Hamilton, professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University, and David Karoly, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Melbourne. Now Hamilton and Karoly have published their dissenting report, which has already been dismissed by the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg. The authority’s chair, Wendy Craik, has also issued a clarification under the heading “misleading report”, saying Hamilton and Karoly’s effort was “not released or endorsed by the authority, and has no status as an authority report”. The CCA’s report is pinned to the government’s current target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030, based on their levels in 2005. That’s the target the Australian government took to the Paris climate talks, despite the authority previously suggesting the target should be between 40% and 60%. Hamilton and Karoly’s dissenting report says: Treating our ‘Paris commitment’ as if it were only the 26-28% target and not the commitment to hold warming to well below 2C is convenient for the current government’s domestic agenda, but it contradicts the nation’s international legal obligations and national interest in avoiding dangerous climate change. Previous CCA reports have been marked by their efforts to stay true to the challenge of bringing the policy and the science together. Hamilton and Karoly’s chief accusation is that the authority has ignored the realities of the Paris agreement, which calls for all countries to work together to keep global warming “well below 2C” and eventually shoot for 1.5C.  The pair’s report says: We believe that the effect of the majority report will be to sanction further delay and a slow pace of action with serious consequences for the nation. Those consequences include one or both of: very severe and costly emission cuts in the mid to-late 2020s; or, repudiation of Australia’s international commitments and free riding on the efforts of the rest of the world. The latter would weaken global momentum for an effective response to climate change and harm the nation diplomatically. What’s more, Hamilton and Karoly have suggested the authority has effectively ignored its previous recommendations based on a “carbon budget” approach. This “budget” has suggested Australia must not emit more than 10.1bn tonnes of greenhouse gases between 2013 and 2050. Hamilton and Karoly say that under the CCA’s latest recommendations, more than 90% of that budget will already be used up by the year 2030. I spoke to Hamilton and asked why he thought the authority had apparently shifted away from its previous advocacy for more rapid cuts and stricter targets. He wouldn’t comment.  So was he intending to stay at the authority? He told me: We’re still members and we’re not going anywhere. It has been suggested that we might resign. We are not resigning and we’re there until out five-year terms expire in July next year. We have an important contribution to make within the terms of the authority’s act. Hamilton said he had started to become concerned about the direction of the authority’s latest report “two or three months ago”:  I crossed a point where I thought that [the report] goes too far to try to accommodate political circumstances – or an assessment of the political circumstances. He told me the CCA was modelled on Britain’s Climate Change Committee and had two key functions – “expertise in its advice” and “independence from government interference or dictation”. He said: I think that all that an independent authority like the Climate Change Authority can do is to attempt to adhere to that. Of course, no one can be purist and everyone wants their report to have an influence rather than get dusty on shelves, but you can go too far and be too clever by half and second guess the political process. And of course, you can just get it wrong. Hamilton said he thought the authority had had a positive impact on policy debates. Despite its recommendations on targets being largely ignored by the previous government, the authority had helped “set a credible benchmark” against which policy proposals could be judged. He added: In the public domain, it’s had a big impact. It’s had a big influence in the parliament and with the wider public.  It is operating in such a poisonous political space that all it can do in my view to retain its authority is to stick to the principles in its act and make its recommendations on the evidence that we have."

"An application for an opencast coal mine in Northumberland has been “called in” by the Government on climate grounds. The proposals by Banks Mining for a surface mine for coal, sandstone and fire clay at Highthorn, between Widdrington Village and Druridge Bay, were given the green light by Northumberland county council in July.  Now it will be subject to a planning inquiry after the application was called in for consideration by communities secretary Sajid Javid. The application will be examined to see if it is compatible with Government policies on meeting the challenge of climate change and protecting the natural environment, and with plans to phase coal-fired power stations in the UK by 2025. The Government made the pledge to phase out polluting coal power last December ahead of United Nations talks in Paris, which secured the world’s first comprehensive climate deal that aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero this century. Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party, said: “The secretary of state’s decision to ‘call in’ the Druridge Bay planning application on climate grounds is hugely significant and very welcome. “Going ahead with this project would fly in the face of the climate science, and be disastrous for the local environment. Coal is a dirty, polluting energy source and has no role to play in a modern economy.” Friends of the Earth campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: “Hopefully this means that ministers have realised that digging up yet more coal is completely contradictory with the Paris climate deal, and that planning rules must be changed to leave fossil fuels in the ground. “Thousands of people objected to the ill-conceived opencast coal mine at Druridge Bay because it would be hugely damaging for the local area, threaten tourism and undermine efforts to tackle climate change. “The Government must look at the evidence, back local people and reject this short-sighted proposal. It’s time to stop extracting and burning coal.” When the mine, which opponents say will destroy a beautiful area, was given the go-ahead, council leader Grant Davey said he appreciated it was a controversial issue, but the project would create jobs and boost the local economy. According to Banks Mining, the scheme will create at least 100 full-time jobs, 50 of which would be new jobs and 50 moved from other sites, while £1.5m would be raised through business rates and £48m spent on local suppliers."
"China has announced its ratification of the Paris climate change agreement, paving the way for a hotly anticipated joint US-China statement on the fight against global warming later on Saturday. In a brief dispatch on Saturday morning, China’s official news agency, Xinhua, said members of the country’s rubber-stamp parliament, the National People’s Congress, had voted “to review and ratify” the historic deal.  The announcement comes as Xi Jinping and Barack Obama are expected to meet in China ahead of the start of the G20 on Sunday to make a joint statement on climate change. Activists believe the centrepiece of that statement, which Chinese and American officials have spent weeks negotiating, will be a formal commitment by both countries to ratify the deal.  The Paris agreement, sealed last December after two weeks of intense negotiations, needs to be ratified by 55 countries, representing 55% of global emissions, in order to come into effect. “China and the US together account for about 38% of global emissions. So if they ratify the agreement it will bring the Paris agreement entering into force much closer to reality,” said Li Shuo, the Beijing-based senior climate policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia.  Speaking on Saturday afternoon, at the opening of the B20 business forum in Hangzhou, China’s president made no direct reference to his country’s decision to ratify the Paris agreement. But Xi said China would continue to confront the causes of climate change and environmental degradation and vowed to close coal mines and steel mills as part of that effort. “I have said many times that green mountains and clear water are as good as mountains of gold and silver. To protect the environment is to protect productivity and to improve the environment is to boost productivity,” Xi said. “We will unwaveringly pursue sustainable development and stay committed to green, low-carbon and circular development and to China’s fundamental policy of conserving resources and protecting the environment. In promoting green development we also aim to address climate change and over capacity.” He added: “We will make China a beautiful country with a blue sky, green vegetation and clear rivers so that our people can enjoy their lives in a liveable environment with the ecological benefits created by economic development.”  The decision to ratify the Paris deal was in line with “China’s policy of actively dealing with climate change,” the approved National People’s Congress proposal argued, according to a Xinhua report issued on Saturday.  Ratifying the agreement would “further advance China’s green, low-carbon development and safeguard environmental security”, it said. The move was also “conducive to China’s development interests”.  In order to fulfill its obligations under the Paris agreement Xinhua said China would need to cut carbon emissions by 60-65% per unit of GDP by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, and boost its use of non-fossil fuels so they accounted for 20% of its energy consumption.  Ranping Song, the developing country climate action manager at the Washington-based World Resources Institute, said China had taken “more and more concerted and aggressive actions against climate change” in recent years. Song said Beijing’s decision to ratify the Paris deal underscored how it now recognised climate change as a global problem to which China was vulnerable as well as the need to tackle severe environmental pollution at home. It also showed how China’s leaders believed they could turn the fight against climate change into “a new engine for growth”. Song said: “[The old development] model is no longer working and, just out of its own economic interests, China is looking for new ways to spur the economy.” "

"The government is falling behind on its commitments to switch a proportion of Britain’s car fleet to electric vehicles, an influential committee of MPs said on Thursday. Take-up of electric vehicles has been slower than hoped in the UK, but the technology is essential to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport, and tackling the air pollution produced by the increased number of diesel cars on the road. According to the guideline target recommended by the government’s climate advisors, ultra-low emission vehicles such as electric cars should make up 9% of the fleet by 2020, but current forecasts by the Department for Transport (DfT) show the figure by the end of the decade is likely to be about half that. Ministers have not said what should happen if the target is not met, nor produced a plan for beyond 2020. Parliament’s environmental audit committee said ministers were failing to put forward the incentives and infrastructure needed to encourage drivers into electric cars, while air pollution was breaching regulations, with 38 of 43 clean air zones exceeding acceptable levels of nitrogen oxides. In addition, the committee said the lessons of the Volkswagen emissions scandal, in which the manufacturer was found to have cheated on tests to make vehicles seem greener than they really were, had not been learned. Affected models were only starting to be withdrawn from the market, the MPs were told. Mary Creagh, chairwoman of the committee, said: “The uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles is too low to meet the UK’s climate change targets at the lowest cost to the public. Air quality targets that were supposed to be met in 2010 won’t be hit until 2020 at the earliest. And it’s been almost a year since we discovered VW had fitted cars with cheat devices, but the government has still to decide what action to take against the company.” Electric vehicles do not produce emissions at the point of use, and the UK’s electricity sector is becoming lower-carbon through the increased use of gas and renewable energy. They are one of the few options for removing carbon from transport. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which represents the industry in the UK, told the Guardian that manufacturers were investing billions of pounds in developing new electric and hybrid models, pointing to the rise in the range of makes available from five in 2011 to more than 30 at present. He urged ministers to provide more incentives to drivers. He said: “We welcome the committee’s call for policy and fiscal certainty to drive the uptake of ULEVs [ultra-low emission vehicles], which will help the government meet its air quality and climate targets. Given this is still nascent technology which carries a price premium, the committee’s call for support across government, from the Treasury to DfT, to help stimulate market demand, is well made.” Nissan, which manufactures the Leaf car, told the Guardian that sales were progressing well and that it expected further acceleration in future. An important advance, the company said, was that 98% of motorway service stations were now equipped with rapid chargers, a key consideration for drivers, and by 2020 it expected charging stations to outnumber fossil fuel filling stations. Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity, which runs the Electric Highway charging network, added: “We share the committee’s concern over the vagueness of the 2020 target for ULEVs - that target is a loose range, the mid-point of which is barely half what the Committee on Climate Change has said is required to keep us on track for our 2050 carbon targets. The government urgently needs to write our existing EU targets on renewable energy and air quality into UK law and set out clear policies for achieving them.” The committee also called for a new target for two-thirds of cars and vans to be ultra-low emissions by 2030. Car manufacturers, including Nissan, would be given a greater incentive to manufacture such vehicles in the UK if clearer signals were evident in government policy, said Creagh. Friends of the Earth said the government should go further still, to have a hope of halting the public health crisis from air pollution, which claims tens of thousands of lives a year and affects the quality of life of many more. Jenny Bates, campaigner, said: “Road traffic [is] the biggest problem, and diesel the worst of all. [The government] must create a plan for phasing out diesel use on Britain’s roads, along with cutting traffic levels and preventing road-building adding to the problem. We know it can be done: the Netherlands and Norway are planning a ban on new diesel and petrol cars from 2025, which large parts of Copenhagen are traffic free.” Air quality targets, set by the EU, were also at risk following Brexit, according to the report, entitled Sustainability in the Department for Transport. There has been no certainty yet from government as to whether these targets will be retained in UK law. The committee also called on ministers to set out a clear plan for dealing with the aftermath of the VW emissions scandal, which could include bringing a prosecution against the company, and for the rail industry to clarify its steps towards reducing emissions, particularly from diesel locomotives. Creagh said the government should redraw the priorities for the DfT to give greater weight to environmental issues. “Transport authorities throughout England have told us they have had problems with getting sustainable transport projects off the ground, because the DfT places more importance on economic benefits rather than the health benefits of improving air quality.” The DfT said it was committing £600m over the current parliament to encouraging ultra low emission vehicles, for instance through grant schemes. While the target of 9% of vehicles being low emissions by 2020 is endorsed by the Committee on Climate Change, a department spokesman pointed out that the government’s own aim is much lower, at between 3% and 7% of vehicles by the same date. The lower end of this target is forecast to be met. “We see ultra-low emission vehicles as the future of road travel and we have set goals for almost all cars and vans on our roads to be zero-emission by 2050,” he said. “We are confident there will be significant further growth in the market.” On the VW scandal, the spokesman said ministers took the matter “extremely seriously” and the department was calling for a Europe-wide investigation, for VW to resolve the issue for affected consumers, and for better tests that reflect real-world performance."
"Rectangles of pale blues and greens lie scattered across a sea of grey sand, looking a bit like someone dropped their Farrow & Ball colour swatches in a cat litter tray. The mottled grey background is marked with faded layers of scratches and scribbles, like an endlessly reworked charcoal drawing, from which the little blocks of colour shine out as bright jewels in the dust. This is what the salt pans of Gujarat in northern India look like, when seen through the painterly bird’s-eye lens of Edward Burtynsky. The 61-year-old Canadian photographer has devoted his career to capturing man’s impact on the landscape from above, elevating the brutish debris of slag heaps and open-cast mines into sublime wall-sized hymns to how we’ve made our mark on the surface of the Earth. And he’s on a mission to document it all before it’s too late.  “I happened upon the salt pans on Google Earth one day,” he says, sitting in east London’s Flowers Gallery, where an exhibition of his work opens on 16 September. “A few months later I was in a Cessna flying over them, trying to capture this incredible terrain before it disappears.” Home to more than 100,000 salt workers, who extract around a million tonnes of salt a year from the floodwaters of the Arabian Sea, the remarkable lunar landscape of the Little Rann of Kutch might not exist for much longer. The industry is under threat from receding groundwater levels and declining market values, potentially putting paid to a way of life and land-forming that has existed here for over 400 years. Like most of Burtynsky’s work – which graces collections from Tate to MoMA and the Guggenheim – when you first see these pastel-hued planes of lines, squares and scribbles, it’s not quite clear what you’re looking at until you peer a bit closer. The furrows in the dappled grey backgrounds, which have the ghostly patina of an etching, turn out to be the tracks of trucks and the grooves of dykes and berms, dug out to stop the desert sand from blowing into the salt pans. “I like it when the viewer can’t ‘get it’ instantly,” says Burtynsky, poring over one of his two-metre wide prints to find a clue that proves we are looking at a river delta, not just an abstract swirl of reds and browns. Like spotting the striped red jersey in a Where’s Wally illustration, there is a satisfaction that comes from decoding the signs of life and industry in one of his sprawling scenes. “You should have to dig in with your eyes to work out what’s going on.” He’d like you to dig in a little with your brain too, because these glossy visions are no mere enviro-porn. “There’s definitely a ‘holy shit!’ aspect to the work,” he says. “We’re at a critical moment in history where we’re starting to hit the thresholds of human expansion and the limits of what this planet can sustain. We’re reaching peak oil, peak fish, peak beef – and the evidence is all there to see in the landscape.” Since his interest was first sparked in man’s imprint on the environment in the 1980s, when he was working part-time in a Canadian gold mine while studying photography, Burtynsky has produced major bodies of work on everything from the oil industry and mining to quarrying and water, the most recent of which have expanded in scope to include documentary film-making. To achieve his favoured god-like perspective, he began with high vantage points and tall tripods, then graduated to telescopic hydraulic poles (think of a 50ft selfie stick), then planes and helicopters, and now computer-controlled drones. His team scouts potential subjects from the comfort of Google Earth, then with GPS technology Burtynsky can fix a position in the air by latitude, longitude and altitude, and send a drone-mounted camera back again and again to the exact same spot until he’s happy with the shot. He is currently engaged in a five-year project on the anthropocene, the pending name for the present geological age in which humans have had a discernible impact on the environment, working in collaboration with scientists from the international Anthropocene Working Group. “We’ve had the five great extinctions,” he says, referring to prehistoric devastations from the “Great Dying” of the Permian eruptions, to the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs. “Now humans are having the equivalent effect of that meteor impact.” If his message is one of impending catastrophe – or indeed a catastrophe that’s already happened – it is tempered by the fact that these manmade scars are incredibly seductive. Who could deny the alchemical allure of the toxic phosphor tailings ponds in Florida, or the beauty of the scrubby patchwork quilts left by mass deforestation? As Burtynsky admits, his images would be equally at home on a Greenpeace poster or the cover of an oil company’s annual report. “The work asks more questions than it answers,” he says. “Which is what artists are there to do.” Further questions are raised in a new book that accompanies the exhibition, Essential Elements, which pairs his photographs, sometimes by tonal values or patterns, rhyming the forms of rice terraces with those of oil fields, but also by narratives that hint at a more critical agenda. On one spread, the mirror-glass skyline of Toronto, shot in the late afternoon sun, faces a gnarled hole in the ground in Australia, the sunset pinks and turquoises echoing the sandy soil and greenish lake at the bottom of the copper mine. “We build cities and leave holes in the ground where they came from,” says Burtynsky. He refers to quarries as “inverted skyscrapers”. Flicking through the book is like touring the landscapes of late capitalism, tracing the supply chains of our consumer culture back to both ends – where the stuff came from and where it ends up. A field of shiny motorbikes is paired with a heap of tyres, an iron-ore mine with a ship-breaking yard. His post-production can be a little heavy-handed with the contrast and saturation levels, in the quest for pin-sharp clarity. But this is also part of his conscious aesthetic: images are pumped up until the entire picture plane is flattened into a surface seething with granular detail, or what he calls “the democratic distribution of light and space across the whole field,” a neutrality that encourages the eye to wander. The flattening of these gaping scenes plunges the viewer headlong into the dams and reservoirs, aqueducts and deltas of this global survey. It brings a visceral sense of places that have been drained, drilled, excavated and extracted, terrains that have an archaic, almost primordial feeling. This is the fundamental matter from which human civilisation has been wrought, the landscapes that have been squeezed and scraped for their material worth, ravaged and disfigured on an epic scale, leaving beautiful residue in their wake. “In our ephemeral information age, people think we’ve left behind the stone, bronze and iron ages,” says Burtynsky. “But they’re all still going on – we use tonnes of this stuff every day. You just have to look.” • Edward Burtynsky: Essential Elements, edited and curated by William A Ewing, is published by Thames & Hudson on 15 September; Salt Pans and Essential Elements will be on display at Flowers Gallery, London from 16 September-29 October."
"Again, self-selected business leaders are calling for a new runway (Letters, 7 September). They offer the interesting example of the desperate need to fly Scottish salmon, presumably farmed, to the world’s developing economies. Are they living on a different planet? How many individuals in the world’s poorer nations “need” salmon flown thousands of miles to accompany the salad presumably shipped in similar style from Harrods (another signatory)?  They also ignore the onrushing disaster of climate change in order to turn a quick profit – big business at its worst. I agree with them that dithering from government is unhelpful. We need a decision as soon as possible: no new airport capacity at all! Business leaders can of course ask for anything they like; government is there to limit the damage they do to the environment and be guided by duty, science and ethics. The facts of climate change should make it clear that air transport is an ongoing chronic environmental disaster. We need less, not more! I feel sorry for the salmon too.Dr Colin BannonCrapstone, Devon • My response to the 40 business leaders who demand a new runway is to ask if they think planet Earth (the holding company), or indeed any truly world-leading future Britain, can afford further inaction and hypocrisy on climate change. Many of the companies that these CEOs represent make bold claims about sustainability leadership from time to time. No. What the world needs now is a new type of leader who refuses to fly. Every 48 hours spent in the air equates to the entire lifestyle greenhouse gas emissions of one average European. For a year. Yet many of “the great and the good” who speak nobly to inspire us to act on climate chaos happen to be frequent flyers. Flagrant double-talk. Whether they like it or not, the unspoken message is heard loud and clear: “We’re carrying on flying.” We need trend-setters, not jet-setters. Leaders who refuse to fly, saying why. The elephant in the room is flying. Please, “leaders”, no more acting dumbo about that gas-guzzling jumbo. Dave HamptonMarlow, Buckinghamshire • Candidates for O-level maths exams in the 1950s were advised to show their working in order to maximise their marks. I wonder if the signatories to the letter calling for a new runway could be encouraged to show how they came up with a figure of £9.5bn as the amount Britain has missed out on in trade with emerging economies as a result of the lack of a new runway. Without this working, it seems that such a figure and the argument it supports becomes meaningless.Christopher MooreYork  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"
"The CSIRO will meet Malcolm Roberts to discuss global warming after the innovation and science minister, Greg Hunt, intervened to help the One Nation senator obtain a briefing. Roberts told Guardian Australia he would listen to the evidence, despite having described climate data that contradicted his view as “corrupted”.  In Senate question time on Thursday Roberts asked the minister for resources and Northern Australia, Matt Canavan, for “the specific location of data that proves claims that humans affect global climate change”. Canavan replied that the Coalition accepted the science on climate change, which Roberts derided as the “opinions and beliefs of the CSIRO”. Roberts asked the government in question time and in writing to help arrange a meeting with the science agency. A CSIRO spokesman confirmed on Friday Hunt had done so. Roberts told Guardian Australia the CSIRO would brief him in the next two weeks. “My core aim is, as always, to get the empirical data that underlies their claim that carbon dioxide is affecting global climate, because they’ve never provided it before,” he said. The CSIRO publishes a wealth of such data on the Climate Change in Australia website. The CSIRO spokesman said: “CSIRO does not speak on the details of meetings with individuals, including members of parliament and senators.” Roberts has consistently rejected arguments that humans cause global warming, despite the overwhelming scientific consensus.  He demanded evidence in his inaugural speech on Tuesday and in an appearance on the ABC’s Q&A, but when data was immediately produced on air, he said it had been corrupted by manipulation by Nasa and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Asked if he would accept CSIRO’s data when he met its representatives, Roberts said: “What we’ve said all along quite openly is that we’re all ears. “We are going to give them every opportunity to show that humans are affecting global climate. It’s about listening not talking – giving them a fair go to explain it now that I’m a senator.” In his inaugural speech Roberts said atmospheric temperatures fell between the 1930s and the 1970s. “Temperatures are now cooler than 130 years ago and this is the reverse of what we’re blatantly told by the Bureau of Meteorology that has manipulated cooling trends into false warming trends,” he said. Roberts’s claims have already been the subject of rebuttals, including by Guardian Australia and Steven Sherwood, director of the climate change research centre at the University of New South Wales. Sherwood said: “Scientists have all interpreted the evidence, going back decades, and unanimously agree that it proves beyond a reasonable doubt that humans are increasing carbon dioxide and this is causing warming.  “There is not a single respectable atmospheric scientist in the world whom I know of, who disagrees with either of these conclusions.” A spokesman for Hunt said “the minister has been one of the strongest advocates for climate science in Australia”. “The minister has a standing offer to any members of parliament to facilitate meetings with the department or key agencies such as CSIRO.”"
"Global investment in energy fell by 8% last year to $1.8tn (£1.4), reflecting low oil and gas prices and cost falls in the sector, new data shows. Nearly half of the decline was accounted for by the US, where plunging oil prices and a recent boom in shale gas, along with cost deflation in the energy sector, have played an increasing role. China remained the world’s biggest investor in energy worldwide, with $315bn spent in 2015, despite a slowing in the pace of its headlong economic growth. Despite falls overall, investment in renewable energy in 2015 remained robust, according to the International Energy Agency, the global energy watchdog, which amassed the data. The move towards clean energy was driven by government policies, with countries pursuing low-carbon growth. About $313bn was invested in renewable and other low-carbon forms of energy last year, representing about a fifth of total energy spending. Much of it was in electricity generation, in which renewable power takes the lion’s share of available investment funds. This has been further aided by steep falls in the cost of wind turbines and solar panels. By contrast, investment around the world in gas-fired power generation, touted as a transition technology between coal-fired power generation and renewables, fell by close to 40%. The investment figures show the mood before the landmark agreement on climate change reached in Paris last December. Under that accord, nearly 200 countries agreed to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. This will entail curbs to greenhouse gas emissions from all the world’s major economies, developed and developing, and meeting these targets will require new policies to favour low-carbon energy above fossil fuels. Such actions should mean further boosts to clean energy sources in years to come. The IEA, in the report World Energy Investment 2016, found that the world’s energy systems were undergoing “a broad reorientation” promoting low-carbon energy sources and greater energy efficiency. But the organisation said that investment in these must be ramped up much further if the aims embraced in Paris were to be achieved. Fatih Birol, executive director of the agency, said: “We see a broad shift of spending towards cleaner energy. Government measures can work and are key to a successful energy transition. But while progress has been achieved, investors need clarity and certainty from policymakers. Governments must not only maintain, but heighten, their commitment to achieve energy security and climate goals.” However, his emphasis on renewable forms of power generation was disputed by Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association. He said that the continuing use of coal, especially in Asia where most new coal-fired power stations are being built, showed the need for massive new investment in carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities, which barely figure in today’s investments. He said: “In many countries, coal is the logical low-cost power choice, particularly in Asia. To assume that fossil fuels will not be required or can be substituted in the next few decades is likely to lead to cheaper, less efficient coal technology being deployed, threatening the ability to deliver global climate objectives. It is critical that energy investment is directed towards all forms of low-carbon technology. Policy parity for CCS is essential if we are to achieve the best outcomes possible.”"
