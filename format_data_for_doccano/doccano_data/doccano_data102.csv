"The world may increasingly look to geoengineering in the wake of the latest UN climate report, which says it could be adopted as a temporary “remedial measure” if the world heads towards dangerous levels of warming. The authors of the new 1.5C study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change say there is high agreement that the injection of millions of tonnes of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere could help limit temperature rises to the most ambitious target of the Paris accord. But the authors warn there are major uncertainties about the social, environmental and ecological impacts, which mean the world would be far better off if policymakers strengthened natural cooling systems such as forest cover and accelerated efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The lengthy document – which was approved at the weekend by all 195 nations in the UN – mentions several options for man-made interference in climate systems, including ocean fertilisation, carbon dioxide removal, marine cloud brightening, cirrus cloud thinning and ground-based albedo modification. A key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment. The scientists found: • By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C. • Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C • Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds. • If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost But it focused most on stratospheric aerosol injection, a technique that essentially mimics the effect of a volcano by pumping gas into the sky that turns into aerosols, which reflect part of the sun’s heat. Although the authors do not include such strategies in their pathways to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures, they raise the possibility that it could be used as a supplementary measure if this target is missed. “If mitigation efforts do not keep global mean temperature below 1.5C, solar radiation modification can potentially reduce the climate impacts of a temporary temperature overshoot, in particular extreme temperatures, rate of sea level rise and intensity of tropical cyclones, alongside intense mitigation and adaptation efforts,” the report observes. A search for palliatives will be necessary as the world is almost certain to miss the 1.5C goal. Current national pledges are forecast to lead to at least 3C of warming by the end of the century – and that is if governments keep their commitments. The IPCC is clearly hesitant to endorse such emergency measures in part because this could allow government leaders to continue pushing problems into the future, but also because of the immense risks involved. The report notes that the injection of sulphur dioxide would change rainfall patterns and weather circulation as well as disrupting stratospheric chemistry and ice formation. It could also result in more ultraviolet light exposure, which would have a negative impact on human health. Ethical and institutional questions also arise over who would oversee such operations and which areas would be affected. The report suggests a number of UN organisations as possible supervisory bodies. But authors also observe that there are scarcely any laws or regulations to stop any country that wants to push ahead by itself. The only guideline cited was the Convention on Biodiversity which states “no climate-related geoengineering activity that affects biodiversity may take place.” There are doubts also over effectiveness. While the aerosols might constrain temperature rises, they would not stop the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the acidification of the oceans. What happens when this “temporary measure” is halted is also an area of concern, as the planetary system might suddenly be hit by a surge in temperature. The IPCC says these uncertainties constrain the ability to implement solar radiation management in the near future. But with the 1.5C target current on course to be overshot at some point between 2030 and 2052, the urgency is likely to grow. Johan Rockström, coauthor of the recent Hothouse Earth study, said the IPCC report was likely to stimulate discussion of these extreme emergency measures. “I think this will raise solar radiation management to the highest political level. We currently have no framework for this,” he said. “I’m very scared of this technology but we need to turn every stone now.” James Hansen said the tipping point in public opinion was more likely to come at a slightly higher temperature, but by then it may already be too late. “2C would force geoengineering on today’s young people. Geoengineering, if global temperature passes 2C, would start, at the latest, once ice sheet collapse begins,” he told the Guardian. “Unfortunately, because of the inertia of the system, geoengineering then would probably be too late to prevent locking in the eventual loss of coastal cities.”"
"Faced with a major UN report that warns of floods, drought, extreme heat and increased poverty should the world not take radical action to address climate change, Donald Trump has been uncharacteristically quiet. The US president was visiting Florida, a state particularly vulnerable to sea level rise and currently in the path of Hurricane Michael, when the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned on Monday that “unprecedented” changes were needed to stave off dire impacts if the world warms 1.5C beyond the pre-industrial period.  Trump, who has previously called climate change a “hoax” and questioned whether global warming was occurring because it snowed last winter, told reporters only that he was aware of the report: “It was given to me. And I want to look at who drew it … Because I can give you reports that are fabulous, and I can give you reports that aren’t so good. But I will be looking at it, absolutely.” Trump has been at odds with the rest of the world when it comes to climate change, with the US the world’s only country to disavow the Paris climate agreement, which committed governments to attempt to stay within the 1.5C limit. The planet has already warmed by around 1C over the past 150 years. “I don’t think the administration cares about this at all,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, prior to Trump’s brief comments. “They just want to figure out how to ignore it all. It’s really disappointing. It’s a real failure that the US government isn’t helping people understand there’s a train coming down the track fast at us and we need to get out of the way.” “We need an international agreement where there is leadership. It would be great if that was the US, but someone else has to step up now.” The US Environmental Protection Agency, which has an official position that climate change is harmful to public health, thanked the “hard work of the scientists and experts” but said it did not “formally endorse specific findings presented by the authors”. Under the Trump administration, the EPA has taken a more industry-friendly stance, weakening greenhouse gas rules around oil drilling and vehicle fuel efficiency, as well as tearing up an Obama-era plan to limit pollution from coal-fired power plants. The agency removed its section on climate change from its website last year for an “update” that has yet to materialize. A spokeswoman for the state department said the US is “leading the world in providing affordable, abundant and secure energy to our citizens, while protecting the environment and reducing emissions through job-creating innovation”. She pointed out that US carbon dioxide emissions in 2017 were at their lowest level since 1992, outlining an approach to climate change that has “unburdened communities, individuals and industries by allowing them to develop and implement policies that fit their needs”. According to the IPCC report, however, far deeper cuts – resulting in net zero emissions by 2050 – will be required if the world is to avoid warming beyond 1.5C. Scientists have warned that the enormous changes in energy, transportation and land use required to meet this goal are technically possible, but currently appear unlikely. “Keeping warming below 1.5C will be very, very hard,” said Dessler. “It’s going to take a reimagining of how the world is constructed around us and we are lacking imagination. Fundamentally, we need to change the politicians in Washington. That’s the key.”"
"Maricela Ruelas is a manager at a vineyard in Medford, Oregon. She trims, harvests – whatever needs doing. This year, she has done much of that work in a face mask. Wildfire smoke has plagued her and her fellow workers nearly continuously for “a couple of months”, she said through a translator, leading to pounding headaches. “It was horrible, horrible this year.” For Ruelas, the smoke isn’t just a nuisance; it’s an economic hardship. She and her co-workers are paid by the hour, so when they have to leave work early because their heads and lungs hurt, they don’t get paid. And Ruelas sends less money home to her grown children in Guadalajara. The west is drier, hotter than ever, frequently on fire. Thanks to reduced snowpacks in the mountains, the soil is parched by early summer and forests are tinder. What firefighters once called a “fire season” is now referred to as a “fire year”, since the fires start so early and rage deep into fall. These extreme phenomena are causing some people to consider leaving the western US, a place long conceptualized in the American imagination as the land of balmy weather and fresh starts. Some have already left. They are sick of wildfire smoke; worried that a lack of water will destroy their communities or about climate migrants from other parts of the country; and struggling with the heat itself. “I felt bad leaving people behind who don’t have that ability to uproot,” said Michael Lakeman, a New Zealander who moved with his American wife and kids back to his home country from Seattle this summer. “We’d been living in Seattle for 17 years, really good life. Good jobs, good friends, nice house.” The seed of the idea to move was planted when Donald Trump won the presidential election. Lakeman and his wife didn’t want their daughters growing up in a “political climate of misogyny” – but Lakeman also worried about the effects of climate change, including wildfire smoke and the disruptions caused by internal migration away from the hottest cities. As a consultant on renewable energy, he thought about climate change a lot. He worried about Seattle, already straining from the influx of many tech workers, ending up as an overcrowded refuge for those fleeing drought and heat in the desert south-west. “What happens when the Colorado river dries up?” he wonders. “Where are the millions of people who call Phoenix and Vegas home going to go when there is no water?” Lakeman’s young daughters are adjusting to Auckland. Lakeman describes New Zealand as “small, not crowded, maritime, far away from the rest of the world – a good place to escape”. Climate change has already raised temperatures across the globe. The United States is predicted to be about 2.5F (1.4C) hotter from 2021 to 2050 compared with the late 20th century. On the porch of his home in Klamath Falls, a 64-year old marine veteran, his forearms decorated with patriotic tattoos, looks out over a sparkling blue lake and golden, grass-covered hills. The man doesn’t want to use his name because he doesn’t want his employer to know he is thinking of leaving the area. His view is stunning, but he has barely seen it lately. For most of the last few months, smoke has blanketed the Klamath Basin, reaching levels deemed “unhealthy” and “hazardous” by the Environmental Protection Agency. The man has chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and uses an oxygen tank 24 hours a day. For much of the summer, he hasn’t even been able to come out on the porch without a mask over his oxygen tubing. The future holds little hope: researchers project that smoke from wildfires will double by mid-century and triple by 2100 in the American west. The man’s daughter is 11. He bought her a cruiser bike this summer but she hasn’t been on it once. She played video games inside instead. Every morning, the man wakes up and checks the air quality. “First thing I do when I get up, I hit refresh on my laptop to see if I can get on my porch,” he said. “It feels like you are a prisoner of your own environment.” He has told his reluctant wife and child that he is near the breaking point. “If it is like this next summer,” he said, “we’re out.” Moving might be challenging. He has calculated that a move to the Oregon coast, which sees fewer smoky days, would cost at least $5,000 in moving costs, plus a first and last month’s rent and security deposit. It is money he doesn’t have. For his last birthday, his daughter made decorations for the home he spends so much time trapped inside: glass jars filled with sand and seashells. “We can’t go to the ocean, so I brought the ocean to him,” she said. There’s another problem with the coast – experts predict up to 1.6 meters (5ft) of sea-level rise on the west coast over the next 100 years. More than 130,000 coastal homes will be at risk by 2100, and acres of wetlands that buffer storms will be lost. “I think that’s the hard part: coming to grips with the fact that there really is no safe refuge,” said Shelby Edwards, a retired major who worked on disaster preparedness in the Army and now advises companies on how to prep for the worst. “None of us humans get to escape this at this point.” Edwards moved to central Oregon just a few years ago for the sunshine, but is now looking for someplace else she, her horses and dogs can call home. For several years, smoke and falling ash has made it impossible to ride or hike for long periods – and she fears for her health after years of inhaling “colored smoke, diesel and tons of it, dust, riot control gas, and all kinds of other burning crap that gets in your lungs” during her deployments in Afghanistan. Edwards doesn’t want to leave the west, but even if she did, she says nowhere is without climate impacts. “If you go into the midwest, you’ve got drought. If you go into the east coast you have hurricanes and rising sea levels, severe storms. Their flavor of disruption is different.” She’s been searching for two years for just the right place to go within the region. One key thing she is looking for are tightly knit communities with a lot of economic diversity. She thinks they will be more resilient to any number of climate change-related problems, from fire to flooding to crop failure. “There are some communities that are brittle, that don’t have a lot of capacity for change.” The effects of climate change across the west will vary, and the shuffling of populations could be complex, according to Solomon Hsiang, an economist who studies climate change at the University of California, Berkeley. The south-west, especially Arizona and New Mexico, is already extremely hot and only getting hotter. Hsiang expects many residents there will hunker down in the air conditioning and stay. “People who have chosen to live there are often not there because they have chosen to spend lots of time outside,” he says. In places where going outside is part of the culture, like San Diego, extreme heatwaves might send more people packing. But the Pacific west – California, Oregon and Washington – is predicted to be one of the areas of the country that will warm the least under climate change, despite persistent wildfire smoke, and might end up attracting migrants from other areas of the country. So the patterns of movement will be complex, Hsiang says. It was faith in her community that helped freelance writer Cally Carswell decide to stay in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Early this year she had been spooked by an eerily warm and dry winter in an already arid city. “We barely got any snow at all,” she said. “I could see the snow on the mountains melt within a day or two each time we got snowfall.” She worried that drought might destroy the community and with it the value of her home, and wrote an essay about her indecision over whether to leave for High Country News. In the end, her research into the water-saving moves the city was making made her cautiously optimistic. But she’s not sure how long she’ll stay. “It is something we are going to have to feel out as we go,” she said Carswell, as a freelancer, is relatively free to move. It is harder for those whose livelihoods are tied to the land, like Ruelas. She knows the fires are getting worse, and worries about long-term health effects, but she does not want to leave her job. She feels powerless to do anything about the situation, though she dreams of a big machine that would absorb all the smoke that is hurting her and her co-workers. She feels that politicians and those in power don’t care about her suffering and are happy to profit off her by selling her medicine when she gets sick. She wishes that people with the luxury of working inside in climate-controlled offices would treat her with more humanity. On the smokiest days, she said, the sun looks strange and she can feel the smoke start to hurt by midday. “Sooner or later,” she says, “there will be consequences.”"

"Climate change is an existential threat to the human race. This may seem an absurd or alarmist statement, since we have been conditioned by unparallelled growth to expect that there are no catastrophes that are insurmountable. Even apocalyptic science fiction deals with bands of survivors who have, by definition, survived. And we always imagine ourselves as among the survivors.  But the threat is real. The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tells us that there are only a dozen or so years in which to change our economies radically if we are to keep the effects of the warming already under way to manageable proportions. That would require the countries of the world to live up to the most ambitious of the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, and keep the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. A rise of even half a degree above that, to 2C, will have effects that are very much worse. Already this seems much more likely. All corals will disappear, as will many insects and plants.  The disappearance of plants, and in particular the deforestation of tropical regions, is doubly dangerous, because it converts carbon sinks (which living trees are, because they absorb carbon dioxide) into producers of carbon. That is only one of the many possible tipping points which may lead to a sudden and violent escalation of the rate of change as malign feedback loops are formed. All these risks make it quite credible that we will end with a warming of 3C, 4C or even worse – and the consequences will be globally terrible, and everywhere unavoidable. Hundreds of millions of people may die through droughts on land, and flooding at the coasts, through the loss of marine species due to acidification of the oceans, and probably through the disruption of long-term weather patterns around which the world’s agriculture has been shaped. These victims will not passively await their fates. Among the tipping points that we cannot foresee in any detail is the prospect of historically unprecedented refugee migrations as whole populations who have no choice but to starve or move set out for land where they can live. The political and indeed the military consequences are unlikely to be small. None of this will only be the product of vast impersonal forces, any more than our present crisis is. There are always political and economic choices that explain our actions. A recent study identified 90 different organisations, ranging from states to private companies, that were between them responsible for nearly two-thirds of carbon emissions since 1864. They all behaved as rational, profit-seeking actors without any external responsibilities, and so brought us to the brink of catastrophe. This kind of twisted rationality exacerbates the dangerous physical effects of climate change.  The election of Jair Bolsonaro as president of Brazil now seems overwhelmingly likely, and he is committed, like Donald Trump, to withdrawing his country from the Paris accords. His policies in the Amazon basin will greatly accelerate deforestation. In Australia, the government of Scott Morrison must deal with the reality of climate change in the form of droughts and wildfires, but is at the same time denying any responsibility for the effects of its own actions when they worsen the situation. This kind of short-term selfishness can’t be overcome only by appeals to unselfishness or to solidarity. Only long-term self-interest can be stronger: perhaps the fear that international anarchy must ultimately lead to international war in an age of nuclear and biological weapons. It is not the direct effects of climate change alone but their indirect effects on the political and economic structures of the world that make it a genuinely existential threat. As individuals in the rich world, we should all eat less meat and use less fossil-fuel energy. But individual action will never be enough. We must also work to strengthen the kind of political structures that will enable, and if needed compel, the cooperation that is the only alternative to destructive anarchy."
"This week, hundreds of scientists and government officials from more than 190 countries have been buzzing around a convention centre in the South Korean city of Incheon. They are trying to agree on the first official release of a report – the bit called the Summary for Policymakers – that pulls together all of what’s known about how the world might be affected once global warming gets to 1.5C.  What will happen to coral reefs? How will extreme weather events and droughts change? What about heatwaves? And then, what are the different “pathways” that economies could choose to keep temperatures to 1.5C? On Monday morning, the summary document is expected to be released, and there will be a cascade of headlines around the world. The report, being pulled together by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, was one tiny part of the Paris climate change agreement. As things stand, if you add up all the things that the 190-plus countries have committed to do as part of that Paris deal, global temperatures will probably go well above 3C. We’re already at 1C of warming, so the extra half a degree isn’t far away – many scientists will say it’s already locked in, while others say there are plausible ways to stabilise temperatures at that level. But in August, one of the world’s leading scientific journals – the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences – published a “perspective” article that has become known as the “hothouse earth” paper. There was no new science in the paper and while it was speculative, it did raise fundamental questions about the ability of governments around the world to stop the Earth from spiralling into a “hothouse”. One of the report’s authors, Professor Will Steffen, of Australian National University and the Stockholm Resilience Centre, talked me through it. The problem lies with “feedbacks” – in the “supplementary information” attached to the paper, Steffen and colleagues actually listed 10 of them. With each, they include estimates of how much extra CO2 and temperature they could add once you hit about 2C of global warming. For example, the ability of the land and ocean to keep soaking up CO2 could weaken, giving you an extra 0.25C of warming. Dieback of trees in the Amazon and subarctic could give us another 0.1C. Permafrost, which is already starting to defy its name by not being all that permanent, could release ever more methane and carbon that might add a bit more warming again (0.09C is the estimate there). The point is that once you add them all up, you get close to 0.5C of warming by the end of the century. Given we’re already at 1C of global warming, that makes the job of keeping warming “well below 2C” or even holding it at 1.5C much, much harder than it already is. And there’s the rub. While governments have the means to affect how much CO2 gets released through policies that radically cut the use of fossil fuels, it would be much harder to get a grip on thawing permafrosts, mass forest collapses or the loss of polar sea ice. By failing to get a grip on a thing that’s feasibly under your control, we end up risking the release a whole gang of other monsters that we can’t. This gets us to another big issue, says Steffen, because climate models don’t include some of these feedbacks. In essence, the warmer things get, the less reliable the models become. He tells me: “I think the dominant linear, deterministic framework for assessing climate change is flawed, especially at higher levels of temperature rise. So, yes, model projections using models that don’t include these processes indeed become less useful at higher temperature levels. Or, as my co-author John Schellnhuber says, we are making a big mistake when we think we can “park” the Earth System at any given temperature rise – say 2C – and expect it to stay there.” For those who understand the idea of a carbon budget – where scientists have calculated how much CO2 you could emit before hitting certain temperature rises – it looks even meaner than before if Steffen and his colleagues are right. But as they also point out, several of these feedbacks might have “tipping points” that then set off a cascade of other issues. Steffen says: “Even at the current level of warming of about 1C above pre-industrial, we may have already crossed a tipping point for one of the feedback processes (Arctic summer sea ice), and we see instabilities in others – permafrost melting, Amazon forest dieback, boreal forest dieback and weakening of land and ocean physiological carbon sinks. And we emphasise that these processes are not linear and often have built-in feedback processes that generate tipping point behaviour. For example, for melting permafrost, the chemical process that decomposes the peat generates heat itself, which leads to further melting and so on.” For the record, Steffen thinks the assumptions in climate models that cuts in fossil fuel emissions will deliver relative cuts in temperatures “is OK for perhaps lower temperature rises of 1.5 or 2C” but beyond that, he’s sceptical. The paper has received a bit of pushback from scientists, largely, it appears, because of the sensational headlines it attracted. For example, Professor Richard Betts, of the UK’s MetOffice, has a measured perspective that’s well worth a look. Dr Glen Peters, an Australian scientist and climate modeller based at the Centre for International Climate Research in Norway, also thought some of the media coverage went too far with the doomsday vibe. But he told me that while it was true that many of the feedbacks in the paper were not well covered by climate models, this was partly because they were not that well understood. I’ll leave you with his thoughts: “The hothouse earth paper conjectures that many of these feedbacks may interact like a domino effect, lead the Earth system to spiral out of control to reach a new steady state very different from today, and these processes may even start if we are successful at meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. “There is also an important timescale question, are we talking decades or millennia, and that is very important for how society may respond. While all the claims made in the hothouse earth paper are justified, we simply don’t have the data to verify if those claims are true. While the paper put in plenty of language to indicate its exploratory nature … many headlines and statements went too far, indicating we had already gone too far and there was no turning back.”"
"World leaders have been told they have moral obligation to ramp up their action on the climate crisis in the wake of a new UN report that shows even half a degree of extra warming will affect hundreds of millions of people, decimate corals and intensify heat extremes. But the muted response by Britain, Australia and other governments highlights the immense political challenges facing adoption of pathways to the relatively safe limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures outlined on Monday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). With the report set to be presented at a major climate summit in Poland in December, known as COP24, there is little time for squabbles. The report noted that emissions need to be cut by 45% by 2030 in order to keep warming within 1.5C. That means decisions have to be taken in the next two years to decommission coal power plants and replace them with renewables, because major investments usually have a lifecycle of at least a decade. Mary Robinson, a UN special envoy on climate, said Europe should set an example by adopting a target of zero-carbon emissions by 2050. “Before this, people talked vaguely about staying at or below 2C – we now know that 2C is dangerous,” she said. “So it is really important that governments take the responsibility, but we must all do what we can.” The UK, which has gone further than most nations by cutting its annual emissions by 40% since 1990, will need to step up if the more ambitious goal is to be reached. A key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment. The scientists found: • By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C. • Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C • Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds. • If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost Claire Perry, minister for energy, said the government would outline its next steps in the next few days: “I welcome the strong scientific analysis behind today’s IPCC report and its conclusions are stark and sober. As policymakers we need to work together to accelerate the low-carbon transition to minimise the costs and misery of a rapidly warming world.” But her failure to spell out how this would be achieved was criticised by Green party MP Caroline Lucas, who said the UK government has slashed support for renewables, pushed ahead with fracking and airport expansion, and continues to subsidise fossil fuels. “If ministers are serious about taking the action they admit is needed,” Lucas said, “the government would commit today to reversing the freeze on fuel duty announced last week and lifting the ban on onshore wind turbines. And crucially, Claire Perry must stop forcing fracking on communities who’ve rejected it.” Bob Ward, of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change, said the UK had a good track record but needed to be more ambitious, which would require action across a wider area of government: “More effort is needed from other departments. For instance, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government needs to be more proactive in ensuring that buildings become zero-carbon as soon as possible. And the Department for Transport must be more ambitious on developing electric vehicles.” Politicians, scientists and climate activists will hold a meeting chaired by Lord Krebs, former member of the Committee on Climate Change, in parliament on Wednesday to discuss the new 1.5C report and consider policy options. Among those attending will be Jim Skea, a co-chair of the IPCC working group on mitigation. “My biggest hope is that they [political leaders] take this seriously,” Skea said. “We can’t carry on with business as usual or minor changes.” But there is increasing pushback by the world’s powerful fossil fuel and agribusiness interests, who are supporting politicians who are apathetic or hostile to climate action. The new IPCC report stressed the urgent need for reforestation and greater forest protection, but within hours of its release the first round of the Brazilian presidential election ended with a huge lead for Jair Bolsonaro, who has promised to quit the Paris accord and open up the Amazon rainforest to farmers and miners. Donald Trump has also announced that the US will pull out of the climate deal. And in Australia, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said there was no money for “global climate conferences and all that nonsense”. So far, however, no government has actually dropped out and civil society groups say the new report by scientists will help them put pressure on leaders to aim for the safer, lower level of warming. “Any administration, and it would appear especially the US and Australia, that pushes damaging domestic policies and picks apart science consensus is a dangerous outlier by ignoring the deadly impacts now due to climate chaos,” said Rachel Kennerley of Friends of the Earth. “International cooperation is manifestly preferable but the rest of the world will have to double down on efforts – it’s a shortsighted block to the global efforts needed that this report sets out, but it’s not insurmountable either.” Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, said the urgent message of the report “must be carried into the halls of power and the negotiation rooms at COP24. This should be a moral imperative for all leaders around the world.”"
"From the beginning of next year, a new global pact will take effect that could have a profound impact on climate change, cutting harmful greenhouse gas emissions by amounts that could help stave off some of the worst impacts predicted by the IPCC. This little-noticed treaty has nothing to do with the Paris accord, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations that have dragged on since 1992, or energy sector emissions, which have resumed their rise. The Kigali amendment, which was agreed on 15 October 2016 and comes into force on 1 January, will drastically reduce hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These heat-trapping gases are the byproduct of industrial processes such as refrigeration and can be eliminated from those processes by re-engineering. The amendment comes under the Montreal Protocol, the world’s most successful international environmental treaty, which aims to stop the depletion of the ozone layer. HFCs are prime examples of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), a range of chemicals that are spewed into the atmosphere by human activities and contribute to global warming. While attempts to reduce climate change have rightly focused on the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, mostly produced from our use of fossil fuels, these other substances have been largely ignored. Experts estimate that cutting down on SLCPs could reduce global warming by as much as 0.5C. That would not be enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change if we continue to burn fossil fuels, but it could buy humanity some much-needed time while carbon emissions are brought under better control. “The only way to slow near-term feedbacks [which could drive climate change past tipping points] in the 15- to 20-year window before we lose control to runaway warming is to cut the SLCPs, which can provide considerably more avoided warming at mid-century than cuts to carbon dioxide can provide,” said Durwood Zaelke, founder of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development and a reviewer of the IPCC report on the effects of 1.5C warming. “In fact, [they could provide] two to six times more [than carbon cuts].” He said the IPCC had recognised their importance. “This is the IPCC’s first acknowledgement that cutting the super pollutants – black carbon, methane, HFCs – is essential for keeping the climate safe. These cuts are the fastest way to slow down warming while we decarbonise the energy system and learn how to remove carbon from the atmosphere at the scale we need.” Many SLCPs break down relatively quickly in the atmosphere, unlike carbon dioxide, which can stick around for a century. But while they are present, they can have a greater impact: some HFCs have a global warming potential more than 11,000 times greater than that of carbon dioxide. The Kigali amendment, by avoiding the equivalent of up to 90bn tonnes of CO2 by 2050, could be “perhaps the single most significant contribution to keeping warming well below 2C, aiming for the still safer 1.5C,” Zaelke told the Guardian. A recent report, before the IPCC publication, by Oxfam and the World Resources Institute found that reducing SLCPs warranted a much greater focus than it has received in climate change efforts. “In the near term, taking fast, ambitious action to reduce SLCPs is particularly vital to keeping temperature rise below 1.5C,” the authors said. “As with present-day impacts of climate change, the impacts associated with crossing such thresholds in the future will impact poor and vulnerable communities first and worst.” Another SLCP is methane, produced when vegetation rots and from animals, and in the form of natural gas from fossil fuel exploration. Methane is more than 20 times as powerful as carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas, but few attempts are made to stop it reaching the atmosphere, even from easily containable sources such as sewage plants and intensive livestock farms, and from industrial sources such as fracking wells and oil and gas production. Soot, or black carbon, is another byproduct of burning fossil fuels, and its effects can clearly be seen at the poles, particularly the Arctic. Brown, black and grey stains over the pristine wildernesses of Greenland, Siberia and Alaska come not from natural sources but from the fall of soot from the air, carried thousands of miles from fossil fuel burning. The stains contribute to warming, because the darkened snow absorbs more heat instead of reflecting it. Soot from power station chimneys and vehicle tailpipes can be captured at source or reduced by switching to burning cleaner fuels. But getting rid of soot helps combat not just warming but also air pollution, as the particles are one of the leading causes of ill-health from environmental factors. Cutting down on soot is not straightforward, however. The contribution of aerosols such as soot and other small particles to warming is complex: while soot on Earth blackens snow and other surfaces and increases warming, aerosols high in the atmosphere deflect some of the sun’s rays back into space. This dimming effect could have already saved the world from as much as 0.5C warming that might have been expected from the quantities of carbon now in the air, according to Johan Rockström, chief scientist at Conservation International. Removing soot or stopping its release into the air might end up being of less use to the climate than stopping other SLCPs as a result, but it would save lives blighted by air pollution. Zaelke said: “With the wolf of climate impacts at our door, time for our counter-offensive is short. The 30 years of success of the Montreal Protocol should inspire us to take still stronger actions, and to use additional tailor-made agreements to address specific business sector emissions, with the full engagement of industry.”"
"A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms the enormous wisdom that governments showed in Paris in December 2015, when they agreed to the goal of “pursuing efforts” to limit global warming to 1.5C. The report’s summary for policymakers paints a sobering picture of the potentially terrible impacts of allowing global mean surface temperature to rise by 2C compared with pre-industrial levels: more extreme weather, sea level rise and ocean acidification, with detrimental effects on wildlife, crops, water availability and human health.  But the policymakers, or at least their aides, should make the effort to read the whole report. Incredibly, the stark summary is still a relatively conservative assessment of the consequences we might face if global warming does exceed 1.5C. The report is a comprehensive review of the published evidence painstakingly compiled by hundreds of authors and reviewers over the past two and a half years. The summary of the report was approved line by line by governments, including the US, Australia and Saudi Arabia, during long and intensive discussions last week in South Korea. It is written in matter-of-fact language, but it omits some of the biggest risks of climate change, which are described in the full text. For instance, the summary indicates that warming of 2C would have very damaging impacts on many parts of the world. But it does not mention the potential for human populations to migrate and be displaced as a result, leading to the possibility of war. This is a risk that many governments around the world have already recognised, with climate change often highlighted in national security assessments as a “threat multiplier”, which could increase the chances of political instability and conflict. The summary also leaves out important information about so-called “tipping points” in the climate system, beyond which impacts become unstoppable, irreversible or accelerate. It acknowledges that the land-based ice sheets in Greenland and west Antarctica may be destabilised even by warming of 1.5C, ensuring several metres of sea level rise over the coming centuries. But there is no mention of other important thresholds that might, for instance, halt the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic, or cause shifts in the occurrence of the monsoons in Africa and Asia. It is not clear why such crucial information has been left out of the summary. Perhaps the authors felt that there are too many uncertainties in our knowledge to be definitive. But the danger is that policymakers will assume the absence of these very significant risks from the summary means that researchers have assessed them to be unimportant or impossible. Uncertainties are also evident in the summary assessment of the economics of climate change and the cost of doing something about it. It indicates that, to keep to the 1.5C target, carbon prices would need to be three to four times higher than for 2C. But on the overall investment required, it states: “The literature on total mitigation costs of 1.5C mitigation pathways is limited and was not assessed in this report”. In fact, a paper on this subject was published by British economists, including some of my colleagues, in the journal Annual Review of Environment and Resources. It examined the evidence on the total investments required and concluded that over the course of this century they would only need to be 50% higher to limit warming to 1.5C instead of 2C. So not quite as scary as the numbers for a specific hike on carbon prices might suggest. These omissions in the IPCC summary are puzzling. But nevertheless the overwhelming conclusion any reasonable policymakers will reach from reading the summary is that the target of keeping global warming to 1.5C is both affordable and absolutely necessary in order to avoid highly dangerous consequences. The question now is whether world leaders such as Donald Trump and Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, will ignore the IPCC report and continue their policy of inaction on climate change, including a disregard of the Paris agreement, when the impacts so clearly threaten the lives and livelihoods of people in their countries and around the world. • Bob Ward is policy and communications director at the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science."

"Scientists are right to stress that halting rampant deforestation is vital to mitigating climate change (Scientists say halting deforestation ‘just as urgent’ as reducing emissions, 4 October). But forests do much more than serve as carbon sinks; their value is far greater and multidimensional. They enable clean air and water, preserve the integrity of complex ecosystems, prevent soil erosion, and contain an extraordinary variety of plants, many of which are critical components of life-saving medicines.  People struggle with taking climate change seriously because it feels temporally distant, abstract, and can be hard to visualise and appreciate palpably. Deforestation, on the other hand, is much easier to visualise and understand. We must make every effort to reduce deforestation drastically and demand that countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia and China take decisive measures to curb deforestation and contribute to afforestation and reforestation where they are ecologically advisable and viable. The US, Europe, Canada and Australia can all make far greater efforts to incentivise forest protection (including domestically), promote ecosystem integrity globally, mobilise consumers to reject products that stem from ecologically abusive behaviours, and hold to account those businesses and governments that destroy our forests with policies and actions that are harmful to humanity and the planet as a whole.Noam SchimmelVisiting associate professor of ethics and international affairs, Elliott School of International Affairs, George Washington University, Washington DC • Your review of the BBC documentary Drowning in Plastic questions our ability to turn the plastic tap off before our oceans become a plastic matrix with some jellyfish embedded (A rallying cry to ditch plastic – but is it too late?, G2, 2 October). We are living in a multidimensional plastic matrix and there is no easy and quick fix. However, the International Solid Waste Association has proposed five steps to turn the plastic tap off. First, we should identify where the leakages and hazards occur, and then prioritise fixing them – there is no need for fancy solutions that are not accountable, like some of those mentioned in the article. Second, plastics and microplastics leakages should be treated like CO2 emissions. We need a global plan and an international agreement to reduce them substantially. The problem can’t be solved locally. Third, microplastics should be considered as hazardous substances, subject to stricter control, and replaced by other materials. Fourth, closing the world’s dump sites, upgrading recycling systems and delivering proper collection services to the developing world is a certain way to prevent marine litter. Fifth, we need to create a new operational system for plastics that will stimulate a surge in plastic resource recovery. Plastic is too convenient and successful. Reducing our dependence on it is the only way ahead. We can only hope that new materials will replace existing plastics, as plastics have replaced so many other materials in so many different uses over the past 65 years. Antonis MavropoulosPresident, International Solid Waste Association • The 38 Degrees campaign for empty non-recyclable crisp packets to be posted back to their manufacturer brought a “crinkly” smile to my face (Don’t post crisp packets without an envelope, begs Royal Mail, 27 September). In the interests of reducing the amount of non-recyclable plastic, why not stop buying crisps and other snack food sold in this type of packaging? This would offer a threefold benefit: saving money; reducing consumption of junk food; and reducing the waste currently going to landfill or, worse, into the water systems. And Royal Mail wouldn’t have to put vehicles on the roads to return the empty packets. If crisp sales were to decline, I wonder how long the manufacturers would take before introducing “smart” packaging? Might I suggest edible packets?

"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is set up by the UN and the World Meteorological Organisation, bringing together the world’s leading climate scientists to assess knowledge of climate change and provide scientific advice to policymakers.  The First Assessment report from the IPCC shows the climate changes partly owing to natural variability, but that greenhouse gas emissions from human activity play a role, and predicts temperature rises of 0.3C a decade in the 21st century, higher than seen in 10,000 years, and sea level rises of 60cm by 2100. At a major conference in Rio de Janeiro, world governments sign the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, a treaty binding them to “achieve … stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”, usually shortened to “avoid dangerous climate change”. From this, establishing what level of warming should be classed as “dangerous” and what avoiding this entails, become key questions. The Second Assessment report is published, showing carbon dioxide is the main contributor to warming, and that human actions increasing carbon concentrations in the atmosphere could alter the climate irreversibly.  The Kyoto protocol, an addition to the UNFCCC treaty stipulating cuts in greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries by 2012, is signed. However, the US – then the world’s biggest emitter – fails to ratify the protocol, leaving it in abeyance. It eventually comes into legal force in 2005 after Russia ratifies it. The Third Assessment report is published, showing the world has warmed by 0.6C compared with pre-industrial levels, and in the last 50 years this was mainly due to human activity. The report predicts temperature rises of between 1.4C and 5.8C by 2100, and sea level rises of 0.1 to 0.9 metres. The UK government publishes the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, led by the former World Bank chief economist Sir Nicholas Stern, showing for the first time that the catastrophic economic impacts of climate change far outstrip the relatively modest costs of reducing emissions. The Fourth Assessment teport is published, showing that warming is “unequivocal” with more than 90% certainty that this comes from human activity. The report confirms that beyond certain levels of warming, effects on the climate become irreversible and in many cases catastrophic, and posits scenarios for a range of estimates of future warming. The mid-range estimate of human-induced warming of about 2C above pre-industrial levels is adopted as the threshold of safety in political decisions on curbing greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC is awarded the Nobel peace prize for its efforts. Negotiations begin on a new global climate agreement. Governments meet in Copenhagen intending to draft an effective replacement for the Kyoto protocol. Amid bitter political fighting, they sign a partial declaration instead under which for the first time the biggest developed and developing countries agree to emissions curbs. Before the Copenhagen conference, hacked emails appear to show climate scientists manipulating temperature figures, claims that were later rebuffed but which quickly gain notoriety. By early 2010, the “climategate” scandal has spread to the IPCC, with errors found in its 2007 report. Most are small, but one that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035, taken from an unverified report, causes deep embarrassment. The IPCC introduces reforms to ensure such “grey” material is not included in future reports. The Fifth Assessment report is published in stages, showing the 2C threshold will be breached within 30 years without urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Governments sign the Paris agreement, the first fully legally binding international accord requiring all countries to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration to limit rises to 1.5C. Soon after, the IPCC begins work on assessing whether the 1.5C aspiration is feasible, and how to meet it. A supplementary report on 1.5C rises is published, showing the aspiration is feasible but will require tough and urgent action to bring down greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC will publish its sixth assessment report, drawing together all current knowledge on climate change, its effects and ways to reduce emissions."
"Two American economists at the forefront of work on climate change and the role of governments in boosting growth have been jointly awarded the prestigious Nobel Memorial prize for economics. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said William Nordhaus and Paul Romer were being honoured for their research into two of the most “basic and pressing” economic issues of the age. Nordhaus made his name by warning policymakers during the first stirrings of concern about climate change in the 1970s that their economic models were not properly taking account of the impact of global warming and he is seen as one of the pioneers of environmental economics. The Yale economist was honoured a day after the latest UN warning on global warming said that urgent and unprecedented changes were needed to keep climate change to a maximum of 1.5C (2.7F). The co-winner – Romer – is seen as the prime mover behind the endogenous growth theory, the notion that countries can improve their underlying performance if they concentrate on supply-side measures such as research and development, innovation and skills. The New York University economist, who has argued that technological change can be accelerated by the targeted use of state interventions in areas such as R&D tax credits and patent regulation, famously inspired Gordon Brown to use the phrase “post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory” in a speech when he was shadow chancellor. Romer was the chief economist at the World Bank but left after 15 months following repeated run-ins with staff. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the two men had won the prize – which is not one of those originally instigated by Alfred Nobel – because they had “designed methods for addressing some of our time’s most basic and pressing questions about how we create long-term sustained and sustainable economic growth”. The two men, it continued, had “significantly broadened the scope of economic analysis by constructing models that explain how the market economy interacts with nature and knowledge”. Responding to news of his award, Romer said it was perfectly possible for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, in line with the latest recommendation of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “Once we start to try to reduce carbon emissions, we’ll be surprised that it wasn’t as hard as we anticipated. The danger with very alarming forecasts is that it will make people feel apathetic and hopeless. “One problem today is that people think protecting the environment will be so costly and so hard that they want to ignore the problem and pretend it doesn’t exist. Humans are capable of amazing accomplishments if we set our minds to it.” Per Krusell, one of the panel that awarded the prize, said both men were part of the same agenda, thinking about “long-run, global” issues. Romer and Nordhaus “had similar views about economic policy and market failure, even though superficially they looked different”. Nordhaus has been a prominent advocate of the use of a uniformly applied carbon tax as the best way to put a true cost on the use of burning fossil fuels and so reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The committee that awarded the prize said he was the first person to design “simple but dynamic and quantitative models of the global economic-climate system, now called integrated assessment models (IAMs). “His tools allow us to simulate how the economy and climate would co-evolve in the future under alternative assumptions about the workings of nature and the market economy, including relevant policies.”"
"The former Liberal leader John Hewson has called on voters in his former seat of Wentworth to use the byelection as a referendum on climate change and vote against the Liberals. He suggested it might take “a drubbing” in the byelection on 20 October to force the party he once led to respond to “the urgent challenge” of climate change, and that Liberal voters should consider voting for others before returning to vote Liberal at a general election in six months’ time.  “The community has a unique opportunity now, with a byelection just months before a general election, they could register a substantial protest vote against the government or any other candidates that don’t understand the magnitude and urgency of the climate change challenge,” he told Guardian Australia. “If the Liberal party doesn’t stand up and argue the case on this, I think people should be encouraged to vote against them. “Is it going to take a drubbing in a byelection to get them to do something on climate?” he asked. Hewson led the Liberal party from 1990 to 1994 and has been scathing of the party’s failure to address climate change. The Liberal party’s failure to map out a clear path to achieving the 2030 emissions reduction targets in the Paris agreement was “grossly irresponsible” and amounted to shunting the problem to the next generation, Hewson said. “They think they can just leave it to 2029 but it requires a very large change in the way we do things,” he said. “I get a lot of shit on this, but I am an Australian first and a member of the Liberal party second,” he said. “If I disagree with a Liberal party policy I do my level best to get it changed. It doesn’t mean I am not a Liberal. But to put their head in the sand on this issue – they just fobbed the IPCC report off, like it doesn’t matter – it’s a pretty unsatisfactory position.” The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released this week warned that the world has only 12 years to keep global warming to a maximum of 1.5C or face dire outcomes. Hewson said the Liberal candidate, Dave Sharma, was “a good candidate” but should be permitted to express some views. “If he has a view he should be able to say he would work within the party, and that would probably get him across the line,” he said. Hewson will join the Adani campaigner and former businessman Geoff Cousins and a coral expert, professor Terry Hughes, at a climate change forum in Bondi on Wednesday night as green groups warn that Wentworth would be markedly hotter and 9% drier by 2050. According to modelling produced for environmental groups campaigning to make climate change the central issue in the byelection, Wentworth faces a future where winter resembles summer temperatures and summer becomes even more extreme. The modelling, which will be used in a social media campaign, is done by the Australian National University using data from the Queensland Department of Environment and Science’s Long Paddock project, which is used to predict climate change impacts in regions and cities. It was commissioned by the Australian Conservation Foundation and is one of a series to be used in the next federal election. The “climate coasters” – visual representations of how the climate will change in key electorates – show the seasonal temperatures now and how they will change by 2050 under the IPCC’s high emissions scenario. This assumes that greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow at the current rate and do not moderate before 2050. The modelling for Wentworth shows that by 2050 the average daily maximum temperatures will be 3C hotter than the historic average (compared to 1960-1990 baseline); there will be twice as many days over 30C; and there will be an average of eight days above 35C. “If we allow runaway climate pollution to continue, Wentworth would keep getting hotter and drier,” the ACF climate change and clean energy program manager, Gavan McFadzean, said. “Summer conditions would take over much of the year and more frequent extreme temperatures would put increased pressure on the health of its more vulnerable residents,” he said. Climate change policy is one of the top issues in the byelection, with candidates aiming to capitalise on the Coalition’s dumping of its proposed national energy guarantee just ahead of dumping the former member for Wentworth and former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull had championed the policy as the way of dealing simultaneously with climate change, energy prices and security of supply, but met with strong resistance from some within his own party. The Coalition has now reverted to the Abbott-era emissions reduction fund as its main policy and is investigating options to prolong the life of coal-fired power plants. High-profile independent Kerryn Phelps has released a six-point plan to tackle climate change and has pledged that if elected she will use her position to push towards 50% renewable energy by 2030. Labor’s Tim Murray is arguing that Labor is the only major party with a comprehensive policy to deal with climate change, and that after the next election it will have the ability to legislate it. Labor is promising to have 50% clean energy by 2030. Several of the other independents and minor parties are also putting forward their plans to tackle climate change."
"The world’s leading climate scientists have warned there is only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. The authors of the landmark report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released on Monday say urgent and unprecedented changes are needed to reach the target, which they say is affordable and feasible although it lies at the most ambitious end of the Paris agreement pledge to keep temperatures between 1.5C and 2C. The half-degree difference could also prevent corals from being completely eradicated and ease pressure on the Arctic, according to the 1.5C study, which was launched after approval at a final plenary of all 195 countries in Incheon in South Korea that saw delegates hugging one another, with some in tears. A key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment. The scientists found: • By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C. • Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C • Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds. • If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost “It’s a line in the sand and what it says to our species is that this is the moment and we must act now,” said Debra Roberts, a co-chair of the working group on impacts. “This is the largest clarion bell from the science community and I hope it mobilises people and dents the mood of complacency.” Policymakers commissioned the report at the Paris climate talks in 2016, but since then the gap between science and politics has widened. Donald Trump has promised to withdraw the US – the world’s biggest source of historical emissions – from the accord. The first round of Brazil’s presidential election on Sunday put Jair Bolsonaro into a strong position to carry out his threat to do the same and also open the Amazon rainforest to agribusiness. The world is currently 1C warmer than preindustrial levels. Following devastating hurricanes in the US, record droughts in Cape Town and forest fires in the Arctic, the IPCC makes clear that climate change is already happening, upgraded its risk warning from previous reports, and warned that every fraction of additional warming would worsen the impact. Scientists who reviewed the 6,000 works referenced in the report, said the change caused by just half a degree came as a revelation. “We can see there is a difference and it’s substantial,” Roberts said. At 1.5C the proportion of the global population exposed to water stress could be 50% lower than at 2C, it notes. Food scarcity would be less of a problem and hundreds of millions fewer people, particularly in poor countries, would be at risk of climate-related poverty. At 2C extremely hot days, such as those experienced in the northern hemisphere this summer, would become more severe and common, increasing heat-related deaths and causing more forest fires. But the greatest difference would be to nature. Insects, which are vital for pollination of crops, and plants are almost twice as likely to lose half their habitat at 2C compared with 1.5C. Corals would be 99% lost at the higher of the two temperatures, but more than 10% have a chance of surviving if the lower target is reached. Sea-level rise would affect 10 million more people by 2100 if the half-degree extra warming brought a forecast 10cm additional pressure on coastlines. The number affected would increase substantially in the following centuries due to locked-in ice melt. Oceans are already suffering from elevated acidity and lower levels of oxygen as a result of climate change. One model shows marine fisheries would lose 3m tonnes at 2C, twice the decline at 1.5C. Sea ice-free summers in the Arctic, which is warming two to three times faster than the world average, would come once every 100 years at 1.5C, but every 10 years with half a degree more of global warming. The final tick box is political will Time and carbon budgets are running out. By mid-century, a shift to the lower goal would require a supercharged roll-back of emissions sources that have built up over the past 250 years. The IPCC maps out four pathways to achieve 1.5C, with different combinations of land use and technological change. Reforestation is essential to all of them as are shifts to electric transport systems and greater adoption of carbon capture technology. Carbon pollution would have to be cut by 45% by 2030 – compared with a 20% cut under the 2C pathway – and come down to zero by 2050, compared with 2075 for 2C. This would require carbon prices that are three to four times higher than for a 2C target. But the costs of doing nothing would be far higher. “We have presented governments with pretty hard choices. We have pointed out the enormous benefits of keeping to 1.5C, and also the unprecedented shift in energy systems and transport that would be needed to achieve that,” said Jim Skea, a co-chair of the working group on mitigation. “We show it can be done within laws of physics and chemistry. Then the final tick box is political will. We cannot answer that. Only our audience can – and that is the governments that receive it.” He said the main finding of his group was the need for urgency. Although unexpectedly good progress has been made in the adoption of renewable energy, deforestation for agriculture was turning a natural carbon sink into a source of emissions. Carbon capture and storage projects, which are essential for reducing emissions in the concrete and waste disposal industries, have also ground to a halt. Reversing these trends is essential if the world has any chance of reaching 1.5C without relying on the untried technology of solar radiation modification and other forms of geo-engineering, which could have negative consequences. In the run-up to the final week of negotiations, there were fears the text of the report would be watered down by the US, Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich countries that are reluctant to consider more ambitious cuts. The authors said nothing of substance was cut from a text. Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, said the final document was “incredibly conservative” because it did not mention the likely rise in climate-driven refugees or the danger of tipping points that could push the world on to an irreversible path of extreme warming. The report will be presented to governments at the UN climate conference in Poland at the end of this year. But analysts say there is much work to be done, with even pro-Paris deal nations involved in fossil fuel extraction that runs against the spirit of their commitments. Britain is pushing ahead with gas fracking, Norway with oil exploration in the Arctic, and the German government wants to tear down Hambach forest to dig for coal. At the current level of commitments, the world is on course for a disastrous 3C of warming. The report authors are refusing to accept defeat, believing the increasingly visible damage caused by climate change will shift opinion their way. “I hope this can change the world,” said Jiang Kejun of China’s semi-governmental Energy Research Institute, who is one of the authors. “Two years ago, even I didn’t believe 1.5C was possible but when I look at the options I have confidence it can be done. I want to use this report to do something big in China.” The timing was good, he said, because the Chinese government was drawing up a long-term plan for 2050 and there was more awareness among the population about the problem of rising temperatures. “People in Beijing have never experienced so many hot days as this summer. It’s made them talk more about climate change.” Regardless of the US and Brazil, he said, China, Europe and major cities could push ahead. “We can set an example and show what can be done. This is more about technology than politics.” James Hansen, the former Nasa scientist who helped raised the alarm about climate change, said both 1.5C and 2C would take humanity into uncharted and dangerous territory because they were both well above the Holocene-era range in which human civilisation developed. But he said there was a huge difference between the two: “1.5C gives young people and the next generation a fighting chance of getting back to the Holocene or close to it. That is probably necessary if we want to keep shorelines where they are and preserve our coastal cities.” Johan Rockström, a co-author of the recent Hothouse Earth report, said scientists never previously discussed 1.5C, which was initially seen as a political concession to small island states. But he said opinion had shifted in the past few years along with growing evidence of climate instability and the approach of tipping points that might push the world off a course that could be controlled by emissions reductions. “Climate change is occurring earlier and more rapidly than expected. Even at the current level of 1C warming, it is painful,” he told the Guardian. “This report is really important. It has a scientific robustness that shows 1.5C is not just a political concession. There is a growing recognition that 2C is dangerous.”"

"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has told world leaders that they have a moral obligation to act on climate change and only 12 years in which to do it (Global warming must not exceed 1.5C, landmark UN report warns, 8 October). We must ramp up the noise until the Trump administration and their Congressional enablers hear. The first order of business should be a revenue-neutral carbon tax, preferably one that is returned to taxpayers. Former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen says such a tax is a “no-brainer”, and many other highly respected economists agree. Beyond that and other measures to go green, America must rejoin the global community and re-assume leadership to prevent climate catastrophe. We will succeed or fail together. Only through cooperation with other nations and helping them to cut their carbon emissions can we succeed.

"The new 1.5C report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a sophisticated intelligence briefing on the fate of our planet. Its message is relevant to every human being on Earth. Based on more than 6,000 scientific studies, the report was compiled by more than 80 of the world’s top climate scientists from nearly 40 countries, and calibrates 40,000 peer-review comments. It is a robust and outstanding example of international cooperation, and an extraordinary source of shared intelligence.  With brutal clarity the report covers the devastating consequences of allowing global warming to reach 2C above pre-industrial levels. It makes clear that every fraction of a degree truly matters. A key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment. The scientists found: • By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C. • Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C • Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds. • If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost When compared to the impacts of a 2C temperature increase, limiting warming to 1.5C (we are already at 1C) would significantly reduce the risk of severe and extreme weather events, particularly heatwaves and heat-related mortality. It would halve the number of humans that will be exposed to water scarcity; prevent runaway sea level rise that could put many of the world’s islands under water and render uninhabitable the large delta and low-coastal regions that are home to two-thirds of the world’s population. It would prevent the almost total loss of the world’s beautiful coral reefs, protect economic growth and be far less expensive to manage. There is nothing opaque about this new data. The illustrations of mounting impacts, the fast-approaching and irreversible tipping points are visceral visions of a future that no policymaker could wish to usher in or be responsible for. Most striking to me, therefore, is the fact that the determinants of whether we head for 2C or for 1.5C are mainly political; they are not technical or economic. We are already at the beginning of a global, exponential shift in the way we produce electricity – away from fossil fuels to the abundant sources of sun and wind. Since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, the price of large-scale solar and wind energy has fallen so far it is now much cheaper in many jurisdictions than coal. Renewables are expected to outcompete fossil fuels as a new electricity source in almost every market by 2020. Electrification of transport is about to hit its exponential increase curve and cities will be transformed. Not all sectors are seeing the same transformation yet, but the additional investment required to limit warming to 1.5C is far from overwhelming – nearly $1tn annually from now to 2050. The recent New Climate Economy report shows that those investments will not only protect us from devastating impacts, they will deliver $26tn in economic benefits by 2030 – and that is a conservative estimate. It is therefore both morally inexcusable and economically irresponsible to allow investment to continue to flow towards the further exploration of fossil fuels, rather than be intentionally directed at technologies and infrastructure that are in the solutions space. Driven by the pursuit of clean air, new jobs, improved transport and competitive advantage, the recent Global Climate Action Summit evidenced the growing appetite of businesses, investors, cities and states to intensify their own climate action, as well as their support for national governments to send stronger signals. Efforts to deliver positive change are inexorably marching in the right direction, but we still have an acute need for speed, radical collaboration, and more visionary political leadership. Emissions reductions today are much more important than emissions reductions tomorrow: the sooner we bend the global curve of emissions, the more options we will have on the table for safely reaching the necessary, desirable and achievable carbon neutrality by 2050. National governments have the evidence base and the opportunity now to set their economies quickly on that curve. This year, nations will start the review of their original Paris commitments from 2015 as they prepare to come back to the table with increased ambition in 2020. The review process will include assessing the burgeoning suite of solutions now available to them. Many of these solutions, like the increasingly competitive price of renewables, the extraordinary technological gains in back-up energy storage, and the rapid emergence of electric vehicles, that are part of our reality now, were unthinkable just three years ago. It is no surprise, therefore, that China, India and the EU appear to be ahead of their Paris targets, and are well placed to be frontrunners in upping their commitments in 2020. We are also seeing the formidable leadership of climate vulnerable nations such as Fiji and the Marshall Islands, who have already committed to increasing their Paris targets by 2020. Let us not forget that it was the foresight of the most vulnerable nations which introduced the 1.5C aspirational ceiling in the Paris agreement. Now we all have the information we need – and a better understanding of the overwhelming benefits – to move forward together to stay under that ceiling. On climate change, ignorance is not bliss. Quite the contrary. I encourage all policy makers to undertake a thorough review of how much has been achieved thanks to the signal they provided in Paris, and to garner the courage to provide much bolder signals now. I encourage corporations and financial institutions to assess the risk they precipitate by not decarbonising their products, services and investment portfolios. And I encourage all of those individuals who have the privilege and democratic right to vote, to understand the evidence presented by the IPCC today, to act in their personal lives and to vote responsibly. We have a safer, more prosperous future to win. • Christiana Figueres was head of the UN’s climate body for six years, including for the 2015 Paris agreement"
"The Australian government has rejected the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report’s call to phase out coal power by 2050, claiming renewable energy cannot replace baseload coal power. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said Australia should “absolutely” continue to use and exploit its coal reserves, despite the IPCC’s dire warnings the world has just 12 years to avoid climate change catastrophe. He said the government would not change policy “just because somebody might suggest that some sort of report is the way we need to follow and everything that we should do”. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, also did not commit to the total phase-out of coal, but called for more renewable energy. Since the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull abandoned the emissions reduction component of the Coalition’s national energy guarantee, Australia has been left without a policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2020, when the renewable energy target will expire. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has claimed Australia will meet its Paris climate agreement targets of reducing emissions by 26% to 28% on 2005 levels by 2030 “in a canter”. The claim is contradicted by environment department figures showing emissions are rising and advice from the Energy Security Board that Australia will fall short under a business-as-usual scenario. The IPCC report held particularly sobering news for Australia, that holding warming to 1.5C rather than 2C would probably be the difference between the survival of some Great Barrier Reef coral and its complete decline. On Monday McCormack told Sky News coalmining was “very, very important” because it provided 60% of Australia’s electricity, 50,000 jobs and was Australia’s “largest export”. Iron ore will be Australia’s biggest exporter earner in 2018-19. McCormack said he “understands the concerns” expressed in the IPCC report, but admitted he hadn’t read it yet. “I’ll certainly consider what it has to say. But the fact is, coalmining … and coal-fired power stations do play an important part of our energy mix in Australia and will do so going forward.” The deputy prime minister said that he hadn’t “seen anything that’s going to replace coal in the near future”, predicting it would be an important part of the energy mix “for more than just 10 years”. “The Liberals and Nationals in government are supportive of small business, of industry, of farms, and of coalmining.” The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg – who as energy and environment minister championed a policy to reduce emissions by 26% in the electricity sector – warned that without coal “the lights will go out on the east coast of Australia”. The environment minister, Melissa Price, said the IPCC report was designed to inform policymakers but was not “policy ­prescriptive”. On Tuesday Price told ABC AM she had not read the whole report, and said Australia’s policies were “adequate” to meet its 2020 Kyoto target. Asked to explain how Australia will reach the 2030 target, Price cited the emissions reduction fund – which only has $250m left of $2.5bn – the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the government’s investment in Snowy 2.0 hydro-electric. Price conceded there had been “a slight increase” in Australia’s emissions but blamed an increase in liquid natural gas production. She dismissed scientists who say Australia will miss its targets as “their opinion” but said she was “very comfortable” with Australia’s trajectory. Price said it would be “irresponsible” to commit to phase out coal by 2050 because clean coal technology could be available by then. At a doorstop on the Gold Coast on Monday, Morrison said the IPCC report “does not provide recommendations to Australia or Australia’s program, this is dealing with the global program”. “Let’s not forget that Australia accounts for just over 1% of global emissions, so there are a lot bigger players than us out there impacting on these arrangements.” Morrison said Australia’s emissions per capita were “at their lowest level in decades” and the government’s focus was “to ensure that electricity prices are lower”. Earlier on Monday Morrison ruled out exiting the Paris climate agreement but vowed not to provide more money to the global climate fund. Advice from the Energy Security Board suggests the dumped national energy guarantee would have reduced household power bills by $150 a year. Labor is yet to decide whether it will persist with the Neg for the electricity sector with an emissions reduction target of 45%, or whether it will take a different policy to the next federal election. On Monday Shorten said the government’s priorities were “all wrong” because “they’re not taking action on renewables”. “What we need to do is move our energy mix to having a greater proportion of renewables. But we are not saying that there won’t be fossil fuel as part of our energy mix going forward.”"
"One great taboo in the climate change debate is how much has improved over the past three decades: in public perception; in transnational consensus and determination; in scientific understanding and discovery. To stress these things seems to ignore the urgency of the situation, minimise the scale of the potential disaster, and let the air out of tyres that really need to be at their most pneumatic.  As climate scientists “politely urge, ‘act now, idiots’”, (as the life-affirming BBC news story has it) the last thing we should do is congratulate ourselves on how far we’ve come. The fact that global warming has gone from something routinely dismissed as the dreamchild of cranks to the animating campaign issue of the age, over roughly the same period as we’ve forgotten all kinds of other basics of progressive politics – how to argue for universal human rights, for example – is at best a diversion, at worst a bromide. Nevertheless, environmentalism, while it distils everything woeful about the human condition – its short-termism, self-interest, the multiple impediments to cooperation and creativity – also contains the seed of transcendent hope. Both in what it has already achieved – the discoveries it has spurred, the alliances it has fostered – and what it can achieve in the future, including, but not limited to, saving the planet. Donald Trump inhabits the White House and Brazil is shortly likely to elect another climate change denier to its highest office. The International Panel on Climate Change on Monday had to make the same dire warnings about a 1.5C warming limit that we’ve been signed up to since the Paris agreement of 2015 – and done nothing to achieve. A decade ago it was routine to take personal responsibility for climate change, foreswearing air travel and conserving water. This seems to have dissipated, replaced by a commitment to transnational action that is often discussed but doesn’t materialise. There are sound reasons to despair, and there may even be a grim comfort in letting the waters close over our heads, at least until those waters become literal. Yet these setbacks are entirely commensurate with what we know of politics: rail against them, sure, but don’t allow them to eclipse the benefits of the radical change the climate demands. In Britain, 27% of all our emissions come from poor housing stock. Were we to undertake a mass programme of housebuilding, creating homes that were carbon-neutral, while retrofitting existing stock, the impact would be immediate and substantial, and would echo into every area of our lives. There is no longer any serious doubt that more homes are needed: you cannot lock a third of a generation out of owning property and expect that situation to sustain itself indefinitely, the young effectively working in bonded servitude to the old. Imagine if we could overhaul this market in a way that met our obligations to the future, as well as making people’s lives more liveable in the present, and energy bills a thing of the past. A programme so bold needs an unarguable political imperative – the last time we imagined such a thing, it was because of the nation’s obligation to its returning war heroes. Climate change presents an even stronger case, and it’s a challenge that history shows us we can meet. To the charge that we could never afford it, the argument that we can’t afford not to is true but insufficient. Capital needs this at least as much as people do: the drive to divest from fossil fuels is based on the real and fast-approaching danger that assets will become worthless as we commit to leaving them in the ground. Investing in social housing would be far more prudent. In the US, meanwhile, they use 18m barrels of oil a day just in their cars, which they could drastically reduce by making cars lighter, electric and, ultimately, solar-powered. There is no shortage of innovation in this field, no lack of ambition. Nobody, post-Tesla, would argue that a petrol-powered car was preferable to an electric one. The challenge now is to bring the cost down. Nowhere are the interests of the environment and the simple aim of improving lives more closely aligned. In Europe and across the world, renewable energy trounces its carbon competitors. The potential here is not just to make whole continents carbon-neutral within our lifetimes, it is also to foster a profound shared purpose across borders, as the sheer surfeit of sun in some countries, and wind in others, urges forth the infrastructure for sharing resources via, for example, a European supergrid. Not since the last century’s fight against fascism has there been a more legitimate and animating case for transnational cooperation. The battle against climate change can do more than render other political divisions trivial: its solutions have long-term ramifications for all the other crises our vexed democracies are throwing up, from the cost-of-living crisis to inequality, from insecurity to conflict. All those ramifications are good: so yes, we should hurry, before it is too late. But more importantly, we should hurry, because what comes next will be better. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"
"The authoritative new report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change sets the world a clear target: we must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to net zero by the middle of this century to have a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C. Every government should read this report and recognise the clear choice we now have. Accelerate the transition to clean and sustainable growth or suffer the mounting damage from sea level rise, floods and droughts that will severely hinder efforts to tackle poverty, raise living standards and improve prosperity. The report, prepared by leading researchers from around the world, warns that the world has already warmed by about 1C since the middle of the 19th century, and could reach 1.5C at the current rate of warming before the middle of this century. Human activities are currently emitting about 42bn tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, and at that rate the carbon budget – allowing us a 50-50 chance of keeping warming to 1.5C – would be exhausted within 20 years. Even 1.5C of warming would have brutal consequences, according to the report. Poor people, in particular, would suffer as the threat of food and water shortages increase in some parts of the world. But the report makes clear that allowing warming to reach 2C would create risks that any reasonable person would regard as deeply dangerous. One of the report’s most stark statements is that “limiting global warming to 1.5C, compared with 2C, could reduce the number of people both exposed to climate-related risks and susceptible to poverty by up to several hundred million by 2050”. However, the report also makes clear that the target of halting global warming at 1.5C could still be technically feasible, particularly if there is a strong and immediate response from governments. The report recognises that the collective pledges by governments that were submitted before the Paris agreement was reached in 2015 are consistent with warming of 3C by the end of the century. By contrast, a path that would prevent a rise of much more than 1.5C would require annual emissions to fall by about 50% between now and 2030, and reach net zero by 2050. We have to achieve these emissions reductions over a period when the world’s economy will experience a radical transformation. Global infrastructure will have more than doubled between 2015 and 2030. The global economy will have doubled within two decades or so if it continues to grow at about 3% each year on average. And the population living in cities, where most emissions occur, will likely double in the next four decades. Hence the next 10 years will be absolutely crucial in determining what kind of world will exist in the decades beyond. If we act decisively, and innovate and invest wisely, we could both avoid the worst impacts of climate change and successfully achieve the sustainable development goals, as the IPCC report emphasises. If we do not, we face a world in which it will become increasingly difficult for us and future generations to thrive. But we will also need greater international cooperation. The IPCC report is clear that we may not be able to limit warming to 1.5C without the need later in the century to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Although we can do this by expanding forests and other vegetation, we must also explore other options, including the development of carbon capture and storage. While many green campaigners are opposed to this technology because they fear it could undermine the pressure on the fossil-fuel industry, we cannot afford to close it off as an option. A collective international effort is needed to speed up research, development and deployment of this area. While it is clear that it is still technically feasible to limit warming to 1.5C, we will not succeed without strong political will and leadership. Governments should recognise both the great peril we face from poor choices or hesitation, and the enormous opportunity on offer from the rapid transition to a clean and sustainable economy. Governments, companies and communities should embrace this transition: it is the growth story of the 21st century. Cities must be planned so that we can live, breathe and move freely in them. And we must reverse the degradation of our land, soils and forests so that they are more productive and absorb more carbon dioxide. All of this is both possible and extremely attractive, as the most recent report from the New Climate Economy, published last month, spells out. We will see in the next two years whether governments have understood the message of this IPCC report as they revise their nationally determined contributions to the Paris agreement. We have in our grasp the opportunity to choose a safer and more prosperous future.

"The former Liberal party leader John Hewson has all but urged voters in Wentworth to reject the party he once led, telling them to register a protest vote over the government’s failure to tackle climate change. Hewson, who held the blue ribbon Sydney seat between 1987 and 1995, said the byelection was ripe for the taking for a “significant independent”, a likely nod to the candidate considered a chance to claim the seat from the Liberals, Kerryn Phelps.  “This byelection is a unique opportunity to register a protest vote,” he said as he campaigned with Stop Adani activists in Bondi on Saturday. Phelps is hoping to capitalise on the cause of the 20 October byelection – the deposition of Malcolm Turnbull as leader – and Hewson noted to voters on Saturday that the former prime minister had lost his position “fighting for the national electricity guarantee, which is the fourth best solution”. Hewson said the Wentworth electorate, considered progressive on environmental and social issues, wanted “a decisive emissions strategy, they want a transition from coal and fossil fuels to renewables”. Speaking to Guardian Australia on Saturday afternoon, he denied that he was specifically advocating a vote against the Liberals. But he repeatedly emphasised that the seat was “ripe for a protest vote” and also noted that Phelps had taken a “pretty strong position on the environment”. “Whoever wins this byelection is only going to hold the seat for a few months, maybe to May next year, when there would be a general election when people have a chance to vote again,” Hewson said. “So they could register a very strong protest vote in this byelection and then vote according to the responses from the major parties by the time of the next general election.” Asked if a person voting on the environment should not the support the Liberals, Hewson said “that’s probably right”. He also suggested that a Liberal loss might “create a change in [the government’s] thinking” if it was clear environment was the key issue on election day. “I’m not going to run an argument against [Dave] Sharma per se, I think his hands are tied,” Hewson said. “I think he’s a good candidate but I think his hands are tied on climate.” On Thursday, a ReachTel poll conducted for the Clover Moore-backed independent in Wentworth, Licia Heath, suggested the Liberals were at risk of losing the seat, with Sharma ahead 51% to 49% on a two-party-preferred basis. Sharma has said he believes anthropogenic climate change is real and needs addressing. He has previously told Guardian Australia: “There is only one Liberal candidate in the race and that’s me. If people want to see a Liberal government in Canberra, they should vote for me.” He said on Saturday: “If I’m elected on 20 October, I will be a strong voice in government ensuring that we met our international commitments. “Better use of technology can help us to both meet our emissions reduction targets and improve energy affordability and security.” Phelps said she was “delighted” by Hewson’s comments. “People are sick of inaction by governments and the Liberals have been paralysed on this for about a decade or more, and the Labor policy doesn’t go far enough,” she told Guardian Australia. Simon Fosterling, a Stop Adani campaigner and Bondi surf lifesaver, said on Saturday Wentworth voters wanted “an MP who will put the community and the future of our kids before coal companies like Adani”. Previous polling has indicated that climate change policy, housing affordability and education are important issues for Wentworth voters. The ReachTel poll on Thursday put Sharma’s predicted primary vote at 40.6%, a sharp decline from Turnbull’s 62.26% first-preference vote performance in 2016. Labor, which is being represented by Tim Murray, had a first-preference vote of 19.5% – up 2 percentage points on 2016, the poll said."
"The warning signals of climate change that have hit people around the world in the last few months must be heeded by national governments at key meetings later this year, political leaders and policy experts are urging, as the disruption from record-breaking weather continues in many regions. Extreme weather events have struck around the world – from the drought and record temperatures in northern Europe, to forest fires in the US, to heatwaves and drought in China, to an unusually strong monsoon that has devastated large areas of southern India.  As the northern hemisphere summer closes, polar observations have just established that the Arctic sea ice narrowly missed a record low this year. The sea ice extent was tied for the sixth lowest on record with 2008 and 2010. Sea currents and wind conditions can have large effects on sea ice extent from year to year, but the trend is starkly evident. “Put simply, in the last 10 years the Arctic is melting faster than it ever has previously since records began,” said Julienne Stroeve, professor at University College London. “We have lost over half of the summer sea ice coverage since the late 1970’s and it is realistic to expect an ice-free Arctic sea in summer in the next few decades.” Of particular concern is the decline in thick ice which forms over several years. “The older ice has been replaced by more and more first-year ice, which is easier to melt out each summer,” she explained. Not all of the effects of this year’s extraordinary weather, which has also seen the UK’s joint hottest summer on record, can be traced directly to climate change. However, scientists are clear that the background of a warming planet has made extremes of temperature, and accompanying droughts and floods, more likely. This week, scientists are gathering in South Korea to draw together the last five years of advances in climate science to answer key questions for policymakers. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) celebrates its 30th birthday this year with what is likely to be a landmark report to be released on Monday 8 October. What is expected to emerge will be the strongest warning yet that these unusual occurrences will add up to a pattern that can only be overcome with drastic action. Thousands of the world’s leading climate experts collaborate on the periodic reports, released roughly every half-decade. They have grown clearer over the years in the certainty of their evidence that climate change is occurring as a result of human actions, and firmer in their warnings of the disruptive consequences. This time, the scientists will attempt to answer whether and how the world can meet the “aspiration” set in the Paris agreement of 2015 to hold warming to no more than 1.5C, beyond which many low-lying states and islands are likely to face dangerous sea level rises. When the scientists deliver their verdict, the onus will pass to politicians to translate their advice into concrete action. Already in recent weeks, global initiatives have begun aimed at doing so: the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco last month spurred protests, and dozens of local governments and multinational companies to make pledges; the second One Planet Summit saw advances in climate finance; while at the UN General Assembly, secretary general António Guterres urged world leaders to step up, calling climate change “the defining issue of our time”. Evidence showing that tackling climate change can be an economic boost rather than a brake has been growing. The recently published New Climate Economy report says more than 65m new low-carbon jobs could be created in just over a decade, and that 700,000 premature deaths from air pollution could be avoided every year by government action on climate change. A further $2.8tn could be added to government revenues by 2030 by reforming perverse incentives to burn fossil fuels. Nicholas Stern, co-chair of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, which produced the study, said: “Current economic models fail to capture both the powerful dynamics and very attractive qualities of new technologies and structures [that reduce carbon]. Thus we know that we are grossly underestimating the benefits of this new growth story. Further, it becomes ever clearer that the risks of the damage from climate change are immense, and tipping points and irreversibilities getting ever closer.” The existence of tipping points – thresholds of temperature beyond which certain natural processes become irreversible, such as the melting of permafrost, which may release the greenhouse gas methane and create runaway warming effects – is a key concern of many climate scientists. The faster emissions rise, the sooner we may unwittingly pass some of these key points. For all these reasons, the IPCC’s special report comes at a crucial point. Scientists and economists have warned that if the world cannot shift course within the next few years, the consequences will be dire, as new infrastructure built now – in energy generation, transport and the built environment – will be made either to low-emissions standards or in the high-emissions habits of the past. As the IPCC’s next comprehensive assessment of climate science will not be available until 2021, this year’s report will be vital in shaping policy. Ted Chaiban, director of programmes at Unicef, urged governments to seize the opportunities for action offered by this year’s series of political meetings offers for action. “Over the past few months, we have seen a stark vision of the world we are creating for future generations,” he said. “As more extreme weather events increase the number of emergencies and humanitarian crises, it is children who will pay the highest price,” he said. “It is vital that governments and the international community take concrete steps. The worst impacts of climate change are not inevitable, but the time for action is now.” After the IPCC publication, the world will face a key test of faith in the 2015 Paris agreement, the only global pact stipulating action on temperature rises. This December in Poland, the UN’s climate change arm will hold a two-week meeting aimed at turning the political resolve reached in Paris three years ago into a set of rules for countries to follow on reducing emissions. The political situation is more fraught than it was in the runup to Paris. The US is pulling out of the landmark climate agreement and is likely to play little part in the talks. Australia’s government is also in turmoil over climate actions. Now the challenger for Brazil’s presidency, Jair Bolsonaro, is threatening to withdraw its participation – a potential blow to the Paris consensus, as Brazil was a linchpin among rapidly developing nations. All eyes will be on China, which has shown remarkable progress on renewable energy and emissions reduction, and India, where climate champions have found common cause with opponents of increasingly damaging air pollution. Patricia Espinsoa, the UN’s top climate official, warned that only “uneven progress” had been made so far on the 300-page rulebook for implementing the Paris targets, leaving the rest of the work for December. While the dangerous weather of the first half of 2018 has raised concerns worldwide that we are seeing climate change in action, many leading experts told the Guardian they were optimistic that political and business leaders this year would help set the world on a different course to avoid the worse predictions of untrammelled warming. Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme, said the past few years had seen “extraordinary progress” in areas such as renewable energy and the take-up of low-carbon technology: “This is real, not in the future but happening now. We are showing that we can do this, we can bring down emissions, it doesn’t need to be a disaster.” Adopting low-carbon aims now would set developing countries on a course to a brighter future, added Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former economic minister of Nigeria and a member of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. “Now is the time to do this, before we lock in high-carbon infrastructure,” she said. “Now is the opportunity for real sustainable growth.” Political leaders will find that global investors back them up in opting for low-carbon policies, predicted Frank Rijsberman of the Global Green Growth Institute. “I see this from investors, from businesses,” he said. “They are ready, and they see low-carbon as the future.” Felipe Calderón, former president of Mexico, called on political leaders to take note: “We can turn better [economic] growth and a better climate into reality. It is time we decisively legislate, innovate, govern and invest our way to a fairer, safer, more sustainable world.”"
"No more Paris agreement. No more ministry of environment. A paved highway cutting through the Amazon. Not only that. Indigenous territories opened to mining. Relaxed environmental law enforcement and licensing. International NGOs, such as Greenpeace and WWF, banned from the country. A strong alliance with the beef lobby.  In a nutshell, this is what Jair Bolsonaro, who is sailing towards Brazil’s presidency after taking a near-majority in a first round vote on Sunday, has promised for the environment. Biography Born in Glicério in São Paulo in 1955 to parents of Italian descent, he served in the army from 1971 until 1988, when he was elected as a city councillor in Rio de Janeiro for the Christian Democratic party. In 1990, he became a federal congressman for the same party. He has since been affiliated with a number of political parties. On 22 July, he was officially nominated as the presidential candidate of the Social Liberal party. Policies Bolsonaro espouses populist and nationalist views that often stray into far-right territory.  A vocal opponent of same-sex marriage, abortion, immigration and other progressive causes, he has defended the death penalty and the 1964-85 military dictatorship. On foreign policy, he has said he wants to improve relations with the US. Economically he says he is pro free market and privatisation.  Political style Deliberately provocative and polarising. He has praised Gen Pinochet, expressed support for torturers and called for political opponents to be shot, earning him the label of ""the most misogynistic, hateful elected official in the democratic world”.  In his bid to capitalise on Latin America’s lurch to the right, he paints himself as a tropical Donald Trump: a pro-gun, anti-establishment crusader set on ""draining the swamp"" and cracking down on violent crime. Controversies On top of repeated calls for a return to dictatorship, he has made equally inflammatory attacks on women, black people, gay people, foreigners and indigenous communities. Earlier this year, he was charged by the attorney general with inciting hate speech.  Support and first round victory Bolsonaro has a devout following among some conservative voters, who admire his promises to get tough on rampant violent crime, and won 46% of the vote in the election's first round.  An enthusiast for torture and the 1964-85 military dictatorship, the retired army captain is famous for racist, homophobic, authoritarian and misogynistic rhetoric. But his views on how to manage Earth’s largest tropical rainforest are just as grim and appalling. Bolsonaro has galvanised voters in urban centres who are disillusioned with the political establishment’s corruption scandals and attracted to his “tough-on-crime” positions amid rising criminality rates. He received 46% of the vote on Sunday and now faces a 28 October run off with the Workers Party’s Fernando Haddad, who polled 29%. In the Amazon, illegal loggers, miners, land-grabbers, as well as large land owners have rallied to his banner. Here, they don’t expect Bolsonaro to enforce the law. On the contrary, the hope is that he fulfils his promise to obliterate nearly all environment and pro-indigenous legislation. He won massive support in rural central western states and all but one Amazonian state. In August, Bolsonaro raised eyebrows internationally when he pledged to join Trump’s US and withdraw Brazil from the Paris agreement. That means the country would no longer be committed to curb its emissions from the deforestation of the Amazon, which is here a bigger source of greenhouse gas than the burning of fossil fuels. Bolsonaro accepts the climate is changing dangerously. CHN asked him about this during a press conference in April. He said the solution was in controlling the growth of the world’s human population. “This explosive population growth leads to deforestation,” he said. “Because you will not grow soy on the terrace of your building or raise cattle in the yard. So we have to have a family planning policy. Then you begin to reduce the pressure on those issues that lead, yes, in my opinion, to global warming, which could be the end of the human species.” Yet he praised president Trump’s policy on the Paris deal and implied that it was part of a UN plot to strip Brazil’s sovereignty over the Amazon. “Congratulations to Trump. If it were good for them, [the US] wouldn’t have denounced it,” he said, adding that a concept for a “136m-hectare ecological corridor” that would be “under world’s control, not ours” had “been discussed”. ” I don’t know how deeply,” he added. Brazil’s current environment minister Edson Duarte said: “Instead of spreading the message that he will fight deforestation and organised crime, he says he will attack the ministry of environment, Ibama and ICMBio [Brazil’s federal environment agencies]. It’s the same as saying that he will withdraw the police from the streets.” Speaking to the O Estado de S.Paulo newspaper, Duarte said: “The increase of deforestation will be immediate. I am afraid of a gold rush to see who arrives first. They will know that, if they occupy illegally, the authorities will be complacent and will grant concordance. They will be certain that nobody will bother them.” Bolsonaro’s environment policies are tied to racist attitudes toward minorities and Brazil’s indigenous peoples. In a speech last year, he said: “Minorities have to bend down to the majority … The minorities [should] either adapt or simply vanish.” Expressing a view common to military circles, he has claimed, without evidence, that indigenous land rights are part of a western plot to create separatist Amazonian states supported by the UN. “Sooner or later, we will have dozens of countries inside [Brazil]. We won’t have any interference in these countries, the first world will exploit the Indians, and nothing will be left for us,” he said last year. Bolsonaro has promised to open indigenous lands to mining and other economic activities. About 13% of Brazil’s territory is recognised indigenous lands, most of them in the Amazon. They are a major barrier to protect the forest, only 2% of rainforest deforestation has occurred inside indigenous territory. The law protects indigenous rights. Article 231 of the 1988 Constitution states that indigenous peoples have “original rights over the lands that they have traditionally occupied”, although the land belongs to the state and they have no ownership rights over minerals. But there are concerns about whether Bolsonaro will respect these laws. Several analysts have warned Brazil could slip towards authoritarian rule. These fears have increased in the past weeks. His running mate, general Antônio Mourão, has argued for a new constitution without popular participation and raised the possibility that Bolsonaro could proclaim a self-coup. Both Bolsonaro and Mourão have defended the excesses of Brazil’s military dictatorship, which displaced and killed (intentionally or through diseases) thousands of Indians in the Amazon, amid an effort to build roads and hydroelectric dams in the forest. The armed forces have never recognised any wrongdoing. “If he wins, he will institutionalise genocide,” says Dinamam Tuxá, the national coordinator of Brazil’s Association of Indigenous Peoples, in a phone interview with Climate Home News. “He has already said that the federal government will no longer champion indigenous rights, such as access to the land. We are very scared. I fear for my own life. As a national leader, I am sure I will be punished by the federal government for defending the rights of the indigenous peoples.” During the campaign, Bolsonaro promised he will abolish the ministry of environment and transfer its functions to the ministry of agriculture. The agriculture portfolio will be handed to politicians from the “beef caucus”, a conservative group of lawmakers who control about one third of Congress and have opposed indigenous land demarcations and advocated for the reduction of conservation units, among other measures, to expand the agriculture frontier. Last week, they formally endorsed Bolsonaro. In several speeches, he said he would end the “fine industry” run by Ibama and ICMBio, to control illegal mining, deforestation and logging. On Sunday he used his first post-election statement to vow to neuter Ibama. This is personal for Bolsonaro. In 2012, he was caught fishing illegally inside a federal reserve off the coast of Rio de Janeiro and was issued a $2,700 fine. Since then as a member of Brazil’s chamber of deputies, he has targeted Ibama, going as far as presenting a bill that forbids its agents to carry weapons, even though they operate in some of the most dangerous areas of the country. Ibama will be stripped of its environmental licensing powers, he said during the campaign. These will be redistributed to other official agencies. That means, for instance, that federal agency will no longer be able to contain controversial projects such as the reopening of the disused BR-319, an 890km highway that cuts from one of the most preserved areas of the Amazon, and São Luiz do Tapajós, a giant hydroelectric plant planned to be built in an area inhabited by the Munduruku indigenous group and river dwellers. BR-319, which connects Manaus to Porto Velho, is specially troublesome, as it will allow for secondary roads. According to a study by NGO Idesam, an area as big as Germany and Belgium combined is under its influence and will become more vulnerable to land-grabbers and deforestation. Recent attempts to pave it have been barred by Ibama. “He names Ibama and ICMBio as his number one public enemies and has given several messages that he will reverse environment and social laws,” said André Guimarães, director of the Amazon Environmental Research Institute. “However, one thing is what he says during the electoral campaign. Another thing is what he will be able to do if he takes office.” Guimarães said that recently the beef caucus has tried to relax environmental and slave labour legislation, but failed in most of the attempts due to strong opposition. “He will try and he is obstinate, but it’s up to the civil society to react against it. It will be a scenario with intense and almost permanent disputes,” he said. “We must be indignant.”"
"One thing I’ve learned in more than a decade of political polling is that public consensus is an incredibly rare commodity. We may not have the theatre of US supreme court confrontations to bring these differences to a head outside the election cycle but our adversarial two-party system has the same tendency to hone in on and amplify our disagreements. What seems a logical, self-evident, moral imperative to one person can seem like the embodiment of reckless turpitude to another. Our representative democracy may be the forum where these differences are supposed to be mediated but right now it is managing a divided nation. A few questions in this week’s Essential Report place this proposition in stark relief. Exhibit A: our new prime minister. For every two of us who dismisses Scott Morrison as a shrill huckster, there are three voters who see him as the straight-taking everyman. While the carefully curated images of Morrison fondling coal and fanging it at Bathurst strike may strike some as bumptious, the new leader is finding favour across the spectrum. In contrast to his more understated opponent, Morrison is drawing significant support across the partisan divide for his personal style. Go figure. There is a similar divide when it comes to where we get our news about the world. As the media fragments and people latch on to their own trusted media source, the tendency to exaggerate differences in opinion only increases. The new prime minister is still locked in the untenable position that proved his predecessor’s downfall. Indeed, for every voter who sees the Guardian as a trusted voice, there is another who sees the Australian as a paragon of truth – even a few who trust both outlets. These results are part of a series of questions we put to the public to test the attitudes to the independence of the ABC following the recent boardroom shenanigans that saw the chairman of the board and the managing director both dispatched. While the public debate was dominated by increasingly frenzied claims and counterclaims of political interference, there is no clear consensus on the national broadcaster either. For everyone who sees the ABC as independent and unbiased, there’s nearly as many who reject the proposition and see it as a plaything of some illuminati of the political correct. And so it goes, on issue after issue, Australia cleaves. From protection of religious freedoms to stemming immigration to the use of social media, we are nation of divided opinions. Even when it comes to the emotionally charged issue of detaining woman and children seeking political asylum, we are incapable of consensus. For every voter who sees the ongoing presence of children on Nauru as a national shame, there’s another voter who sits comfortably with the current policy. My point? There are few givens in Australia politics, issues where people naturally reach a consensus and the political class gets a clear read on the public will. Instead we fall into the pattern of polarising our views and dismissing those who disagree with us. But there is once issue where the consensus is stronger, the partisan divide less pronounced, though you would never guess it from the policy failures of the past decade. That issue is climate change. As the IPCC challenges the world to phase out fossil fuels by 2050, Australians have already formed a consensus that action is required. Sadly, we didn’t have a round of questions about climate change in the field this week to coincide with the report but we do know that the long-running response from voters is that (a) climate change is real and caused by human activity and (b) we don’t think the government is doing enough to address it. On nearly every question we ask around climate change and renewables, support for government action sits around two-thirds of all voters. Take this from September, 69% believe it’s important for the government to agree to a policy to reduce climate change, and 74% approve of government incentives for renewables. Despite our mixed views on the prime minister and the veracity of the News Corp empire, and even the morality of locking children indefinitely on Nauru, there is a consensus when it comes to addressing human-induced climate change. The support is deep and broad, across partisan divides, weighted to the young, who have a greater stake in the outcome, but not exclusively their province. The fact that consensus has not led to political action bears testament to the powerful interests who have the most lose from the transition to a renewable energy base. With coal zealots such as Tony Abbott and Craig Kelly blocking anything that smacks of reform, the new prime minister is still locked in the untenable position that proved his predecessor’s downfall. Even as the warnings of climate inaction intensify, the new prime minister is leading a team that cannot even agree among themselves on doing the one thing the Australian public has managed to unite on. It is now up to the opposition to tap this consensus and build a proposition that taking action on climate can unite the nation rather than divide it. • Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential and a Guardian Australia columnist"

"I was born after 9/11, so extensive airport security has always been a reality for me. So has the fact that life as we know it on this planet is coming to an end because of climate change, and that my generation will inherit a looming apocalyptic-scale disaster. My name is Jamie, I’m 16 years old, I’m going into my junior year of high school, and I, along with 12 other young people, recently sued the state of Washington. Why? Because Governor Jay Inslee and the whole state government is screwing over my generation. Washington state’s elected officials talk about solving the climate crisis, but then turn around and issue permits for fossil fuel plants that poison communities, and destroy the ecosystems, water, air and land that my generation and future generations need to survive. The even crazier part is that they are destroying our life support systems with a fossil fuel energy system that is wholly unnecessary to provide for our basic energy needs. Experts across the planet say that we don’t need to power our planet with dirty life-threatening fuels. Summers in my home city of Seattle didn’t use to be smoggy to the point that they make me and my friends sick. In fact, they didn’t use to be smoggy and smoke-filled at all. But now, when I scroll through my Instagram feed in the summer, instead of seeing pictures of my friends enjoying the sun, I see some of them wearing gas masks above captions saying things like “I can’t find breathable air anywhere.” I also see pictures of what is supposed to be the Seattle skyline, but all you can see is smoke. Smoke from the fires in Canada – worsened by unusually hot and dry summers – have made the air quality on the worst days worse than in Beijing. The winds blow the smoke down over the Pacific north-west, suffocating us. There was a week in August where I didn’t dare to step outside. It was grey 24/7 – not from clouds, but from smoke. If I went outside, it hurt to breathe, the air smelled funny, and I got a headache and sore throat. This is not the way it used to be in my home town. I’m able-bodied, so for my friends with chronic health conditions, it’s even worse. A few had to go to the ER for respiratory emergencies caused by the smoke. My city is suffocating every summer. The whole Pacific north-west can’t breathe. In the US constitution it says that everyone has the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Washington state law says that I have a “fundamental and inalienable right to a healthful environment”. But how am I supposed to live my life and pursue happiness when I can’t go outside in the summer and am living on a planet where record-breaking storms, epidemic wildfires, and heat waves are displacing, sickening, and killing thousands? That’s why, with the help of the non-profit organization Our Children’s Trust, 12 other youth and I sued the state of Washington for denying young people our constitutional rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness by actively worsening the climate crisis. Last week we got a ruling from the court that was pretty much a complete write-off to my generation and kids everywhere who apparently now have to be “optimistic” and beg our leaders for rights so basic as a livable planet. Rights that previous generations were able to enjoy. The ruling granted the state’s motion to dismiss our case. Instead of supporting young people asking for a livable future, the state fought tooth and nail to shut us down, and the court ruled in favor of silencing the young people’s pleas. What’s even more disappointing is that the judge ignored the fact that the legislature has already stated that the youth have a “fundamental and inalienable” right to a “healthful environment”. Here is what the law says: “The legislature recognizes that each person has a fundamental and inalienable right to a healthful environment and that each person has a responsibility to contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environment.” This is the only right the legislature has characterized as “fundamental and inalienable”. The judge who ruled on this case did not assume that the scientific facts we put in the complaint were true, which is what he was supposed to do. He instead relied upon his personal opinions and outside sources for the proposition that the youth should be “optimistic” about their futures and hope that the ruling generation will change course. Optimistic. How in the world am I supposed to be optimistic when I am literally being given warnings not to go outside and breathe the air because it is unhealthy? Apparently he neglected to look outside his window to see how wildfire smoke has plagued our city. When youth try to take a stand, our leaders blatantly and explicitly disregard our rights, pat us on the head, and give us the legal equivalent of “you’re cute, don’t worry about a thing little kid, we’re taking care of it.” But the Washington state government isn’t taking care of anything when it comes to climate action. My generation’s right to a healthful environment is not an “aspiration”, as the judge said. My own legislature has already recognized this as a right that must be protected: “The legislature recognizes that each person has a fundamental and inalienable right to a healthful environment and that each person has a responsibility to contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environment.” This is the only right the legislature has characterized as “fundamental and inalienable”. The constitution requires the judicial branch to serve as a check and balance of executive and legislative actions that are unconstitutional. This principle was used to challenge laws that segregated African American children in public education, laws that prevented same-sex couples from marrying and laws that prevent meaningful suffrage. Youth being harmed by climate change are entitled to the same kind of consideration. We won’t stop fighting until we get the change we need and deserve.

"A court in The Hague has upheld a historic legal order on the Dutch government to accelerate carbon emissions cuts, a day after the world’s climate scientists warned that time was running out to avoid dangerous warming. Appeal court judges ruled that the severity and scope of the climate crisis demanded greenhouse gas reductions of at least 25% by 2020 – measured against 1990 levels – higher than the 17% drop planned by Mark Rutte’s liberal administration.  The ruling – which was greeted with whoops and cheers in the courtroom – will put wind in the sails of a raft of similar cases being planned around the world, from Norway to New Zealand and from the UK to Uganda. Marjan Minnesma, the director of the Urgenda campaign which brought the case, called on political leaders to start fighting climate change rather than court actions. What is it? Climate litigation is a ​new weapon for environmentalists who are turning to the courts in an attempt to hold governments and corporations to account for the environmental damage they cause. Advocates aim to use the law to force stronger government action to cut carbon emissions, and win damages from the companies responsible to cover the costs of dealing with the impacts of warming. Who is involved? There are hundreds of cases in the pipeline around the globe from India to Uganda; Ireland to Norway, where campaigners are seeking to block oil drilling in the Arctic. The UK government is facing its first major brought by 12 citizens through a legal group called Plan B and which already has the support of the government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir David King. But it is in the US, the world’s most litigious nation, that the greatest number of cases have been brought, with Arnold Schwarzenegger the latest to confirm he was preparing a lawsuit. Could it save the planet? To date victories are rare​, but campaigners say wins are more likely in future, as public opinion – and the attitudes of judges – shift with the times. A flurry of billion-dollar cases against fossil fuel companies brought by New York city and communities in California over the rising seas has already pushed climate litigation into the limelight. But big oil is fighting back hard, with allegations of a politically motivated conspiracy against them.  She said: “The special report of the IPCC emphasises that we need to reduce emissions with much greater urgency. The Dutch government knows that as a low-lying country, we are on the frontline of climate change. Our own government agencies recently concluded that in the worst case scenario sea levels might rise by 2.5 to 3 metres by the end of the century. The court of appeal’s decision puts all governments on notice. They must act now, or they will be held to account.” Jesse Klaver, the leader of the Dutch Greens welcomed the decision as “historic news”. He told the Guardian: “Governments can no longer make promises they don’t fulfil. Countries have an obligation to protect their citizens against climate change. That makes this trial relevant for all other countries.” The Dutch government must now decide whether to appeal to the Netherlands’ supreme court, or explain how it will nearly double the entire amount of greenhouse gas emission cuts it has made since 1990 within one year. One of two newly opened coal plants would have to be shut down to comply with the original court ruling, according to a report by CE Delft in 2016. Government sources did not immediately respond to requests for comment but an appeal is thought likely. However, legal sources cautioned that its success was far from assured, given the conservative nature of two courts in The Hague which had now ruled for the Urgenda campaign, and its 886 citizen co-litigants. State lawyers had argued that the judges were “sidelining democracy” by trying to force a policy change but the court found government proposals “unacceptable” in a stinging and wide-ranging judgement that leaned heavily on the European Convention of Human Rights. “Climate change is a grave danger,” ruled Judge Tan de Sonnaville. “Any postponement of emissions reductions exacerbates the risks of climate change. The Dutch government cannot hide behind other countries’ emissions. It has an independent duty to reduce emissions from its own territory.” Rutte’s administration has pledged to reduce emissions by 49% by 2030, but in nearly three decades, the country has so far only cut its emissions by 13%. Since 2012, that figure has barely changed, despite a court ruling for the 25% cut three years ago. Paul van der Zanden, a spokesman for the Netherlands’ economic affairs and climate ministry said: “A possible appeal by the Dutch government will not interfere with the execution of the the Hague court of appeal’s verdict made today. The Dutch government is fully committed to execute this verdict.” Van der Zanden added that a 25% emissions cut by 2020 was “feasible” and said that the Dutch environmental assessment agency would deliver an update on the outlook for doing so next spring. Dennis van Berkel, the legal counsel for Urgenda, which brought the case, told the Guardian that the ruling “has consequences for all governments. They should look at this closely and realise that they are not acting in the interests of their own people. By delaying [climate] actions and not increasing them to the highest possible level – they are violating the rights of their people.”"

"Limiting global warming to 1.5C rather than 2C would likely be the difference between the survival of some Great Barrier Reef coral and its complete decline, according to the latest United Nations assessment of climate change science. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on the impact of global warming of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, released in South Korea on Monday, found coral reefs were likely to decline between 70% and 90% if the temperature increased to that level. If global warming reaches 2C, more than 99% of coral reefs were projected to decline.  Scientists said it underlined the need for urgent global action to cut greenhouse gas emissions – including a rapid withdrawal of coal-fired electricity, a shift that would have major implications not only for Australia’s power grid, but one of its largest export industries. Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a coordinating lead author on the report and a coral reefs expert with the University of Queensland, said there was a distinct difference in the amount of coral that would remain under the two warming scenarios. “Going to 2C and above gets to a point where corals can no longer grow back, or you have annual bleaching events. On the other hand, at 1.5C there’s still significant areas which are not heating up or not exposed to the same levels of stress such that they would lose coral, and so we’re fairly confident that we would have parts of those ecosystems remaining,” he said in a briefing to journalists before the report was made public. While the report does not break down the impact of warming by regions, Australian scientists highlighted several areas where there were clear differences between 1.5 and 2C. Others included the relative risk of drought in the south, river flows, the retreat of snow and ice in alpine areas and the scale of disruption in fisheries as marine species moved south to cooler waters. It found it not too late to avoid 1.5C, but time was limited. Global emissions rose 1.6% in 2017 after three years of flatlining. The world is considered on track for between 3 and 4C by 2100. Reaching the goal would likely involve the use of coal for electricity across the globe being cut by between 59% and 78% by 2030 and 73% and 97% by 2050, compared with 2010 levels. Professor Peter Newman, from the Curtin University Sustainability Policy Institute and a lead author of a chapter of the report on the global response to the climate change threat, said he expected coal would rapidly phase out of the Australian power grid but the country was yet to appreciate what was in store for exports. “The kind of exports that we’re having will be phased out. We need to get that in our perceptions of the future – that coal cannot be a major part of our export future. It’s not going to have anything like the ability to compete with solar and wind particularly, and we need to adapt out economy accordingly,” he said. “It is going to happen in India, it’s already happening in China.” The report is likely to increase pressure on the Australian government to explain how it will meet its pledge of a 26-28% cut in national emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. It has been accused of having no policies to meet the target since walking away from a pledge to introduce a policy to cut emissions from the electricity sector. National emissions have risen each year since former prime minister Tony Abbott abolished the carbon price introduced under Julia Gillard. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said he was focused on reducing power prices, and would not increase Australia’s emissions target. Labor has pledged to make a 45% cut by 2030, in part by boosting the share of renewable energy to 50%. On Sunday, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said: “If you don’t care about doing the right thing by the environment, then you actually have no right to be the government of Australia.” The IPCC spent two years on the report following a request by the world’s governments at the 2015 climate conference in Paris, where 195 countries signed up to an historic agreement to keep the global temperature rise this century well below 2C and – following urging by low-lying island nations and vulnerable developing countries - to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5C. Citing more than 6,000 scientific references, the panel found limiting warming to 1.5C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society. It says achieving it would have clear benefits for human health and nature and, compared with 2C, help ensure a more sustainable and equitable society. It is estimated there has already been 1C of warming, overwhelmingly due to human activities that produce greenhouse gases. The world is already seeing and feeling the consequences, including increased extreme weather, rising sea levels and reducing sea ice cover in the Arctic. At the current rate of warming, the world is considered likely to reach 1.5C warming between 2030 and 2052. Professor Mark Howden, a review editor for the report and the director of the Australian National University’s Climate Change Institute, said: “We need new technologies, energy efficiency, clean energy sources, less deforestation, better land management, sustainable agriculture and many other things. The good news is there’s actually movement in the right direction in many of those areas, but we need to do more and faster if we are to keep to 1.5C or even 2C.” Howden said 2C warming would mean significantly increased risk of drought, particularly in Australia’s southern half. Expected reduced rainfall would reduce soil moisture while the higher temperature would increase evaporation, depleting the soil more quickly and more rapidly triggering droughts that would tend to be more intense and last longer. He said river flows in south-east and south-west Australia tended to fall linearly as temperatures increased. Hoegh-Guldberg said corals on the reef faced not only warming waters but ocean acidification, which slowed the pace at which they could form skeletons, affecting the ability to recover from extreme events. There has been a 26% increase in acidity since the pre-industrial period. “It is a really major change in the way ocean systems are working,” he said. “The problem with ocean codification is it takes about 10,000 years to correct in terms of the ocean receiving alkaline material from the continents … so it is here to stay.” Newman gave Australia a varying scorecard in its efforts in responding to the issue compared with other countries. On energy transformation, he said Australia was showing quite rapid progress comparable with the rest of the world due to the disruptive effect of solar and wind energy. On urban systems, there were examples of how to do zero carbon development in place, such as the White Gum Valley in Perth where renewable energy was shared to make housing cheaper, though the approach was yet to be mainstreamed. On the land, there were good signs of reforesting to capture emissions. But on industry and transport, Australia’s performance on emissions was poor. To reach 1.5C, the report found global emissions would need to fall by about 45% below 2010 levels by and be “net zero” by about 2050. Any remaining emissions would need to be balanced by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Going past 1.5C warming – described as “overshooting” – would mean a greater reliance on techniques that remove carbon dioxide from the air. The effectiveness of these techniques is unproven at large scale and may carry significant risks. The IPCC found it meant the decisions made today were critical. "
"A Minnesota judge abruptly dismissed charges against three climate change activists during their trial on Tuesday, saying prosecutors had failed to prove that the protesters’ attempt to shut down two Enbridge Energy oil pipelines caused any damage. The Clearwater county district judge Robert Tiffany threw the case out after prosecutors rested their case and before the protesters could use their defense: that the threat of climate change from using crude oil drilled from Canadian tar sands was so imminent that the activists’ actions were not only morally right, but necessary.  The attorneys had long fought to use a “necessity defense” during the trial of the three Seattle-area residents, two of whom admitted turning the emergency shut-off valves on the northwest Minnesota pipelines in 2016 as part of a coordinated action in four states. Such a defense has been used by other activists protesting against pipelines. Their attorney, Lauren Regan, acknowledged outside the courthouse in Bagley that she and her clients were surprised that the judge had granted their motion to dismiss the case. The three defendants faced felony charges involving criminal damage to critical public service facilities. They could have faced up to a year in jail, according to prosecutors. “I’m very relieved the state of Minnesota acknowledged that we did no damage and intended to do no damage,” the defendant, Emily Johnston, said. “I also admit that I am disappointed that we did not get to put on the trial that we hoped for.” The Clearwater county attorney, Alan Rogalla, declined to comment afterward. Climate change activists have increasingly turned to direct actions against oil and gas pipelines, with mixed legal success . Valve-turner cases in other states resulted in convictions that are under appeal. A Massachusetts judge in March cleared 13 gas pipeline protesters who used a necessity defense. While the cases generally have not set binding legal precedents, activists are hoping they help legitimize direct action as a tactic against climate change. In the Minnesota case, Johnston and Annette Klapstein readily acknowledged turning the emergency shut-off valves on two Enbridge Energy pipelines on 11 October 2016, near Leonard, about 210 miles north-west of Minneapolis. A third defendant, Ben Joldersma, called in a warning to Enbridge. Charges were earlier dropped against a fourth defendant. They did it as part of a coordinated action by Climate Direct Action activists to shut down five Canadian tar sands crude pipelines in Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana and Washington state. A total of 11 activists were charged in the four states. The Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge temporarily shut down the two pipelines as a precaution before any damage occurred. The company issued a statement Tuesday saying the protest was “reckless and dangerous”. “The individuals involved in these activities claimed to be protecting the environment, but they did the opposite and put the environment and the safety of people at risk – including themselves, first responders and neighboring communities and landowners,” the company said. The defendants insisted there was never any danger. “We did everything in our power to make sure this was a safe action, and we did this to protect our children and all of your children from the devastating effects of climate change,” Klaptstein said at the activists’ news conference afterward. The valve turners had hoped to put climate change itself on trial by presenting expert witnesses who would have backed up their claims that climate change was making natural disasters worse, and that the threat of climate change from Canadian tar sands crude – which generates more climate-damaging carbon dioxide than other forms of oil – was so imminent that they had no legal alternatives. But they never got the chance."
"Greece and Turkey were struck by an unusual storm called Zorba last week. This was a tropical-like cyclone, or TLC, also known by the portmanteau term “Medicane”, a combination of Mediterranean and hurricane. Such storms generally occur only once or twice a year, as they require very specific conditions to form, including a mass of cold air and atmospheric instability. Medicanes are circular storms, like hurricanes or typhoons, and have a similar structure with a clear eye at their centre. However, to be classed as a hurricane, a storm must form over the Atlantic and have a sustained windspeed of more than 74mph. Medicanes are smaller and less powerful. Zorba’s wind speed of 56mph would make it more equivalent to a miniature tropical storm than a hurricane. Generally speaking, hurricanes travel from east to west whereas Medicanes go from west to east. Zorba formed over Tunisia where it caused flash floods, killing at least five people, before moving on to Greece. A 2013 study suggested that climate change will lead to fewer Medicanes in future, because the conditions for forming them will be less common. However, the same study also predicted that there would be more severe storms in the region generally, resulting in greater overall damage."
"Several years ago, I wrote about the five stages of climate denial: In 2013 @dana1981 wrote about the 5 stages of #climatechange denial.Stage 1: Deny the Problem ExistsStage 2: Deny We're the CauseStage 3: Deny It's a ProblemStage 4: Deny We can Solve ItStage 5: It's too LateLook where the Trump Administration is.https://t.co/FRQGZ8gQ4r To date, the Trump administration has pinballed between Stages 1, 2, and 3, calling climate change a Chinese hoax, disputing the degree of human causation (100% since 1950), and claiming it’s not a threat.  But the purpose of climate science denial is to obstruct climate policies, and science denial doesn’t hold up in court.  Unlike in the political realm, judicial decisions are generally based on evidence.   The Trump administration wants to roll back the Obama administration’s increased vehicle fuel efficiency standards.  But under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), “if a proposed major federal action is determined to significantly affect the quality of the human environment,” the agency has to publish an environmental impact statement (EIS). And so, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was required to publish an EIS detailing how the proposed fuel efficiency rollbacks would impact the environment, including via climate change.  Here, the Trump administration shifted to Stage 4 and 5 climate denial. In modeling the proposal’s climate impact, the NHTSA assumed we will follow a scenario in which Earth’s average surface temperatures will warm 3.5°C (6.3°F) by 2100.  That’s surprisingly realistic – it’s a scenario in which countries follow through with their current climate policies but don’t enact any more stringent ones in the future.  The problem is that the NHTSA assessment then concluded the fuel efficiency rollbacks aren’t important because they won’t have a significant impact on those hotter global temperatures: The impacts of the Proposed Action [freezing fuel efficiency standards] and alternatives on global mean surface temperature, precipitation, sea level, and ocean pH would be extremely small in relation to global emissions trajectories. This is because of the global and multi-sectoral nature of climate change. These effects would be small, would occur on a global scale, and would not disproportionately affect the United States. This is true.  The Trump administration proposal decreases vehicle fuel efficiency requirements in the United States for the years 2020–2025.  Of course it won’t have a big global impact relative to all greenhouse gas emissions from two centuries of burning fossil fuels.  The report continues: The emissions reductions necessary to keep global emissions within this carbon budget could not be achieved solely with drastic reductions in emissions from the U.S. passenger car and light truck vehicle fleet but would also require drastic reductions in all U.S. sectors and from the rest of the developed and developing world.  We could make this argument about literally any and every individual climate policy.  Just like a single step won’t move a person safely out of the path of an oncoming truck, no single climate policy will significantly change global temperatures eight decades from now.  It will take a myriad of climate policies passed by countries all around the world.  That’s precisely why virtually every country signed the Paris climate agreement.  The report’s maddening illogic doesn’t stop there: In addition, achieving GHG reductions from the passenger car and light truck vehicle fleet to the same degree that emissions reductions will be needed globally to avoid using all of the carbon budget would require substantial increases in technology innovation and adoption compared to today’s levels and would require the economy and the vehicle fleet to substantially move away from the use of fossil fuels, which is not currently technologically feasible or economically practicable. This isn’t entirely true – electric vehicles are becoming increasingly affordable and economically competitive with gasoline-powered cars.  But more importantly, rolling back fuel efficiency standards will only slow the transition away from fossil fuels.  Requiring higher fuel efficiency in fleets forces automakers to accelerate the research, development, and deployment of zero carbon vehicles.  It’s ludicrous to argue that because the transition isn’t yet feasible we should roll back a policy meant to make it more feasible. The tragedy of the commons is a situation in which individual actors using a shared-resource system act in their own seeming self-interest and deplete the resource as a result.  For example, consider a small fishery with a dozen fisherman each catching as many fish as he can.  Soon the resource becomes overfished and every fisherman suffers the consequences.  Only if they all agree to limit their catches to sustainable levels can the fishery remain a long-term stable resource for all of the fishermen. We’re in the same situation with climate change.  Every country can act in its own short-term self-interest and continue burning lots of seemingly cheap fossil fuels; the long-term result in that scenario would be a catastrophic destabilization of the global climate on which we all rely.  Or every country can agree to take steps like increasing vehicle fuel efficiency standards that cumulatively will slow global warming and avoid the worst climate change impacts. Of course, being a short-sighted nationalist, Donald Trump is the only world leader to reject the Paris climate agreement.  His administration is similarly making short-sighted arguments that coincidentally serve the best interests of the fossil fuel industry, while in this case producing the equivalent carbon emissions of adding 9 million more cars on the road. At least the Trump administration doesn’t deny basic climate science in this report, but worse yet, they’ve taken the nihilistic viewpoint that we’re screwed and nothing we do matters. Like the other stages, this is simply another form of climate denial meant to protect fossil fuel industry profits at everyone else’s peril."
"When Justin Trudeau swept into power in 2015, he pledged to make fighting climate change a top priority for his government. Three years later, Canada’s prime minister is on the defensive, scrambling to both revive his party’s unravelling climate strategy as a growing number of provinces refuse to participate in national carbon tax – and to temper frustrations over his government’s continued investment in the fossil fuel industry.  “From the beginning, [the government] decided they were going to try to thread the needle on the need for climate policy and fossil fuel resource development. They even made the two interdependent,” said Matthew Hoffman, a political science professor at Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs. But on the surface, the strategy appears to be quickly falling apart. Trudeau’s political foes have already seized on the carbon tax in anticipation of the upcoming federal election – still a full year away – but the prime minister has shown no signs of backing down. “Pollution should not be free anywhere across this country,” he said last week.  The political infighting comes as the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that drastic changes are needed to offset the impacts of global climate change. As part of a strategy to reduce Canada’s emissions, provinces are required to introduce a tax of at least $20 per tonne on emissions from January 2019, with increments of $10 each year until 2022. In provinces which fail to produce an adequate carbon pricing plan, the federal government would implement its own tax, or “backstop”. Last week, Manitoba became the fifth province to publicly opt out of carbon pricing, arguing that its own plans to combat climate change were sufficient. Saskatchewan, which still relies heavily on coal for its power, has called the carbon tax a “ransom note”. In Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, the rightwing premier, Doug Ford, has vowed to rally opposition to the measure, which he described as “the worst tax ever”. Alberta, home to the country’s oil sands, announced it would leave the plan after the federal government failed to push through construction of the Trans Mountain expansion pipeline – a project Alberta argued was critical to its economy. “Until the federal government gets its act together, Alberta is pulling out of the federal climate plan,” said Premier Rachel Notley in August. “And let’s be clear, without Alberta, that plan isn’t worth the paper it’s written on.” Only two provinces, British Columbia and Quebec, have signalled a willingness to remain in some form of carbon pricing agreement. When the original agreement was laid out, many of the provinces had Liberal politicians in power. Now, a conservative wave across the country has changed the party in power – and the political calculus. “This is a political move by the provinces. It’s conservatives wanting to give the Liberals a black eye,” said Nelson Wiseman, a professor of Canadian studies at the University of Toronto. “If you ask people, ‘Should the government do something about climate change?’ they’ll say yes. If you ask them, ‘Are you prepared to pay higher taxes?’ they’ll say no.” The recent stumbles, however, could end up being a benefit for Trudeau, argued Mark Cameron, director Clean Prosperity, an environmental thinktank. “If anything, this may end up making the carbon price backstop more effective,” he said. “Instead of one or two provinces that are going to be falling under it, there will be four or five. You’ll be getting a more coherent national carbon pricing system.” Carbon taxes are supposed to be revenue neutral, meaning any increase a person pays are offset elsewhere. With its own carbon tax, the federal government could circumvent antagonistic provincial governments and deliver cheques – as high as $600 per year– to individual households. “The [upcoming federal] election is going to be in October,” said Wiseman. “Imagine, in July, people start getting cheques in the mail!” Experts agree that any plan to fight the tax is probably a losing battle: courts have repeatedly affirmed the right of the government to impose a tax on provinces. “Whether that court victory leads to political victory is another question altogether, said Hoffman. “[Trudeau’s] got to build popular support for this.” As he grapples with carbon pricing, Trudeau is also engaged in a delicate task of placating his environmental supporters over frustrations that oil development is detrimental to emissions reductions. Construction on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which the government purchased from Texas-based Kinder Morgan, was halted over the summer by a federal court order, largely the result of inadequate consultations with indigenous communities. The government remains committed to pushing the pipeline through – and recently hired a retired supreme court justice to buttress its consultations with First Nations. “The idea that the environment and the economy are not opposing goals, is a great framing,” said Hoffman. “But it’s tough to do when you’re framing the economy not as a transformed economy in a low-carbon world, but as further exploitation of fossil fuel resources.”"
"Scott Morrison has resisted conservatives’ calls to withdraw Australia from the Paris climate agreement but ruled out providing more money to the global climate fund. The prime minister made the comments on 2GB Radio on Monday, before the release of a Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which is expected to call for a phaseout of coal power generation to help limit temperature rises to 1.5C.  Morrison repeated his claim that Australia would meet its Paris emissions reduction target “in a canter”, despite environment department figures showing emissions increased 1.3% in the year to March 2018, suggesting Australia is likely to miss the target. Advice from the Energy Security Board has said that a business as usual scenario will mean the electricity sector will “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels” by 2030. Asked if Australia would be held to the target to reduce emissions by 26% to 28% from 2005 levels, Morrison said: “No, we won’t … we’re not held to any of them at all. Nor are we bound to go and tip money into that big climate fund. We’re not going to do that either. I’m not going to spend money on global climate conferences and all that nonsense.” Australia has contributed $200m to the Green Climate Fund from 2015 to 2018, but the Coalition has come under pressure from One Nation to rule out making further contributions. The fund’s purpose is to help developing countries respond to climate change. Last week the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, wrote to Morrison complaining that Australians were not aware when the government signed up to the Paris agreement that it would “lead to organisations like the global climate fund acting like standover men, knocking at our door, telling us to pay up, or else”. Morrison said when Australia signed an agreement “it means something”, and noted it was not the previous Labor government but rather “our government” that had signed the Paris agreement, a reference to the Coalition government of Tony Abbott. “This is an enormously important issue to partners in the Pacific who are strategic partners. So my question is: what is to be gained by ripping it up? “I don’t think there’s much to be gained from ripping it up – it’s not going to affect electricity prices, [the energy minister] Angus Taylor already told you that.” Morrison noted the IPCC report “said a year ago the policies were fine”. In August Malcolm Turnbull dumped the emissions reduction component of the Coalition government’s national energy guarantee, but was removed as Liberal leader regardless. On taking office as prime minister, Morrison declared the national energy guarantee “dead”, leaving Australia without a mechanism to reach its Paris target. On Monday Taylor told Sky News that Australia will meet its Paris commitments, claiming it is “well on target” to achieve a 26% reduction in the electricity sector. Asked how Australia would achieve a 26% reduction overall – including other sectors like transport and agriculture – Taylor did not cite a single policy, instead pointing five times to Australia’s “track record” in meeting Kyoto phase one and two targets. Australia’s emissions have been rising since the repeal of the carbon tax in 2014 and the Coalition will not renew the renewable energy target in 2020. Asked if Australia could phase out coal power by 2050, Taylor said the key “is not to focus on an industry it’s to focus on the outcome”. He said Australia produces only 1% of global emissions so “the critical thing” is for developing countries such as China and India to reduce emissions over time. Earlier, Morrison told 2GB the Paris target of 26% emissions reduction was “not going to touch electricity prices” and “not going to touch one job”. Asked about the prospect of overturning Australia’s ban on nuclear energy, Morrison replied: “If I thought that this was going to have a big impact on Australia’s electricity prices I will do what is necessary to bring electricity prices down. “I don’t have any issues about any of these [sort of things] … The issues there are the same issues everywhere – that the investment doesn’t stack up.” Morrison praised the Hodgman government in Tasmania for the “battery of Australia” project to double pumped hydro capacity."

"On 10 April 2018, the United Nations general assembly adopted a resolution that paved the way for negotiations on a global pact for the environment. This international treaty would combine the guiding legal principles for environmental action into one single and far-reaching text. In 2015, the adoption of the sustainable development goals and the Paris climate agreement represented major progress. However, environmental damage persists and is more serious than ever before. The years 2017 and 2018 have seen record-breaking temperatures. Biodiversity continues to decline at a rapid pace. With the global pact for the environment, the international community would be equipped for the first time with a treaty of a general nature that covers all environmental areas. It would be the cornerstone of international environmental law, therefore overseeing the different existing sectoral agreements (climate, biodiversity, waste, pollution, etc), filling the gaps and facilitating their implementation. The treaty would gather principles found in key national and international texts, giving them legal value. Each state legislator would find references to the adoption of more robust environmental laws. The supreme courts would draw from it as a common source of inspiration to build the foundations for global environmental law. Citizens and NGOs would see their environmental rights strengthened while businesses would benefit from the harmonisation of the rules of the game. While we celebrate the 70-year anniversary of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the moment has come for a new chapter in the history of international law. We are calling for the adoption of a third pact, enshrining a new generation of fundamental commitments: the rights and duties of states, public and private entities, and individuals relating to environmental protection.

"Political leaders have been urged to act on the landmark special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has warned that strong efforts would be required to prevent disastrous consequences from dangerous levels of climate change. Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who led the historic Paris agreement of 2015, said: “There is nothing opaque about this new data. The illustrations of mounting impacts, the fast-approaching and irreversible tipping points are visceral versions of a future that no policy-maker could wish to usher in or be responsible for.” A key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment. The scientists found: • By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C. • Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C • Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds. • If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost Figueres said the need for urgent action was clear: “Emissions reductions today are much more important than emissions reductions tomorrow. The sooner we bend the curve of global emissions, the more options we will have on the table for safely reaching the necessary, desirable and achievable carbon neutrality by 2050.” The decisions taken in the next few years will be crucial because the investment cycle for power plants and transport systems is at least 10 years. Infastructure built now will continue to burn up carbon for decades to come if it is not re-engineered. “This is the decisive decade,” said Johan Rockström, chief scientist at Conservation International and co-author of the recent Hothouse Earth report, which warned of a domino-like cascade of melting ice, warming seas, shifting currents and dying forests beyond which human efforts to reduce emissions will be increasingly futile. “Any investment in energy has a 10-year lifecycle. Even a family car: 1.5C has become real.” “Climate change is occurring earlier and more rapidly than expected. Even at the current level of 1C warming, it is painful,” he told the Guardian. “This report is really important. It has a scientific robustness that shows 1.5C is not just a political concession. There is a growing recognition that 2C is dangerous.” Business leaders and investors pledged their support. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, representing financial investors with $21tn in assets, called on governments to provide the framework necessary to spur greater finance. “The IPCC has delivered a stark message. To limit global warming to 1.5C requires an urgent acceleration in the pace at which we are moving to a low-carbon economy,” said Stephanie Pfeifer, the group’s chief executive. “Governments now have to raise their ambition levels to implement the Paris agreement and provide the signals required for the clean energy transition.” Peter Bakker, the president of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, added that the effort would require “unprecedented funding and coordination”, with the private sector playing a key role. “It’s time to put real money next to real solutions, [with] different players from different sectors together driving forward.” Politicians are expected to respond later this year, when governments meet in Poland in December to flesh out the ways of meeting the goals set out in the Paris agreement. Progress on this step of implementing the agreement has been slow so far, the UN has warned. Although all of the world’s functioning governments are signed up to the Paris goals, the US under President Trump has begun its withdrawal, making it harder for supporters of the agreement to move forward in the talks. Jim Hansen, the former Nasa scientist who testified on climate change to the US Congress in 1988, the year the IPCC was formed, told the Guardian: “I have faith that they will act, eventually. The US, which has done twice as much as any other nation to create the excess CO2 in the air today, is the key. The executive and congressional branches will not, on their own, solve the problem. The courts will have to force the other branches of government to be responsible.” Rockström said the political shifts in some countries should be met with a counterbalancing move in others. “Every time we get leaders in the US or Brazil taking a step back then others, particularly in Europe, should take a step forward.” The UK is set to continue to pursue the Paris targets after Brexit, when the country’s emissions cuts will no longer count towards the EU goals. “There is now no excuse and real action is needed,” said Claire Perry, the minister for energy and clean growth. “This [IPCC] report should act as a rallying cry for governments around the world to innovate, invest and raise ambition to avert catastrophic climate change.” The government is set to ask the Committee on Climate Change to advise on how the UK can meet its share of the emissions cuts needed to avoid 1.5C of global warming. The committee’s targets are binding on ministers. Civil society groups are also piling pressure on policymakers to turn warm words into action. “The difference between impossible and possible is political leadership,” said Stephen Cornelius, chief adviser on climate change at WWF. “We are already seeing loss of natural habitats and species, dwindling ice caps, rising sea levels, impacting on our health, livelihoods and economic growth. We know what is needed and we can do it relying mostly on proved technologies, such as decisively scaling up renewable energy and halting deforestation.” Rachel Kennerley, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, added: “Just like ignoring credit card statements, so that repayments only become sharper and steeper, this report shows that weak responses will make it harder in the long run.”"
"One of the biggest hubs of real-time climate research is a lab hundreds of miles from the rising seas and melting ice caps. There are no test tubes or beakers. Instead young scientists and economists hunch over computers analyzing the newest data. A group of them are currently reviewing a study that considers whether crime levels are connected to monsoon seasons. The findings are a tiny part of a big question: how much is climate change costing society, and who’s paying?  “Each time we use energy from fossil fuels, we are causing some kind of cost on someone who’s not involved,” said Amir Jina, a professor at the University of Chicago and member of the Climate Impact Lab. “By causing that damage we’re essentially taking money away from them because of some interaction, whether it’s driving our cars or turning on our light switches.” The world is far off track to limit catastrophic climate change and needs to undertake unprecedented changes within the next 12 years to avoid the worst of warming, according to international scientists. Barring a radical transformation in how people live, temperatures will continue to rise and climate costs will grow. The Climate Impact Lab wants to know how much they will increase and how dangerous the planet will become. “There’s been a change in urgency in how we discuss things,” said Jina, who was an early student of this project to meld climate science and economics. “People are starting to shift to think of it as not just what happens to the natural world and here’s what happens with this problem, but what the implications are for people.” From the effects of heat on worker productivity to suicide surges following crop losses, the lab is tallying the damages that don’t make the evening news. In addition to the University of Chicago, it also operates out of the University of California at Berkeley, the economic research firm Rhodium Group and Rutgers University. “A lot of academia is writing a paper and hoping someone notices and putting it on a shelf next to another paper, and those papers can be really valuable but we’re trying to step back and say, ‘together, what do all of these things mean for policy?’” said Tamma Carleton, a postdoctoral scholar working with the lab. Carleton studies deaths and crime related to climate change, as well as internal and international migration. In one study from India, she found that when heat damages crops during the growing season, there are more suicides. When it’s hotter than 20C, each degree increase in a single day means about 70 people kill themselves. Carleton estimated warming has been responsible for 59,300 suicides in India over 30 years. Another study co-authored by a Climate Impact Lab member found that higher temperatures increase suicide rates in the US and Mexico too. “Any death is important, but when it’s suicide I think it’s a really important indicator of human hardship,” Carleton said. Anant Sudarshan, the South Asia director of the University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute, has other startling findings about what extreme heat means for India. His research found that on hot days, productivity at manufacturing plants declines 4% to 9% for every degree increase in temperature. When it is very hot for several days, people stop going to work. Warming between 1971 and 2009 may have decreased output in India by 3%. Companies in India are using the data to determine whether to buy expensive air conditioners, hire more people, shift to automation or just take the hit, Sudarshan said. Sudarshan said the observations aren’t just relevant to India. “We’re trying to say you should be concerned even if you’re not in a developing country,” Sudarshan said. “It’s not so clear we won’t see that in many places.” In the US, officials rolling back climate rules have stopped counting the global benefits of efforts to curb climate change. In one case, they argued that each ton of carbon pollution costs society as little as $1, far less than what most experts think is accurate. The Climate Impact Lab will use a supercomputer to look at daily climate data for 25,000 regions, to come up with an updated number and to tell people what climate change will mean on the local level. Michael Greenstone, the codirector of the lab, who helped calculate the social cost of carbon pollution under the Obama administration, said he was frustrated that science could only tell people how much temperatures would rise on average or what that would mean for the global economy. “That doesn’t tell anybody in Louisiana what’s going to happen to their life. They’re not the global average. It’s not interesting to them,” Greenstone said. The University of Chicago covered this reporter’s travel expenses to moderate an event on campus but had no input on this reporting."

"The Liberal candidate for Wentworth, Dave Sharma, said his party is “doing enough” and has “a good record” on climate change, after a blistering attack from former leader John Hewson, who said the party deserved a “drubbing” over its inaction on the issue. Hewson told Guardian Australia that Liberal voters have a unique opportunity: register a protest now and return to the party at the general election in six months’ time.  “I obviously disagree with John Hewson on this,” the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said as he campaigned with Sharma at an optometrist’s shop in Rose Bay on Wednesday. Frydenberg said a vote for an independent in Wentworth was as good as a vote for the Labor party. “It will bring uncertainty to the parliament and it will bring Bill Shorten one step closer to The Lodge,” Frydenberg said. Sharma also rejected Hewson’s assessment that the Liberal policy on climate change was inadequate. “I do think we are doing enough and I do think we have had a good record on climate change. Emissions are at their lowest levels in 28 years,” he said. Sharma was referring to emissions as a proportion of GDP not absolute emissions. “We are on track to meet the Paris commitments and I believe we will address the Paris commitments and we will be addressing affordability and sustainable and coherent energy policy,” he said. Hewson has accused the Liberals of putting their heads in the sand on the issue and kicking the issue down the road for future generations. The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull dropped plans for a national energy guarantee that would have imposed emissions reduction targets and then was dumped by his own party, which was deeply divided over his plan. Frydenberg defended the government’s record. He said emissions on a per capita GDP basis have come down to their lowest level in 28 years. But the economy has been growing and so too have overall emissions. Australia is on a trajectory that will see it miss its Paris climate targets – a reduction of 26% to 28% based on 2005 levels – according to figures from the consultants, NDEVR Environmental, for the year up to the end of June 2018. The NDVER figures showed Australia’s emissions were again the highest on record when unreliable data from the land use and forestry sectors was excluded. This was the third consecutive year for record-breaking emissions. Despite this, Frydenberg claimed that the nation is on track to meet its Paris commitments – even without the Neg, which he had supported. He also lauded the Coalition’s record on investment in renewables. “Renewable energy investment has never been higher in Australia. Never been higher. Twenty per cent of Australian homes have solar panels on their roofs. We’ve seen large-scale renewable projects. We’ve got Snowy Hydro, the largest pumped hydro facility in the southern hemisphere,” he said. “These are Coalition achievements. These are Coalition initiatives. These are things that we should be proud of, rather than the rhetoric and the reckless targets and policies of Labor and the Greens,” he said. Asked about the IPCC report this week, which called for coal generation to be phased out by 2050 or the world would be facing a catastrophe, Frydenberg said it was their word, not ours. “Our policy is you need to do it in a way to reduce your carbon footprint in a way that is cost effective and that pays paramount importance to what the impact on the businesses and the households that rely on their energy for their sustainability, for their viability,” he said. He said coal and gas would need to remain part of the energy mix. Sharma did not offer an opinion."
"Following the UN’s report concluding carbon emissions need to be reduced massively and rapidly to prevent an average increase in global temperatures of more than 1.5C (Global warming must not exceed 1.5C, landmark UN report warns, 8 October), one quick and simple way in which the UK could make a start is by cutting the top speed vehicles can travel on motorways from 70 to 60mph. All cars operate most efficiently at a speed between 50 and 60mph. At the stroke of a pen we could ensure all vehicles on motorways are running far closer to their most efficient levels. It won’t save the world on its own, but it’s a cost-free and easy step to take that gets us moving in the right direction.Matt WheelerBushey, Hertforshire • It is increasingly evident how difficult it will be to stop global warming; the need is pressing, obvious and requires strong leadership from governments. But, incredibly, our government is planning to build a major road (the so-called expressway) between Oxford and Cambridge. Painful as it might appear, the time has come when we have to stop building new major roads altogether, anywhere. We have to slash use of roads and fossil fuels, not encourage them.  The proposed new road would exacerbate man-made climate change, leading to increased pollution with attendant health impacts. The impacts on the environment, climate, landscape and people living in the path of the road should rule it out. Any upgraded transport links between Oxford and Cambridge must instead be via a fast, efficient, high-capacity electrified rail line.Chris OsmanOxford • Your article (Air pollution and how to avoid it, G2, 8 October) omitted to mention the fact that reducing the number of journeys taken by car is an effective way of reducing exposure to toxic air.

"The challenge of avoiding catastrophic climate breakdown requires “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”, according to a new IPCC report. Experts say that although the challenges are huge there is still time to create a thriving, sustainable future. The main focus is on the decisions facing governments around the world but the IPCC acknowledges the role individuals can play.  Here are some of the things people can do. Although individual choices and actions are important, experts say people need to unite if the scale of this challenge is to be met, making the political space for politicians and big businesses to make the necessary changes. Bill McKibben, a leading climate campaigner and founder of 350.org, argues that the most important thing people can do is come together to form movements – or join existing groups – that can “push for changes big enough to matter”, from city-wide renewable energy programmes to large-scale divestment from fossil fuels. According to a report earlier this year, avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet. Relatively simple measures such as insulating lofts and draft-proofing doors and windows on a large scale would see a big drop in energy consumption. However, the UK government substantially cut the amount that energy companies are forced to spend on helping households with energy efficiency measures. All that money is now focused on helping fuel-poor households, with no incentive for better-off households to improve their energy efficiency. Switch to renewable energy wherever possible. In the UK, consider installing solar panels before April, when government incentives will end and the costs will increase for most people. Walk or cycle where possible and if not – and it is available and affordable – use public transport. If you need to go by car, consider an electric one. Buy fewer things and consume less. Recycle wherever possible and – even better – reuse things. Demand a low carbon option in everything you consume, from clothes to food to energy.  Many experts – including the IPCC – say there is still a chance to create a sustainable, cleaner and more equal global system. Individuals can hold politicians to account by supporting political parties that put the environment at the heart of their economic and industrial policies. However the IPCC is clear that the real challenge from its report is to politicians, political systems and corporations rather than individuals. Jim Skea, a co-chair of the IPCC working group on mitigation said the report had presented governments “with pretty hard choices”. “We have pointed out the enormous benefits of keeping to 1.5C, and also the unprecedented shift in energy systems and transport that would be needed to achieve that,” Skea said. “We show it can be done within laws of physics and chemistry. Then the final tickbox is political will. We cannot answer that. Only our audience can – and that is the governments that receive it.”"

"Carbon emissions from the energy sector are on track to grow for the second year running, in a major blow to hopes the world might have turned the corner on tackling climate change. Preliminary analysis by the world’s energy watchdog shows the industry’s emissions have continued to rise in 2018, suggesting that an increase last year was not a one-off. The finding comes as the world’s leading climate scientists issue a landmark report on whether the world can meet a tougher global warming target, of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C. Dr Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), told the Guardian: “When I look at the first nine months of data, I expect in 2018 carbon emissions will increase once again. This is definitely worrying news for our climate goals. We need to see a steep decline in emissions. We are not seeing even flat emissions.” Emissions largely flatlined in 2014–16 after climbing for decades, raising hopes that global action on climate change was beginning to turn the tide – but in 2017 they grew by 1.4%. The IEA would not say exactly how much emissions were up this year, as it will not publish official figures until March 2019, but confirmed they had definitely risen to a historic high so far. Indications that the trend has continued and was not a blip means the Paris climate deal’s target of keeping temperatures well below 2C – let alone the 1.5C being discussed this week – looks increasingly out of reach. Birol said the growing carbon pollution was a result of the global economy driving coal, oil and gas use. “Energy efficiency improvements and renewables are not good enough to reverse that,” he added. A new report by the IEA, published on Monday, predicted that renewables will grow rapidly in the next five years. Wind, solar and other renewable sources are expected to grow their share of global electricity generation from 25% in 2017 to 30% by 2023. Solar in particular is projected to make huge strides over the five years, accounting for as much new capacity as all other renewable power technologies combined. In 2023, China is expected to have 40% of the world’s solar power capacity. But Birol made clear that the growth in renewables had to be accompanied by coal plant closures in Asia if dangerous climate change is to be avoided. “If there are no early [coal power station] retirements, more than two-thirds of the emissions [in 2040] are already determined today. Unfortunately a big chunk of the problem in my view is the coal in Asia.” The IEA’s annual renewables report shows China and the EU will be the two biggest leaders on renewables in coming years. While the watchdog does not name Donald Trump and his rolling back of Barack Obama’s green energy blueprint, it cites US tax, trade and energy plan changes as causing “downside forecast uncertainties”. We expect energy-related CO2 emissions will increase once again in 2018 after growing in 2017 pic.twitter.com/rb0Em2folC Asked if the US was slipping behind because of Trump, Birol said: “Instead of blaming somebody I will say it is the result of a good policy in the EU. The US is still growing, especially on wind and solar, but the growth in other countries seem to be accelerating.” Overall, the IEA’s forecast is more optimistic than last year for renewables in the next five years, owing to policy changes and market developments in key countries. But prospects for the UK were revised downwards. The country is expected to increase its renewable electricity capacity more than a quarter by 2023, driven largely by new offshore windfarms. Solar has an incredibly cloudy outlook, with total new additions by 2023 expected to be around half what the UK installed in a single year in 2017."
"An official United Nations grouping of 47 of the world’s poorest countries has urged Australia to “honour its international commitments” after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the country would not be “throwing money” into a key international climate change fund. Australia has previously pledged $200m to the Green Climate Fund (GCF), set up through the UN’s climate convention to help developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change and cut their own greenhouse gas emissions.  But on Monday, in the hours before a major climate report was released, Morrison told radio presenter Alan Jones that Australia would not be “throwing money into some global climate fund”. One international climate expert said that geopolitically it was “mildly insane” that Australia was backing out of the GCF. In a statement to Guardian Australia, Ethiopian Gebru Jember Endalew, the chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group, said: “Funding from wealthy nations such as Australia is key to enabling an effective global response. “LDCs and other developing countries have made ambitious plans, but these plans cannot be implemented without sufficient tools and resources being mobilised. The Green Climate Fund plays an integral role in delivering these funds and continues to be underresourced.” The LDC Group represents 47 countries at UN climate negotiations and says its members are “specially vulnerable to climate change but have done the least to cause the problem”. African nations dominate the LDC group, alongside Pacific and East Asian countries Timor-Leste, Kiribati, Vanuatu and Tuvalu. Endalew said this week’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report showed “the science is crystal clear that limiting global warming to 1.5C is absolutely vital and that urgent, collective and unprecedented action is required by the international community”. He added: “Australia and other developed countries are yet to deliver on their collective commitment to mobilise a minimum of US$100bn annually by 2020 to support developing countries. The LDCs will continue to urge Australia to honour its international commitments for the safety and prosperity of present and future generations in Australia, in LDCs, and around the world.” Australian government ministers have been roundly dismissive of the findings of the IPCC report. Morrison dismissed the report’s relevance for Australia, saying it “deals with the global situation” and claimed, incorrectly, that the “same report” had backed Australia’s policies “only a year ago”. The latest IPCC report was one off and did not assess individual country policies. Morrison’s dismissive remarks about the GCF contrast with Australia’s previous enthusiastic support for the fund. In 2016, the then foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said Australia’s involvement with the GCF as a co-chair was “instrumental in gaining approval for major climate resilience investments” of US$1.3bn at that time. Chris Tinning, chief economist for development at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is currently a GCF board member. A board meeting scheduled for 17 October in Bahrain with board documents showing it will consider $1.16bn in funding proposals. A GCF spokesman said: “We don’t comment on contribution policies of individual countries.” Dr Bill Hare, the Australian chief executive of respected international climate advisory group Climate Analytics, said the GCF was a “major instrument” that would help lever investments away from fossil fuels. He said: “In the Pacific, our neighbours are suffering from climate change and the damages they are experiencing are already quite confronting for anyone who cares to notice, and for them the GCF is a major source of resources to help them adapt and to reduce emissions themselves. “Geopolitically it is, to say the least, mildly insane for Australia at this moment in history in such a sensitive region so crucial to the country’s security, to back out of support for these island countries.” The former executive director of the UN’s climate convention, Christian Figueres, who led world to the Paris climate agreement, told the ABC on Tuesday that Australians faced a critical moment in history. “What do you stand for and what do you want history to remember you by,” she said, saying there were clear choices for Australia. “Do you want bushfires raging across the east coast for six months at a time, or do you want a thriving agricultural sector? Do you want the Great Barrier Reef, or the largest aquatic cemetery in the world?” She said Australia and coal was facing an important moment and that continuing a dependence on coal would deliver “dramatic loss of assets”. In comments reported in late September, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg indicated Australia had no plans to increase GCF funding, but a Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said at the time the government was considering “further contributions”.  On Thursday, a Dfat spokesperson said: “Australia is not planning to provide further funding to the Green Climate Fund (GCF).  We will continue to invest in climate change and disaster resilience through our existing development assistance budget, with a focus on the needs of our Pacific partners.” • This article was amended on 11 October 2018 to include the department’s response."
"Heatwaves and bushfires are predicted in southern Australia thanks to a 70% chance of El Niño weather conditions, the Bureau of Meteorology has warned. Although cyclones may ease up in the north by the end of the year, the outlook for drought-hit areas is not good, according to the bureau. “Between the [above average] temperature and the lack of rainfall, this is not good news,” climatologist Robyn Duell said. “This outlook on the back of such little rainfall and dry conditions makes it such a worry for people.”  Australia had endured its driest September since rainfall records began in 1900, Duell said. Despite rain in some areas in the past week, most of New South Wales and Queensland remain bone-dry. Drought conditions are worsening in parts of Victoria, where farmers are struggling to save their crops. NSW farmers have been hit hard by drought: 100% of the state is drought-declared, 34.3% is classed as drought-affected, 48.4% is in drought and 16.7% is in severe drought. Close to 60% of Queensland is in drought, and parts of the state have been dry for the past seven years. Farmers in drought-declared areas are eligible for relief payments and support services. El Niño is the part of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (Enso) characterised by weak trade winds over the Pacific, which reduce moisture and rainfall in eastern Australia. An El Niño is detected by a sustained fall in the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) to below –7. Sustained positive values above +7 typically indicate La Niña. Values between +7 and −7 generally indicate neutral conditions. “Any given year there is a risk because El Niño is a normal part of our climate system. We get an El Niño on average every two to five years,” Duell told the ABC. “That puts the risk at any given year at about a 25% chance. At the moment we’re looking at around a 70% chance. “This is absolutely not the type of outlook I think that many people would be hoping to hear.” The bureau outlook also noted that the the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), another key climate indicator, was trending positive, further contributing to the dry conditions. A positive IOD event typically reduces spring rainfall in central and southern Australia and can exacerbate any potential El Niño-driven rainfall deficiencies."
"Key dangers largely left out of the IPCC special report on 1.5C of warming are raising alarm among some scientists who fear we may have underestimated the impacts of humans on the Earth’s climate. The IPCC report sets out the world’s current knowledge of the impacts of 1.5C of warming and clearly shows the dangers of breaching such a limit. However, many scientists are increasingly worried about factors about which we know much less. These “known unknowns” of climate change are tipping points, or feedback mechanisms within the climate system – thresholds that, if passed, could send the Earth into a spiral of runaway climate change. Tipping points merit only a few mentions in the IPCC report. Durwood Zaelke, founder of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said: “The IPCC report fails to focus on the weakest link in the climate chain: the self-reinforcing feedbacks which, if allowed to continue, will accelerate warming and risk cascading climate tipping points and runaway warming.” He pointed to water vapour in the air, which traps heat in the atmosphere, as well as the loss of polar ice, the collapse of permafrost, and the migration of tropical clouds towards the poles. Ice melting at the poles is known to be of particular danger. The Earth’s ice caps act as reflectors, sending some of the sun’s rays back into space and cooling the planet. When sea ice melts, it reveals dark water underneath, which absorbs more heat and in turn triggers greater warming, in a constant feedback loop. Ice on land, such as in Greenland and under much of the Antarctic, may contain yet another feedback loop; when the ice melts, water percolates to the land below where it lubricates the slide of ice over rock and could accelerate the collapse of glaciers into the surrounding sea. Bob Ward, of the Grantham Institute, said: “The IPCC summary for policymakers only mentions the west Antarctica and Greenland tipping points, which we may already have reached.” The full report of the IPCC reflects our lack of knowledge of the full potential of tipping points, he said: “The underlying report suggests that the other tipping points are too poorly understood, or not likely to be triggered until higher amounts of warming – but given their consequences, one would expect a more risk-based approach. That is, you don’t ignore them until you know them to be impossible.” A key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment. The scientists found: • By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C. • Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C • Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds. • If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost One of the problems with tipping point thresholds is that we may not know when they are reached. Robert Larter, of the British Antarctic Survey, called polar ice sheets “sleeping giants”, which if they pass a tipping point will cause devastation. “As ice sheets melted after the last glacial period, there were times when sea level rose at a rate of more than three metres per century, an order of magnitude faster than the current rate,” he said. “This implies that there are situations in which ice sheets can melt much more rapidly than they have over the period we have been observing them. We should be very cautious about disturbing these sleeping giants.” Another issue with melting ice is that it uncovers and destabilises permafrost. This layer is known to contain vast quantities of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas with a warming effect many times that of carbon dioxide. Melting permafrost will release that gas into the atmosphere, with unpredictable consequences. Further unknowns include the effects of climate change on carbon sinks, such as soils and forests: higher temperatures could dry out some soils, causing them to release stored carbon into the air. But increased rainfall – a symptom of climate change in some regions – could in other areas be making it harder for forest soils to trap greenhouse gases such as methane. Mario Molina, who shared the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1995 for his work on depletion of the ozone layer, said: “The IPCC report demonstrates that it is still possible to keep the climate relatively safe, provided we muster an unprecedented level of cooperation, extraordinary speed and heroic scale of action. But even with its description of the increasing impacts that lie ahead, the IPCC understates a key risk: that self-reinforcing feedback loops could push the climate system into chaos before we have time to tame our energy system, and the other sources of climate pollution.”"
