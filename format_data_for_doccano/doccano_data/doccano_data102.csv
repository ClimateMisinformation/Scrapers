"China will aim to cut its greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60-65% from 2005 levels under a plan submitted to the United Nations ahead of crucial climate change talks in Paris later this year. The pledge has been eagerly awaited as the country is the world’s largest carbon emitter.   China said it would increase the share of non-fossil fuels as part of its primary energy consumption to about 20% by 2030, and peak emissions by around the same point, though it would “work hard” to do so earlier.  The figures are contained in a document submitted to the United Nations ahead of the next round of UN climate talks in Paris. All countries are expected to submit their national pledges to reduce carbon emissions beyond 2020, also known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC). China plans to increase its installed capacity of wind power to 200GW and solar power to around 100 gigawatts (GW), up from 95.81GW and 28GW today, respectively. It will also increase its use of natural gas which is expected to make up more than 10% of its primary energy consumption by 2020.  According to estimates by E3G, a European-based environmental thinktank, China’s plan will see it install as much low-carbon energy as the entire US electricity system capacity to date.  China’s pledge largely reflects commitments it made in November last year as part of an agreement struck with the US.  Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy officer with Greenpeace, said he believes the figures announced are floor figures and that China is definitely capable of over-achieving.  He said it reflects the actions that are being taken domestically as China attempts to reduce its toxic levels of air pollution that are a result of its rapid coal-based economic growth. China’s premier Li Keqiang has previously “declared war” on pollution, describing it as a “blight” on people’s quality of life.  Coal consumption still accounts for around 66% of China’s energy consumption. Last year, China’s cabinet announced a plan to cap coal consumption by 2020 at a level of 4.2bn tonnes and for coal to make up no more than 62% of the primary energy mix by the same year. Changhua Wu, China director of the Climate Group said China’s INDC is a “positive boost” to the international climate change process. “China’s effort to align its domestic growth agenda and global climate change agenda is a leading example of how a fundamental shift is needed to grow the economy differently,” she said. In its document submitted to the UN, China said the outcomes of the negotiations in Paris “should take into account differentiated historical responsibilities”, a reference to the fact developed countries have put more carbon into the atmosphere over time than developing countries. However, according to the Climate Group, due to China’s massive economic development and taking into account emissions from 1990 to now, the country has almost caught up with the US’s total historical emissions.  China’s pledge is expected to give an important boost to efforts to reach a global deal on reducing emissions beyond 2020 in Paris, which UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon warned on Monday were moving at a snail’s pace.  Mohamed Adow, Christian Aid’s senior climate change adviser, said China’s pledge is a “huge step”. Ahead of the talks in Copenhagen in 2009, China and the US were criticised for holding back progress, and “now China is leading the way. It shows that China is starting to do its bit. This is a new era for climate politics,” said Adow.  However, it is not likely that the pledges that have been submitted, including China’s, are sufficient to keep global temperatures rises below the internationally-agreed target of 2C, according to Li Shuo.  “We think the collective ambition of what has been putting on the table, in particular major emitters (EU, China, US) are not sufficient to help us maintain below 2C,” said Li. “Now it is the task of the political process all the way to Paris to ensure we have a robust agreement by the end of this year to enhance action further.”       "
"“We can’t divest from fossil fuels unless you tell us,” Meryam Omi of Legal and General Investment Management, the UK’s largest pension asset manager, told the Guardian recently. Her words came as we teamed up with the responsible investment charity ShareAction to encourage Guardian readers active on fossil fuel divestment to do just that – to write to their pension fund asking if their money could be moved out of coal, oil and gas companies.   Hundreds took the action – using our template letter or online tool – and sent us the responses they received back from their fund.  Many have not yet received a response, but readers should not underestimate the difference contacting your pension provider could make, Sophia McNab of ShareAction told us. “Pension funds aren’t used to hearing from their members so when savers do get in touch, it makes a difference. We’ve heard first-hand from pension funds that these emails spark important internal discussions,” she said. We’ve now picked out the most common responses and rebuttals and suggested how readers might want to respond. Here are the steps those who want to divest their pension fund could think about taking. 1. Make a demand Like Omi, many pension funds will argue that there is no demand for fossil-fuel-free pensions and until there is, they will not provide an option. Your email alone shows that this argument is no longer valid. It’s an important first step, but you might also want to sign the I Want to Break Fossil Free petition, which is bringing together those want to save fossil-fuel-free to ask savings providers to create such options. 2. Respond If your fund has sent a response, the information below should help. If you don’t get an answer, or their response doesn’t answer your questions, don’t worry. Pension funds aren’t used to hearing from their members – it could even be the first time somebody has raised this issue – so it could take them weeks or months to create a response. Don’t be afraid to pick up the phone, ask them when you can expect a response by or even better, ask for a meeting where you can discuss your concerns in person. It is your money and it is legitimate for you to question where the fund is investing it. 3. Find allies Are there other people in your workplace who might also want such an option? If you can find a few, it could be easier to ask for a meeting with your trustees or fund managers. If you contact ShareAction, they may also be able to come and deliver training for you and your colleagues. 4. Move your money If your employer allows, one way to move your savings out of fossil fuels is to self-invest it in a personal pension; in the UK, funds provided by Jupiter Ecology or WHEB for example do have viable options. However, these funds are run by an active manager – rather than with passive trackers – who follows the market and uses their judgement to move investments so there is a fee to pay for the service.  In Australia, there are options at MyFutureSuper and the Asset Owners Disclosure Project provides a useful tool to measure how climate-friendly your fund is. In the US, Green Century provide fossil-fuel-free options. The Divest-Invest Individual campaign is another useful resource. 5. Ask for help If your response isn’t covered below, you have more questions or want to get more involved, contact Sophia McNab of ShareAction at sophia@shareaction.org and she may be able to help. If you want tailored advice, consider speaking to a financial adviser. Did you divest? If you’re able to, like these readers, let us know – email keep.it@theguardian.com using ‘pension divestment’ in the subject line.  The responses readers received from pension funds were varied, from an invitation to join an internal meeting to no response at all. Here are seven of the most common responses – and how you might like to respond if you would like to divest your pension.  Many investors who are reluctant to move their money out of fossil fuels make this argument, which is that their shares get them entry to the boardroom and therefore a say on the strategic direction of the companies in question. Few of these investors have been able to provide evidence of where this engagement has made a difference – ask your pension fund for this evidence. What commitments have they asked for and at what point would they divest if engagement proved unfruitful? Pension funds control huge amounts of money and could make a real difference. In Norway, the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) recently committed to divest from coal companies. The $900bn (£569bn) fund will involve the sale of millions and impact on 122 companies, including UK utility company SSE and Drax, the UK’s biggest coal-fired power station.  This may well be true and of value so you may want to explore it as an option, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that the companies a pension fund screens out include coal, oil and gas extractors. Such funds will often focus on excluding arms manufacturers or tobacco companies for example. If you are offered an option like this, ask to see the list of holdings – they are unlikely to provide the full list, but they should at least provide you with information about the largest holdings. When pension funds or financial managers refer to “duty” they most often mean fiduciary duty. This is a legal requirement designed to ensure the people who look after your money take due care to do so. Traditionally, it is seen as a duty confined to the economic sphere only. But last year the rules changed. A review, commissioned by the government and conducted by the Law Commission, judged that pension scheme trustees must consider factors that could be “financially material to the performance of an investment – including over the long-term”. It specified that such factors can include environmental, social, corporate and macroeconomic concerns. Those who want their pension fund to provide a fossil-fuel-free option, should first point out that environmental concerns can now be considered as part of fiduciary duty. Second, you can make the financial argument: if international targets to tackle climate change are pursued, investments in fossil fuel reserves (including pension funds) are vastly overvalued. This concept – of a trillion dollar “carbon bubble” – is currently the subject of an investigation by the Bank of England. It might be difficult but it’s not impossible. Many pension funds make investments by using an index, which automatically tracks the market – but different trackers have been created for different reasons. A fossil-fuel-free tracker has already been created by FTSE so your pension fund could create a product that uses this. This is true. As people live longer, these schemes – sometimes called final salary pension schemes – are becoming less common because savers are guaranteed a pre-agreed sum upon retirement and the employer must shoulder the risk. The pensions from the company’s employees are invested as a whole so it is not possible for individuals to pick and choose where these investments are made.  If you have one of these schemes, which are common if you work in public services, the only way to divest your pension is to persuade the company to divest the whole scheme from fossil fuels. This may seem like a huge challenge, but is not impossible. The network at 350.org has many campaigns like this, with some making significant progress and they have lots of resources to help you. You can stress to your pension provider that these are financial concerns, which they should be considering for the whole fund. These schemes are being replaced by defined contribution schemes, where individuals’ money is invested in the stock market. Employees therefore take on much more of the risk so have a choice – to a degree – in where this money is invested.  Even though a pension fund doesn’t provide a fossil-fuel-free option, they may still take environmental principles into consideration in a number of different ways. Many will point out that they have signed up to the UN’s Principles for Responsible Investment, but these do not commit investors to take any action.  It’s great if a pension fund is measuring its carbon footprint and investing in renewables, but if this isn’t what you are asking for, request more information. Which companies do these products screen out? What are their investments in renewable power? ShareAction is currently lobbying the government to give savers the right to more transparency on such issues.  This response is an open door – so it’s your chance to push further and have more influence. What exactly are they measuring and how? What is the timeline for the review? Where will they publish it and can they send you a copy? What are the opportunities for member input? Readers should be aware any answers given do not constitute financial advice or endorsement of any particular product. Readers should consult a financial advisor where appropriate."

" The hole in the landscape that opens up in front of the group of visitors is so vast and deep that some of them simply stare, mouths agape. “This mine will be active until 2026 or 2027,” says Barbara Wittig, a guide with a local operator of excursions into one of Germany’s largest open-pit lignite mines. Down below at the bottom of the mine, workers are busy running gigantic machines to remove the topsoil and dig deep into a layer of brown coal, or lignite. These rich seams of fossil fuel have provided the Lausitz region, 60 miles southeast of Berlin, with jobs and incomes for more than a century. “We certainly hope that mining will continue after 2027 and we keep producing reliable electricity in our beautiful power plants,” Wittig says, pointing toward large cooling towers on the horizon, which send steam into the atmosphere.   These towers also spew a much more problematic gas: The three regional coal-fired power plants — Jänschwalde, Boxberg, and Schwarze Pumpe — are among the largest point-sources of CO2 emissions in the world. In recent months, Welzow-Süd and other lignite mines have become the subject of heated controversy in Germany as their continuing operations clash with the country’s ambitions of being a green energy powerhouse. That conflict has sparked a battle over imposing a special “climate fee” on coal-fired power plants. Germany is Europe’s largest economy, and its wealth depends heavily on exporting industrial goods made with cheap electricity. Lignite is the cheapest source of electricity from fossil fuels, and Germany has the world’s largest reserves of it. But lignite causes the highest CO2 emissions per ton when burned, one-third more than hard coal and three times as much as natural gas.  Yet Germany also has the most ambitious green energy strategy of all the industrialized nations — the Energiewende, or energy transformation. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany’s conservative chancellor, Angela Merkel, vowed to phase out all nuclear power plants by 2022, while simultaneously sticking to the pre-existing goal of reducing national CO2 emissions 4%0 below 1990 levels by 2020 and by 80 to 90% by 2050. While Germany prides itself as a green champion, something paradoxical has happened in the last several years: CO2 emissions steadily fell from 1,051m metric tons in 1990 to 813mtons in 2011, the year of the Fukushima disaster. But in 2012 and 2013, CO2 emissions rose again to 841m tons. This can largely be attributed to an increase in the use of lignite for electricity production. When the emissions data was compiled last year, alarms went off in Merkel’s chancellery, and even more so when an expert report projected that Germany would fall short of its 2020 CO2 target by five to eight percentage points. Merkel has rejected criticism that her government’s nuclear phase-out is responsible for this gap. Germany’s emissions have gone up, she said, because the country has exported more electricity from lignite to neighboring countries and because the European Union’s trading system for CO2 emissions certificates has worked poorly. In contrast to previous warnings that the Energiewende would lead to a shortage of electricity and possibly even power outages, Germany exported a record amount of about 5% of its total electricity production to neighboring countries in 2013. The surplus electricity not only came from the growing number of German wind farms and solar installations, but also from increased lignite use. Power production from renewable sources like wind, solar, and biomass has soared in recent years to a record level of 26% of electricity generation in 2014.  This contributed to a significant drop in overall prices for electricity bought wholesale by large consumers. At the same time, electricity from lignite became cheaper due to another factor: As economies throughout Europe weakened due to the global financial crisis, companies reduced their production and thus had to buy fewer EU certificates for emitting CO2. As a result, the price utility companies have had to pay for emitting a ton of CO2 into the atmosphere crashed, from a historic high of nearly 30 euros per ton in 2008 to just over 3 euros per ton in 2013. This has made burning lignite very attractive.  For industrial users, Germany has become a source of cheap electricity — but not for private consumers in Germany, who bear the brunt of building up renewable power sources as a result of German feed-in tariffs.  “Without the collapse of the CO2 certificate price, Germany’s emissions would most probably not have increased,” says Otmar Edenhofer, professor for the Economics of Climate Change at the Technical University Berlin.  Nevertheless, Chancellor Merkel and her coalition partner, the Social Democrats, don’t want to be seen as betraying the Energiewende goals. “It would be hard to justify the expenses for renewable energies if CO2 emissions keep rising again,” says Jochen Flasbarth, Germany’s junior environment minister. So on 3 December, 2014, the government passed what it called the Climate Action Program 2020, a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions by around 70m tons annually by 2020.  Most measures have remained uncontroversial, such as increased spending on energy efficiency and green buildings. But the government’s announcement this spring that it intended to reduce emissions by 22m tons with the help of a “climate fee” for coal-fired power plants caused an uproar among coal miner unions and large utility companies. The fee would have forced operators to buy extra certificates for their emissions from the European Trading Scheme for CO2 emission allowances, thus making electricity from lignite less profitable.  While environmental organizations hailed the climate fee, trade unions warned of the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in Lausitz, central Germany, and the Rhenian district, where lignite is produced and burned.  “The climate fee will lead to a nationwide end for coal power plants and structural turmoil in the affected regions,” Michael Vassiliadis, head of the miners’ union, IGBCE, has proclaimed at rallies. After a number of miners’ demonstrations, the German government is now giving in to the protests. At a closed-door meeting on July 1, the heads of the governing parties decided to replace the climate fee with an alternative set of measures. The new plan is a total strategic reversal: Instead of making utilities pay more for emitting CO2, the utilities will now actually be paid for downsizing their operations while keeping their power plants operational as a “national capacity reserve.” The plan aims to eliminate 2.7 gigawatts of lignite production, amounting to 13% of Germany’s brown coal capacity — an initiative the government says will avoid 11m tons of CO2 emissions annually. Additional cuts in lignite production are planned for the future.  “Ultimately, we will deliver the 22m ton reduction, but at a higher cost,” says Social Democrat leader Sigmar Gabriel, vice chancellor and federal minister for economic affairs and energy. He acknowledges that the cost of this reversal is high: $2.2bn to $3.3bn dollars per year, divided fifty-fifty between the federal government and private consumers who have to pay more for their electricity.  Environmental NGOs and economists are highly critical of the new, less stringent emissions reduction plan. “Chancellor Merkel has broken her promise to get serious about decarbonization,” says Tobias Münchmeyer of Greenpeace Germany.  “This will gild the end of lignite power plants, instead of making money available for building storage facilities for surplus wind and solar electricity and power lines for transporting wind energy from coastal regions into the rest of the country,” says Claudia Kemfert, head of the Energy, Transportation, and Environment Department at the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. “What we lack is a strong and clear price signal that emitting CO2 will become more expensive,” says Edenhofer, of the Technical University Berlin, who is in favor of creating a Europe-wide minimum price for emissions that would steadily increase. Revenues from the price on carbon would be used to support the economic modernization of regions that would be affected when coal mines and power plants close, according to Edenhofer. Negotiations have begun in Brussels to reform the European Trading Scheme by 2020, but until then the German government doesn’t expect a price level for CO2 that would help reduce emissions. Merkel’s government is now keen to emphasize that scrapping the climate fee is not a departure from the Energiewende goals. “This is not about whether we reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% until 2020, this is merely about how we do it,” says environment minister Barbara Hendricks, a Social Democrat. In late June, her ministry convened 200 officials from German states and municipalities to develop a strategy for how to move from a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions to the far more ambitious goal of slashing emissions by 90% by 2050.  “Our new data show that in 2014, CO2 emissions have dropped again and that’s the way we want to keep going,” says Hendricks.  In Welzow-Süd, miners have reacted with relief to the government’s decision to back off from imposing the climate fee. But the future of this mining area is still very uncertain. Vattenfall, the Swedish company that owns the operations in Welzow-Süd, is offering its Lausitz lignite reserves and power plants for sale, triggered by an order from the Swedish government to reduce the company’s overall CO2 emissions. While Germany continues to expand solar and wind power, the government’s decision to phase out nuclear energy means it must now rely heavily on the dirtiest form of coal, lignite, to generate electricity. The result is that after two decades of progress, the country’s CO2 emissions are rising. The overall share of coal in German electricity production has shrunk from 56% in 1990 to 43% in 2014. During the same period, the share of renewables in electricity production has soared from 4% to 26%, with no end in sight for that growth. If these trends continue, inexpensive wind energy will make coal operations less and less profitable.  But Wittig, the tour guide, is confident that the end of German coal is not in sight. She led her tour group down to the flöz, the black bottom of the Welzow-Süd opencast mine, where the remnants of swamps and bogs from 17 million years ago are being dug up. The excavating equipment here is so large that workers operating them look like ants. Wittig described how this mine alone sends 36,000 tons of coal per day to nearby power plants. The Welzow-Süd mines hold “enough coal for the rest of the century,” she said proudly."
"Now is probably not the best time – if there ever was one – for a minority within Australia’s Liberal party to be excreting climate science denialist brain farts. The government is expected to announce within a week or two its proposed target to cut greenhouse gas emissions beyond the year 2020.  This will be the target Australia takes to December’s international climate talks in Paris and it will further put the Australian government under international scrutiny. So far, there is a substantial gap between the supposed agreement to keep global warming below 2C and the levels of cuts governments say they’re willing to make to get there.  But one smallish rump of the Liberal party – a rump some within the party might like to have removed – thinks the whole climate science thing needs a review before Australia signs anything in France.  Here’s a quick recap.  The Liberal party’s regional and rural committee put a motion to the party’s national council meeting to:  … examine the scientific evidence that underpins the man-made global warming theory and investigate the reasons for the failure of computer models, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and prominent individuals to predict, among other things, the pause in global warming this century. Liberal MP Dennis Jensen and Liberal senator Chris Back supported the motion, but rather than hold a debate it was referred to the party’s policy committee. Twelve scientists then wrote to Jensen and Back, offering to brief them on the science. Jensen accepted.  Jensen claimed to the ABC there were “at least 10” members of his party who shared his climate denialist tendencies.  With some prodding from ABC Radio National host Fran Kelly, Jensen set out why he thought the science needed a review.  Why not just accept the assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change? No good, said Jensen, because this body was guilty of “institutionalised groupthink”.  Jensen was similarly unimpressed with the experts who had co-signed the letter, saying “only two” of the signatories were climate scientists.  Because some of the scientists were experts on the impacts of climate change, Jensen dismissed them – presumably because they’re experts in something he doesn’t believe in.  Jensen attempted to make some scientific points too.  He claimed if carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubled, this would deliver 1.1C of global warming if CO2 was “acting in isolation” which, of course, never happens. Ever.  In Jensen’s mind, the evidence that adding CO2 to the atmosphere can kick off feedbacks in the system to create more warming is “not compelling at all”. So “not compelling” is the well-established understanding that CO2 warms the atmosphere. A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapour - a greenhouse gas.  Presumably “not compelling” either is how as sea ice and snow melts, this exposes darker surfaces beneath, which absorbs more heat and cuts the amount of solar energy reflected back out to space, causing more warming. Jensen also claimed that “98%” of climate models had “way overstated” recent global temperatures. I asked Professor Steve Sherwood, director of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales and a lead IPCC author about Jensen’s points (he had more to say too, which we’ll get to at the end). He told me:  There is overwhelming theoretical support and observational evidence for positive feedbacks on global temperature. Moreover the climate sensitivity desired by Jensen is inconsistent with Earth’s climate record, which shows 2-5C of warming every time CO2 doubled. You can throw away the climate models and we still know we have a serious problem. Victoria University’s Professor Roger Jones, also an IPCC author, said Jensen’s argument that climate models were overstating warming “did not hold water” and pointed to a recent study in the journal Nature Climate Change.  That study examined global temperatures for every 15-year period from 1900 to 2012 (starting with 1900 to 1914, then 1901 to 1915 and so on) and compared these to temperatures delivered by climate models. The study found no evidence that climate models systematically overestimated global temperatures. Jones said he would not be surprised if the current El Niño delivered a marked shift in global temperatures, as high as 0.3C, and that this would push the planet into a “new regime”. He added: I have no interest in briefing Jensen or his colleagues. The world is doing that quite effectively and speaks with a louder voice than I do. Professor Matthew England, also of the Climate Change Research Centre at UNSW, told me Jensen was being fooled: Jensen is showing a worrying ignorance of the science. And he’s being fooled by dodgy analyses put out by lobby groups determined to delay action on reducing fossil fuel emissions. Colleagues overseas can’t believe we have elected representatives who still don’t get the science. It’s an embarrassment. Jensen said any review into the science would have to be conducted “from people outside the system” which seems to me to be another way of saying “don’t give me any actual experts”.  I’m wondering if a Liberal Party review of the science might sound a bit like the Republican-led US House Science Committee hearing last year, reviewed here by Jon Stewart. So who does Jensen think is worth listening to?  In September 2013, Jensen promoted the views of that most eccentric of climate science denialists, Lord Christopher Monckton, saying he thought that most of the viscount’s views were “entirely reasonable”. I don’t know if Jensen ever did clarify which of Monckton’s views he thought were reasonable, but the British viscount himself did pen a colourful nine-page response to my questions. Jensen’s parliamentary colleague, the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has a different view of Monckton, once describing him as a “vaudeville artist” and a “professional sensationalist” with “no credibility, politically or scientifically”. So back to Sherwood, who has evidently had enough of the attacks on the credibility of his profession from non-experts. I’ll leave you with his thoughts:  If Jensen would like to have scientists investigated yet again, let him do it. If my colleagues or I have been guilty of what the likes of him are claiming, we deserve to go to jail.  But please ask him to also investigate climate sceptics, whose claims have repeatedly been shown to rest on misrepresentations of the evidence.  I am getting tired of my own integrity and that of my colleagues being questioned for political reasons when our conclusions are based on a deliberate, careful and completely open scientific process, the opposite of “groupthink.”  These groundless accusations have gone on for long enough."

"Barack Obama was the one asking the questions in an interview with British naturalist David Attenborough that aired on Sunday in which they agreed that combating climate change would require a global effort.  Saying he had long been a “huge admirer” of Attenborough’s TV documentaries about the environment, Obama turned the tables on Attenborough in an interview taped on 8 May at the White House, which aired on the BBC and other international broadcasters. Climate change is one of Obama’s priorities for his remaining time in office, but he faces resistance from Republicans in Congress on how to deal with the issue.  Obama noted the US agreement with China in 2014 to set new limits on carbon emissions starting in 2025. The two countries are the world’s leading carbon emitters.  He told Attenborough: “We’re not moving as fast as we need to, and part of what I know from watching your programs, and all the great work you’ve done, is that these ecosystems are all interconnected.  “If just one country is doing the right thing, but other countries are not, then we’re not going to solve the problem. We’re going to have to have a global solution to this,” he said.  Attenborough agreed that “the solutions are global”.  Obama also asked the naturalist if he thought it was possible “to get a handle on these issues”.  After Attenborough stressed the value of finding ways to generate and store power from renewable resources, Obama said: “I think you’re right about that. There has got to be an economic component to this.”  Attenborough, 89, the brother of the late actor and director Richard Attenborough, has been making television documentaries for 60 years. The BBC has called him “the godfather of natural history TV”.    It came as his administration is finalising rules to curb carbon emissions from power plants. Obama has pushed world leaders to agree to new targets at a summit later this year in Paris.  Obama told Attenborough that children were “much more environmentally aware” than adults, and cited his daughters Malia, 16, and Sasha, 13, as examples. “They do not dispute, for example, the science around climate change,” Obama said."

"On a June morning, Father Rob Yaksich, a park ranger until he found his calling in mid-life as a Catholic priest, presided over his first ever Sunday Mass at the historic Cathedral Basilica of Saint Francis in Santa Fe, New Mexico. That day, he chose the power of spreading the faith as the theme of his sermon. “Think of the mustard seed,” he told those gathered for the early morning Spanish language mass. “We all carry little mustard seeds of faith in our hearts. This mustard seed grows, and if it is nourished, it grows into a great tree.”  The roots of the Catholic church run deep here; New Mexico is considered one of the most culturally Catholic states. The first permanent Franciscan mission is in present-day Santa Fe, which is surrounded by the Sangre de Cristo mountains. The power of those Catholic faithful will now be put to the test twice over, with the pope’s radical message about climate change in the global economy, and his call for a phase-out of fossil fuels in the name of protecting the poor. It’s now up to Yaksich and others to spread Francis’s message of urgency and make the seed of action planted by the pope grow, even in New Mexico, a poor rural state with a Republican governor caught in a pincer hold by the oil and gas industry on its northwestern and southeastern flanks. The industry accounts for about a third of the New Mexico’s general fund.  As priests speak out from the pulpit and the ranks, their advocacy on climate change could eventually help build the critical mass of public support needed to push political leaders to take the bold action. In return, the pope’s support for climate justice – a cause that resonates strongly with a younger generation and the rapidly rising Latino population – could help stop people from drifting away from the church. The question in both cases is whether a wildly popular and progressive pope can make a difference in the face of a slow-moving existential threat. About a quarter of Americans identify as Catholics – around 80 million people, although those numbers are slipping. There are also the faint beginnings of a political realignment, with those who identify as Catholics shifting their allegiance from the Democratic to the Republican party. But Catholics still worry more about climate change than Americans overall, according to the Pew research center. Catholics who identify as Latinos or Hispanic are even more concerned: 82% say the earth is warming due to human activity, compared to 64% of white Catholics. About 63% of Hispanic Catholics say climate change is a very serious problem, compared to 39% of white Catholics. In his long pastoral letter, which contained almost as many references to science as to scripture, the pope cast climate change and degradation of the environment as a consequence of a global capitalist system that had been left to run riot over the poor and the planet. Our world had come to resemble a pile of filth because of reckless use of resources, he lamented. He urged leaders to act swiftly to protect our “common home”. The pope will get a second shot at expounding on those views to a US audience – and to those Republicans who are openly hostile to the idea of a pro-poor, pro-climate pope – next September when he is due to visit the United Nations and address a joint session of Congress. In Father Yaksich, who spent nearly 20 years teaching school children about bird life in his native New Mexico as a conservation biologist, the pope has a willing disciple. “It’s an issue that’s near and dear to my heart” Yaksich said, speaking on the steps of the church as parishioners filed out, with one or two asking for blessings or gently correcting his Spanish. Water and drought were a natural concern for people in New Mexico, he said. Late snowfall and unusually heavy spring rains this year brought some relief to four years of a vicious drought. But by then at least one town, Magdalena, south-west of Albuquerque, had run out of water and several were on the brink of catastrophe. It was impossible not to see the connections, Yaksich said. “When the human family is taken care of deep down ... then the natural extention of that is taking better care of the environment, protecting and sharing resources in such a way that benefits everybody,” he said.  On the Sunday afternoon before the pope delivered his climate treatise, the newly ordained Archbishop of Santa Fe, John Wester, joined in a tradition stretching back 303 years: the annual procession in honour of Diego De Vargas, who crushed the late 17th century native American pueblo revolts and re-established Spanish colonial rule over New Mexico.  Women and girls, draped in layers of white frills, traipsed through the streets from the basilica to an historic cemetery in the withering heat. The next morning, Wester arrived for his first official day on the job as Archbishop of Santa Fe, at the archdiocese headquarters located on the west side of the Rio Grande, across from downtown Albuquerque. After the elaborate pageantry of Sunday’s events, Wester acknowledged there were some who would prefer to see the Church relegated to upholding such rituals, rather than taking on the life-and-death issues of the modern day. “We think of religion as the bible, morality, sacred tradition, doctrine, ritual, liturgy. That is the domain of religion,” he said. “When we talk about things like the death penalty, immigration, climate change, these are issues that are very much out there in the public political arena. Now some people may say: ‘tell the priests and bishops to stay in church and we will take care of this’. But that’s not true. The church has an obligation to speak the truth in the public square and then people can do what they want in the voting booth. The church has an obligation because they are religious matters, human matters.” A week before the pope’s intervention on the environment, US bishops gathered in St Louis for their annual assembly. Wester, who was there, was still serving as the conference’s spokesman. Admittedly climate change was not top of the agenda for all of the bishops at the gathering. But, Wester said, he had never met a bishop who was an outright climate denier. “Some will be more vociferous about it than others,” he said. But he added: “They will all be anxious to promote the pope’s message.” Some priests and bishops, especially those in conservative parts of the country, or where the local economy is heavily dependent on extractive industries, would welcome the pope’s intervention for giving them licence at last to touch on subjects they dared not raise for fear of offending their parishioners. “This will be a wonderful boost for them,” Wester said. For others, and Wester puts himself among them, the strong message from the Pope was a signal to press even harder for change. “What good does it do if 100 years from now we wake up and say: ‘Oh my goodness. We missed the boat. It’s too late now. We can’t reverse what we have begun,” he said. A few miles to the south of the campus, Richard Moore got up at 6am to fill a rush order for organic lettuce from a local restaurant. Moore, the son of Puerto Rican farm workers, had spent the better part of half a century as a community organiser, much of it among the poor and working class immigrant neighbourhoods of New Mexico. After an early run-in with the law as a gang member, Moore briefly entertained the idea of entering the priesthood, but then devoted himself to a life as an activist, as director of the Southwest Network for Environmental and Economic Justice. There were fights against chemical plants, oil refineries, slaughter houses, dog food factories, and landfills – all heavily polluting industries dumped unfairly in working class neighbourhoods. And then there were the very elements: earth, water and air. After four years of drought, the wells in some small towns were running dry. Farmers were pumping up brackish water, which was damaging the crops, and much of New Mexico was a tinder box dry. Megafires ripped across the forests, darkening the sky with ash and fouling the air quality for those with asthma and other respiratory conditions. On some recent summer days, there were warnings in Albuquerque to keep the windows closed, because of the gritty haze of surounding fires. These days, community groups are organising against plans to divert about 20 million gallons of water a day from the Rio Grande from smaller farmers on the outskirts of Albuquerque to a big condo project. From where Moore stood there was always a link between the environment and economic justice, long before the pope drew the connection. For all of the fights about dirty air and dirty water, there was a single unifying principle, so far as Moore saw it. The struggle was about justice, not the environment. “Take chemicals, there are 86,000 chemicals on the market, and less than 200 are regulated,” Moore said. He said he fought for environmental justice every day. “The Catholic church has always been a little bit slow so far as we are concerned in terms of moving on social justice issues, whether it is food or immigration or police repression.” The current focus of Moore’s struggle is the two-acre organic farm which operates as a community garden, raising lettuce, spinach, peas, onions, arugula, radish and kale. Such small plots are quite common on the edges of Albuquerque and other towns, reminders that New Mexico is still primarily a rural state. A number of the homes in Moore’s neighbourhood have chilis drying on the porch. Moore’s farm, organised by Los Jardines or gardens institutes, supplies produce to about 100 families, who volunteer on the farm, as well as restaurants. Over the last few years he noticed an increase in real-time effects from climate change. Last spring, he lost hundreds of seedlings to a grasshopper infestation. Moore blamed the mild mild winter. Low temperatures in December and January would ordinarily be relied on to kill off the pests. But this year they destroyed an entire hothouse of tomatoes.  Moore was glad, he said, that the Pope had committed the entire Catholic church to fight climate change – but he didn’t entirely trust the outcome would be in the interests of the people he had fought for in his lifetime. “The voice of the Pope lifting up these issues is very very important to the work that we are doing, but we have to be cautious,” he said. “Corporate leaders and CEOs will go to church on Sunday and on Monday, they will go right back into the office doing the same thing.” Juan Reynosa, an activist with the Southwest Organising Project, grew up in the shadow of industry power, in the small town of Hobbs, in southern New Mexico. A conservative, deeply Catholic town near the border with Texas, Hobbs functions as a hub for the oil industry. Reynosa’s father was an oil field truck driver. After eight or nine years as an organiser, Reynosa said it was still hard for him to even begin a conversation about the environment in his hometown without being accused of wrecking the economy. With the pope’s intervention, he hoped priests that had been silent on the environment would be emboldened to do more. “If there was a big environmental issue in New Mexico that the archdiocese took a stand on it could pretty much change the conversation overnight. Talk about how the oil and gas industry could be safer, how it could treat communities better,” he said. Everytime Reynosa talked about public health and air and water quality, opponents swatted back accusing him of sacrificing jobs to protect the environment. “People are trying to survive but they also feel like it is a little bit of a risk for them to be outspoken. Having God at your back or however you want to put it that can be pretty empowering,” he said. “Now it’s not just me, some random organiser on the ground. It is some very powerful person globally. It really does make a difference – especially when you have some politicians saying the exact opposite.” A prime example would be New Mexico’s Governor Susana Martinez. A Republican, Martinez made history in 2010 when she was elected the country’s first Latina governor. Around the same time, she told Politico she had doubts human activity was responsible for climate change. Martinez went on to reverse several of the environmental measures introduced by her Democratic predecessor, Bill Richardson. By late last year, after Martinez won re-election and Republicans took the house, Democrats were on the verge of despair, according to Jerry Ortiz y Pino, a member of the state Senate. As in a number of western states, the job of an elected state official is part-time and only modestly paid – which is why so many of New Mexico’s representatives are more on the order of gentleman politicians: lawyers, ranchers, or oil men of independent means.  It is hard to over-estimate the importance of the oil and gas industry to New Mexico. In the San Juan basin in the northern part of the state, oil and gas installations sprawl across 10,000 square miles of mesa, canyon and desert plain. There is so much methane leaking from those 40,000 fracked wells, a vast cloud of carbon pollution is now detectable from space.  Oil and gas royalties feed the state’s $14bn permanent fund, which pays for public schools. Other royalty payments and taxes fund road repairs and other budget items. Oil and gas fuels also pays for cultural products from local colleges to museums, according to a report last year from the New Mexico Tax Research Institute. Given those resources, it’s easy to understand the long losing streak for campaigners. Last January, the courts struck down a move to limit fracking in a rural county north-east of Santa Fe. A few months later, the state legislature voted to extend tax credits for solar power installations until 2020. But Martinez failed to sign the bill before the end of the legislature session in June, and the measure lapsed; the tax credits will fade out at the end of next year. Likewise, a campaign to convert an old notoriously smog producing coal-fired power plant in the Four Corners to clean energy was thwarted when the state utility opted to shut down the old polluting units – but install newer coal. Long before the Pope Francis’s pastoral letter, the US Conference on Catholic Bishops put its weight behind Obama’s clean power plant rules. Catholic church workers lobbied companies like Exxon to factor climate change into their future plants, and power plants to shift away from coal to cleaner-burning fuels. Earlier popes, including Benedict, spoke out about climate change. Sister Joan Brown, who grew up on a farm in Kansas and has spent the last 40 years in the south-west, was deeply involved in many of those efforts, along with Interfaith Power and Light, a religious group that campaigns on global warming. In September last year, when 400,000 gathered for a historic climate demonstration in New York, she and others organised a march of their own in Albuquerque, stopping at stations along the route: churches with solar panels, schoolyards with community gardens energy efficient homes – anything to show people that they could incorporate actions to fight climate change into their daily routines. But there had never been a mobilisation on the scale of the one gathering behind the pope. With Francis’s message out, young people are getting involved.  “I’ve never seen anything like this in the faith community or otherwise,” she said. “I just haven’t seen this kind of enthusiasm. It is kind of like looking forward to a new light.”"

"A new paper just published in Science summarizes the projected impacts of climate change on the world’s oceans, and consequently on humans and our economy. The study concludes that global warming beyond the international limit of 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures would pose serious threats to marine ecosystems and their millions of human dependents. It builds on the consensus science published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year. The study concludes, Ocean changes associated with a 2°C warming of global surface temperature carries high risks of impacts and should not be exceeded. The oceans have absorbed over 90% of the excess heat and 28% of the carbon pollution generated by human consumption of fossil fuels. As the authors of the paper note, in many regions, the ocean plays an important role in the livelihood and food supply of human populations. The ocean represents more than 90% of the Earth’s habitable space, hosts 25% of eukaryotic species, provides 11% of global animal protein consumed by humans, protects coastlines, and more.  The study considers human impacts on the world’s oceans under two different scenarios. The first is a business-as-usual high fossil fuel consumption scenario (called RCP8.5 in the latest IPCC report), and the second is a scenario in which humans take immediate serious steps to curb fossil fuel consumption (called RCP2.6). Between now and 2100, RCP8.5 involves 6 times more global carbon pollution emitted by humans than RCP2.6. The societal effort involved in reducing fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions to meet RCP2.6 is obviously much greater than the effort involved in the do-nothing scenario, but this study finds that the outcomes are also starkly different for the world’s oceans. In the business-as-usual scenario, by 2100 the oceans would be about 30 cm higher, oxygen content nearly 2% lower, ocean acidity 70% higher, and sea surface temperatures about 2°C hotter than in RCP2.6. The authors write, In summary, the carbon that we emit today will change the Earth System irreversibly for many generations to come. The ocean’s content of carbon, acidity, and heat as well as sea level will continue to increase long after atmospheric CO2 is stabilized. These irreversible changes increase with increasing emissions, underscoring the urgency of near-term carbon emission reduction if ocean warming and acidification are to be kept at moderate levels. As an example of one consequence of these changes, many marine species are shifting to different geographic regions as the oceans warm. These shifts can pose serious challenges for fisheries. Recent studies strongly reiterate that many species—including various invertebrates, commercially important fish species and marine mammals—are undergoing phenological and geographical shifts of up to 400 km per decade as a result of warming. These geographical species shifts are projected to occur about 65% faster in the business-as-usual scenario than under RCP2.6. Coral reefs are particularly sensitive to human-caused ocean changes. They provide habitat for almost a quarter of the species in the oceans. Hundreds of millions of people rely on the coastal protection, tourism, and food provided by coral reef ecosystems. However, the authors of this study note that the dual threats of global warming and ocean acidification pose a serious threat to coral reefs. Reef-building corals are extremely vulnerable to warming. Warming causes mass mortality of warm-water corals through bleaching as well as through biotic diseases, resulting in declines in coral abundance and biodiversity. Coral reefs can recover from bleaching events when thermal stress is minimal and of short duration. However, ocean warming and acidification are expected to act synergistically to push corals and coral reefs into conditions that are unfavorable for coral reef ecosystems. There is limited agreement and low confidence on the potential for corals to adapt to rapid warming. The study also estimates some of the economic impacts of ocean changes in the business-as-usual scenario. For example, lost coastal habitats and sea level rise could combine to expose 0.2 to 4.6% of the global population to inundation annually at a cost of 0.3 to 9.3% to global GDP. In terms of tourism dollars, the difference between the two scenarios amounts to about $10 billion per year, hitting Australia and the USA particularly hard. Loss of coral reefs to tourism under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios could cost between US$1.9 billion and US$12 billion per year, respectively. Coral reef losses due to ocean warming and acidification on the Great Barrier Reef place up to $5.7 billion and 69,000 jobs in Australia at risk. In addition, ocean acidification may cause an annual loss of reef ecosystem services that are valued up to US$1 trillion by 2100. For about a quarter of countries with reef-related tourism, mainly less developed countries, this kind of tourism accounts for more than 15% of gross domestic product and is more sustainable than extractive livelihoods. The study also makes a critical and often-overlooked point. Some people believe geoengineering is a better or more practical solution than curbing our carbon pollution. Geoengineering proposals often involve slowing global warming by reducing the amount of sunlight absorbed by the Earth, for example by pumping sulfur high into the atmosphere, or putting large mirrors into orbit. However, these proposals wouldn’t curb human carbon emissions, and hence wouldn’t slow the accumulation of carbon in the oceans, or the resulting ocean acidification. Ultimately, the authors warn that immediate action to cut carbon pollution is critical if we want to curb the rapid and dangerous impacts already being observed in the world’s oceans.  …immediate and substantial reduction of CO2 emissions is required in order to prevent the massive and effectively irreversible impacts on ocean ecosystems and their services that are projected with emissions scenarios more severe than RCP2.6. Limiting emissions to below this level is necessary to meet UNFCCC’s stated objectives. Policy options that overlook CO2, such as solar radiation management and control of methane emission, will only minimize impacts of ocean warming and not those of ocean acidification."
"George Osborne has infuriated green energy producers and campaigners with a £910m-a-year raid on the renewable energy sector by changing a climate change levy (CCL) at the same time as providing more fiscal help for North Sea oilfields. RenewableUK, the lobby group, said the changes would cost green energy producers around £450m in the current financial year, and up to £1bn by 2020-2021.  The move hammered the share price of power generator Drax which is in the process of converting stations from burning coal to burning wood pellets. The company lost more than a quarter of its stock market value as it said the move would cost it £30m this year and £60m in 2016. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, described the budget as a “serious blow for the fight against climate change”, while Greenpeace said it showed the chancellor is out of step with the times. Osborne insisted the Conservative government would still continue to promote low carbon investment and would be pushing for a deal at United Nations talks in Paris later this year to limit global warming to 2C. But his budget measures included removing the CCL exemption from renewable electricity schemes and promised streamlining other taxes. “The government will review the business energy efficiency tax landscape and consider approaches to simplify and improve the effectiveness of the regime. A consultation will be launched in autumn 2015,” he said. Osborne also promised to bring forward proposals for a sovereign wealth fund for communities that host shale gas developments, to expand the North Sea investment, and cluster area allowances to include additional activities. Phil Grant, of management consultants Baringa Partners, said the budget was bad news for investors in green power. “Britain is a world leader in green energy but the abolishment of climate change levies for renewables is another blow for an already fragile sector. Investors were perturbed by recent decisions … to reduce subsidies for new renewable plants and we’ve seen the share prices of companies exposed to renewables take a further hit this afternoon.” Gordon Edge, RenewableUK’s director of policy, said that until now, Levy Exemption Certificates generated as a result of the CCL had provided vital financial support for renewable energy producers.  “The government had already announced an end to future financial support for onshore wind – even though it’s the most cost-effective form of clean energy we have. Now they’re imposing retrospective cuts on projects already up and running across the entire clean energy sector.  “Yet again the government is moving the goalposts, pushing some marginal projects from profit into loss. It’s another example of this government’s unfair, illogical and obsessive attacks on renewables”. Caroline Lucas said that axing the CCL exemption for renewable electricity, committing to further funding for road building, and doing nothing to push forward a low-carbon agenda more widely jeopardised progress on climate change. “We’ve seen yet another example of reckless short-term policy making that prioritises the profits of polluters over the public interest in a safe and habitable climate,” she added. Doug Parr, director of policy at Greenpeace, said Osborne was now taxing clean-power schemes as if they were fossil fuel. “This will make it more expensive for business to buy electricity from renewable power. He is man out of step with the times,” he added. But the move to review the impact of energy efficiency measures on bill payers was welcomed by the EEF, manufacturing employers organisation. “Fifteen years of layering and tinkering with policy has left us with a vast patchwork of expensive, inefficient and incoherent policy drivers for decarbonisation,” said the EEF’s director of policy, Paul Raynes. “We urgently need to revisit the policy landscape to reduce costs, improve the business environment and better deliver on our policy objective of reducing emissions,” he added. Meanwhile Catherine Mitchell, a professor of energy policy at the University of Exeter, said the government wanted a sustainable, secure and affordable energy system but had introduced policy changes that took the UK away from that goal. “The ending of subsidies for onshore wind farms, our cheapest low-carbon electricity resource, the failure to exploit the potential of energy efficiency, the removal of the Climate Change Levy exemption for renewable energy, and support for unpopular fracking and extortionately expensive nuclear power does not add up to a credible energy policy,” she said adding: “It reduces the chances of us meeting our various legal requirements, and presents serious political risk to investors, which in itself makes energy more expensive.” Sam Fankhauser, a professor and deputy director at the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at the London School of Economics, said the move on renewable electricity compromised the effectiveness of the Climate Change Levy as a form of carbon pricing. But he believed a review of green taxes could be constructive: “UK energy taxes can and should be reformed to make them less burdensome for businesses, deliver increased revenues for HM Treasury and reduce carbon emissions more efficiently. For instance, the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme, Climate Change Levy and Climate Change Agreement can be combined into one single instrument.”"
"The Vatican may consider, but is not committed to, divesting its holdings in fossil fuels, a Catholic church official has said, despite Pope Francis’s call for bold action to fight climate change and global warming. The statement – made at a press conference on Wednesday to discuss the pope’s recently released encyclical on the environment – is likely to disappoint climate activists, who have praised Pope Francis’s essay stressing that climate change is mostly a man-made problem.  “I think that the Vatican bank may think of initiatives which are at the core of this change. So we will see in the future ... it [divestment] may be considered by the Vatican,” said Flaminia Giovanelli, a lay woman who serves on the Vatican’s Pontifical Council for Peace and Justice. The hesitancy to act may reflect internal divisions about whether investment decisions by the Institute for Religious Works (IOR)– the official name of the Vatican bank – which has about €6bn (£4.25bn) under management, ought to reflect Pope Francis’s values, particularly ones that might still be considered contentious within the church’s hierarchy. George Pell, the Australian cardinal who serves as the pope’s chief economic minister, is known to be a climate-change denier. In a speech in 2011, he said that “evidence” that had led the scientific community to conclude that the earth is warming was “insufficient to achieve practical certainty on many of these scientific issues”. Naomi Klein, the Canadian climate activist and author who recentlyjoined forces with the Vatican on the issue of climate change and is in Rome for a two-day conference on the encyclical, said she believed that a possible divestment policy was under discussion. “It is my understanding that this is an issue that is being internally debated and that a lot of issues are up for review and this is being raised,” Klein told the Guardian. A spokesman for the Vatican bank, Max Hohenberg, claimed the issue was largely irrelevant because “there really isn’t much to divest”. He said about 95% of the bank’s assets were invested in government bonds, and the rest was invested in stocks held in investment funds, and that he had no knowledge of what specific stocks were held. “If you look at divestment and look at the profile of the institute, you will come to the conclusion as an objective observer that it really does not have much relevance at the IOR,” Hohenberg said.  He added that the bank did not have any social investment policies in place, and that establishing one meant that it would likely be seen as a “model” within the church, “which is obviously quite a big issue”. But Klein told the Guardian that she did not believe that the divestment issue was a “linear market argument”, but rather a moral argument about the “immorality” of investing in fossil fuels. “The encyclical amplifies the moral argument that is a tremendous tool for the divestment movement, no matter what happens at the Vatican,” she said. While some critics argue that divestment policies alone have little to no impact on corporate profits of major polluters, Klein said she believed that divestment in fossil-fuel companies would “set the political stage” for regulatory actions to recapture some of their profits, though a carbon tax or increased royalty payments on extraction. “Once you have said those profits are immoral, then the public has a right to those profits,” she said.  Klein, who is known as a fierce critic of globalisation, acknowledged in a public statement that she was entering an “unlikely alliance” with the Vatican on the climate change issue, but said that the scale of the problem required all sorts of unique pairings. “Inside these coalitions, we don’t agree on everything – not by a long shot. But we understand that the stakes are so high, time is so short and the task is so large that we cannot afford to allow those differences to divide us,” she said. Klein said any deal arranged in a critical December summit in Paris that failed to immediately reduce emissions and provide “real and substantive” support for poor countries would be deemed a “failure” by activists. “To our so-called leaders preparing their pledges for ... Paris, getting out the lipstick and heels to dress up another lousy deal, I have to say this: read the actual encyclical – not the summaries, the whole thing,” Klein said. She called the document “courageous” and said it was making Pope Francis some “powerful enemies”. Klein took a swipe at Barack Obama in her interview with the Guardian, saying that although the US president had made some “great speeches” and introduced some good proposals recently on climate change, his decision to open up the Arctic to drilling by Shell was “wholly incompatible with climate leadership”. She also said she had no “high hopes” for Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic contender in the 2016 race for the White House. “When she was secretary of state she rarely talked about climate change and it was her State Department that was set to rubber stamp Keystone,” she said, referring to the controversial trans-American pipeline. “So, just judging her on her record, I don’t think there is any reason for optimism about Hillary on climate change,” she said. Klein added that she was looking forward to seeing how leading Catholic Republicans who are running for the White House, especially Jeb Bush, would grapple with the climate issue while seeking to appeal to Hispanic voters, who see Pope Francis as a “rock star”. “Watching how Republican candidates navigate seeing a significant and really critical part of their base greet this pope – and how important he is to them – and how they will maintain their position on climate change ... I mean, I’m looking forward to seeing how they dance,” she said. While Catholic politicians in the US – on the left and the right – have comfortably held positions that oppose the church, on issues ranging from abortion to capital punishment and gay rights, Klein said she believed that Republicans could no longer be as dismissive of the climate change issue as they were in previous elections. “You are already seeing a slightly more serious tone, at least from Jeb Bush,” she said."
"The Abbott government’s energy white paper made headlines for its curious reluctance to mention climate change – but the looming defence white paper may prove to be a different story. A report on community consultations associated with the defence white paper flags the consequences of climate change, extreme weather events and environmental pressures as a significant security risk for Australia – second only to the risks posed by terrorism.  “Many people suggested [climate change] would lead to an increased need for humanitarian and disaster relief activities, including by armed forces,” the report released on Wednesday said. “Some people also noted that climate change and resource stresses, such as food and water shortages, could drive unregulated cross-border movements of people.” The consultations also unearthed “considerable interest in evolving the ADF [Australian defence force] to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and manage its environmental impact.” “That interest was not confined to environmental groups, and such efforts were viewed as being not only good management of resources, but also likely to improve the ADF’s operational flexibility and survivability.” The Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s executive director, Peter Jennings, who oversaw the consultation process, said recognising the impact of climate change did not actually require anyone to “take a position on the causes of climate change”. It was a simple strategic calculation, and one the defence white paper needed to grapple with. “I think our thinking here is simply to say that defence needs to make sure it’s able to manage, as it were, strategic consequences of climate change,” Jennings told Guardian Australia on Wednesday. “Even if we don’t need to take a position on the causes of climate change we do need to understand how defence forces might be called upon to respond to effects which are the products of climate change. That’s something that needs to be addressed in the white paper context.” Jennings said defence force personnel were often required to help respond to extreme climate events in Australia such as floods, bushfires and cyclones. “Again, the question is, if we’re seeing these extreme weather events – put to one side the cause of these things - we do need to have adequate defence plans in place to respond to them.” Labor’s defence white paper in 2013 acknowledged the effects of climate change and associated resource pressures could increase the risk of insecurity and conflict. Wednesday’s consultation paper also flags interest in Australia acquiring nuclear-propelled submarines. “A few people suggested that, even if Australia was committed to a conventional submarine to replace the Collins class, work should begin soon on the national infrastructure to support a subsequent nuclear-powered submarine by mid century.” The idea of Australia acquiring nuclear powered submarines, and establishing a domestic industry to support such a fleet, has been kicked around in Canberra since the mid 2000s. Jennings said previous defence white papers had stated opposition to nuclear propulsion, and the government needed to explain its rationale in more detail. “I think people are looking to try and understand why [the option has been ruled out],” he said. “I think part of the argument is there is probably not a broad community acceptance at this stage and we don’t have the right infrastructure – civilian or military – to support it.”"
"The phrase “TV event of the week” seems to have pointlessly malleable applicability. Assemble a good-looking dessert or sing a song slightly better (or worse) than most people could, and TV executives feel entitled to out-hyperbole the internet. Heaven forbid someone in the middle of a karaoke session should knock out a decent crème brûlée: it would probably be met with more excitement than the sodding moon landing.  Australian viewers watching a pudding that moves over on Ten this week might have had their attention briefly drawn away to When Attenborough Met Obama on ABC1: admittedly just two men chatting in chairs, but certainly more of an “event” than most shows can claim to be. As a starter for a full series, it was prohibitively impressive. Next episode: When Noam Chomsky Met The Ghost of Kennedy? Probably just as well it was a one-off. The statesman’s and naturalist’s conversation mostly focused on environmental issues, such as climate change and the damage being done to the Great Barrier Reef. </open News Corp mode> Pah! Typical left-wing luvvy undergraduates! Not surprised the ABC broadcast this factual nonsense </close News Corp mode> It’s sad in a way that Attenborough’s career has lasted long enough to necessitate his emergence as an activist. At one time he could almosthave been considered old-hat – someone only your parents watched – but as time has snuffed it, and much of the planet too, his relevance has only increased.  Attenborough has done a reverse Top Gear, a show that has staggered from the realm of edgy into the truly fuddy-duddy. As our collective complicity in Mother Nature’s knackered organs became clear, Top Gear began to look as cool as a broken petrol pump at an all-day dad joke festival. Obama wasn’t quite up to scratch as an interviewer, managing a tired smile for most of the meeting, but not much more. He seemed distracted and forlorn at points but perhaps it’s not surprising. It must be hard to muster enthusiasm in front of an octogenarian getting excited about slugs when, after this, you know you’ve got to go to a meeting and order a drone-strike. I imagine a sleep-deprived Jack Bauer would have struggled to interview Steve Irwin for the same reasons. Overall, though, it was a riveting 35 minutes, using Attenborough’s birthday (and longevity) as a hook to explore humankind’s ongoing impact on the world. Just as well he got to spend his special day at the White House.  I’m not sure When Attenborough Met Abbott would have been quite as informative. Attenborough would have found his passion for nature extinguished by a PM who thinks coal is good for humanity and windfarms not just aesthetically awful but bad for your health too. Perplexed and terrified, Attenborough would have ended the exchange with a caterwaul as he dived through a window. Thank goodness outside Australia there are more level-headed countries where this sort of TV event is met with a warm reception. Over here, the mere act of confronting anyone in cabinet with an expert who’s grounded in reality would probably be regarded as some sort of communist stunt."

"The world is in the midst of a tall building boom, with more skyscrapers being built now than ever before. From the outside, these towers present the epitome of the modern city, combining weird and wonderful forms with seemingly endless curtain-wall glazing. But scratch below the surface and you find essentially the same steel or concrete structure that supported the first skyscrapers in 19th century New York and Chicago.  However, this could be set to change through the reinvention of one of our oldest construction materials – timber.  These developments are being led by Vancouver architect Michael Green and his proposal for the tallest timber-supported tower in the world – a 35-storey skyscraper that forms part of a six-tower development called Baobab in Paris. The building would be over three times taller than the world’s current tallest timber building, the ten-storey Forté Apartments in Melbourne, and the UK’s tallest, the nine-story Stadthaus. Other 30-storey-plus wooden towers are planned in Stockholm, Vancouver and Vienna. While the idea of timber towers may conjure up visions of multi-storey Swiss chalets, or high-rise log-cabins, these skyscrapers are not the traditional timber-framed buildings we’re used to seeing. Instead, the designs take advantage of recent innovations in “mass wood” to create vast solid timber panels that can support buildings to a much taller height than ordinary wood can. Green’s Baobab uses Cross Laminated Timber, or CLT. This consists of several layers of timber board glued together at 90 degrees to form large structural sheets up to 40cm thick. The cross-lamination provides the material’s dimensional stability and strength. For the Baobab project, CLT sheets would be manufactured and cut to exact sizes before being transported to site. Sheets can then be lifted into place and screwed together like a giant piece of IKEA furniture. “Their manufacture is very accurate, there’s very little work that needs to be done on site,” said Green. “Because of this, construction will be very quick. Someday I’d like to make a building where all you need is a giant allen key to put it together.” Baobab’s structure consists of a series of these solid timber walls that travel the full height of the tower, along with timber columns and a central timber “core” housing elevators and stairs. However, not all of the structure is timber. Steel beams are used to provide additional strength and flexibility to resist sideways force from the wind, while concrete is used in the foundations and ground floor to provide a stable base for construction. “We’re not trying to throw away concrete and steel – we’re trying to adjust the proportions, and increase the amount of timber” notes Green. So what’s behind this shift? “The fundamental reason for me is climate change,” said Green. “We’re taking two materials - steel and concrete - that have high carbon footprints, and replacing them with a low-energy material.” While the use of sustainable materials in construction is not new, the current battle for a more environmentally-friendly built environment focuses almost entirely on attempts to reduce the energy we use when operating our buildings: heating, cooling and lighting them. But buildings contribute to carbon emissions before they’ve even been occupied, from the mining of iron ore to create a steel beam, to the energy required to lift that beam into place on site. It is only recently that we’ve started to grasp the huge contribution the energy used to create materials plays in a building’s carbon footprint. For example, according to a report by the Royal Institute of Chartered Engineers, the carbon embodied in building materials will make up 45% of a typical modern office block’s carbon footprint. Concrete and steel are huge contributors to this. The production of cement – the primary ingredient in concrete - is responsible for 5% of all man-made CO2 emissions (to put this into perspective, the aviation industry is responsible for between 2 and 2.5%). Add to this the fact that high-rise are more material hungry than most due to the extra structure required to resist stresses from wind and earthquakes, and there is a real need to change the way towers are built. Green is convinced timber is the solution, and not just because it is a low-energy material, but because it acts as a “carbon sink”.  Trees absorb CO2 through photosynthesis. When they die and decompose, or are burnt, this CO2 is released. Green believes we need to better manage this carbon-cycle, by harvesting trees early in their life and using the timber to create our cities. This, he says, would capture carbon within our buildings, whilst also creating a greater economic demand for wood, leading to more trees being planted, and more CO2 absorbed. “If we manage our forests, if we harvest trees carefully, we can actually capture carbon as a building material. Then we can replant the trees.” He said. Through this method, suggests Green, the timber used in Baobab would store an estimated 3,700 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide.  The problem with Green’s theory is that if we dispose of or burn the timber structure at the end of the building’s life, all the sequestered carbon is released. But here too, Green has a solution: disassembly and reuse. The prefabricated construction of the building can be reversed once it is no longer needed, with the tower dismantled, and the CLT sheets used in other buildings. “The timber products we’re using have a real financial value. When these buildings have finished their life, I can imagine the salvaging of these materials for generations. I expect them to last for centuries.” Predicting how we might use materials decades from now is challenging. But even so, we can envision a scenario at some point in the future where these timber panels would be disposed of, and their captured carbon released. Even taking this into account timber has other environmental benefits. A timber tower would be far lighter than a concrete one, which would mean less material is required in the foundations.  While timber makes a compelling case environmentally, we all know that wood burns, while steel and concrete do not, raising questions about its safety. However, there’s a huge difference in terms of physical properties between mass timber, such as CLT, and the lightweight timber frames that are perceived as being susceptible to fire. When mass timber is exposed to fire, the outer layer starts to burn and form charcoal. The charcoal layer forms a protective barrier, soaking up heat and insulating the interior timber. As exposure to fire increases, this layer grows, creating even more insulation, and further slowing the burning rate. In timber towers the thickness of the charcoal layer that would form in a fire can be predicted. To protect the structural integrity of the timber, this same thickness of wood can be added to the CLT sheets. This would form a sacrificial timber barrier which would char in a fire, and in doing so, protect the material within. “It’s mother nature doing what she does best,” says David Barber, a principal fire protection engineer at Arup in Washington DC, and an author on a report on the fire safety challenges of wood tall buildings. “In the aftermath of a forest fire you’ll see trunks of trees that are black and charred. The timber inside the charcoal layer is still alive – after a fire you will see regeneration. This is the same physical property we utilise in timber towers.” Somewhat unexpectedly this even puts mass timber at an advantage against steel in terms of fire resistance. Steel starts to lose some of its structural strength at around 550 – 600C (1022-1112F). Since typical fires burn at between 800 and 1000C (1472-1832F), steel buildings require fire protection. This can take the form of intumescent paint, which swells when exposed to heat, or other insulating materials such as gypsum or concrete cladding. “CLT doesn’t need fire protection. The thickness and inherent mass of the wood provides the performance. This gives you an inherent reliability,” notes Barber. While Green’s 35-storey Baobab may become the world’s tallest timber tower it is unlikely to stay so for long. Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, architects of the world’s current tallest skyscraper, the 163-storey Burj Khalifa in Dubai, have designed a theoretical 42-storey timber tower in Chicago. This would be supported by a hybrid structural system of solid timber walls and floors with supplementary concrete beams. They’ve shown this hybrid system would reduce the building material carbon footprint by 60 – 75%, as compared to a concrete-only structure. “This composite system has no theoretical height limit,” suggests Benton Johnson of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill and lead investigator on the study. “In practice, the limiting factor on height will be the economics of the project or municipal restrictions.” Green has similarly lofty ambitions. He’s currently undertaking research to explore whether the 110-storey Empire State Building in New York could have been constructed with a timber structure, instead of steel. His solution, like Skidmore, Owings and Merrill’s proposal, is a hybrid system combining mass timber alongside steel and concrete. “One of the unique problems with wood buildings is we need to keep the columns a bit closer together than you’d usually expect in a tall building,” he said. “The columns in the Empire State Building are already close together. If we replace these with wood we absolutely could build to 110 storeys.” Green’s Empire State Building redesign also includes replacing the exterior brickwork with hollow timber sections, allowing for steel tension rods to run the height of the tower, in order to provide stability and reduce sway. The research is only conceptual at the moment, suggests Green, but such heights are unlikely to be realised in the near future. Regardless, he is convinced that timber is the material that will transform skylines around the world. “When I said seven years ago we could build three storeys with wood people thought I was crazy. Today we’re seeing timber tower proposals every month.” "
"Thousands of campaigners and religious leaders have marched through Rome, backing Pope Francis’s uncompromising environmental message ahead of a Vatican conference on climate change, and urging world leaders to take action. Holy See officials will this week discuss the environment with activists and scientists at a meeting at which Naomi Klein, a prominent social activist, will take centre stage alongside Cardinal Peter Turkson, one of the pontiff’s most senior aides.  Soon after the release of Pope Francis’s encyclical on the environment, regarded as a landmark intervention in the global climate change debate, campaigners on Sunday travelled to Rome from across the globe to thank the Argentinian pontiff for his papal letter.  In the encyclical, Francis directed sharp criticism at global leaders for their failure to combat climate change. It was greeted with a hugely positive response from environmentalists, who have seized on the pope’s message ahead of a United Nations climate change conference to be held in Paris in December. The UN summit is aimed at reaching a global deal on climate change, but as the pontiff noted, previous meetings have ended in disappointment, with decision-making paralysed by disagreements. Alongside Klein and Turkson, the conservation group WWF has been invited to this week’s Vatican conference and had a strong presence at the rally on Sunday, described as a “historic event” by Samantha Smith, leader of the organisation’s global climate and energy initiative. “We have seen that climate change is such a big and important issue that you can’t solve it in a corner with environmental groups,” Smith said. “That’s why the mobilisation of people of faith, including the Catholic church, is so important.” Activists at the One Earth, One Family event broke through the silence enveloping early-morning Rome with singing and chanting, waving paper birds high over the central Piazza Farnese before marching to the Vatican. “The reason we are here is to thank Pope Francis, but above all it is to bring a message to the people and politicians on the Paris climate change conference – to make strong, ambitious and binding commitments,” said Andrea Stocchiero, from the voluntary group Focsiv, co-organiser of the event. While a few hundred people began the multifaith march, holding banners and sheltering from the sun under giant paper leaves, organisers said about 5,000 were present at the end of the march in St Peter’s Square. There, Francis exhorted a multifaith effort to help protect the environment. “I encourage the collaboration between persons and associations of different religions on behalf of an integral ecology,” he said. Among them was Yeb Saño, the Philippines’ former chief climate change negotiator at the UN, who is now a spiritual ambassador for the march co-organisers, OurVoices, a multifaith environmental group. Saño praised the pontiff for his “courage and leadership” and said the march represented “a particularly amazing day to celebrate”. “We know that the adverse impacts of climate change are hitting the Philippines and it’s unfair, because we have very little contribution to the causes of climate change and we are at the receiving end of it,” he said. Pope Francis visited the predominantly Catholic country in January, little over a year after a devastating typhoon killed thousands of people in the Philippines. The November 2013 storm was the strongest recorded to hit land and was seen as an example of the archipelago’s vulnerability to the elements. The pope’s encyclical was released five months after his Asia trip. While Pope Francis has ensured Catholic voices reach the centre of the climate change debate, organisers of the Rome march were keen to fulfil his wish of going beyond the Christian faith. Kiran Bali, who travelled from Yorkshire in the UK on behalf of the Hindu community, said it was imperative that religious leaders such as herself get involved. “It’s so clear that the world is at a crucial tipping point due to climate change and it’s so important that faith leaders take action on this important issue,” she said. “Now is the time to unite, to come together and to really make a difference to protect the earth from further destruction.” Representing the global Anglican community, David Moxon said a global response was necessary as ultimately all would be affected by climate change. “The challenge facing Europe and all of the industrialised and industrialising world is very important – we’re going to choke or cook unless we do something about it,” he said. Massimiliano Pasqui, from the Institute of Biometeorology at Italy’s National Research Council, said the bel paese has even greater reason than its neighbours to act on climate change. “For us in Italy – in the middle of the Mediterranean – we’re in one of the most vulnerable places. It’s necessary for us to build strategies because in respect to other countries in northern Europe, what we are up against has a bigger impact on our society.”"

"The UK’s Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) faces cuts of 90% to its staff budgets within three years, threatening the government’s ability to tackle climate change and move the energy supply to cleaner sources, according to an expert analysis. Former energy secretary Ed Davey told the Guardian that cutting Decc’s head count so dramatically would damage economic growth and undermine private investment. The finding by the politically-neutral environmental thinktank the Green Alliance came as eight leading energy academics wrote to Oliver Letwin, the minister in charge of the cabinet office, to express concern that the cuts could undermine the UK’s ability to deliver climate policy.  Ring-fencing of health, education and development budgets means other departments face an average cut of 11.6% over the next five years, with the steepest cuts expected at the start of the parliament.  Green Alliance estimated that once officially and unofficially protected spending was taken into account – including nuclear cleanup costs, liabilities over old coal and capital spending – cuts would leave the department with just £40m by 2018-19 for so-called resource spending, which largely consists of staff costs. That budget is £402m in 2014-15.  “You have to have internal expertise, you have to have some troops in the department able to interpret ministers’ words,” said Matthew Spencer, Green Alliance’s director. “If you end up with a dumbed-down department you get a bad deal for consumers and citizens.”  Davey said: “The main effect of slashing the headcount at Decc will be cutting economic growth and undermining private sector investment. It is Osbornomics at its worst.” He said the department was an “economic powerhouse” for the UK, with energy infrastructure investment dwarfing investments in transport, communications and water combined. The analysis said that reductions in staff spending could be a false economy, because a lack of expertise might lead to overspending on nuclear and renewable energy, funded by levies on household energy bills, which would drive up the cost of decarbonising the energy supply.  Spencer said it was “a small department with a big impact on the British economy” and it “determines pretty much the future of the UK energy infrastructure”. The department’s total budget is around £4bn a year. He added: “Decc has two big peculiarities in its budget. It has huge historical liabilities, principally from nuclear industry, which is not officially protected but it’s hard not to spend money on keeping nuclear waste safe. Secondly, Decc has a much bigger capital spend [than some departments], and government has said it’s going to protect capital spending.” He said the department could ditch a key part of its capital spending – £1bn on its books for a demonstration carbon capture and storage (CCS) plant – but that would mean jettisoning one of the “three legs” of UK energy policy, which are renewable energy, nuclear and CCS. The analysis comes three days after the government’s statutory climate advisers warned that there was doubt in how government policies would help meet the UK’s post-2020 carbon targets. Decc has already said it will cut £70m this year from its £4bn annual budget, mainly on schemes designed to help people save energy at home.  In the letter to Letwin, signatories including Jim Watson of the UK Energy Research Centre, Catherine Mitchell of the University of Exeter, and Paul Ekins at University College London warned of higher household energy bills for consumers if Decc’s budget was cut too far. “Costs to consumers from energy policy are likely to be higher, and energy supply less secure, if government does not protect its in-house expertise to negotiate contracts with the energy industry, to complete energy market reform, and to develop new energy saving programmes for the most vulnerable customers,” they wrote.  They added that it was “vital that government protects its impressive track record in climate diplomacy”. In November and December, the UK and nearly 200 other governments meet at a UN climate summit in Paris in attempt to seal a new deal on post-2020 action on carbon emissions. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to lay out the details of Decc’s settlement in his emergency budget next Wednesday. A Decc spokesman said: “Through making savings from underspends last year we have been able to protect spend on priority areas for 2015/16 including keeping the lights on and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Decc budget will be set out by the Chancellor and any estimates before that are pure speculation.”  "
"Regulating companies on their environmental performance is not anti-business, the chairman of the government’s committee on climate change has said, but is what companies want as they seek clarity in making their investments. Lord Deben, former Conservative environment minister and now chairman of the committee set up to be statutory advisors to ministers on how to meet the UK’s emissions targets, said that as a businessman, he and others wanted clear and fair regulation on green issues. This is in contrast with the view of the Chancellor, George Osborne, who has described green rules as a “burden” on the economy.  “It’s very important to understand that business wants proper regulation,” he told a meeting of the all-party parliamentary environment group on Wednesday. But he said that successive governments had failed to recognise this. “This is not about a single political party but all political parties do not get this. I’ve been in business all my life. We in the business community need to bring this back to government, to make government understand.” He said the role of government was to make the rules fair, and allow businesses to compete in a free market, by regulating for a level playing field. For instance, he said, “subsidies” for renewable energy were actually a means of taking into account the true costs of fossil fuels, on health and the environment, which fossil fuel companies do not have to pay. “This is not a free market,” he insisted. “The market we happen to have is very significantly twisted.” Deben also called for a return to cross-party consensus on environmental issues, particularly climate change. “Consensus is a crucial party of what we do on the environment and climate change. When people try to take control [of the green agenda] and slag off other parties, [that harms progress on the issue].” He pointed to the Climate Change Act, under which the committee on climate change was set up to advise ministers on meeting greenhouse gas targets, as a key example of cross-party consensus. The Act was passed with support from all the main parties, and with only a handful of dissenting MPs. He warned that the environment should not be seen as “something out there, outside us” but as an eco-system of which we are a part, and he called for an international perspective in which the UK should take on its “moral duty” to assist other countries in tackling the ravages of global warming.  “If we trade [with other countries] then we have a responsibility,” he told an audience of parliamentarians and businesses. “If we ask people to produce things, then we have a responsibility. That is the truth and we cannot avoid it.” With a crunch conference on climate change taking place late this year in Paris, such an international approach would be “crucial”, he said. “Why do governments fail to understand that the way to do this [cutting emissions and dealing with green issues] in the most cost-effective manner is to do it now? They need to set the example, and stop saying “after you Claude”.” Deben also defended the importance of environmental issues to any government agenda, instead of being overlooked. “Far from being at the edge of everything, this is at the centre of everything. I hope this government understands that.” Huw Irranca-Davies, the Labour MP who is the incoming chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, one of the key select committees scrutinising the government’s green record, agreed: “This is a pro-business agenda.” Nick Hurd, Conservative MP, said: “It’s been very important to have a cross-party consensus on this agenda, though you constantly need to test the boundaries. The next few years will be critical.”"
"Mark Carney has called for companies to disclose their carbon footprints to help investors to make clearer decisions about whether or not to back them. London has a responsibility to lead if the age of irresponsibility is over. “One of the best things that can be done is disclosure of carbon footprint,” the Bank of England governor said in response to a question at a conference in London. It is not the first time Bank officials have intervened on the subject of climate change and its impact on businesses. Paul Fisher, the deputy head of its regulatory arm, said in March that insurance companies could be hit if their investments in fossil fuels ended up being worthless. He described such assets as potentially “stranded” if policy changes limited the use of fossil fuels. At a World Bank meeting a year ago, Carney said the vast majority of fossil fuel reserves may be unburnable if the world was to limit temperature rises to 2C. Such restrictions could send shockwaves through the financial markets. Carney, speaking at a conference on inclusive capitalism, said investors needed information on carbon footprints to make judgments about companies. A year ago, Carney told delegates at the same conference that capitalism risked destroying itself unless bankers realised they had an obligation to create a fairer society. He developed his thoughts on cleaning up City behaviour in his Mansion House speech this month when he said the “age of irresponsibility” was coming to end. He called for maximum jail terms for market abuse to be raised to 10 years from seven, and the offence widened to include foreign exchange and bond markets.  He told his audience on Friday: “London has a responsibility to lead if the age of irresponsibility is over. London is about markets. This is about London stepping up.” The Bank is holding an open forum in the autumn to discuss the changes to the regulation of foreign exchange and bond markets, in which meddling has led to a wave of fines since the 2008 financial crisis.  While firms had been hit with fines totalling $150bn (£96bn) since the crisis, individuals have got away relatively scot-free, Carney said.  “A lot of people in these markets didn’t really know, and probably still do not know, what is expected of them because it hasn’t been adequately defined in everyday language,” he said.   The industry is in the process, of drawing up a new code of conduct, overseen by the Bank, intended to change that.  Carney said markets could only grow if they had a social licence to do so. “These markets will not sustain themselves unless they have integrity,” he said. "
"Climate change is compounding existing threats to Australia’s forests, wetlands and deserts, with several key landscapes now at risk of total collapse, a landmark series of new studies have found. An assessment of 13 ecosystems across Australia, ranging from the wet tropics of far north Queensland to rare shrubland in Western Australia, found what researchers call a “worrying” climate change impact that adds to existing harm caused by urban development, agriculture and invasive species.  The research is the first of its kind to assess Australian ecosystems based on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s benchmark Red List criteria which has, until recently, focused on the status of individual animal and plant species rather than whole landscapes. Under the Red List criteria, eight of the studied Australian ecosystems would be classified as “endangered” or “critically endangered”, with just the Lake Eyre wetlands considered in the “least concern” category.  Professor David Keith of the University of NSW, who led the international team to expand the Red List to ecosystems, said the Australian study, which he also led, shows that climate change is leaving its imprint on vast swaths of the environment. “The overall picture is one of increasing risk,” he told Guardian Australia. “Climate change is amplifying other threats. It’s the most pervasive threat because it cuts across everything, whereas habitat loss and diseases are specific to individual systems. It’s very worrying.” Changes in the climate – Australia has warmed by nearly 1C over the past 100 years – are having a variety of effects, the research published in Austral Ecology found.  A decline in rainfall in south-west Western Australia is threatening incredibly diverse but rare shrublands that require moisture during a crucial window for seedlings during the year. Meanwhile, forests perched on the mountains of Lord Howe Island are drying out because the damp clouds that envelop them are becoming sparser. A separate study of an area of Antarctica shows that sea sponges could lose out to algae if sea ice thins, increasing the amount of sunlight that enters their marine environment. Ecosystems face other threats – for example, the wet tropics have become fragmented due to land clearing for cane sugar farming and other industries. This means that cassowaries, which are crucial to dispersing seeds and maintaining plant diversity, have less space to roam and are increasingly being killed by cars or having their young picked off by predators. “Our ecosystems are become more simple, they are losing species, which reduces these systems’ resilience to change,” Keith said.  “In some cases it’s due to changes in land use, such as the clearing of woodland, and in others it’s invasive species, such as water mould, goats, deer, cats and foxes.  “Native herbivores are being taken out, which means that ecosystem tasks such as the turning over of soils isn’t being done. This has cascading effects – species that aren’t directly impacted [on] find they can’t persist because they can’t reproduce.” This decline has a direct impact upon humans as well as other affected species, Keith said, citing the Cumberland plain woodland system near Sydney. “This woodland has been extensively cleared for grazing and cropping to the extent that just 10% of its area remains,” he said. “The native mammals have become extinct and there are sustained declines in the bird species. The system is at a point where it’s almost starting to consume itself, it’s collapsing. “Apart from the intrinsic values of nature, urban areas need open spaces to keep populations sane and healthy. That, essentially, is what we are losing. “The rate of decline in Australia is up there among the worst in the world. We need to turn that around. That said, the major threats have been operating for a relatively short time on a global scale, around the last 150 years, so there’s still a lot to work with.” The research comprised of making detailed assessments over the extent of an ecosystem and then analysing the trends of key species within the area.  Australia contains more than 5% of the world’s plants and animals, with 87% of them endemic, meaning they aren’t found anywhere else on Earth. However, Australia has one of the worst extinction records in the world, with 50 species vanishing in the past 200 years, including 27 mammal species. Alongside climate change, habitat loss remains a challenge in Australia despite land-clearing laws slowing historical removals. WWF estimates that between 3m hectares and 6m hectares of rainforest and temperate forest, mainly stretching across New South Wales and Queensland, could be lost between 2010 and 2030 on current trends."
"The world’s fossil fuel companies risk wasting billions of dollars of investment by not taking global action to fight climate change seriously, according to the chief economist of the International Energy Agency (IEA). Fatih Birol, who will take the top job at the IEA in September and is one of the world’s most influential voices on energy, warned that companies making this mistake would also miss out on investment opportunities in clean energy.  Coal giant Peabody recently dismissed global warming as “an environmental crisis predicted by flawed computer models”, while another major coal producer Glencore Xstrata said governments would fail to implement measures to cut carbon emissions, as has oil and gas major ExxonMobil. Birol, speaking at a major climate science conference in Paris ahead of a crunch UN summit in the city in December, said: “We see some moves from energy companies in the direction of sustainable development. However, it is not at the level you would like to see. If they think that their businesses are immune to the impacts of climate policy, they are making a strategic mistake.” “Any energy company in the world, whatever they do - oil, gas, renewables, efficiency, coal - climate policies will impact their business,” said Birol. “So in order not to make the wrong investment decisions, in terms of making the investment decisions which may not bring the right returns, or in terms of missing investment opportunities, businesses may need to take climate policies and the impact for their businesses more seriously. Without solving the carbon [emissions] in the energy sector, we have no chance to solve the climate change problem.” The World Bank and Bank of England have already warned of the serious risk climate action poses to trillions of dollars of fossil fuel investments and the G20 is investigating the risks. The think-tank Carbon Tracker has estimated that over $1tn (£0.6tn) of oil investments and $280bn of gas investments would be left uneconomic if the world’s governments succeed in their pledge to limitglobal warming to 2C. Birol said there was some cause for optimism in tackling climate change, with increasing renewables, energy efficiency and action in China helping to curb emissions. But Professor Ottmar Edenhofer, chief economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said: “Emissions are rising and rising and rising, with an increasing growth rate over the last decade.” Edenhofer warned of a “global coal renaissance”, particularly in fast-growing poor nations. He said six of the 10 fastest growing carbon emitters are from sub-saharan Africa, led by Congo, Benin and Angola. He said that, even if technology to capture and store carbon on a large scale is developed, two-thirds of all coal resources and a third of all oil and gas would have to be kept in the ground to limit climate change to 2C. Without carbon capture and storage, 90% of coal and two-thirds of oil and gas would have to remain buried. Edenhofer said this would not happen without a global price being put on carbon pollution. “As a Catholic, I believe in miracles, but I do not rely on them,” he said. “We need carbon prices to reflect the most limited resource of the 21st century – the limited disposal space for CO2 in the atmosphere.”  He said national leaders often saw taxing carbon as “political suicide” but he argued that they needed to recognise the positive impact the revenues generated by carbon taxes could have. “Even just removing fossil fuel subsidies would allow us to provide universal access to clean water and electricity in parts of the world,” he said. Professor Frank Geels, from the University of Manchester, told the Paris conference that many technological transitions involve “creative destruction”, with new businesses replacing old ones.  “But we have not focused enough on the destruction part. The fossil fuel companies are some of the most powerful companies in the world and it is going to be very difficult to persuade them to keep it in the ground, but not impossible,” he said. “In many transitions you need to compensate the losers, or they will fight tooth and nail.” Geels cited the example of the Dutch government paying for workers in closing coal mines to be retrained. Professor Ken Caldeira, at the Carnegie Institution for Science in California, said the public were vital to forcing the transition to clean energy.  “Politicians do not lead, they follow,” he said. “We need to reach a social tipping point where people do not think it is OK to build another smokestack. It is only when the average person does not think it is OK that change happens.” He said there were instances of such changes in social acceptability, including the introduction of gay marriage in the US and abolition of slavery."

"The Coalition’s emissions reduction fund is likely to cut Australia’s greenhouse gases by about 11% by 2025, far less than the expected target the government is soon to unveil, according to a new analysis. The $2.55bn in the emissions reduction fund, the centrepiece of the Coalition’s direct action climate plan, could be exhausted within 18 months, rendering the policy toothless unless further money is committed, energy market analysts RepuTex said.  Under its current arrangements, RepuTex estimates the fund will help Australia reduce its emissions by just 11% by 2025, based on 2000 levels. This is well below the expected post-2020 emissions reduction target set to be announced by the Coalition, even though it is unlikely to commit to the 36% cut in emissions by 2025, on 2005 levels, recommended by the independent Climate Change Authority. Currently, Australia has a minimum goal of a 5% cut in emissions by 2020, based on 2000 levels. Countries are formulating post-2020 targets before key climate change talks in Paris later this year. The emissions reduction fund, which replaced the scrapped carbon pricing system, works by paying businesses that wish to reduce their emissions. According to an analysis of carbon abatement opportunities across six key sectors, such as energy and agriculture, RepuTex found that a reduction of just 280 million tonnes was “realistically attainable” in Australia by 2025, under the fund. In April, the first auction paid out $660.4m to businesses in order to prevent 47 million tonnes of emissions being emitted. Federal environment minister Greg Hunt said the auction was a “stunning outcome” although it has emerged that 107 of the 144 funded projects were already operating under a previous scheme.  Bret Harper, head of research at RepuTex, said the emissions reduction fund “probably isn’t of sufficient size to get us to the 2020 target, let alone a post-2020 target.” “There just aren’t the opportunities to get us to that goal, we will need additional policies to get there, we just can’t get there with the current policy,” he said.  “There’s no talk of further money being provided for the fund so we expect it will be exhausted within 12 to 18 months. “The current policy doesn’t constrain emissions growth. It’s an incentive-only scheme that has little influence on emissions. There are far greater factors. Changes in agriculture or mining, for instance, would swamp anything the emissions reduction fund does.” Harper said the climate plan was further hindered by an “ineffective” safeguards system. The safeguards component is intended to prevent emissions rising elsewhere in the economy, thereby negating the offset emissions. Emissions standards will be set for about 140 companies from July next year, although these “baselines” will be flexible if a business wants to expand its operations. “The government could enhance the renewable energy target further or they could apply a carbon price,” Harper said. “The most obvious thing is to use the safeguard mechanism and tighten the screws across the board.” Hunt’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment on RepuTex’s analysis."
"Rich countries are very, very far from raising the billions they promised to help poor countries fight climate change, jeopardising the prospects of reaching a global warming deal at Paris, the world’s rising economies warned. As a key United Nations meeting got underway, Brazil, China, India and South Africa said they were disappointed in rich countries’ failure to make good on a promise six years ago to mobilise $100bn a year by 2020 for climate finance.  The funds, intended to help developing countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for sea-level rises, extreme weather and other consequences of climate change, are seen as a crucial element to reaching a global warming agreement at the end of the year. Monday’s high-level meeting of the UN general assembly – including an appearance from Robert Redford – was intended to help build momentum for a Paris deal that would keep warming to 2C, the internationally agreed limit to avoid dangerous climate change. But some of the key players among the 193 countries taking part in the negotiations – and two of the world’s biggest carbon polluters in India and China – say they are frustrated with rich countries’ failure to come up with a clear plan for raising the cash to fight climate change. By some estimates, there is less than $20bn a year in public finance making its way to developing countries for climate action – or less than a fifth of the $100bn target. “We will say that that is very, very far from what has to be mobilised by the year 2020,” Edna Molewa, South Africa’s environment minister, said. “It is important therefore that this scaling up happens … there is still a lot of money that is required.” Rich countries have been promising since 2009 to help rising economies develop technologies to cut greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change and protect their people from consequences of climate change. But a joint statement from the four countries expressed “disappointment over the continued lack of any clear road map to provide $100bn per year by 2020, as well as on substantially scaling up financial support after 2020”. Climate finance has been a major sticking point in negotiations for a global warming deal at Paris. The last round of negotiations, in Bonn earlier this month, ground along without really managing to zero in on the key components of a deal. There is widespread recognition that rich countries will need to help developing countries, which did the least to cause climate change, but will suffer the most severe consequences. “If rich countries can show they are making good on their $100bn promise, there will be a much stronger foundation of trust for the Paris talks,” said Tim Gore, Oxfam’s international climate adviser. “We need to see real funding increases.” But it’s unclear how much rich countries will pay, and to whom. Developing countries are also pushing rich countries to make more funds available for future protections against climate change – not just cutting greenhouse gas emissions. But by Oxfam’s estimates, just $2.5bn to $4.5bn of current climate finance is going towards climate protection measures. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa are already spending about $5bn from their own budgets to prepare for climate change – much more than they were receiving in climate finance from rich countries, according to Oxfam. The four countries said they were working hard to try to put a climate deal in place, but that finance was a crucial element to reaching an agreement. “There is still a clear expectation and so I hope the developing countries can fulfill their commitment before the Paris meeting,” Xie Zhenhua, China’s climate change envoy, said. “We need to avoid what happened in Copenhagen”, which failed to reach a comprehensive climate deal, Izabella Teixeira, Brazil’s environment minister said. But the four countries made it clear developing countries could not be expected to cut greenhouse gas emissions without help. “Without the flow of technical support … it will be impossible to move onto any such trajectory in the near future,” said Ravi Prasad, India’s climate change negotiator."
"Pakistan’s commitment to tackling climate change is a “joke” lacking proper funding and support from government officials, says cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan.  In an exclusive interview with RTCC, Khan praised the creation of a national climate change ministry, but questioned the level of support allocated to it by prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s administration.  “They (the federal government) need to back it up with supportive funding and capacity, which are both missing,” he said. “The paltry funds allocated to the ministry of climate change this year are a joke. “It actually shows the totally ridiculous and confused priorities of the government which is hell bent upon wasting public finances on extravagant schemes like green and yellow taxis, freebie laptops and building the Guinness world record for the most expensive metros in the world.” According to the latest budget, funding for the climate ministry is 39.752m rupees (£250,000). Khan is chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, which governs the northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and he harbours ambitions to become the next prime minister of Pakistan. The government’s priorities need to be redirected towards issues which are directly impacting people, such as climate change, and not driven by the urge to feed what he described as corrupt mafias. Instead, he suggested the government should focus on capitalising on the large renewable resources of green energy, such as hydro, solar, wind and nuclear, to end the energy crisis. “In addition we need to reverse our fast-depleting forest resources – which we are doing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. All of this is sensible development for Pakistan and provides global climate mitigation measures for the world,” Khan said. Pakistan is one of nearly 200 countries working on plans for a global climate deal, to be signed off this year and to come into force from 2020. The government has yet to submit its contribution to this deal, and Khan stressed the need to emphasise how it is suffering from what he termed “climate injustice” at the hands of rich and most-polluting countries. “Rich countries should not only assist Pakistan in mitigation and adaptation efforts but also compensate us for the tremendous economic losses we face each year,” he said. Adapting to climate change is an issue of life and death for Pakistan, he said, “we need to create a focused adaptation plan to deal with climate-related disasters and also invest in climate-resilient infrastructure development in the country.” Human cost The country’s epic floods of 2010 led to the deaths of 1,985 people, displacing 18 million people and damaging 12 million homes. This year a recent heatwave that hit the southern city of Karachi claimed the lives of 1,300 people, while a freak typhoon hit Peshawar, provincial capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “We unfortunately do not have the luxury to waste time as far as climate change is concerned. We in Pakistan are actually living through the age of urgent climate adaptation,” said Khan. “We are facing its full impacts, including the recent heatwave which turned the streets of Karachi into an oven and the spate of disastrous climate triggered mega-floods over the past few years. “All of these are collectively and very unpredictably impacting our people and our agriculture, which is not equipped to cope with these rapidly shifting weather patterns.” Adaptation urgency According to Khan, the country’s economy faces costs of between US$6-10bn per year to cope with investing in a new green energy system and to prepare for floods, droughts and heatwaves. His government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has made climate change a priority, he said, with the allocation of two billion rupees (around $20m) to focus on green initiatives. “Our focus is on forestry, national parks, green energy development – all of which create natural climate mitigation and adaptation measures. In comparison, the Punjab government slashed their environment ministry budget by 75% from last year,” he said. Projects include the “Billion Tree Tsunami” – which has been accepted under the global Bonn Challenge to slow deforestation rates. It was not enough on its own, he acknowledged, but argued planting forests was the “easiest and most effective way” to deal with the challenge. As for cricket, Khan dismissed suggestions the sport could suffer as a result of rising global temperatures. “It’s the first time I am hearing of this impact but I feel Test cricket will find a way to adapt itself and survive,” he said."

"Futurist and author Ramez Naam is an optimist, even when it comes to the  problem of climate change.  His personal history is all about progress. Naam’s father, a physician, grew up impoverished in Egypt; three of his siblings died as infants. He emigrated to the US and spent a decade working in rural Illinois, where doctors were in short supply, to obtain permanent residency status and raise his children as Americans. Naam, 42, grew up to become a computer scientist and executive at Microsoft, an inventor, and an award-winning author of science fiction books. “When people ask me, what was the most important thing to shape my life, that was it,” Naam says. As a student of world history, Naam has seen how humanity has flourished in the last century. People live longer and suffer less than before. Doom-and-gloom predictions have not just been proven wrong, but spectacularly wrong. Take food: some forecast that the world would starve by the 1970s. While population has doubled since then, the food supply has grown by two-and-half times, and today there are more obese people than malnourished people in the world. “This is the best of times,” Naam writes in his 2013 nonfiction book, The Infinite Resource: The Power of Ideas on a Finite Planet. “We live in a period of health, wealth and freedom never seen before.”  Natural resources – notably the atmosphere’s capacity to absorb greenhouse gases – may be limited, Naam argues, but ideas and innovation are not.  Lately, Naam has been sharing his can-do optimism, along with specific solutions, on his blog, at conferences (most recently Sustainable Brands) and as a teacher at Singularity University, a think tank designed to inspire and equip business leaders to tackle humanity’s big problems. None is bigger than climate change, Raam told me when we met recently. This is because of its peculiar economic, political and scientific dimensions. The costs of fixing climate change are short term and local; the benefits are long term and global. Equity issues, meaning who should pay for higher energy or adaptation costs, are thorny. Meanwhile, carbon dioxide, which is being emitted at an unprecedented rate, persists in the atmosphere for decades, so time to solve the problem is running short. Bringing billions of people out of poverty, feeding a growing planet and stewarding water resources while reducing greenhouse gas emissions “may well be the largest challenge that humanity has ever faced”, Naam says. “The problems are vast. They’re very substantial. They will not solve themselves on their own. But if we make a concerted effort, they are not insurmountable.” What’s to be done? When Naam talks about innovation, he’s not talking simply about new technology. Innovative business models and policy are vital. “Technology innovation is often facilitated or bootstrapped by policy innovation, and it’s driven along by business-model innovation,” he says.  All require strong business leadership from big companies and startups alike, he says. Naam argues that capitalism isn’t the enemy of climate, as Naomi Klein has written; to the contrary, well-regulated markets will drive climate solutions. Consider solar power, one of the technologies, along with wind, battery storage and, possibly, nuclear, that he’s counting on to transform the world’s energy system. “Over the last 35 years or so,” he says, “the price of solar modules has dropped by a staggering 150 times.” This is promising news, especially, to the more than one billion people without electricity, most in Africa and South Asia. They “almost all live in the sunny parts of the world, a lucky coincidence for us and for them”, he says. With help from the World Bank, India is now building what will likely be the world’s largest solar plant. “This is a disruptive technology,” Naam says. To rapidly drive the uptake of solar, though, business-model innovation is needed. The US firm Solar City, for example, came up with what in retrospect is a simple idea: finance the upfront capital costs of solar for homeowners and businesses so they can pay-as-they-go and realize immediate savings. “That was a triple bottom line win,” Naam says. “It was good for the customers, it was the good for the planet. And Solar City created a $6bn market cap out of thin air.” Many big companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft, are already major buyers of clean energy, which drives prices down. “Every company and person that deploys clean energy makes it cheaper for everybody else,” Naam says. Now business leaders must take the next step, and become forceful advocates for smart clean energy policy, as Apple’s Tim Cook did last fall. Policy is the toughest nut to crack, Naam says. Solar would not be thriving without government subsidies in the US and, even more so, in Germany. To drive clean-energy innovation faster and further, Naam, like a growing number of business leaders and economists across the political spectrum, advocates a carbon tax.  He’s got a simple, four-point plan for a carbon tax. First, pass the tax, give businesses and consumers five years to prepare for it, and start it at just $10 per ton of CO2. Second, raise the price by $10 a year until the US meets its emission targets. Third, put a tax on imports from countries that don’t tax carbon. Fourth, give all the money back to taxpayers, probably by reducing payroll of income taxes. States and cities are already adopting innovative climate policies. Washington will follow, Naam predicts, as the cost of climate solutions continue to fall, and the costs of inaction become clear. “We’ll make progress when those two lines cross,” he says."

"The leadership of the Episcopal church has voted to withdraw from fossil fuel holdings as a means of fighting climate change, delivering an important symbolic victory to environmental campaigners. Two weeks after the pope’s pastoral letter on the environment, the divestment decision by a major US Protestant denomination underscored that climate change is increasingly seen by religious leaders as a deeply moral issue.  The measure, adopted by the governing body at a meeting in Salt Lake City, commits the church to quit fossil fuels and re-invest in clean energy. It covers only a small portion of church holdings, but encourages individual parishes and dioceses to begin moving funds in their control away from coal, oil and gas. “The vote says that this is a moral issue and that we really have to think about where we are putting our money,” said Betsy Blake Bennett, archdeacon in the Episcopal diocese of Nebraska, who supported divestment. “At a point where we are losing species and where human life itself is threatened by climate change, the church, by acting on it, is saying that this is a moral issue and something that everyone needs to look at seriously.” The immediate impact of the vote is symbolic. The measures covers some $380m in church holdings, but does not cover the denomination’s biggest asset, the $9bn pension fund, or some $4bn controlled by parishes and dioceses. The resolution encourages those congregations to begin looking at divestment. But the vote signals growing activism among leadership of churches on the issue of climate change. Desmond Tutu, a former archbishop of Cape Town and a leader in the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa, has also endorsed the cause of fossil fuel divestment, as have Anglican bishops in Australia, Britain and New Zealand.  With the vote, Episcopalians become the third major US denomination to take a position on fossil fuels. The United Church of Christ voted to quit fossil fuels in 2013. Earlier this year, the United Methodist Church instructed managers of its $21bn pension fund to drop coal holdings. A number of Episcopal dioceses have already called for divestment, and campaigners had been pushing the leadership to quit fossil fuels for a few years. At this week’s meeting, church leaders rejected a proposal to divest from the $9bn pension fund, the managers of which are understood to oppose divestment. A number of bishops opposed divestment overall, arguing it would do little to stop climate change. But campaigners said they hoped the vote would spur further activism, and encourage individual parishes and dioceses controlling some $4bn in assets to divest from fossil fuels as well. “The passage of this resolution will kickstart the dioceses,” said Bud Cederholm, a now retired church leader known as the “Green Bishop”. He said he thought the timing of the Pope’s message had also helped ease passage of the measure: “When the largest denomination in the world, when their leader make a statement like that, it get the rest of the Christian world’s attention.”"

"More than a dozen Catholic organisations will on Wednesday launch a campaign calling on people to make radical changes to their lifestyle choices – including cutting energy use, eating less meat and buying locally produced food – after the release last week of Pope Francis’s sweeping environmental encyclical. The plan by CIDSE, an international alliance of 17 Catholic social justice groups from Europe and North America, will be announced at a press conference at the Vatican that will include Peter Turkson, the Ghanaian cardinal who helped draft the papal document, and Naomi Klein, the Canadian author and anti-globalisation activist, who has said that the only hope of avoiding catastrophic warming of the earth requires “radical economic and political change”. The pope’s encyclical, or church teaching, states that global warming is mostly a man-made problem. The nearly 200-page essay has been seen as a moral call for action to phase out use of fossil fuels and an urgent plea for world leaders to agree on a plan to tackle climate change.  But it is also a call for individuals to re-evaluate their lifestyle choices – like the decision to turn on the air conditioning instead of coping with the heat – and curb out-of-control consumption. In it, Francis even states that he supports consumer boycotts to force polluters to change their practices, saying that boycotts “prove successful in changing the way businesses operate, forcing them to consider their environmental footprint and their patterns of production”. By aligning itself with CIDSE, the Vatican is once again clearly signalling that it supports an individual activist approach to environmental issues, which may or may not resonate with the world’s 1.2bn Catholics. “We believe that collective and individual changes are crucial to respond to the urgency we face through climate change, environmental degradation and the consequence they have on people’s lives,” said Bernd Nilles, the secretary general of the CIDSE. The Catholic groups will argue that, even though many people want to consume fair and sustainable products, that “politics and markets do not follow this demand”, according to a statement released before the press conference. Quoting the pope – who said that “a change in lifestyle could bring healthy pressure to bear on those who wield political, economic and social power” – the groups are calling for “radical change” towards “living simply and making different and more conscious choices”. It said a three-year campaign would focus on energy and food consumption, and would use social media and workshops to encourage people to make better daily choices. Some of the examples they suggest include cutting the amount of the energy people use, buying local and sustainably produced food, using public transport, and eating less meat."
"In November, representatives from 196 countries will meet in Paris to try to agree a deal to prevent dangerous increases in global temperatures.  Efforts to date aim to begin the “peaceful divorce” between greenhouse gas emissions and economic growth: no longer do the two need to go together. Last year was the first year where the world economy grew but greenhouse gas emissions did not. We wait to see if this is an indication of a broader trend or a blip.   What is clear, though, is that the UK must play a key role on the international stage to help global efforts to tackle climate change. In previous international gatherings, the UK could point to its world-leading climate change legislation: its system of carbon budgets and processes for assessing the risks from climate change and putting in place measures to adapt. That is no longer enough. Over 70 other countries now have similar legislation and, more importantly, the UK’s legal framework only encourages ambition from others if it is backed up by robust action.  Of course, some action has been taken, often following recommendations from the two committees that we chair. The UK has better flood defences, a more appropriate mixture of ways to generate electricity, greener transport, new and more resilient infrastructure and millions of homes benefiting from improved insulation and the lower energy costs that go with it.  But it’s not all positive. While the UK has made progress in reducing its emissions, much more needs to be done. We are not on track to meet our carbon budgets in the 2020s, and important risks that will arise in the future from climate change have not been fully addressed. If the UK is to be taken seriously in its ambition to deliver progress at a global level, urgent steps are required.  On Tuesday, our committees present their first joint report to the new parliament detailing where action is needed most. The government has a unique opportunity with the beginning of a new parliamentary term coinciding with the coming international discussions. It is a chance to think strategically about how to tackle one of the defining issues of our time.  We want to see government clarify its ambition for emissions reduction from electricity through the 2020s. This crucial step is needed to allow investors to plan with confidence at least 10 years ahead in line with their investment cycles. It should help unlock £100bn of investment in low- carbon electricity generation.  There is also an opportunity to decrease energy bills. While there has been some improvement in the energy efficiency of our homes and buildings, our report shows a need for further dramatic improvement if we are to meet our long-term emissions targets. The good news is that action in this area could save consumers £100 annually by 2020 in reduced electricity and heating bills and remove a million homes from fuel poverty at the same time. There are also significant opportunities for motorists to save money from improved government policies, while also reducing the UK’s carbon footprint. Electric vehicles are currently expensive, but their costs are falling, and more models are coming to market. Supporting electric vehicle roll-out now opens up the potential for future savings in fuel costs, while also tackling the health problems related to air pollution.  In fact, the impacts of climate change pose significant risks to health, particularly when it comes to heat. The government urgently needs to promote measures to prevent homes and buildings overheating during hotter summers. Take hospitals, for example. Internal temperatures often exceed 30C when it’s only 22C outside, making sleep, and recovery from illness, more difficult.  Climate change will also lead to more UK homes falling into high flood risk categories, where mortgages and flood insurance may become problematic. We’re urging the government to help people protect their homes and limit new development in at-risk areas rather than needlessly spending public money subsidising the costs of flood insurance.  There may also be benefits to the UK, for instance in increased food production, but only if the key natural capital, soil and water, is properly managed, and the current plans for doing this fully implemented.  If the UK fails to meet its own ambitions on climate change, the dangers are clear: stop-start investment leading to increased costs to us all and lost opportunities for increased food production, for new jobs and new areas of growth.  The government has until October to respond to our report. As negotiations intensify in the lead up to the Paris conference, it is only with ambitious domestic climate policies that the UK’s international credibility can be assured. Actions speak louder than words. "

"Should scientists show emotion while discussing their science? I ask because a professor of ocean geology wept as she discussed with me the impact carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are having on the sea. She fears we are acidifying and heating the ocean so fast that her young daughters may no longer enjoy coral reefs and shellfish by the end of the century.  And as we pondered the future, her passion for the oceans triggered tears. The interview came half way through a long day for the professor, who had left her young children in the early hours on a visit to the Marum labs in Bremen. We had gone to witness ocean sediment cores showing an event known as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) 56m years ago, when the sea bed rapidly heated and became more acidic. It’s visually dramatic: the cores are chalky white from the fossils of tiny shellfish for millions of years – then they suddenly turn reddish brown as many of the shellfish (foraminifera) are driven to extinction. Our CO2 emissions are acidifying the seas at least 10 times faster than at that cataclysmic moment – maybe 100 times faster. The majority view is that some species will benefit from the changes we are imposing on the ocean, in the short term at least, but most changes are likely to be negative. It is unlikely, for instance, that the spectacular branching corals that embellish reefs will survive the century. As the professor spoke about the future of the oceans for Radio 4’s World Tonight I noticed the tears in her eyes. “Stop recording now,” she said. “I can’t be crying on the radio. It’s demeaning to women scientists, especially after Tim Hunt [The UCL Professor who controversially resigned after quipping that women scientists get emotional in the lab].”  I argued that the audience would be moved by her commitment, and the interview continued with tears flowing. “I love the oceans,” she said. “I feel passionately about what we are doing to them and I’m worried that they will be irreversibly damaged. “Ocean acidification is very simple. The CO2 is increasing in the atmosphere; the ocean and the atmosphere are exchanging the CO2; the ocean will become more acidic. That’s simple chemistry and much easier to calculate than what is the regional warming effects of the land and the ocean. “I’m a geologist. In the long term the Earth and Earth system will recover back to a normal state. But humans – we are depending on the services the oceans provide. “It’s really important for me that the next generation can grow up diving in the ocean, enjoying it and getting pleasure from it. I’d like my girls to see it (as it is now). “I’m seriously concerned how the ocean will look like in 2100. Because with the current predictions we will not have coral reefs, with the current predictions they will not enjoy eating mussels and oysters. They will not have a lot of things we take for granted. “This is all about the rate of change – if we can reduce the rate with which we change the CO2 in the atmosphere. How 2100 is looking like is our choice.” A colleague was moved by her passion: “That was really powerful. She almost had me crying too. That’s the sort of interview that will stay with the audience for some time.” The professor on the other hand was unhappy. I persuaded her to let me broadcast the tearful radio interview but she truncated a subsequent TV interview when she became overwrought again. Her fellow acidification scientist Dr Carol Turley from Plymouth Marine Labs supported her emotion: “There’s nothing wrong with passion for your science,” she said. “Women are allowed to be emotional. Men are allowed to be ironic. The Tim Hunt business was absurd.” It brought to my mind that dramatic moment when the chair of the annual climate change conference Yvo de Boer wept on stage after an attack on his integrity as he worked round the clock to get a deal to protect the Earth from warming. But how will the audience respond to the professor’s tears for the oceans, and her unambiguous plea for a reduction in CO2 emissions? Social scientists tell us the way people respond to media messages depends on many factors, including age, life experiences or their attitudes to say, risk or tax. Values are also key, along with prior beliefs – especially in this case about the accuracy of climate science. So, some may be moved to pay more attention than otherwise because the professor revealed an emotional commitment to her science. They may perhaps be drawn to research further into ocean science themselves. And they will trust the interviewee more because she displayed “honest” emotion rather than just “dry” statistics. Others may conclude that tears can cloud judgement. These will insist on a more methodical analysis of the certainties and uncertainties of ocean acidification – the sort of thing the professor would provide in a lecture to students. They will trust the interviewee less for revealing emotion behind her science. Gender can be another factor in receiving media messages. Why not try the ocean tears test with a member of the opposite sex while listening to the interview? Would you have responded the same way, I wonder, if the interviewee had been a man? I wonder, too, if the tears would have been more widely-accepted if the interviewee had been passionate about space, rather than the Earth? I suspect many climate scientists downplay their passion for their subject to avoid being labelled environmentalists by those who don’t share their values. One thing is for sure - your own judgments about the prospects for the long term future of humanity and the planet are unlikely to be influenced only by logic, any more than all scientific breakthroughs stem from intellect alone.  • Follow Roger @rharrabin "

"One afternoon towards the end of May a violent wind howled through Bogandé, the main town in Gnagna province, in eastern Burkina Faso. Raising a storm of dust and sand, it plunged the streets into semi-darkness, driving roaming goats crazy. In villages across Gnagna people connect these extreme climate events with deteriorating living standards. They explain how these increasingly frequent “red” winds wreak havoc, burying their crops in sand, destroying their homes, and spreading disease among their flocks. In late May, on the great Gnagna plain, the earth is dry, with deep cracks. An occasional tree – usually red acacia (Vachellia seyal) – stands out as a patch of green. In the villages, most of the wells have dried up. It is the toughest part of the year, when reserves from the previous harvest run low and the next one is not yet ripe. And still there is no rain.  In 2014, just 538mm of rain fell here. Over the past 30 years, average annual rainfall has dropped by 200mm. “The Sahel climate zone is steadily spreading further south. Bogandé used to enjoy a Sudanese-Sahelian climate, but it is now borderline,” says Claire Gaillardou, head of the risks and disasters department at the Action Against Hunger (ACF) mission in Burkina Faso. “Since 1975 the [average] temperature has risen by 0.8C.” Tnidano Tissa, 78, remembers how the village looked when he was a child. “There were great African mahogany, locust bean, fig and shi trees, all of which produced fruit. In the rainy season, long grass protected the ground. All year long there was a bit of plant cover. We’d see antelopes, big savannah monitors and hyenas,” he says, drawing a smile from the youngest members of his audience, who have never seen such creatures. The plant cover has vanished, and trees are now a rarity. With diminishing rainfall, the soil is blown away by winds that grow ever more violent. “There are no longer any trees to slow them down,” says Lankoandé Diagnogou, 38, a neighbour of Tissa’s. At Tindandou, 45km away, Diawari Barbibilé, 63, is equally desperate. “The loss of plant cover has speeded up soil degradation, and the rainy season is very short,” he says. The rain comes later and is interspersed with long periods of drought. Across the region, rainfall is increasingly erratic and increasingly intense. The rain cuts into the ground and washes away the little humus – which is essential to the fertility of the earth – it contains. “That, in turn, can cause flooding, because water has difficulty penetrating bone-dry earth. Some years the run-off rate can be as high as 40%,” Gaillardou explains. ACF is trying to help communities adapt to these extreme climate events, which seem to get steadily worse. Assistance involves learning farming techniques that keep the water in the soil and reduce the effects of erosion. This year Barbibilé prepared three one-hectare fields, digging semi-circular hollows along the contour lines to trap as much rain as possible and create better conditions for sowing. He hopes this technique will yield a bigger crop. Ten years ago, Barbibilé was still harvesting “five cartloads” of grain. “We could live very nicely on what I grew, and I could sell the surplus,” he says. “But in the last few years the soil has become so poor that I don’t have anything to sell. The two cartloads I bring home are barely enough to feed the family. The rest of the crop is only fit for cattle-feed.” His 34-year-old son works with him now, and in all there are 16 mouths to feed. “The rain stops before the millet has even had time to fully ripen. If there’s no rain what you grow is worthless,” Barbibilé says. Due to the unpredictable rainfall he has had to give up the traditional crop of sorghum, which takes longer to ripen. He prefers to use white sorghum and pearl millet, with a shorter crop cycle. In Burkina Faso in late May, as they waited anxiously for the next crop, more than 330,000 people faced food insecurity. In Gnagna province, with an average of seven people in each household, the situation is far worse than in the rest of the country. Farmers are producing less than half the food they need to survive. After four to six months their reserves run out. In the worst years, they have no option but to sell part or all of their livestock – if they have any – or run up debts. “When we run short of food, we have to turn to one of our neighbours in the village who has sufficient resources to lend us food,” says André Dori, 38, who lives in Kongaye, in Gnagna province. Dori, who has four children, says he too can no longer meet his family’s needs. “These loans are in kind. With a 100% interest rate: for one sack of grain borrowed, I must pay back two. I am deep in debt, because my crops don’t ripen properly, due to the climate.” He has been unable to pay off any of his debts in recent years. Dori hopes things will get better through the use of improved techniques. With more bountiful harvests, he says, he could feed his family and even buy livestock.

"The EU should set challenging new fuel efficiency targets for new cars in 2025 to reduce motoring costs for consumers and tackle climate change, according to four member countries. Environment and transport ministers from the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden and Finland have written to the European commission saying the new goal should be set next year.  The 2025 target for Europe’s car makers would be in addition to an existing one for new cars in 2021 to emit no more than an average of 95g CO2 per km for a manufacturer’s fleet. The average in 2014 was 123.4g CO2 per km. “New challenging targets for 2025, accompanied by a comprehensive package to address refuelling infrastructure and other issues, will encourage a transition towards a zero-emission powertrain in passenger cars,” says the letter, which the Guardian has seen. “Such targets are essential to stimulate new innovations that develop and improve electric, hydrogen and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.” A cross-party group of 11 MEPs has also written to the climate and energy commissioner, Miguel Arias Cañete, calling on him to confirm that he will announce new fuel efficiency goals for the 2020s next year. The Renault-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn told the Guardian last week that he could not predict electric vehicle production volumes until the EU, US and China showed their hand on fuel standards for 2030.  Such interventions sets the scene for a new regulation battle, in which Germany is expected to try to apply the handbrake on tough targets on behalf of car manufacturers such as BMW and Daimler. In the last round of the fuel efficiency battle two years ago, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, played hardball, forcing an agreed cap on emissions to be frozen and then watered-down. This time though, several EU states are keenly aware that Europe’s moderate commitments to renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements will not deliver the 40% carbon cut that leaders have signed up to. The car industry knows this too and has been carefully consulting with consumer and environmental advocates, in a bid to coalesce a more soft-focused opposition to carbon-cutting obligations. The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (Acea), which represents the major car showroom players, says that it trying to build an unusually broad alliance for alternative approaches towards a 2025 target. “There is a limit to what we can further do with technology [to reduce emissions] in the auto industry, so it is important that we involve all stakeholders for input, in order to deliver on a more ambitious climate change agenda,” a spokesman said. A recent position paper by the group proposed cutting car pollution by fleet renewal, a greater use of biofuels, more ‘intelligent’ transport systems, and compulsory eco-driving lessons for motorists. This involves teaching drivers to change their behaviour by predicting traffic better, using the accelerator more slowly and smoothly, coming off it earlier, and never accelerating up to traffic lights. “The evidence shows that eco-driving can have a worthwhile effect but only for a very short period,” said Greg Archer, a spokesman for the green campaign group, Transport and Environment (T&E). “Immediately afterwards, people drive more efficiently but they very quickly revert to driving in their old style.” A recent T&E analysis found that fuel efficiency targets for 2025 and 2030 could deliver almost half of the whole transport sector’s contribution to the EU’s 2030 climate goal. Without them, swingeing fuel taxes, road tolls or radical overhauls of planning would be needed. Car-makers though say that all the ‘low-hanging fruit’ of emissions-cutting measures has already been picked - at great expense to industry – and that any further fuel standards will depend on a switch to electric vehicles. One EU official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the argument as “misinformation,” because studies suggest that diesel hybrid powertrains could bring emissions down to 65g/km by 2035. “It’s complete nonsense,” the official said. “There is technical potential to improve internal combustion engines much further.” In 2013, the commission pledged to review a 2025 fuel standard of between 68-78g/km for new cars the following year. The work has not yet been completed. "

"British scientists have devised a new way to observe the greenhouse world, enabling researchers to measure with exquisite accuracy how atmospheric carbon dioxide builds up, migrates, evolves and absorbs radiation. The technique will allow more accurate predictions about how much the Earth is likely to warm over the next few decades as a result of the inexorable rise in atmospheric CO2 – from car exhausts, power station chimneys and burning forests – that drives global warming and climate change.  More than a century has elapsed since the Swedish Nobel laureate Svante Arrhenius first predicted the greenhouse effect, but scientists have until now only been able to establish the way CO2 absorbs light, with accuracies of about 5% at best. But Oleg Polyanksy and Jonathan Tennyson, professors in the department of physics and astronomy at University College London, and colleagues report in the journal Physical Review Letters that they can exploit the laws of quantum mechanics to narrow the uncertainty to 0.3%. The consequence is that a range of dedicated satellite missions – among them Japan’s Greenhouse Gas Observing Satellite (Gosat), Nasa’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) and potential European Space Agency missions such as CarbonSat − will not just be able to identify industrial sources of CO2 and map their spread, but watch the gas in action, slowly warming the planet by as much as 5°C by 2100. “Billions of dollars are currently being spent on satellites that monitor what seems to be the inexorable growth of CO2 in our atmosphere,” Professor Tennyson says. “To interpret their results, however, it is necessary to have a very precise answer to the question: how much radiation does one molecule of CO2 absorb? “Up until now, laboratory measurements have struggled to answer this question accurately enough to allow climate scientists to interpret their results with the detail their observations require.” The orbiting satellite has become the climate scientist’s most prolific data delivery machine. There are satellites measuring the shrinking of the ice caps and the rate at which the ice is melting. Besides an arsenal of weather monitors, satellites are using sophisticated sensors to monitor sea level rise, changes in ocean acidity and soil moisture, agricultural success in India, and even the energy spent in lighting up the world’s cities at night. All these studies are part of the great global warming puzzle, but for most of the last 50 years, confirmation of what a greenhouse gas does has mainly rested on the match of CO2 levels in the atmosphere and the consequent rise in global average temperatures. The University College team, with colleagues in Russia, the US and Poland, tried another approach. They started with the exact quantum mechanical equations obeyed by a molecule such as CO2, then harnessed computers and subtle laboratory technologies to measure the different “colours” or wavelengths of light absorbed by molecules. Each wavelength carries a precise energy, and highly-accurate measurements for small laboratory samples should enable researchers to scale up to equivalent accuracies for the entire atmosphere. That means that they will be able to observe the intricacies of global warming − more or less as it happens − from high orbit, and make increasingly accurate predictions about future global warming."
"We all know how good a cold ice cream tastes on a hot day, and climate scientists are telling us to expect more hot days – and extended heat waves – in the years ahead. As the planet gets warmer, we at Ben & Jerry’s want to be sure that our ice cream is produced with as few greenhouse gas emissions as possible, to keep our fans supplied with Cherry Garcia without making climate change even worse. We’ve done our homework and know that 17% of our carbon footprint comes from transportation, from shipping our ice cream from the factory to our distribution centers. That’s a big bite out of our carbon budget, and we’re not alone.  Heavy over-the-road trucks move 70% of America’s freight, yet these trucks average only six miles per gallon and emit over half a billion tons of greenhouse gas pollution per year. These trucks are the fastest-growing single source of carbon pollution in the US, and truck travel is projected to increase 40% by 2040. To tackle this carbon pollution and costs, the Environmental Protection Agency has proposed federal regulations for the fuel economy of freight trucks. These proposed regulations are a step in the right direction, but they don’t lower emissions far enough or fast enough. Stronger standards are needed. Experts say that a 40% reduction in fuel consumption by 2025 is not only feasible and cost effective, but would save businesses and consumers even more money and cut more pollution than the proposed standards, which don’t specify an overall figure.  Today’s trucks get our products to your local freezer at too high a cost, financially and environmentally. Together, US businesses spend $650 billion a year shipping goods in long-haul trucks. More efficient trucks may cost a little more upfront, but they will cost far less to run over the life of the truck, reducing freight rates by nearly 7%, which could drop costs by $0.21/mile by 2040. They’d help us deliver our pints to your freezer more cheaply, and with less greenhouse gas pollution, than we are able to do today. The Consumer Federation of America estimates that, each year, the average American household spends $1,100 extra on consumer goods and services to cover the costs of fueling up inefficient, heavy-duty trucks, and that stronger standards could save the average household $250 a year. That’s good news for us, for trucking companies, for truckers – and for you. Ben & Jerry’s is committed to reducing our carbon footprint across our entire business. From manure separators that reduce emissions on our dairy farms to installing solar panels at our factories in Vermont, we are proud to have already taken steps that are tackling the greatest sources of our emissions. Strong truck fuel standards will help us continue taking bites out of our carbon footprint. While there will always be a few who continue to deny the scientific reality of climate change, we understand that solutions, like efficient truck standards, will help us take on global warming, reduce fuel costs and drive innovation. We’re proud to stand with the many forward-thinking companies that understand strong fuel economy standards for trucks will lower freight costs and benefit everyone."

"Humans could save the Great Barrier Reef from global warming by transplanting corals that survive heat stress, say scientists. A new joint study by the Australian institute of marine science (AIMS) in Townsville and the University of Texas has found a genetic basis for tolerance of higher temperatures in coral. The discovery could pave the way for manmade colonies of coral bred to adapt to hotter oceans, according to the researchers. University of Texas biologist Mikhail Matz said: “Averting coral extinction begin with something as simple as exchange of coral immigrants across latitudes, which … can be jump-started by humans moving adult corals”. “This is occasion for hope and optimism about coral reefs and the marine life that thrive there,” Matz said. AIMS evolutionary ecologist Line Bay said the discovery was a boon to “understanding of the potential for coral on the Great Barrier Reef to cope with hotter oceans”. Researchers crossed individuals of branching coral Acropora millepora, from the warmer far north of the Great Barrier Reef, with members of the same species at Orpheus Island, 540 km south. The corals of the north passed on their heat tolerance to their offspring, they found. The study found heat tolerance could hinge largely on “mum’s genes”, being centred in mitochondria, the “powerhouses of the cells that are inherited solely from mothers”. The scientists now wish to confirm the role of mitochondria in heat tolerance, suggested for the first time by the study. That was the next step in identifying the “winners and losers in the game of climate change”, they said. Only then could they consider attempts to restore reefs or make new ones by choosing heat-tolerant corals, or help those communities naturally took over from others that died. "
"Germany agreed on Thursday to mothball about five of the country’s largest brown coal power plants to meet its climate goals by 2020, after months of wrangling between the parties in chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition.  But Merkel and the leaders of her two junior coalition partners also, in effect, agreed to set up a “capacity reserve” system where utilities could switch on the brown coal plants if there were power shortages in the country.   An economy ministry spokesman said the decision on brown coal would mean Germany could meet its goal of reducing German CO2 emissions by 40% by 2020 compared to 1990. The goal is much more ambitious than the EU-wide target of the same cut by 2030.  “Brown coal-fired plants with a capacity of 2.7 gigawatts will be mothballed. Those plants will not be allowed to sell any electricity on the normal power market,” said a spokesman for the economy ministry after the talks which lasted four hours.  In a television interview, economy minister Sigmar Gabriel expanded on the plans, which are part of Germany’s switch to renewable energy away from nuclear and fossil fuels.  “We need a capacity reserve on the power market in case there are shortages due to the switch to renewables. The reserve will be made up of brown coal,” Gabriel told ARD television.  Gabriel originally proposed putting a levy on CO2 emitted by the oldest and most-polluting power stations above a certain threshold to help curb CO2 emissions from the coal sector by a further 22m tonnes by 2020.  But he faced a backlash from industry, with unions saying the plan could put up to 100,000 jobs at risk and lead to the decline of the mining and power generation industries.  The utility companies lobbied hard against the levy and demanded compensation for an alternative reserve option.  While the levy now seems to be scrapped, it is unclear whether companies such as RWE or Vattenfall Europe will get compensation payments or not.  Gabriel also said the leaders of the coalition had agreed that taxpayers should not end up paying for provisions for the costs of the nuclear phase-out.  “We agreed that we want to ensure, a bit like parents being responsible for their children, that a situation doesn’t arise where, due to changes within companies, taxpayers have to pay for the provisions,” Gabriel said.  Merkel and her coalition partners also settled a dispute over high-voltage power lines, planned to carry green energy from the north to the industrial south, with an agreement to avoid bottlenecks and have a uniform price structure."

"See if you can guess which politician said this: “We need a recovery that is sustainable environmentally, not just economically. I believe that this can be a huge opportunity – greening our economy can be a win-win solution.”  Al Gore, Ed Milliband, or Caroline Lucas, perhaps?  If they were elected, the politician said, they would ensure the Treasury would no longer be “the cuckoo in the nest when it comes to climate change”. The Treasury would “become a green ally, not a foe”. On Wednesday, the same man who uttered those warm words on the environment in 2009 and 2010 stood up in parliament and delivered a budget that was many things, but definitely not green. From turning a tax designed to encourage renewable electricity into a tax on renewable electricity, to making a Porsche cost the same to tax as an electric car, everywhere you turned in George Osborne’s speech there were measures that cast the Treasury back in its traditional role of green foe. The budget marks the completion of the chancellor’s slow volte face on the environment. We’re now a long, long way from the Conservative party’s enthusiastic adoption of green talk as part of its modernisation and detoxification, and David Cameron’s husky moment in 2006. Some may argue that Osborne never believed in the green project as the prime minister did.  But in the early years of the last parliament, while Osborne may have delivered frequent jibes over what he perceived as the “burden” and cost of environmental policies, he still seemed to feel a responsibility to at least speak positively about renewable energy. And he pushed through the creation of the green investment bank, which the coalition would later point to as evidence they’d lived up to their aspiration of being the “greenest government ever”. But fast forward to this week, and the Tories were briefing that the chancellor believed the Liberal Democrats had let subsidies on clean energy – which actually account for a tiny fraction of spending – run out of control. We know the Lib Dems acted as a brake on Osborne’s attempts to water down environmental policies. Now that brake is off, as the emergency budget demonstrated.  New roads will be built, fuel duty will be frozen (again), vehicle excise duty (“road tax”) will be reconfigured from 2017 so that, after the first year, the buyer of a low-carbon electric car will pay the same as buyers of the most polluting 4x4s and sports cars.  Friends of the Earth calculates that the changes to road tax mean it’ll cost £1,000 more to run a greener car over seven years. Even the industry doesn’t like it, saying it will disincentivise the takeup of low-emission vehicles.  On energy, the criteria for previously announced tax breaks for North Sea oil and gas exploration will be broadened. There is vague talk of a sovereign wealth fund for communities living near shale gas, something Osborne has floated before, despite communities in Lancashire giving shale exploration a resounding thumbs-down last month. Energy efficiency schemes for business will be reviewed later this year, for which you can read watered-down. A target set during the last government to keep increasing the proportion of revenue from environmental taxes was dropped. The green investment bank is to be largely sold off.  But the big one was scrapping the exemption that renewable electricity producers had under the climate change levy, a tax that is meant to help cut emissions. In effect, a green tax just became an energy tax. As one Friends of the Earth campaigner put it, it’s “like making apple juice pay an alcohol tax”. All this comes on top of the newly elected government’s quickfire moves of ending subsidies for onshore windfarms and making it easier for local people to block them.  And in case you were in any doubt about the direction of travel, on Friday the Treasury effectively killed off a longstanding goal of making all new homes “zero carbon” from 2016. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem former energy secretary, said of the decision that “Cameron may as well hug a coal power station”. Several senior figures in government, such as Cameron and the new energy and climate change secretary, Amber Rudd, appear to be genuinely committed on a personal level to green issues. But for Osborne, the summer budget conclusively buries and paves over the man who once criticised the Treasury for being “at best indifferent, and at worst obstructive” on environmental policy."

"In April of this year, two Dutch polar explorers, Marc Cornelissen and Philip de Roo, set off from Resolute Bay in the Canadian Arctic. They were headed for Bathurst Island, a journey of 400km that was due to take around a month. This was part of the Last Ice Survey expedition to gather data about snow and ice thickness for York University, Ontario. They would walk and ski across a region known as the Last Ice Area, where summer sea ice is expected to be most resilient to climate change. A few days into their trip, when they were still in Resolute Bay preparing for the hard month ahead, Philip found Marc’s sled from a previous unsuccessful expedition being used by a local hunter. In one of the many short voice recordings which they uploaded each day during their journey, Marc talks about what a special feeling it is to be back in the region and how pleased he is to be there with his trusted expedition partner Philip. “That [last expedition] was a failure, but if we make it there this time, it will be a beautiful contrast.”  In their final voice recording, uploaded on 28 April and since then listened to almost 24,000 times, Marc talks about how unseasonably warm it is – “too warm actually” – and mentions that within 60 minutes of starting their journey that day they were skiing in their underwear. “We think we can see thin ice in front of us which is quite interesting. We’re going to research some more if we can.” On 29 April, about 200km south of Bathurst Island, they encountered sea ice so unexpectedly thin that they fell through. Both died. The accident shocked the polar exploration and research community. “Marc and Philip’s deaths serve as a warning to anyone working in the region,” says Dr George Divoky, director of the not-for-profit organisation Friends of Cooper Island. “As tragic as their deaths are, they have heightened my awareness of how important it is not to become too comfortable in how I deal with the Arctic. The next decade will present new dangers and threats.” You might think that the unexpectedly thin ice points to the effects of global warming, but the scientists are adamant that no research conclusions should be drawn from the accident. Professor Appy Sluijs, who works in the earth sciences department at the University of Utrecht, was a close friend of both Marc and Philip. “The area they were working in is considered to have ample sea ice and is projected to have sufficient sea ice in the near future for these kinds of expeditions,” he says. “A couple of hundred metres from where they were, there would have been far less risk.” Nevertheless, all future scenarios imply a significant reduction in seasonal and multi-year ice in the Arctic. The kind of fieldwork they were carrying out is likely to become more and more difficult, while the data it provides becomes ever more important. I first met Marc and Philip in 2005. I was a student in the Climate Change College, a programme run by WWF International and Ben and Jerry’s to educate young people about the environment. It involved several months of intense training, ending with a fortnight in Greenland where we camped out on the ice sheet to do fieldwork. Led by Marc and Philip, we gathered ice and snow measurements to validate the data from the European Space Agency’s CryoSat satellite. Scientists have long been aware that the extent of Arctic ice cover is changing, but they know far less about the thickness of that ice. Ground camps enable researchers to make accurate recordings and ensure that CryoSat’s radar is reflecting off the ice itself, not just compacted snow. Peter Nienow, professor of glaciology at Edinburgh University and one of the scientists we worked with in Greenland, explains how crucial the work on the ground is. “Validation work is essential because without measurements that we know are accurate, we cannot be confident of any observed trends in ice-mass change. A small error in estimates of elevation, when extrapolated across a whole ice sheet, can lead to large imbalances in estimates of mass change, and thus contribution or otherwise to sea level.” Marc was always quick to point out that he was not a scientist himself: he referred to his model of working as a “feed in – reach out” approach. He trained as an architect at Delft University of Technology and after graduation decided to make “one last expedition” before entering the world of work. He never made it to the office, instead becoming a full-time explorer. Over the years he travelled to the polar regions more than 20 times and developed a reputation as a highly experienced, knowledgeable expedition leader. In 2011 Marc founded Cold Facts, an organisation that supports polar science by co- ordinating research activity between scientists, explorers and local populations, and then promotes the results of those collaborations to a wider audience. Additionally, he developed equipment and protocols that made it easier for other polar travellers to do simple measurements and communicate their findings. Marc also spent time developing effective polar bear tripwire alarms and shared these with other researchers. Dr Divoky recalls: “He sent me four of them shortly after we met in Barrow. Since then those alarms have regularly scared away polar bears and woken me up as increasing ice retreat has driven growing numbers of bears to the island. Marc’s alarms continue to be a part of my daily camp life and, of course, deploying them this summer has been emotional.” Before leaving for the Last Ice Area expedition in March, Marc shared a picture on Twitter of his most recent alarm. “Double piezo makes for a screaming mix. Best so far. Not sure my neighbours like it…” Marc and Philip’s other strength was that they understood that, even within the community of people who want to protect the polar regions, there are many different motivations. At the Climate Change College experts spoke on everything from biodiversity to social justice and economics. “Marc had a great legacy on involving business in his projects,” says Sluijs. “Engaging companies is a crucial aspect because they can provide possibilities that public parties cannot. Both Marc and Philip were great leaders in this way.” Marc made the point again and again during our training that for campaigners to have a truly compelling argument there must be a strong body of evidence. He urged us to know our facts, to make sure that we wouldn’t be caught out and have people dismiss our argument because we’d got the figures wrong. My experience with the Climate Change College led to full-time work as an environmental campaigner in Scotland. I often called and asked one or the other of them for advice. We kept in touch and I watched their research with keen interest. Each time they shared photos and stories from their fieldwork, I was reminded of the long evenings we had spent huddled together in a tent in Greenland, talking, laughing and drinking red wine with chunks of ice floating in it. Living in such an isolated environment had brought us close very quickly. There is sometimes a temptation when you lose people too soon and under difficult circumstances to romanticise their lives, to suddenly start referring to them as heroes. But in my mind Marc and Philip have always been heroes. They regularly pushed themselves – both mentally and physically – to their absolute limits because they cared so much about the Arctic and felt it was their responsibility to help protect it. “Philip and I met regularly in Utrecht to have a beer and talk about how we could help each other,” says Sluijs. “We wrote a proposal together and although what he wrote was absolutely outstanding in terms of content, the text was all jumbled and his spelling was terrible because he was seriously dyslexic. He constantly pushed himself to improve on that. I will also never forget how Marc fell asleep with a cigar in his mouth after a busy day during a project in Spitsbergen. We took it out and let him sleep. ‘Tired’ was not a word that often appeared in his dictionary.” Philip was just 30 at the time of the accident. He celebrated his birthday on the ice during that last expedition, and uploaded a joyful, laughing message about waking up to a decorated tent, a birthday song, and the cake and presents that Marc had brought along. He spent his teenage years volunteering as a Ranger for WWF and in 2000, at the age of 15, was rewarded for his efforts with a place on Xpedition Cool, a month-long research assignment in Antarctica. It was on this trip that he met Marc. Marc and Philip were not thrillseekers, although they were a great deal of fun. They were experienced explorers who clearly understood the risks of expeditions in the polar regions. In a 2011 TEDx talk at Utrecht University, Marc spoke about how much he hated encountering open water on expeditions. His nose wrinkled in disgust as he introduced a video of a colleague in a dry suit, slowly crawling through water and breaking the surface ice with his elbows as he goes. It looked utterly grim. In the short voice recordings which Marc and Philip took turns to upload each day during their journey across the Last Ice Area they made observations about the ice and the weather conditions, about the challenges of settling into a new routine with their dog Kimmik, who at first refused to pull his own sled. But as well as talking about the challenges, they also talked about the small pleasures of life on the ice. You can hear in their voices the deep satisfaction they got from sitting in their sleeping bags with a hot drink, or from tucking into a bowl of warm food at the end of a long day. They included many small details that made their experiences accessible and interesting, and despite the number of times they had undertaken such journeys, neither man lost his enthusiasm for the beauty of the Arctic landscape. It is something they mentioned in almost every recording – the blue skies, the pretty sunsets, the interesting formations of ice. There are several painful ironies about the loss of Marc and Philip. In a blog for National Geographic back in March, Marc wrote about the fact that this area of ice was the very same one where he started an unsuccessful expedition back in 1996. Although he had been back to the Poles almost every year since then, the memory was still one that came back before this trip. “This unsuccessful expedition is the basis of everything I’ve done afterwards. And now, completely unintentionally, I return to the same ice field.” On 29 April the Dutch base camp for the expedition received an emergency message from their tracer. An urgent pick-up was requested, but no further details were available. Poor weather conditions meant that attempts to transport a recovery team to the area by helicopter had to be abandoned. It was almost a week before a team of local volunteers, co-ordinated by Canadian police, was able to reach the area on snowmobiles and recover Marc’s body. At the time of writing, Philip has still not been found. I learned from them that science and campaigning – feed in and reach out – are two sides of the same coin. Progress is often slow. One man digging a hole in the ice may not feel like he is achieving much. One man standing in front of a lecture theatre may not feel like he is changing anything. But when you learn to see that personal effort in the context of collective action it feels a lot more powerful. Everything is easier if you do it with a smile on your face, and all the best days end with hot chocolate and whisky."

"A new study has examined the comments on climate science-denying blogs and found strong evidence of widespread conspiratorial thinking. The study looks at the comments made in response to a previous paper linking science denial and conspiracy theories.  Three years ago, social scientists Lewandowsky, Oberauer, and Gignac published a paper in the journal Psychological Science titled NASA Faked the Moon Landing—Therefore, (Climate) Science Is a Hoax: An Anatomy of the Motivated Rejection of Science.  The paper detailed the evidence the scientists found that, using survey data provided by visitors to climate blogs, those exhibiting conspiratorial thinking are more likely to be skeptical of scientists’ conclusions about vaccinations, genetically modified foods, and climate change. This result was replicated in a follow-up study using a representative U.S. sample that obtained the same result linking conspiratorial thinking to climate denial. This shouldn’t be a terribly shocking result. When confronted with inconvenient science, those in denial often reject the evidence by accusing the experts of fraud or conspiracies. We saw a perfect example of this behavior just a few weeks ago. When scientists at NOAA published a paper finding that there was no ‘pause’ in global warming, one of the most common responses from those in denial involved the conspiratorial accusation that the scientists had somehow fudged the data at the behest of the Obama administration. Nevertheless, nobody likes being characterized as a conspiracy theorist, and so those in the denial blogosphere reacted negatively to the research of Lewandowsky and colleagues. Ironically, many of the attacks on the study involved conspiratorial accusations, which simply provided more data for the social scientists to analyze. For example, the authors were accused of everything from faked data to collusion between Lewandowsky and the Australian government.  As a result, a year later Lewandowsky, Cook, Oberauer, and Marriott published Recursive fury: conspiracist ideation in the blogosphere in response to research on conspiracist ideation. The paper analyzed blog comments that mentioned the Moon Landing paper. It became the most-read paper ever published by the journal Frontiers in Psychology. However, the study was subsequently accused of being defamatory because the public blog comments had not been made anonymous in the paper. At the request of Frontiers, the authors anonymized the comments, but the journal still withdrew the paper out of fear of legal action. Its failure to stand behind sound scientific research led to the resignation of three of Frontiers’ editors: Ugo Bardi, Björn Brembs, and Colin Davis.  Subsequent to the withdrawal of Recursive Fury, Frontiers published an article that denied the link between HIV and AIDS. Despite widespread protest from the scientific community, the journal declined to withdraw the paper and instead classified it as an “opinion” piece. More recently, Frontiers fired 31 Editors in the medical arena, who expressed concern that Frontiers’ publication practices are designed to maximize the company’s profits, not the quality of papers, and that this could harm patients. Lewandowsky, Cook, Oberauer, Brophy, Lloyd, and Marriott have now published Recurrent fury: Conspiratorial discourse in the blogosphere triggered by research on the role of conspiracist ideation in climate denial in a different journal - the Journal of Social and Political Psychology.  In this latest study, university undergraduate students (mainly psychology majors) were given the comments from denial blogs, together with genuine scientific critiques of the Moon Landing paper provided by 3 psychology PhD students at the University of Bristol.  In order to make this a blind test, participants were told the comments related to an unnamed scientific paper. The participants were asked to classify the comments, for example as types of conspiratorial thinking (e.g. questioning the motives of the authors of the paper) or as reasonable scientific critiques. In the end, the participants clearly identified the comments from science-denying blogs as conspiratorial in nature, and the comments from the 3 PhD students as genuine scientific critiques. In fact, the results were quite strong.  Normally we might expect the data to have a shape similar to that of a Bell Curve, with some of the comments mentioning the Moon Landing paper exhibiting a moderate level conspiratorial thinking, but few to an extreme degree. On the contrary, the results were heavily skewed, with most denial blog comments about the paper being heavily suspicious and questioning the motives of the authors. Lead author Stephen Lewandowsky told me, I do not recall ever having seen such a strong effect in 30 years of behavioural research, and I have certainly never encountered ratings that favoured the extreme end of the scale to the extent observed here. Given that those denying a 97% consensus among scientific experts must find a reason to reject that consensus, it’s not at all surprising that conspiratorial thinking is common among those who deny climate science. Conspiracy theories have even become a prime argument against climate policy among some top Republican presidential candidates like Ted Cruz, who said in a recent interview, I think the data is driven by politicians who have always supported more government control. However, Lewandowsky explains why he believes the results of his study are important, if not surprising, a. Conspiracism, by definition, is not skepticism. Hence it is important to show that self-anointed “skeptics” are not skeptical. b. The blog content was identified not only as conspiracist, but also as lacking in scholarly incisiveness. This is very important because it shows that conspiracism isn’t “a price you pay for skepticism”—on the contrary, conspiracism detracts from scholarly critique. c. The public is entitled to know what is happening on blogs, given that there is a pipeline from blogs to right-wing media to (in some countries) Parliament and/or harassment of meteorological and climatological institutions. The key finding of Recurrent Fury is that those who label themselves global warming “skeptics” share more in common with those paranoid of a one-world government than with Galileo."

"A massive coral bleaching event currently ravaging coral reefs across the globe could destroy thousands of square kilometres of coral cover forever, US government scientists have said. In figures exclusively released to the Guardian, scientists from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said about 12% of the world’s reefs have suffered bleaching in the last year. Just under half of these, an area of 12,000 sq km of coral, may be lost forever.  But the devastation is only getting started. The event could continue well into 2016. Noaa announced on Monday that the western Atlantic is about to heat up, turning the corals of the Caribbean bone white. When this occurs, bleaching will have hit every tropical ocean basin on Earth since June last year. In all, scientists forecast a total of 15,000 sq km of reef may not recover and losses to the world’s remaining coral reefs would be a devastating 6%. Dr Mark Eakin, the co-ordinator of Noaa’s Coral Reef Watch programme, said that given uncertainties around how long the event will continue it was very difficult to predict exactly how much reef would be wiped out. “It probably won’t be as big as 1998, so we’re probably talking hopefully no more than 10%. Even if we’re talking one to 10% of the coral reefs around the world that’s a huge amount of coral reef area,” he said. Global bleaching events have only been recorded twice before, in 1998 and 2010. Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland, said Noaa’s figures, while rough, were decent estimates of the potential damage. He said, before 1998, bleaching of this magnitude had not occurred for “hundreds, if not thousands, of years”. In 1998, a massive El Niño (an upwelling of warm water in the Pacific) set off a chain of warming events in oceans across the world that killed off 16-19% of the world’s coral reefs. Mark Eakin, the co-ordinator of Noaa’s Coral Reef Watch programme, said this year’s El Niño was playing a part, but “it’s almost certainly being driven largely by global warming”. A huge patch of climate change-generated hot water, known as ‘the blob’, has been wobbling across the northern Pacific since this time last year. It first bathed the reefs of the Hawaii and the Marshall Islands in June 2014. It has now returned to where blitzed reefs have only just begun the slow process of rebuilding.  Other hot patches of water washed through the South Sea Islands during the southern Pacific summer. Reefs in the Indian Ocean were also hammered by warm temperatures. “We are seeing real changes in the ocean as related to climate change,” said Eakin. Corals can only tolerate a narrow range of temperatures. If the water around them warms by just 1C and this lasts more than a week, they are likely to bleach. After a mild warming event it is possible for polyps to regain their colour. But under extreme warming, the corals will die, meaning new colonies will have to grow. “The recovery speed of these reefs, when you get a big bleaching event, is not a matter of a few years. It’s more on the scale of a decade or so,” said Eakin. To establish the expected loss of coral from the current bleaching, Noaa used recent research from James Cook University, which found 40% of reefs in the Seychelles that were bleached in 1998 had now been replaced by weed and algae. Once this type of ‘regime change’ occurs, corals are unlikely to return. Hoegh-Guldberg confirmed this “really high proportion” of lost corals was probably typical for massive bleaching events. “The sorts of conditions we are facing are similar to 1998 and if it continues to develop we are going to lose coral again,” he said. Hoegh-Guldberg said the background warming of climate change could also hamper recovery. After a warming event, corals that stayed stressed by even slightly warmer than normal temperatures recover more slowly. “We’ve only had a 0.8C change in global temperature,” he said. “We’re already starting on a journey where just a mild change in temperature is causing a massive deduction in coral reefs. Just imagine when we get to 2C or 3C or 4C.”  In the Marshall Islands capital atoll of Majuro, where the Guardian observed massive bleaching last year, the first, fragile signs of a recovery have been found by scientist Karl Fellenius. “Because the thermal event last July to December was severe, the coral colonies died right way. So the ‘bounce back’ would be new patches of coral on those clean skeletons, not recovery of those corals,” said Fellenius, who works on Majuro for the University of Hawaii Sea Grant programme. “There are patches of new coral both on the lagoon side and ocean side of Majuro. Stuff is growing. But that’s like saying that 100 babies were born this year in the village, a ‘bounce back’ of sorts after 100,000 people died in a catastrophe last year,” he said. But in dire news for the reefs in Majuro, and across much of the northern Pacific, the sea has begun to reheat.  “As of yesterday I see small patches of new bleaching on broccoli coral on the outer reef flat. That’s the first report [from the Marshall Islands] as far as I know,” said Fellenius.  Eakin said his models, which have predicted the passage of this event with remarkable accuracy, said the second wave of bleaching would also hit Hawaii and other Pacific island groups before moving into the Indian Ocean. “This is two years in a row, and corals getting nailed in successive years like that are really going to take a beating,” he said. This was the problem for corals worldwide as bleaching events piled one atop the other.  “The concern isn’t just about whether conditions are going to go back to normal, because we certainly expect they will. The question is how long does it take before they go back up to the really high temperatures that cause bleaching? That’s been coming much more frequently and in some areas its been getting much more intense,” he said. There are stopgap measures that can greatly assist the chance of reef recovery for the time being. When a coral bleaches, it loses its ability to clean itself of algae. Once algae cover the surface, it is impossible for coral to repopulate. Herbivorous fish graze the coral and help keep it algae free. In polluted water, algae grow faster. “Pollution and overfishing, if you’ve got a lot of that going on then coral reefs don’t recover very quickly. But if you can control those other factors you can improve the ability of corals to bounce back,” said Hoegh-Guldberg. Fellenius said he had asked the Marshall Islands government to enact temporary fishing closures during bleaching episodes. But Hoegh-Guldberg, who in 1999 predicted the loss of most of the world’s coral reefs by the middle of this century, said the only hope for coral reefs to survive long term was rapid curbing of carbon emissions to stop the world from warming more than 2C."
"It is said that the UK has the greatest wind energy potential in Europe. Our weather could give us more sites producing more energy per wind turbine at less cost than any other country in Europe. The country also has Europe’s most vocal minority of opponents of wind farms who campaign with such vehemence that it is hard to think of a more divisive issue. Offshore wind farms, which also have huge potential, do not attract such campaigners, and so Britain has become a world leader in the deployment of this technology, despite the fact that it is far more expensive. This has produced the curious result of Amber Rudd, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, pulling the plug on cheaper on-shore wind in favour of offshore, claiming in the House of Commons it is to save consumers money.  The fear she expressed is that we should have so much cheap onshore wind that companies would no longer want to invest in more expensive off-shore, tidal and other renewables still being developed. While everyone claims to want to save the planet, there is clearly a division in the new House of Commons between the Conservatives protecting the countryside against wind farms and other politicians who want to save jobs. Rudd’s announcement came as new figures emerged about the vastly increased potential for sea level rise around southern Britain. This will submerge parts of Conservative held seats. Presumably this means that potential wind farm sites will then become offshore and so qualify for subsidies."

"Scorching summers are likely to become common in the UK by the end of the century while winters turn wetter and less chilly, according to new research. Met Office researchers carried out a new analysis of long-range climate projections for the UK based on 30 year averages. It reveals that the chances of very cold British winters or soggy summers dwindle as the world warms, but could still occur in individual years.   The lead scientist, Dr David Sexton, and head of scenarios development at the Met Office, said: “Our new research provides a more detailed picture of the range of seasonal temperatures and rainfall we could see in a given year.” The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, shows the odds of having a colder than average winter in the UK dropping from around 20% in 2020 to just 4% by 2100. Very cold winters such as the one that occurred in 2009/10 will become almost non-existent. The chance of experiencing one of these is less than 1% by the end of the century.  Over the next two decades there was still a 35% to 40% likelihood of summers being wetter than average, but the odds fall to about 20% by 2100. The chances of a very wet summer – defined as 20% more rain than the 1961-1990 average – were expected to fall from 18% in 2020 to 10% eight decades later.  But by the end of the century the likelihood of experiencing a blazing hot summer of the kind now seen every 20 years rises to 90%, making scorchers the norm.  Met office senior scientist, Dr Glen Harris, who co-authored the research, said: “While there is a trend towards warmer winters and drier summers, there will still be a lot of variations in weather from year to year. Cold winters and wet summers just become less likely, and we will still have to be prepared for them.”"

"Australia’s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has played down the significance of China unveiling its post-2020 emissions reduction target, saying Beijing’s position has been known “for some time”. The world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide has pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60-65% from 2005 levels, and increase the share of non-fossil fuels as part of its primary energy consumption to about 20% by 2030.  China’s commitment, which should result in its emissions peaking by 2030, is an important precursor to global climate change talks in Paris later this year. The commitment is consistent with a joint undertaking China made with the United States last November. Australian climate groups on Wednesday welcomed China’s commitment, characterising it as a significant step forward by the most important player in the developing world. But Bishop played down the milestone. “I think China’s position has been known for some time. Indeed China and the United States announced this aspiration some time ago,” Bishop told Sky News on Wednesday. “China says its emissions will peak in 2030. Well that coincides with when its economy is likely to peak.” Australia is yet to reveal its post-2020 target. The Abbott government is expected to unveil its initial position for the United Nations process in July. Bishop said Australia, unlike some other countries, had proposed a concrete 2020 emissions reduction target, and she said she was confident Australia would meet its commitment. A range of experts have queried whether the Coalition’s Direct Action policy will be sufficient for Australia to meet the 2020 target. The government has consistently rebuffed that analysis. Bishop said the new post-2020 target would be “economically responsible, proportionate and, I believe, appropriate for Australia” – and it would take into account commitments offered by other nations before the Paris talks. But climate groups warned Australia risked lagging behind. “With China’s announcement overnight, countries accounting for over half of global emissions will have declared their initial targets for post-2020 pollution reduction,” the Climate Institute’s chief executive, John Connor, said on Wednesday. Connor said South Korea had this week released “more ambitious targets than expected, citing global responsibility as well as new business and innovation possibilities”. “Australia risks getting caught in the backwash of global climate action and economic modernisation if it sticks with laggards like Canada,” Connor said. “The tests of our soon-to-be released post-2020 target are primarily climate credibility but also carbon competitiveness.” Frank Jotzo, the director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, said China’s announcement meant it was time for other countries to get serious. “The US and EU emissions pledges will probably require less effort than what China is embarking on,” Jotzo said. “For Australia, the question what national target to offer is increasingly one of avoiding too much embarrassment by being out of step. Anything less than the US emissions target will be difficult to justify.” Samantha Smith, the leader of WWF’s global climate and energy initiative, said China was proposing a significant contribution. “This is the first major developing country emitter to set a total emissions peak target. In doing so, China has committed to both global climate security and to a transformational energy transition at home,” Smith said. On Monday a coalition of business, welfare and environment groups, and trade unions called for the Abbott government to produce credible emissions reduction commitments."
"A notorious funder of climate sceptics in the US has spent at least €550,000 (£390,908) lobbying the EU on environmental protections and energy issues over the past three years. An obscure entry on the EU’s voluntary transparency register shows that up to €750,000 (£533,049) may have been spent by Koch Industries, the largest private energy company in the US, on trying to influence EU policy.  Brothers David and Charles Koch, who own Koch Industries, fund several thinktanks in the US that deny climate change. Most recently, one of their charitable foundations was found to have have been funding a prominent Harvard-Smithsonian Center scientist and climate sceptic, Willie Soon. The Koch’s lobbying in Europe, spotted by the blog DeSmog UK, has focused on “all initiatives on the areas of environmental protection, trade and internal market,” documents show.  Its lobby focus has been on a recast of the EU fertiliser regulation, called Reach, and EU free trade negotiations, which have been ongoing with the US and Canada. Other areas of interest to the firm listed on the register include: energy, climate action, environment, agriculture and rural development. Jason Anderson, WWF’s head of European energy and climate policy, said that while the Koch brothers were “obviously the biggest problem case on climate change in the US”, any climate science-denying pitches would receive short shrift in Brussels. “Their interest in trade is slightly more worrying though given the concern that private companies would be able to exert more influence there,” he said. “We’ve been assured that important legal matters such as the precautionary principle would not be weakened but these negative forces may feel some possibility of benefit to them [from lobbying] – which is exactly what people have been concerned about.” In the US, a Greenpeace investigation found that the Koch brothers had earmarked nearly $48m to climate sceptic groups and lobbying for fossil fuels. The activist group accused the Koch brothers of funding 35 conservative and libertarian groups, as well as more than 20 congressmen and senators. In Europe, the figure cited in the EU’s transparency register could significantly underestimate the actual amount spent by the Koch family, according to LobbyFacts, a joint project between Corporate Europe Observatory, LobbyControl and Friends of the Earth Europe. “The new EU Transparency Register continues to suffer from seriously unreliable data,” the group says, adding that many companies tend to under-report their lobbying spend."

"Must child refugees remain incarcerated and brutalised if Australia is to return to a sensible climate policy? This is the horrible question now confronting all progressive Australians. By progressive, I mean those who understand the dangers of climate change and the imperative for Australia to play a fair role in reducing global emissions and who, at the same time, feel appalled that this nation can lock up asylum seekers in offshore detention centres to live, without hope, in sub-human conditions.  This is the hidden question roiling beneath preparations for the ALP national conference later this month. Despite strong opposition from Labor for Refugees, the conference is likely to endorse tow-backs, offshore detention and the whole infrastructure of systematic punishment. Recognising the party’s vulnerability on refugee policy, the Labor leadership is desperate to neutralise it as an issue in the election, which may be called this year. If it is impossible to detect daylight between Labor and the Coalition on refugee policy, on climate policy the gulf is wide. The Coalition – led by a man who denies climate science and has shown himself hostile to renewable energy, while lauding the benefits of burning coal – will do all it can to preserve the status quo and wind back policies introduced by the previous Labor government.  Meanwhile, the ALP has committed itself to reintroducing a carbon price and a number of other complementary policies (even if those policies still fall well short of Australia’s fair contribution to limiting warming to two degrees celsius). So the calculus is this: if Labor is to win the next election and put Australia back on the path towards a sensible climate policy, then it must match the Coalition in promising to maintain the ruthless treatment of asylum seekers. For the conservatives, the hope is that Labor’s historical commitment to human rights will prevail, so that the Coalition can win the election and maintain both a pitiless refugee policy and a retrograde climate policy. Of course, Coalition leaders do not accept that their refugee policy is pitiless, let alone deliberately punitive, because they believe they are good people. They have made up the “preventing drownings” argument to bolster this opinion of themselves.  The ferocity of the attacks on Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs can be understood only if we recognise that, in detailing the brutal facts, Triggs is exposing their self-deception and opening them to the possibility that they are not good people. The exquisite dilemma this situation poses for progressives has its genesis in the marked shift of public sentiment towards those seeking asylum on Australian shores. Although there has always been a strong undertow of xenophobia in Australia, the shift began some 15 years ago when then prime minister John Howard exploited it to brilliant effect with the Tampa affair, justifying the introduction of the Pacific Solution. In August 2001, Howard introduced the border protection bill, which Labor voted down. But by then an ugly anti-immigrant sentiment, already primed by the rise of Pauline Hanson, was on the loose. It was further inflamed two months later when the government manufactured a story about boat people throwing their children overboard. It went on to win the election it had been predicted to lose. Climate change policy in Australia has since become a hostage to xenophobia. It is no longer likely that the two goals of climate protection and a compassionate refugee policy can be met by electing a government both humane and serious about global warming. It is possible that the premise of my argument is erroneous and that the ALP could win the next election with a more humane refugee policy. Labor for Refugees has commissioned surveys in marginal seats that are said to show this is the case.  Analysis of the influence of refugee policy on voting intentions suggests its effect would be small and that the number of voters abandoning Labor on these grounds would be matched by the number casting a ballot for them (probably instead of the Greens). But the surveys were conducted at a time when voters’ anxieties had been calmed. If the Abbott government were to make an issue of boat arrivals during an election campaign, as they most certainly would if Labor were to adopt a less cruel policy, then the survey figures are likely to be as reliable as the opinion polls before the recent election in Britain. In the lead-up to the next election we can expect the government to manufacture stunts, like the children overboard affair. Perhaps it will allow a few boats laden with unruly refugees to almost make it to shore, before towing them back as television cameras roll. The political damage to Labor would be immense if it could be portrayed as being soft on boat people. In the longer term, the only solution is to reverse the tide of xenophobia. SBS TV’s Go Back To Where You Came From strikes me as a powerful approach because it directly counters the government’s highly effective campaign to portray boat people as non-humans, more akin to dangerous animals. In the short term, there is only one glimmer of light in this awful moral imbroglio. The treatment experienced by asylum seekers depends not only on laws and policies, but on how those laws and policies are applied.  Whereas the Coalition seems to take pride in punishing asylum seekers for attempting to seek refuge in Australia, we could expect a Labor administration to adopt a more humane approach, to implement with some compassion an inhumane policy. To paraphrase Richard Neville, those incarcerated on Nauru and Manus may discover that there may be only an inch between Labor and the Coalition, but it is an inch in which they can breathe."
"The godfather of climate denial has warned that a United Nations deal on global warming would spell “economic suicide” for America and a disaster to the world, according to a leaked fundraising letter. In the rambling 13-page letter, Fred Singer, a retired rocket scientist who rejects the science underlining climate change, appeals for at least $425,000 (£270,212) to stop what he called the “radical, economy-wrecking and sovereignty-destroying UN climate pact”.  The letter, penned on behalf of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (Cfact), an ultra-conservative group that denies the existence of climate change, suggests growing desperation about the prospects of a climate change deal emerging from the Paris meeting. Cfact did not dispute authenticity of the document. A leaked copy of the letter which was sent to Cfact supporters was obtained by the Guardian. “This is a very dangerous treaty and it is something that we think should not be supported by the international community,” said Craig Rucker, the executive director of Cfact. “We wan’t to make sure it doesn’t happen.” He went on: “It would be something that we would be very concerned about. Yes, it would not be a thing that we would relish.” Other Cfact personalities, including Marc Morano, the group’s communications chief, have warned that climate deniers are on the verge of defeat in 2015. Those anxieties about the prospect of a global warming deal in Paris have increased with the intervention of the Pope, who made a strong appeal to phase out fossil fuels to help the poor earlier this month. Rucker, in a blog post, called the pastoral letter “Rome’s greatest scientific blunder since Galileo”.  The 8 June fundraising appeal, describes 2015 as a “make or break year” for climate, and asked for $425,000 to send a delegation of “climate truth tellers” to monitor the talks in Paris. It sought unspecified additional funds to finance a spoiler film by Morano. Cfact has no formal relationship with Singer, according to Rucker. But he said Singer had written such fundraising appeals for the small Washington group in the past, and that they had tended to be lengthy letters. Within the small fringe of climate denial, Singer, who is 90, enjoys special cachet for possessing genuine scientific credentials as a trained atmospheric scientist. The Vienna-born Singer, who was forced to flee the Nazis in 1938, has long-argued that environmental regulation is a pretext for global domination. The letter re-hashes many of those arguments, saying: “President Obama is pandering to zealots on the Far Left fringe posing as environmentalists.” Elsewhere he accuses Obama of embarking on an “anti-energy regulatory jihad”. He refused to comment on the letter, saying in an email that he was in the middle of a move. Cfact is little-known outside the fringe of climate denial. In 2012, the organisation was buoyed by an in infusion of $3.7m from a secretive funding network for corporations and ultra-conservative billionaires. But that revenue stream – Cfact’s biggest source of cash – abruptly dried up the next year, when the thinktank got just $325,000 in dark money. In a further blow to the world of climate denial, the Smithsonian said on Friday it was strengthening its policies on funding and conflict of interest following revelations that the researcher Willie Soon had refused to disclose grants from fossil fuel companies in published papers.  A spokesman said Soon would have to abide by the new policies. He remains the subject of a separate investigation."
"European countries including France, Spain, Italy and Britain have issued weather alerts and the United Nations has urged countries to create better warning systems as a heatwave sweeping western Europe was expected to push temperatures to a nine-year high on Wednesday.  The heatwave, enveloping Britain, Spain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and northern Italy, is expected to last several days and has already seen temperatures rise as high as 40C. In the west of France, in Brittany and the Pays de la Loire, there was a massive power cut which saw between 600,000 and a million homes left without electricity between Tuesday night and the early hours of Wednesday morning after high temperatures affected power equipment. State authorities said it was “exceptional” for the weather to have such repercussions on power supply to homes. The heatwave sparked a further power cut in the western town of Vannes early on Wednesday morning, leaving up to 120,000 homes without electricity at 7am. In France, where temperatures in some areas have reached 40C, train transport continued to be disrupted and delayed on several lines, including between Paris and Toulouse, as metal tracks and cabling were affected. Within Paris, the RER C trains which link the capital to the suburbs were experiencing delays as trains were slowed and maintenance work was carried out to avoid tracks buckling in the heat.  France’s weather office put 40 regions on orange alert, warning of an “enduring heatwave of significant intensity requiring particular vigilance”.  France, which has activated its national heatwave emergency plan, is particularly sensitive to the risks after thousands of its elderly people in isolated areas died in a European-wide heatwave in 2003 that led to nearly 20,000 deaths. In 2003, Europe was caught off-guard by the severity of the heatwave, and authorities are currently working to ensure the most vulnerable – such as elderly people, young children and those who are ill – are monitored. Temperatures in Paris are expected to hit 39C on Wednesday afternoon, after south-west France saw temperatures of 42C and Córdoba in southern Spain recorded nearly 44C. In Paris, which has seen a spike in air pollution during the heatwave, the city hall took measures to limit drivers’ journeys, making residential parking free, imposing speed limits and encouraging use of public transport.  From Italy to the Netherlands, governments warned of the risks to older people, young children and those with serious illnesses. The UN has urged countries to create alert systems to counter the health risks of heatwaves as they become more frequent, intense and dangerous due to climate change.  For the first time, the UN’s World Health Organisation (WHO) and its World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) have joined forces to create guidelines for experts and authorities for how to lower the health risks of heatwaves such as the ones currently scorching Asia and Europe.  “Heatwaves have emerged as an important hydrometeorological hazard and will remain so, given projected changes in the frequency of extreme heat events associated with human-induced climate change,” the UN text warned.  The main recommendation was to create heatwave warning systems that highlight the health hazards and inform people what they should do to protect themselves.  While such systems exist in countries such as France, Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum of the WHO voiced concern about places such as Pakistan, where more than 1,200 people have died amid soaring temperatures in the south of the country.  That crisis came a month after neighbouring India suffered a deadly heatwave that killed more than 2,000 people.  “It is common to have weather forecasts tell people what the temperature is going to be, but in many countries they have not looked at what that means to health,” he told the news agency Agence France-Presse.   WHO and WMO are calling on countries, even those not traditionally hit by extreme temperatures, to put in place heatwave preparedness systems, allowing them to quickly alert the population to dangers and put hospitals on standby for an influx of patients suffering from heat-related ailments.  “Climate change is not only likely to bring about changes in the frequency and duration of heatwaves in ‘core’ heatwave regions but also an alteration of the geographical distribution of heatwave disasters,” WMO and WHO warned in their guidelines, based on several previous scientific studies.  This meant heatwaves might occur in places where they had not happened previously, they said.  They also warned that urbanisation had exacerbated the problem, since cities tend to be hotter than elsewhere, putting vulnerable populations such as the elderly and chronically ill more at risk."

"The White House said it would move to put more solar panels on rooftops in poor, inner-city neighbourhoods to cut electricity bills and fight climate change. The plan, to be unveiled on Tuesday in Baltimore, follows dozens of new initiatives rolled out by the White House since the start of the year to signal Barack Obama’s commitment to act on climate change – even in the face of Republican opposition.  America is in the midst of a rooftop solar boom – with installation up 139,000% in the last decade, because of falling costs.  But only about 1% of the electricity moving along America’s grid comes from solar, and nearly half of all US households are shut out of solar, because they are renters or their properties are too small to install panels, White House officials told a conference call with reporters. “We think it’s important for everybody to have access to solar energy,” Brian Deese, a senior White House adviser, told reporters. In the new solar initiative, the White House said it wanted to make rooftop solar panels more affordable and open up new jobs in inner-city neighbourhoods. Officials said they would work with housing authorities and solar companies in 20 states to improve financing packages. The new initiative – the second move by Obama to expand solar since April – aimed to install 300 megawatts of solar power in subsidised housing by 2020, officials told the call. That’s just over half as much energy as generated by the big solar farm in the Mojave desert – one of the first big solar projects backed by Obama, which went into operation earlier this year. But it represents a tripling of Obama’s initial target to install 100 megawatts of rooftop solar in subsidised housing by 2020 – a goal that has already been reached thanks to falling prices for solar panels. “The curve is really spiking up because the costs are coming down,” Deese said. Obama last April announced plans to train up to 75,000 new solar industry workers. Tuesday’s initiative is the latest in a growing series of actions intended to demonstrate to the international community that Obama remains focused on climate change, ahead of a critical set of negotiations for a global warming deal in Paris at the end of the year. Those efforts are going to take a hit as a Republican-controlled Congress returns to work after the Fourth of July holiday, with hearings in the House and Senate challenging the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to cut carbon pollution from power plants and the Obama administration’s focus on climate change as a security issue. The move also suggests a pivot for Obama from large-scale solar farms to rooftop solar. When Obama entered the White House in 2009, there were no large-scale solar farms. Now there are 17, funded by Department of Energy loan guarantees."
"Sometime in the mid 1990s, probably unnoticed by anyone, a region of the Pacific that is home to more than a dozen nations experienced something known as a “climate expulsion”. That was the point in time when the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere pushed temperatures higher than anything that natural climate changes alone could have delivered.  The finding comes in a new study from scientists at Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology and published in the International Journal of Climatology. Scientists examined temperatures between 1953 and 2010 in an area of the Pacific that includes the Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. The study analysed data from weather observations in that west Pacific region and found temperatures have been rising by about 0.15C per decade.  To find out what was behind the temperature increases the researchers ran a series of climate models to try and reproduce those real world temperature observations. Dr Scott Power, senior principal research scientist at the Bureau of Meteorology and one of the study’s authors, told the Guardian: “The only way these models can replicate the warming that has been observed is if they incorporate the increases in greenhouse gases. It is clear as day that that part of the world has warmed up. “What’s also interesting from the study is that you can see that after about the mid-1990s, every year has been warmer than it was prior to the early 1970s. We looked at this in the models and they tell similar stories. At a certain point the temperatures in this part of the world have exhibited what we would call ‘climate expulsion’ – the greenhouse gases have forced the temperature variability beyond the earlier historical experience.” The study also used the same climate models to try and get an idea of what will happen to temperatures in the region in the future, depending on how much or how little the world does to limit emissions of greenhouse gases coming mainly from fossil fuel burning.  The study found: “The magnitude of projected warming is directly and strongly linked to future global emissions of greenhouse gases, with greater emissions leading to greater warming in the Pacific.” Even under the most ambitious scenarios to cut emissions, the models in the study suggest the region will still experience between 0.5C and 1.7C of extra warming by the end of this century. This is based on where temperatures were in the period between 1961 and 1990. If the world keeps on emitting at similar rates to now, then the bad news obviously gets much worse. The region would be between 2C and 4.5C warmer by the end of this century.  What would this mean for those countries? Power said: “With these temperature rises you would expect a greater incidence of heat stress issues among humans, especially the young, the elderly and the sick, and during heat waves a likely increased pressure on hospitals and potentially increasing death tolls. “This would also put stress on plants and animals as well, including agricultural crops and wild plants. You would expect an increased risk of coral bleaching and also a higher risk of fundamental change to reef-based ecosystems.” The health of reef-based systems are especially important to island nations, because those are the places where they catch their key food supply – fish. While these island nations have contributed almost nothing to the problem of rising greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, they will be among the hardest hit. Many of these islanders fear that as the world continues to warm, sea levels will be pushed progressively higher – swamping their ancestral and cultural homes and making their islands unliveable.  The study findings will give these island nations another reason – as if they needed one – to push for an ambitious new deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions to be agreed at the United Nations climate talks in Paris in December. Unless greenhouse gas emissions are cut steeply, and soon, then it seems that if the rising seas don’t push these island nations to the brink, then the temperature increases probably will. "
"An “induced implosion” of the fossil fuel industry must take place for there to be any chance of avoiding dangerous global warming, according to one of the world’s most influential climate scientists. Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, an adviser to the German government and Pope Francis, said on Friday: “In the end it is a moral decision. Do you want to be part of the generation that screwed up the planet for the next 1,000 years? I don’t think we should make that decision.” Schellnhuber was speaking at a major science conference in Paris, taking place before a crunch UN summit in December, also in the city, at which nations must seal a deal on global warming. World leaders were sent a stark message in the communique issued by the conference, which warned that the opportunity to avoid disaster is rapidly diminishing. Laurence Tubiana, France’s climate change ambassador, said the aim of the UN summit is to send a signal that the transition from coal, oil and gas to a low-carbon economy is inevitable. If the aim is achieved, Tubiana told the Guardian, “you will see a massive acceleration [to a greener economy], particularly on the investment side in the next five years”. The conference was addressed by Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, who said the fossil fuel industry faced big challenges: “A mixture of many different changes going on – consumption patterns, civil society, political action – will be disruptive to the carbon economy.” Stiglitz, Schellnhuber and Tubiana all expressed support for the global divestment campaign, which lobbies investors to sell their stocks in the biggest fossil fuel companies. “I fully support the divestment movement,” said Schellnhuber. “Do you want to be part of an economy that is destroying the world, or part of an economy that protects creation?” Tubiana said the recent call by major European oil and gas companies for a price to be put on carbon pollution was partly the result of the “very important” divestment movement. She said: “Oil companies are like canaries in the mine. When there is no danger they are silent, but when they feel danger and opportunity they make a move.”  The Guardian is divesting from fossil fuels and is campaigning for the world’s biggest health charities, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, to do the same.  The Paris conference was attended by more than 2,000 scientists from 100 countries. Schellnhuber told the delegates: “In order to stay below 2C (3.6F) [the internationally agreed limit for global warming], or even 3C, we need to have something really disruptive, which I would call an induced implosion of the carbon economy over the next 20-30 years. Otherwise we have no chance of avoiding dangerous, perhaps disastrous, climate change.” “The promise of the fossil fuel age has never been fulfilled,” he said. “We still have 2bn people living on $2 (£1.30) a day – that is crazy.” He called for two strong messages to come from December’s UN summit: that “the age of carbon is over” and that “it is not the poor of the world who will pay for the transition”. To achieve these outcomes, Schellnhuber said: “We need a global social movement and it is already happening.” He said the best analogy for the transition from dirty to clean energy was the abolition of slavery, which was fundamentally driven by ethical concerns. The scientists’ communique said that tackling climate change is economically affordable, but that nations “waiting on the sidelines” will cause the costs to rise. It said global warming is already inflicting damage across the globe and that failing to act will lock in the dangers. Stiglitz backed the affordability of tackling climate change: “Creating a green economy is not only consistent with economic growth, it can promote economic growth,” especially when there is a lack of demand in the global economy. He said the best option for an enforceable climate deal was for willing countries to introduce carbon taxes and then penalise nations refusing to do the same with border taxes on their exported goods.  A voluntary agreement could not solve the climate crisis, he said: “The atmosphere is a public good – all want to get the benefits, but no one wants to pay the cost.” He also dismissed carbon markets as being too prone to political lobbying: “It is basically giving away money.” Stiglitz said it was unsurprising that a carbon price has proven hard to implement on a worldwide scale. “If you own fossil fuel assets, and the impact of any global agreement on climate change is going to push their value down, you are going to resist, using whatever tactics. But the interests of global society have to overcome these narrow special interests.” • This article was amended on 13 July 2015 because an earlier version incorrectly converted a 2C increase to 36F.

"The next mayor of London needs to be committed to making our city a better place to live; both more affordable and greener. The high cost of renting, public transport and low wages are one side of the challenge’ while the need to reduce CO2 emissions, tackle air pollution and offer new sources of green jobs are the other. Across the world, many other cities and countries are tackling the challenge with much more speed. London cannot afford to be left behind in this new global competition for more liveable cities.  Top of the incoming mayor’s agenda should be a commitment to extend and refine the congestion zone. The scale of air pollution in London is now so severe that urgent action is needed to encourage a switch away from diesel vehicles. We need to use public transport more, which is why I’d cut tube, train and bus fares by 10% on day one of my mayoral term and freeze them for three years – a cut of almost 20% in real terms by 2020. With London growing by an extra 100,000 people a year, greener transport will be critical to tackling air pollution. Low-emission cars, buses and lorries are increasingly being road tested. Car clubs, the new wave of cycling businesses and the new green crowdsourcing platforms are just a few other examples of businesses the mayor should be encouraging. The extra revenue raised from an extended congestion zone needs to be invested in electric cars and buses and making cycling safer. That means extending the number of electric car charging points across the city and setting out a plan tomake London’s buses green. With Formula E – the electric car equivalent of Formula 1 – successfully taking place in London recently, there is a new opportunity to champion a switch to electric cars, reducing pollution dramatically and thereby helping to promote better public health in London. I’d want to put mayoral support behind the new wave of green living – encouraging new ideas for a London urban park, community gardening and other community co-operation. The mayor should also follow the example of Toronto and Paris and introduce a green roofs law, requiring either a green roof or solar panels on any big developments they are responsible for, to promote biodiversity and lower emissions. Renewable energy is rarely promoted as a major part of London’s future. But the new mayor needs to encourage businesses promoting solar power, energy from waste, district heating and show leadership on energy efficiency.  Transport for London, under my leadership, would publish a strategy for decarbonising its energy use. With Crossrail and Crossrail 2 on the horizon, TfL is set to become an even bigger user of electricity. It needs to work with London’s sustainable businesses to develop new sources of local power that create jobs and apprenticeships for Londoners and help keep more of the money we spend on energy in Londoner’s pockets, rather than in the pockets of the big six energy providers. London has huge untapped potential for generating solar power. I want the solar industry to see London as one of its key hubs – leading the debate in Britain, but increasingly across Europe on how the energy market can be decentralised, opened up to smaller businesses, and where social enterprises and community energy can flourish alongside more traditional businesses.  In the same way that farms rent out their land to wind-farmowners and developers, I want London to offer up its roofs for a new wave of solar businesses. I’d start by identifying TfL and City Hall-owned roofs that could be rented out for community or business solar use. And I’d work with digital businesses to help crowdsource the funding for these solar community co-ops and guarantee that TfL would buy up the spare power, if it’s generated in London by Londoners or London businesses. Aviation will dominate the next mayor’s liveability inbox with a third runway at Heathrow firmly on the political agenda. It offers the opportunity to accelerate the greening of the aviation world – with lower-emission aircraft given preference, further incentives to new passengers to use public transport and further investment in low-carbon vehicles on the airport and noise insulation.  The most significant cause of pollution from a third runway would be the number of cars travelling to the airport, which is also why I would want to make it a condition that Heathrow invest in the extra public transport links.  Lets’ be clear: a third runway is in London’s interest. The 40,000 jobs, 10,000 apprenticeships and the boost to London’s global status are too important to turn our back on, but the new mayor must use their power and influence to turn Heathrow into the world’s greenest airport. By focusing just on Heathrow, it is possible to ignore the urgent action that the next mayor needs to take to decarbonise London’s energy needs and tackle the pollution caused by congestion on our roads. London isn’t Britain’s greenest or most liveable city yet. The next mayor will have failed if there hasn’t been a radical improvement by the end of their time in office."
"Europe will likely get more than half of its electricity from renewable sources by the end of the next decade if EU countries meet their climate pledges, according to a draft commission paper. A planned overhaul of the continent’s electricity grids will now need to be sped up, says the leaked text, seen by the Guardian.  “Reaching the European Union 2030 energy and climate objectives means the share of renewables is likely to reach 50% of installed electricity capacity,” says the consultation paper, due to be published on 15 July. “This means that changes to the electricity system in favour of decarbonisation will have to come even faster.” The EU has set itself a goal of cutting emissions 40% on 1990 levels by 2030, and an aspiration for a 27% share for renewables across Europe’s full energy mix, which includes sectors such as transport, agriculture and buildings that do not necessarily rely on electricity. Around a quarter of Europe’s electricity currently comes from renewable sources. Oliver Joy, a spokesman for the European Wind Energy Association welcomed the draft text but noted the 27% goal for 2030 was non-binding, and some countries were looking likely to even miss an earlier goal, for 2020, that is binding.  “Even with a binding provision, we are seeing the Netherlands, UK and France potentially missing their 2020 target [to source a fifth of energy provision from renewables].”  Joy called for the commission to deliver a governance system for renewables that prevented slacker states from hiding behind the more fast-moving ones. Downing Street would almost certainly resist more stringent oversight from Brussels on renewable energy. Other measures put up for discussion in the paper could be an anathema to the government’s eurosceptic backbenchers. One question in the consultation document linking market distortions to divergent energy taxes and charges, leaves the door open for proposals to harmonise taxes. These would raise hackles with several countries, the Conservative MEP Ian Duncan warned. “I can’t believe that common taxes are the right approach for opening up markets,” he told the Guardian. “If we get bogged down in the the notion of common taxes, it will drag the whole thing down – and it won’t be pretty I’m afraid.” The paper also proposes intraday cross-border power trading between countries so that renewable energy can be instantly dispatched to meet demand, without the need for storage. This kind of trading only takes place on a day-ahead basis at present. "
"Governments must rethink plans for new coal-fired power plants around the world, as these are now the “most urgent” threat to the future of the planet, the head of the OECD has warned.    In unusually strong terms for the organisation – best known as a club of the world’s richest countries – its secretary general Angel Gurria, told governments to think “twice, or three, or four times” before allowing new coal-fired plants to go ahead.  “They will still be emitting years from now,” he warned. As a result, many could turn into “stranded assets”, having to be mothballed decades before their economic lifetime had expired. “We are on a collision course with nature,” he warned. New research, published by the OECD on Thursday, has found that, on current trends, coal-fired power generation will result in more than 500bn tonnes of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere between now and 2050. That is the equivalent of about half of the “carbon budget” – the amount of greenhouse gas that we can safely pour into the atmosphere – for this half-century, if we are to stay within the 2C limit that is widely agreed as the threshold for dangerous climate change. Gurria said that financing from rich countries to provide access to renewable energy in developing nations as an alternative to coal should form a key part of the discussions in the run-up to the crunch UN climate talks in Paris in December. Governments are hoping to agree a new deal on greenhouse gas emissions involving all countries, to take effect from 2020 when current commitments expire, and with absolute cuts in emissions from the rich nations and curbs on the growth of future emissions from the poor. Coal has become a more popular form of generation in recent years as it has fallen drastically in price. This is one result of the shale gas boom in the US, which has seen gas prices tumble, with gas-fired generation taking off in turn, and a glut of cheap coal thrown on to international markets. In addition, many developing countries have coal mines but no indigenous gas resources, making it seem an attractive option for cheap power generation. Gurria argued, however, that coal was “not cheap” when the full costs – including climate change impacts, air pollution and its effects on health – were taken into account. “Governments need to be seriously sceptical about whether coal provides a good deal for their citizens.” He said the cost of renewable energy was reducing rapidly, and so it represented a good investment for developing countries and donors to them. “Prices have been falling very, very fast, to [levels] that we would not have imagined a few years ago,” he said, in comments to journalists ahead of a lecture at the London School of Economics. Although rises in global greenhouse gas emissions have been slowing, Gurria warned that “we have our work cut out for us” to bring about the falls needed to meet the carbon budget necessary to keep within 2C of warming compared with pre-industrial levels."
"European Union ministers are seeking an ambitious, durable and legally-binding deal to curb global warming, enforced through five-yearly reviews, a draft of their position statement for UN climate talks shows.  EU environment ministers meet on 18 September in Brussels to iron out their joint position ahead of the UN talks in Paris in December. Diplomats have already drawn up a draft text.   The Paris climate agreement must be “legally binding in order to enshrine the strongest expression of political will and provide predictability and durability“, says the EU ministers’ draft seen by Reuters.  It calls for five-yearly reviews to ensure temperature rises are capped at 2C, the necessary limit according to scientists to prevent the most devastating climate change.  The EU ministers will promise more money to help deal with the impact of changing weather, although the detail of “scaling up the mobilisation of climate finance” is left for EU finance ministers meeting in October to decide.  Developing nations say that cash is essential for them to sign a new deal.  Europe has pledged to curb its emissions by at least 40% by 2030 versus 1990 levels, which EU diplomats say is likely to remain the deepest reduction on offer.  China, the world’s biggest emitter, has not formally submitted its plans to the United Nations. But its premier has said the nation sets itself a target of peak carbon dioxide emissions around 2030 or sooner if possible.  EU emissions, which account for about 10% of the world total, compared with China’s roughly 25%, peaked in 1979.  On Monday at summit talks with the EU in Brussels, China is expected to issue a joint call to tackle climate change as one of “the greatest threats facing humanity“.  Chinese support is considered crucial to avoiding a repeat of the failed Copenhagen UN summit in 2009, the last attempt to reach a global climate deal.  Increasingly, China acknowledges the need to grow sustainably and is developing pilot emissions trading schemes along the lines of the EU Emissions Trading System.  One of the Chinese projects includes aviation, giving EU officials hope a global market-based solution to cutting aircraft pollution will be agreed as part of the follow-up to any Paris deal, although they acknowledge talks on the issue are difficult.  The draft for the September meeting says the International Maritime Organization and International Civil Aviation Organization should in 2016 “regulate in an effective manner emissions from international shipping and aviation“. "
"If the Guardian’s aim with its Keep it in the Ground campaign is to draw attention to the issue of fossil fuel divestment, then they have already succeeded. The Paris financial community is turning out in force on Thursday to talk about the merits of selling shares in oil, coal and gas companies ahead of UN climate talks in December – versus the alternative of keeping the shares and engaging with directors. Companies are keen to be (and be seen to be) on top of this issue. I just wish, if all this energy is to be devoted to the divestment issue, the campaign could focus on something more relevant to preventing dangerous climate change than whether or not a couple of charities hold shares in some not-very-profitable coal companies. The Guardian’s campaign focuses on persuading the Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to divest their endowments from fossil fuel companies. So far, both have declined to do so. Many UK and US universities are under heavy pressure to “divest from coal” – whatever that means.  Investors are suspicious of activists and scientists telling them where to put their money. That is entirely understandable. Speaking as one who thought the world wide web was a bit of a nerdy fad of my particle physics colleagues in the 1990s, I’m certainly not in the business of giving anyone investment advice. What the scientific community can do, and something we aren’t doing very well at the moment, is tell investors what is going on. This is point of the Oxford Martin Safe Carbon Investment Initiative which we are launching at the Assemblée Nationale on Thursday. If investors want to know whether their portfolios are contributing to dangerous climate change, they should be able to find out. And right now, they can’t. People don’t even know what to look for. Sure, there are consultants out there who will tell you whether you (or your fund managers) hold any “pure coal” companies: but what exactly do you achieve by getting out of coal if you thereby boost the fracking industry when there is plenty of oil and gas out there to push us over 2C already? Or selling your coal interests to a state-owned corporation that probably has a lot less interest in ensuring they are exploited efficiently than you do?  More sophisticated consultants will measure your portfolio carbon footprint, or the amount of greenhouse gases generated by the companies you own last year. It’s a start, but it completely obscures the point that climate change is a stock problem: it is the total amount of carbon we dump in the atmosphere that matters, not the rate we dumped it last year. A company might boast about reducing its carbon footprint while at the same time opening up vast new oil and gas reserves in the Arctic, vastly increasing our committed future cumulative emissions.  Investment is supposed to be about the future, and so is the divestment campaign. Yet ironically, the whole debate is stuck in the present. People are bickering about what companies are doing now and ignoring the plans they are quietly putting in place for future emissions. These plans either commit us to dangerous climate change, or commit future taxpayers to a planetary scale clean-up programme that would make the great bail-out of the bankers look like a gallic shrug. The test is really simple: stopping climate change means getting net global greenhouse gas emissions to zero. The IPCC and G7 have acknowledged this and, who knows, perhaps the UNFCCC will do the same in December. So if we are serious about holding global temperatures to 2C, we need a plan to get net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by the time human-induced warming reaches 2C. It’s about 0.92C now and rising at about two-hundredths of a degree per year. More seriously, the gap between current human-induced warming and 2C has narrowed by 5% since 2009, when the 2C goal was welcomed by many progressive companies and investors. So any company or investor with a plan to get to net zero by 2C should be 5% of the way through by now. So where are these plans, and how are they doing?  It is time for the divestment campaign to start asking some more interesting questions."
"If you wandered around planet Earth 100,000 years ago you would have come across at least half a dozen distinct species, or sub-species, of human. At least one, Homo erectus, centred around East Asia, lasted for nearly two million years. That makes the duration of us, recognisably modern Homo sapiens, at around 200,000 years, seem modest.   It will remain so if Yuval Noah Harari, author of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is correct. He suggests on current trends we’ll be lucky to see out the millennium.  Some of those other human species we seem to have absorbed, such as the Neanderthals whose DNA we carry, while others we probably drove to extinction, directly or inadvertently. Scratching for positives you could argue that at least we don’t discriminate over who or what we push over the edge, including ourselves. Is this, counter-intuitively what we will be remembered for – if there is anything or anyone else to remember us? Not our art, technology or great cities, but our epochal knack for driving others, and possibly ourselves in the process, to extinction? That we are living through the planet’s sixth great (or not so great) mass extinction event was reinforced again last month. A new paper by scientists from the US and Mexico confirmed that vertebrate species, conservatively, are being lost at a rate up to 100 times faster than the natural background rate. So, like some super accelerated ageing process, we’re losing in a year what otherwise would have taken a century. The rate for invertebrates isn’t known. Usually when we reflect on what makes us different as a species it is things such as our large brains (Homo sapiens meaning, roughly and controversially, ‘wise man’), or our complex language and tool-handling ability that come to mind. But what if, reduced by the long view of history, our significance is marked out simply by our destructive ability? That would be ironic. In Caleb Scharf’s recent book The Copernicus Complex the question of our significance is reduced, in effect, to one about the likelihood of life in general, and our lives in particular, existing at all. In that view, if common, we’re insignificant. If the opposite is true and we’re rare, we matter. He reveals still-evolving planetary systems, including our own, that are not fixed but are dynamic and bewilderingly diverse. You see just how much luck and chance (a lot) meant that we could evolve at all. It gives a view of the future suffused with darkness like the voids between stars. Life is “ultimately condemned to a distant future of bleak isolation within an increasingly indecipherable universe.” But do things have to be incredibly rare before they matter or take on significance, and is there not enough here on Earth for rich fulfilment? Watch someone, almost anyone, experience childbirth and you might think differently. Whether we’re alone in the cosmos or not, we can still experience joy and wonder, and that creates significance out of nothing, much like the universe coming into existence itself.  A slightly reductive laboratory view equating rarity with significance may even be part of the problem. Because one of the things that truly marks us out as a species is our consciousness and remarkable ability to experience empathy – with some now pushing an empathy revolution.  And, related to that, there is our skill at cooperation. An injection and cultivation of these facets and abilities can develop our significance positively, and may even save our species’ reputation from being cemented as the dark destroyers. The Parliament of Things is an innovative writing contest that does just that, inviting people to put themselves in the position of a thing or animal and imagine their voice. What would they say about the world as it is right now, being shaped by human civilisation? If that sounds like a stretch, consider that in New Zealand recently a river was granted legal personhood with two advocates designated, one of them Maori, to speak on its behalf. The organisers point out that in the Old Norse, English and Dutch, an assembly was called a Ding, or Thing, and was used to settle disputes and find consensus. Up until 1 September you can imagine yourself as something else in 500 words, or how a parliament of things itself might work in 2,000 words. Being able to express a sense of extended responsibility in this way, which humans are capable of in abundance, is itself rare and significant among life forms. Our human species appears not as happy as the last one standing, seemingly at war with itself and the rest of life. And yet we’re gifted with empathy and the ability to wonder consciously at the world we’re in. Much remains yet to explore, for which our physical senses are inadequate. Our highly evolved sight stumbles at the invisible light spectrum. A dog’s sense of smell is over 1,000 times more sensitive than ours, meaning they inhabit a different world to us. Perhaps, like hope being the last thing plucked from Pandora’s box, our other great, unusual talent - imagination - could be the thing to save us."

"Britain finally confronted the point of a decision on a difficult question that it had ducked for far too long. Or, at least, that is how the Airports Commission presented its endorsement of an extra runway at Heathrow. The airwaves reverberated with the voices of the sort of men who never shrug off a boyhood Airfix fixation, arguing with burning intensity about whether the precise spec and coordinates of the Heathrow proposal, and its Gatwick rival, had the makings of a world-beating hub. A few voices were raised about the “environmental” effect, in the sense of the immediate local environment – questions of noise, of birdlife and the extra fumes that could soon be inhaled by the suffering lungs of Middlesex. These are all real issues, but together with the diversionary debate about “where” rather than “whether”, they pale besides aviation’s contribution to the planet’s slow cooking. If there is a difficult question that has been ducked for too long, then that is the one about decarbonising the economy. To be fair to Sir Howard Davies, his commission did not ignore carbon. The report predicated its projections of passenger growth on two scenarios, both of which it said could respect UK carbon obligations. The first involved a rigid cap on aviation emissions, a little above current levels. The commission stuck a finger in the air and ventured that this might be compatible with a 61% rise in passengers by 2050, a calculation that must rely on engineering advances easing the brute, energy-intensive physics of lifting people and machinery into the air. The emphasis, however, and the basis for arguing that increased capacity was not merely desirable but imperative, was on a second, fairytale future, in which passengers double, under the auspices of comprehensive and globally enforced carbon trading.  At a time when European integration is under strain, the invitation here is to imagine that something akin to the EU emissions trading system is first extended to the rest of the world, and then made so much more effective that the carbon price rises from a few euros a tonne to something in the hundreds. If all this can be put into practice, then, the theory runs, the value of UK flights will be such that the aviation sector will be able to outbid British factories and foreign enterprises in the scramble for carbon rations. That is a dubious proposition. For all the talk of Heathrow as an engine of growth, many of the new jobs would be low-tech and low-pay: serving the coffee in another Costa, or lugging more suitcases out of holds. The official figures confirm that the proportion of flights dedicated to business is lower than it was at the dawn of the millennium, the result not only of passing recession, but also the march of things like Skype, which allow more business meetings to be held online. Seeing as – in all likelihood – the price of carbon is not going to rise to the point where the climate problem is fixed, the pertinent question is whether the actual price of flying is going to get closer or further away from where the planet would want it to be. Building more capacity is going to reduce the cost of taking an extra flight: that is its principal aim. It will mean more people choosing to fly, rather than holidaying closer to home, or taking the train. Indeed, nothing betrays the mindset more than the way in which the commission held up the downward trend in regular domestic flights into Heathrow as if this were a problem. It is part of the solution. In 2009, David Cameron stood against expanding Heathrow, linking his opposition to support for high-speed rail. That grand project may be on track, but other important rail upgrades have just been postponed. The Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign has pointed out that existing fossil-fuel stocks are more than sufficient to unleash climate chaos; the same thing is true of the existing infrastructure. Transport networks need to be re-engineered for decarbonisation. But that would require some real blue-sky thinking, and of that there is no sign."
"The Queensland government will use new real-time water quality monitoring to take action against industrial and agricultural polluters of the Great Barrier Reef, says the state environment minister. Steven Miles also defended the role of the state’s largest coalminer, BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA), as a cornerstone investor in the “eReef” tool, despite carbon-driven climate change being the reef’s greatest long-term threat.  The online tracking, which models the effect of sediment and chemicals in reef waters via satellite, will be showcased to world heritage committee members in Germany next week before Unesco’s final ruling on whether to list the reef as “in danger”. Asked whether BMA’s involvement in the project was ironic, Miles said the miner’s contribution showed their “commitment to … managing whatever impacts their business might be having on the reef”. “I’ve said repeatedly that the big long-term threat to the reef is ocean warming and acidification, both caused by carbon pollution,” he said. “Much of what we’re doing here is about resilience, making sure the reef is in the best possible shape to deal with those coming threats. “I think what you’re seeing in terms of BHP’s involvement is their intention to be a long-term positive contributor to Queensland and to support our efforts to protect the reef and I certainly welcome that.” Miles said the chance to address climate change would be at the UN conference in Paris in November and called on the federal government to implement “targets that will see Australia do what it needs to do to limit global warming to 2C”. Scientists hope the tracker will help transform stewardship of the reef, with the public able to measure progress in checking flows of sediments, nutrients and pesticides into reef waters via local rivers. Miles said eReef would also be a useful tool for the government in forcing local industry to stop or limit pollution. “What this will do is strengthen our case in going to particular industries and sectors and saying, look it’s no longer a suspicion that what you’re doing is having an impact, we know it is and here we can show you,” he said. It also partly addressed recent concerns flagged by the state auditor general about the need to “invest more in the science that tells us what impact we’re having”.  “So we can say, you don’t need to take our word for it, you can jump on eReef and can compare two similar storms, compare the sediment impact to see whether it’s making a difference,” Miles said. “It’s not all the solution by any measure and the bigger and harder thing we need to do is to have more monitoring, so we’re measuring more and modeling less.” Miles also believed eReef would make a “powerful” impact on Unesco delegates before the final ruling on the reef. “It’ll certainly be one of the tools we’ll have with us to show the member countries just the scale and level of our investment in monitoring the reef and monitoring our impact over time,” he said. “One of the things that’s hard to explain to people around the world is just how big and complex this system is. They’re much more used to dealing with world heritage sites that are much, much smaller.  “So being able to show the scale and how we’re gradually getting our data down to more granular levels, we can much more accurately see where the changes we’re making are working.” Scientists hope satellite advancements will soon enable viewers to go from square kilometres to square metres at high resolution. Their aim is to achieve realtime monitoring, as opposed to daily monitoring, by 2017. Crown of thorns starfish outbreaks, and the health of coral and seagrasses will also be monitored. Dr Andy Steven, the CSIRO research director on coastal development and management, said eReef gave “an unprecedented ability to provide current conditions and even forecast conditions so that we can start to respond and anticipate”. BMA joined the federal government, CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology and the Science and Industry Endowment Fund in putting $11m into the foundation running the project after an initial $3m investment from the Queensland government."
"The government must explain how its withdrawal of support from onshore windfarms will affect the cost of meeting greenhouse gas emissions targets, and urgently set out plans for alternative electricity generation, its statutory advisors on climate change have said. One of the first policy announcements from the incoming Conservative government was that support for onshore windfarms would be withdrawn from 2016, and planning procedures put in place that will make it much harder for any new windfarms to be brought forward. This is likely to severely restrict the development of any new onshore wind farms in England, despite the fact that they are the cheapest form of renewable electricity generation. This in turn will push up the cost of reducing emissions, and meeting renewable energy targets set for 2020. Lord Deben, the chairman of the committee on climate change, said that the job of the committee stopped short of advocating particular measures, but that it could advise ministers on the likely overall effect of their climate policies. He said: “This [end of subsidies to onshore wind] is a political step by the government, and it is perfectly reasonable for them to do – as long as they are prepared to allow people to know what the cost is going to be, and what they are going to do instead [to meet climate targets].” Under the Climate Change Act, ministers must respond to the committeeby mid-October. This means the government will be forced for the first time to put a price on its controversial quasi-ban on new onshore wind farms, and set out how the resulting shortfall in renewable energy generation will be made up. The committee on climate change, set up under the Climate Change Act to advise ministers on how to meet long-term greenhouse gas targets, produced its first mandatory report on Tuesday, setting out its assessment of previous policy and its projections of whether the UK would meet its future carbon targets. The report found that although there had been progress in meeting targets up to now, there is doubt over policies beyond 2020. Unless there is clarity on longer term policies, investment in vital infrastructure – such as renewable energy, greater efficiency and lower-carbon transport – is likely to be deterred. Deben added that so-called subsidies to renewable energy were not true subsidies. “Fossil fuels are subsidised, as fossil fuel [companies] do not bear the cost to the community. Support for renewable energy is a way of levelling the playing field so they can compete.” He said that onshore wind was now on a par, in cost terms, with fossil fuels, if the real cost of carbon emissions was factored in, and that taxpayer support for renewable technologies was rapidly bringing down their cost. Matthew Bell, chief executive of the committee, said: “Investors have no idea what the framework will be [beyond 2020] to allow them to analyse and make their investments.” He said policies needed to be brought forward as a matter of urgency in the new parliament. The Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “We are committed to meeting our climate change target of an 80% emissions reduction by 2050. We have already made great strides to that goal, with emissions down 30% since 1990. There’s still much work to do and we will continue to power our move to a low-carbon economy at best value to consumers.” Green campaigners urged ministers to act. Simon Bullock, the senior climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “This report turns up the political heat on the government, with crucial decisions due imminently on new runways and coal that could lock us into decades of pollution. Ministers must listen to the alternatives recommended by its official advisor: more support for clean energy, better insulated homes, and a huge energy efficiency drive.” The report is likely to be more controversial among Conservative backbenchers, some of whom are hostile to the Climate Change Act, which sets out emissions limits more than a decade ahead for the UK, in the form of “carbon budgets”. Ministers must show how their policies will meet these budgets. The report also included sharp criticism of the UK’s readiness for tackling the effects of climate change, saying that the government’s current national adaptation plan “does not amount to a coherent programme” and urging action on flood defences, water supply, reducing heat stress and soil fertility.  Hospitals merit particular attention, according to Lord Krebs, chairman of the sub-committee on adaptation, because nine out of 10 wards currently are liable to over-heat in the hotter temperatures that are likely to become the norm. Nick Baveystock, director general of the Institution of Civil Engineers, said ministers must act: “There is a growing need for a more comprehensive approach to UK resilience, one that better reflects interdependencies, or the domino effect where the failure of one system, such as a flood defence, affects the operation of the other networks [such as water and sewage, transport, power and telecommunications].”"
