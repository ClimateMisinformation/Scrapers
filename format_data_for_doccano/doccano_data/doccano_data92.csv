"The fragrant jasmine rice growing on the left side of Kreaougkra Junpeng’s five-acre field stands nearly five feet tall. Each plant has 15 or more tillers, or stalks, and the grains hang heavy from them. The Thai farmer says this will be his best-ever harvest in 30 years and he will reap it four weeks earlier than usual.  It is very different on the other side of the field. Here, Junpeng planted his rice in closely spaced clumps of 20 or more seedlings in shallow water just as he, his father and millions of other small farmers across south-east Asia have always done. He used the same seeds but the conventionally grown plants are wind-battered and thin, and clearly have fewer, smaller grains. Junpeng is part of a pilot project to see if it’s possible to grow more rice with less water and fewer greenhouse gases. The dramatic difference between his two crops points a way to help the world’s 145 million small rice farmers, and could also greatly reduce global warming emissions from agriculture. The project, backed by the German and Thai governments and by some of the world’s largest rice traders and food companies, has seen 3,000 other farmers in this corner of Thailand’s “rice basket” near the Cambodian border trained to grow sustainable rice according to the principles of a revolutionary agronomical system discovered by accident in Madagascar in the 1980s. Jesuit priest Henri de Lalanié working in the highlands observed that by planting far fewer seeds than usual, using organic matter as a fertiliser and keeping the rice plants alternately wet and dry rather than flooded, resulted in yields that were increased by between 20 and 200%, while water use was halved. Giving plants more oxygen, minimising the competition between them and strictly controlling the water they receive is thought to make them stronger and more resilient to flood and drought. When it was first employed outside Madagascar in 2000, the system of rice intensification (SRI) was dismissed  by a handful of scientists who questioned the legitimacy of the reported increased yields. But since then, it has evolved and been developed by peasant farmers working in many different climates around the world. Academic criticism has since all but disappeared and the SRI system of farming has been validated in hundreds of scientific papers and adopted by up to 20 million farmers in 61 countries, according to the SRI information centre in Cornell University. “The results consistently cite yield increases, decreased use of seed, water and chemicals, and increased income,” says Norman Uphoff, professor of global agriculture at Cornell. Vietnamese, Cambodian, Nepalese, Filipino, Indian and African farmers have all reported large increases. In 2011, a young Indian farmer broke the world record for rice production, harvesting 22 tonnes from a single hectare (2.47 acres). “SRI is very positive in west Africa. It uses fewer seed and fertilisers and needs less water. Farmers saved up to 80% of the cost of seed and got increased yields and incomes. They see the advantages and they change. People are teaching each other now,” says Professor Bancy Mati, director of the water research centre at Jomo Kenyatta University in Nairobi, Kenya. The Thai farmers who took part in the Ubon Ratchathani trial say they are delighted. Says Khampha Bunchansee from Noan Dang village: “It was very easy to learn. I will use the extra money to invest in a tractor. If I can do it, anyone can. Everyone can come and learn.” “I applied more fertiliser on my conventional crop but it produced lots more leaf but not more grain,” says Wanna Sriwila, also from Noan Dang. “Now I bring other farmers to see what can be done. Seeing is believing.” But what is now exciting some of the world’s largest food corporations and governments is that growing rice along SRI principles also greatly reduces emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane, which escapes when rice, or any other crop, lies waterlogged for weeks at a time. Methane is roughly 30 times more powerful than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, and rice emits as much as 1.5% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. With the human population in south-east Asia expected to grow by around 100m people in the next 20 years, emissions from rice growing could increase 30% or more. The urgency to act for the global good, self-interest in maintaining production and the possibility of accessing money to reduce farm emissions has now led heavy rice-using food companies like Mars and Kellogg’s, and the agri-business colossus Olam, to set up the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP). This coalition of companies, NGOs and governments sets the world’s first voluntary sustainability standards for rice growing. It adopts the basic SRI principle of planting seedlings further apart, and keeping them moist rather than flooded, but adds targets and measurements to provide consistency. “Rice is both a victim and a cause of climate change,” says Sunny Verghese, CEO of Singapore-based Olam’s, which grows its own rice on 25,000 acres in Nigeria, owns mills and processing plants across south-east Asia and ships nearly 20% of the world’s globally traded rice. “South-east Asian rice farmers are among the world’s most vulnerable to climate change impacts such as rising sea levels, salinity, temperature rise and droughts. Yields can decrease as much as 10% for each 1C temperature increase, threatening food security for billions of people. “With another two billion people we cannot carry on the way we are. We must go beyond what is currently being done and achieve far more at greater scale. We must re-imagine the whole food supply chain if the world is to become carbon neutral by 2050,” he says. “SRI should influence everyone’s thinking. In Nigeria we saw a 70% increase in yields, albeit from a low base. SRI is revolutionary. It is a genuine change in thinking. It is difficult for scientists to understand that an amateur [like Lalanié] should have a solution. We want to partner with SRI, to scale up in Africa. “But reducing emissions from rice cannot be a trade-off that hurts farmers and communities who depend on it for their income and sustenance. We have to measure the true cost of food and dismantle the subsidy system.” Working with German development agency GIZ and south-east Asian governments, Olam now plan to roll out SRP rice to 100,000 farmers in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and India within five years, increasing yields and incomes, and reducing methane emissions by 50%. Governments and global bodies must act too, says tropical agronomist Erika Styger, director of climate-resilient farming systems at Cornell University who led a three-year World Bank study of 50,000 farmers using SRI methods in 13 west African countries. This saw a 56% rise in yields in irrigated areas, an 86% increase in rain-fed areas and an average 41% increase in income. “The SRI revolution is happening. People are changing their practices and you can see SRI in the field in many places now. There is no reason why SRI should not become normal agronomic practice,” says Styger. “But there is no long term funding. If we want to make it mainstream it needs to get to a critical mass. We are left with breadcrumbs, with only short-term project finding,” she says. “The food system is broken. Olam on its own cannot fix it, we can only change it. We can’t do it overnight but there is a new way of collaborating. Companies must change and reduce their resource intensity. The whole food sector must change,” says Verghese. “What is needed now is large retailers to brand SRP. It’s the way we can reduce emissions, use less water and grow more. Win. Win. Win.”"
"I’ve long felt America, particularly the south, where I grew up, is in the “denial” stage of grief when it comes to our psychological response to climate change. The sixth mass extinction has begun, our oceans are warming 40% faster than scientists anticipated, and the US’s carbon dioxide emissions rose 3.4% in 2018. How, I wonder, is everyone so calm? So business-as-usual? The field of ecopsychology explores our connection to nature, and the way it affects our state of mind. Many of us fail to realize how essential that connection is. Given that southern Florida – with its billions of dollars of vulnerable real estate on exposed coastline – is considered by many scientists as ground zero for climate change, I started my listening tour there. Floridians receive a constant stream of bad climate news. I was curious: does the state of the environment – specifically, the pending losses of biodiversity, tourism and property, and the prediction of category 6 hurricanes – keep people up at night?  After a long morning of driving through the Everglades, I stopped at Joanie’s Blue Crab Cafe, a vibrant red shack on the side of Highway 41 in Ochopee. “Sit anywhere you like, baby,” Lisa, the waitress, said. I grabbed a bottle of Coors from the cooler, and sat on the sun-soaked back deck overlooking a stretch of water lined with sawgrass and frequented by alligators. Over a few hours I saw cypress swamps, mangrove forests, osprey, bald eagles, roseate spoonbills and sandhill cranes. Even though there has been a 90% loss of wading birds in the Everglades this century, there is still so much left to lose. “You’re having the blackened grouper sandwich,” Lisa said. “So good it will make you cry.” Lisa was right – the grouper was incredible. And crying wasn’t out of the question. The government shutdown had given my trip a raw feeling. That morning signs were posted at the national park sites: “Enter at your own risk.” The Everglades – the largest subtropical wilderness left in the United States – is an environmental treasure imperiled by pollution, toxic algae blooms, disrupted water flow and politicians who favor big industries like sugar. Climate change denial and avoidance are prevalent here. The new governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, announced surprising plans for big environmental reforms earlier this month, without mentioning climate change (a term his predecessor, Rick Scott, also refused to use). Many people I spoke to in the Everglades didn’t want to talk about climate change. They considered it too political. After I got home, I reached out to Erica Henry, a biologist who studies at-risk butterfly populations in the Florida Keys and Everglades, for her take. “You could be fatalistic about the fact that the news is bad, or that particular species seem doomed,” she said. “You could be paralyzed. But I’ve picked off my little piece, the problem I can help solve.” I drove north, through Florida’s panhandle, witnessing miles of extensive tree damage from Hurricane Michael. I thought I’d hear tales of increasing environmental anxiety over rising seas, and the misery of enduring hurricane seasons in the era of climate change. But in nearly all of my conversations, I encountered more resolve than anxiety. I booked a charter boat out of Ocean Springs, near Biloxi, to see Mississippi’s barrier islands. My captain was Matthew Mayfield, a chef, restaurateur and fisherman with an infamous smoked tuna dip. As we pointed the skiff away from the Gulf Coast, he recalled how his wife’s dresses were caught in the branches of the oak trees after Hurricane Katrina, just waving around. We found a pelican skull and tail tracks of a small gator as we walked the white sand beaches of Horn Island, made famous by artist and conservationist Walter Anderson, who notoriously rode out Hurricane Betsy tethered to a tree. Mayfield told me about the clouds of monarchs that pass through in the fall. Generations from now, Horn Island may be gone. On the way home, I worked up the courage to ask Matthew why he rebuilt his life on the coast. “Why do you stay?” I asked. He said he needed time to think about it. In the days that followed, he sent me reasons and pictures of the family property, colorful sunsets, local food, and a tame fox. “People that live here realize that the reward greatly outweighs the risk and pain of a storm,” he explained. “No one really cares how much you make or what you do for a living. Maybe we have a bond that storms intensify.” “Don’t you worry about the future?” I asked. “I can’t live my life like that,” he said. A few days later, I stood across the street from the Saint Louis Cathedral in New Orleans, where 13 years ago Hurricane Katrina took down massive oak trees, ornamental fencing, a portion of roof and the marble hands of a statue of Jesus Christ. Cammie Hill-Prewitt, who coordinates residencies for artists focused on the environment for Tulane University, agreed to talk to me about the spiritual tax of living on the coast in the era of climate change. She evacuated for Katrina, but stayed through Isaac, pregnant and with three house guests. “I grind my teeth during hurricane season,” Hill-Prewitt admitted. “But I have a 30-year mortgage. My partner owns restaurants. It’s not easy to leave.” “We’re not exactly zen about it,” she clarified. “If you came back in September, when it’s hot, and there are four tropical depressions looming in the Atlantic, you’d get different responses. Incredible how short our memory is.” While waiting for the annual Joan of Arc parade to start, we talked about a kid she knew who processed the trauma of Katrina through his Lego play for years, building houses then smashing them to pieces. Thousands of people had lined the street, drinking, wearing sequined dresses and feathered hats. The drums started. A green paper mache dragon was hoisted into the air, followed by angels, then Joan of Arc on a well-trained horse. Hill-Prewitt leaned over to me. “This is why we stay,” she said. Later, I met Anna and Cam working at The Little Toy Shop near the bustling Cafe du Monde. They were in elementary school when Katrina hit. When I ask if they were anxious about climate change forecasts, Anna shrugged. “Maybe for a year or two after Katrina,” she said. Then she said something quietly profound. “You just learn not to get too attached to things.” From New Orleans, I drove through Mississippi, from Natchez, to Piney-Woods, and finally Oxford, where I joined Heather McTeer Toney for coffee. She was the first African American mayor of Greenville, Mississippi, and a former Obama appointee, overseeing the south-east region of the Environmental Protection Agency. I wanted to hear about her experience with frontline communities, people living near levees and in flood zones. “Our story of climate change and the south has always been about attachment to land,” Heather explained. “It’s generational. Cultural. This is our home and we’re as intertwined as flesh and blood.” Heather agreed with me that the south – particularly communities of color – is often unfairly painted as uniformly oblivious, and disinterested, when in fact the conversation is just taking place in a different language. “We talk about climate concerns daily, but express our fears through the changes we see in hunting, fishing and farming instead of carbon emissions and PM2 standards,” she said. “We understand it quite well and are fearful for the future of our homes and children.” During my trip, I thought that I might observe more of a cultural tipping point, an urgency in places that need it most. But I found that many members of coastal communities have built up psychological resilience after living through years of extreme weather. Avoidance and denial are proven coping mechanisms. And, frankly, most people are just trying to work and get through the day, and express concern for the future differently, from off-record conversations to outright advocacy. But continuing to reckon with a science-based reality – as painful and worry-inducing as it might be – is an important step toward informing meaningful, individual action. Home is an emotional commitment. We’re an adaptable species, but also habitual and sentimental; that’s one reason we’re stuck in denial. It’s the reason change is going to hurt so much."
"Removing coal from the global energy mix is taking too long, too many forests are still being destroyed, and fossil fuel subsidies are ongoing despite their distorting effect on the market, a  study has found. There has also been insufficient progress in agriculture to stop harmful practices that increase carbon dioxide production, and heavy industry is not doing enough to use energy more efficiently, according to analysis carried out by the World Resources Institute thinktank. Without progress on all these fronts, the world is unlikely to see global greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2020, which is likely to be necessary to stay within the 1.5C or 2C warming thresholds that scientists have identified as key to the future safety of the planet. But the analysis also found important steps forward, on renewable energy, curtailing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, and public sector investment in reducing emissions. These suggest progress in other aspects of tackling climate change is also possible, with greater effort from the public and private sectors. The WIR looked at six key goals that have been pegged as necessary to cause emissions to peak in 2020 and achieve the targets of the 2015 Paris agreement. They include goals on energy, transport, land use, industry, infrastructure and finance. The report found that renewable energy accounted for about a quarter of global electricity generation in 2017, and more than two-thirds of new power generation capacity. By 2020, electricity from renewables is likely to be consistently cheaper than fossil fuel energy, making it possible that 30% of electricity could come from renewable sources by 2030, one of the Mission2020 milestones. But coal-fired generation is still increasing, with coal-fired power plants continuing to be built in some areas, while existing plants are not being removed from service fast enough. Electric vehicles, meanwhile, comprise 1.4% of overall sales, making a 2020 milestone of 15% of new car sales hard to reach. The goals are the work of Mission 2020, a global coalition of several climate analysis organisations, headed by Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who negotiated the Paris accord. Mission 2020 has calculated that if these milestones are achieved by 2020, it will make the longer-term Paris goals possible – because progress now on reducing emissions will make it easier and cheaper to reduce them in the longer term – and wants to spur sufficient progress on climate change to bring that about. Figueres is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos to press political and business leaders for more support for climate change initiatives. She said: “The impacts [of climate change] have never been as clear, nor action so urgent, as we are quickly approaching tipping points of no return. It would follow, then, that leaders everywhere should now be discussing this number one concern as their number one priority.” She added: “The decisions we take over the next two to three years are crucial for the unprecedented structural changes we must embark on to safeguard our climate and clean up our air. This is the make it or break it opportunity we have, knowing that the world is expected to invest about $90tn on infrastructure in the period up to 2030, with much of this investment to be programmed in the next few years.”"
"The 16-year-old activist behind the fast-growing School Strikes 4 Climate Action has taken her campaign to the streets of Davos, to confront world leaders and business chiefs about the global emissions crisis. Greta Thunberg, whose solo protest outside Sweden’s parliament has snowballed across the globe, will join a strike by Swiss schoolchildren in the ski resort on Friday – the final day of the World Economic Forum.  Thunberg travelled by train for 32 hours to reach Davos, and spent Wednesday night camped with climate scientists on the mountain slopes – where temperatures plunged to -18C. Having already addressed the UN Climate Change COP 24 conference, Thunberg is rapidly becoming the voice for a generation who are demanding urgent action to slow the rise in global temperatures. As she travelled down Davos’s funicular railway from the Arctic Base Camp – while more than 30,000 students were striking in Belgium - Thunberg said the rapid growth of her movement was “incredible”. “There have been climate strikes, involving students and also adults, on every continent except Antarctica. It has involved tens of thousands of children.” Wow! They're back and this time they're 32,000 strong! These students want #climateaction and they are not going to stop marching until they get it! Be Like Them!!!#ActOnClimate #Klimaatmars #Youth4Climate #ClimateMarch #klimatstrejk #FridaysForFuture via @Green_Europe pic.twitter.com/Jra5Zq4TLg Thunberg started her protest by striking for three weeks outside the Swedish parliament, lobbying MPs to comply with the Paris Agreement. After the Swedish election, she continued to strike every Friday, where she is now joined by hundreds of people. “This Friday I can’t be there,” she told the Guardian. “So I will have to do it here in Davos, and send a message that this is the only thing that matters.” Students around the world have been inspired by Thunberg, with thousands skipping school in Australia in November. Last Friday there were strikes in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland, where more than 20,000 students skipped school. Missing gym class, geography and religion each Friday is something of a sacrifice for Thunberg, who says she loves school and can’t pick a favourite subject. “I like all subjects. I love learning, which people maybe don’t think about me.” She’s also been forced to give up her hobbies, as climate change activism has taken more of her time. “I used to play theatre, sing, dance, play an instrument, ride horses, lots of things.” She’s sanguine, though, pointing out that climate activism is much more important: “You have to see the bigger perspective.” Thunberg said she would like more students to join her strike. “That would have a huge impact, but I’m not going to force anyone to do this.” In the UK, only a small number of students have so far begun strikes, including 13-year-old Holly Gillibrand in Fort William. But plans are now being made for a big strike on 15 February. Thunberg predicts there will be protests in many locations. She believes parents should be supportive if their children tell them they’re striking on Friday. “Everyone keeps saying that the young people should be more active, and they’re so lazy, but once we do something we get criticised.” The world’s scientists warned in October that, without a dramatic ramping up of action to cut emissions, global temperatures would rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with severe consequences for humanity. Thunberg believes the older generations need to acknowledge that they have failed to protect the environment. “We need to hold the older generations accountable for the mess they have created, and expect us to live with. It is not fair that we have to pay for what they have caused,” she says. Thunberg has also called on business leaders and politicians to commit to “real and bold climate action”, and focus on the “future living conditions of mankind” rather than economic goals and profits. In a video address for leaders attending Davos she says: “I ask you to stand on the right side of history. I ask you to pledge to do everything in your power to push your own business or government in line with a 1.5C world.” Thunberg has been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, which she believes helps her see the problem of climate change clearly. “My brain works a bit different and so I see things in black and white. Either we start a chain reaction with events beyond our control, or we don’t. Either we stop the emissions or we don’t. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival.” The school strikes last Friday were by far the biggest to date. In Germany, an estimated 30,000 students left their schools in more than 50 cities to protest, carrying banners including: “Why learn without a future?” and “Grandpa, what is a snowman?” One 17-year-old student in Kiel, Moritz, told Deutsche Welle: “We want to help shape and secure our future so that there will be another world for us to live in in 60 years.” In Belgium, 12,500 students went on strike last Thursday and plan to strike weekly until the EU elections in May. Some teachers were tolerant of the truancy. Patrick Lancksweerdt, in Brussels, said: “Education has to turn youngsters into mature citizens. By their actions, they proved that they are.” School strikes also took place in 15 cities and towns in Switzerland. In Geneva, 12-year-old Selma Joly said: “Frankly, I would rather demand climate action than go to school. Otherwise, years from now, we may no longer be here.” Janine O’Keeffe, who helps coordinate and keep track of the school strikes from her home in Stockholm, Sweden, was surprised at the scale of last week’s actions: “I am still in shock, actually – a nice kind of shock.” Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace, says youth activism on climate change gives her hope. “The 15-year-olds just speak truth to power.”"
"The risk to global civilisation from nuclear weapons and climate change remains at an all-time high, according to a group of prominent US scientists and former officials, who said the world’s predicament had become the “new abnormal”. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced that its symbolic “doomsday clock”, unveiled every year, was stuck at two minutes to midnight, the same as last January. The only other time the Bulletin has judged the world as being this close to catastrophe was 1953, in the early volatile stages of the cold war. The reasons given by the Bulletin’s panel of experts included the collapse of arms control treaties, and the emphasis in Washington and Moscow on modernising nuclear arsenals rather than dismantling them, and the lack of political will to reverse climate change. “We are like passengers on the Titanic, ignoring the iceberg ahead, enjoying the fine food and music,” said Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, said. Since leaving office this month, Brown has become the Bulletin’s executive chairman, citing the imminent threats to humanity. “It’s late and it’s getting later. We have to wake people up. And that’s what I intend to do!” The former US defence secretary William Perry said that the summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore last June, succeeded in calming some of the “hysteria” in the standoff between the two countries, but had not led to any North Korean moves to dismantle its nuclear arsenals. Perry pointed to Trump’s declared intention to suspend compliance with the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty on 2 February, and serve notice of US withdrawal, as a sign of the erosion of contacts between the world’s most heavily armed nuclear weapons powers. “When you withdraw from treaties you are losing this important vehicle of dialogue,” Perry said. “We will have only one [arms control] treaty left, the New Start treaty, which could very well go away when it expires in another two years.” “My own judgment is, relative to a year ago, we are slightly worse off,” Perry said. Rachel Bronson, the Bulletin’s president, said there should be no comfort taken from the fact that the clock did not move forward over the past year. “This new abnormal is a pernicious and dangerous departure from the time when the United States sought a leadership role in designing and supporting global agreements that advanced a safer and healthier planet,” Bronson said. “The new abnormal describes a moment in which fact is becoming indistinguishable from fiction, undermining our very abilities to develop and apply solutions to the big problems of our time.” As governor of California, Brown introduced emissions controls and other regulations aimed in part at mitigating the impact of Trump’s decision to walk out of the Paris Climate accord, but he said that states and businesses could not combat climate change effectively without support from the White House. “I find that the political response is alarming. It’s akin to sleepwalking,” Brown told reporters on Wednesday night. “We’re headed toward a very bad situation on the climate front and it will drive many more migrants to the border and create more political instability politically. So all the problems we have are going to be made worse and we may have passed a tipping point where we can’t make them better in any reasonable time and so that will undermine the entire basis of democratic governance.”"
"A chemistry master at school was universally known by the nickname Cleg, at least when he was out of earshot.  When quizzed, older pupils revealed that a Cleg, Haematopota pluvialis, is a particularly nasty form of fly that you do not notice until pain alerts you to the fact it has cut a hole in your skin and started to suck your blood.   It is very similar to a horsefly, except smaller, silent and stealthy, so normally not detected until the damage is being done. At the time it seemed a rather apt name for an unpopular master, never happier than when wielding a cane, but was completely forgotten about until last summer’s heatwave.  The wet spring benefited the overwintering larvae and the hot summer was ideal for the adults. Bites were frequent, painful and itchy for days.  But all those years ago the boys had got it wrong – it is only the females that bite and suck your blood to provide the nourishment for the eggs they are about to lay. The males lack the sharp mouthparts to cut through your skin and are harmless nectar eaters and beneficial pollinators.  It is too early to say whether last year’s unwelcome population surge will be repeated; the larvae do not emerge as adults until May. "
"The level of climate-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is forecast to rise by a near-record amount in 2019, according to the Met Office. The increase is being fuelled by the continued burning of fossil fuels and the destruction of forests, and will be particularly high in 2019 due to an expected return towards El Niño-like conditions. This natural climate variation causes warm and dry conditions in the tropics, meaning the plant growth that removes CO2 from the air is restricted. Levels of the greenhouse gas have not been as high as today for 3-5m years, when the global temperature was 2-3C warmer and the sea level was 10-20 metres higher. Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C rise above pre-industrial levels that scientists advise, according to the UN. But the past four years have been the hottest on record and global emissions are rising again after a brief pause. “Looking at the monthly figures, it’s as if you can see the planet ‘breathing’ as the levels of CO2 fall and rise with the seasonal cycle of plant growth and decay in the northern hemisphere,” said Prof Richard Betts, at the Met Office’s Hadley Centre. “The graph is a thing of beauty, but also a stark reminder of human impact on climate. Each year’s CO2 is higher than the last, and this will keep happening until humans stop adding CO2 to the atmosphere.” “This news is worrying and compelling,” said Prof Nick Ostle, at Lancaster University. “It represents a call to innovate with rapid and radical responses to offset these growing emissions.” He said cuts in fossil fuel use, deforestation and emissions from livestock were needed: “It’s a massive challenge but there are real opportunities to make an impact individually and globally.” The Met Office has a good record of forecasting global CO2 levels and predicts that the average rise over 2019 will be 2.75 parts per million (ppm). That would put it among the highest annual rises in the 62 years since good records began. Only years with strong El Niño events, 1998 and 2016, are likely to be higher. The rise in 2016 was 3.39ppm. In the decade after the first measurement on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa in 1956, annual rises were less than 0.9ppm per year. An El Niño event occurs when the tropical Pacific swings into a warm phase, causing many regions to have warmer and drier weather. Trees and plants are natural carbon sinks because they absorb CO2 as they grow, but this is reduced in El Niño years. “This year we expect these carbon sinks to be relatively weak, so the impact of record high human-caused emissions will be larger than last year,” said Betts. The Met Office forecasts an average CO2 level in 2019 of 411ppm. Monthly averages are expected to peak at 415ppm in May, before the growing season temporarily reduces levels to 408ppm in September, when CO2 will begin rising once again. The level of CO2 in the atmosphere before the industrial revolution sparked the large-scale burning of coal, oil and gas was 280ppm. “It never rains but it pours,” said Prof Dave Reay, at the University of Edinburgh. “Our own CO2 emissions are still increasing, and now the world’s natural carbon sinks are set for a bad year too. We know these sinks have been mopping up around half of all our emissions to date. We can only hope their faltering in 2019 is just a short-term blip, as without their help any chance of a safer climate future will turn to dust.” Prof Jos Barlow, also at Lancaster University, said the rising destruction of forests is serious concern: “This has been a particularly bad year. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased to around 8,000 square kilometres in 2018, which is equivalent to losing a football pitch of forest every 30 seconds. There are also worrying signs that deforestation is occurring at a faster rate in other Amazonian countries, such as Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.”"
"Victoria may experience its hottest day since the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires on Friday, with its main power stations at reduced capacity after a third coal-fired generator shut down overnight. Energy minister Lily D’Ambrosio told 3AW radio on Friday morning that she “can’t rule out brown-outs” with three generators across the Yallourn and Loy Yang A power stations out of action, meaning the state is down more than 1000MW of power generation capacity.  “We have aging coal-fired power stations,” D’Ambrosio said. “They are becoming less reliable.” Between 5,000 and 10,000 homes lost power for a few hours overnight, but those faults have been attributed to localised issues. The Alcoa aluminium smelter at Portland in western Victoria also reduced production for an hour on Thursday night to reduce demand, and South Australia — which experienced a record breaking heatwave on Thursday including a high of 46.6C in Adelaide — switched on emergency diesel generators for the first time. However the Australian Energy Market Operator said it was not expecting blackouts on Friday. Temperatures in Melbourne reached 35C by 8am on Friday, and hovered around 30C overnight. Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster Chris Godfred said the sweltering night would have set records for high minimum overnight temperatures, but for a slightly cooler morning on Thursday. BoM records are taken in 24-hour intervals from 9am to 9am, and in some places — such as Shepparton in northeast Victoria, which was 27.8C at 9am on Thursday but did not dip below 29.1C overnight — that meant minimum temperature records remained intact. According to the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO, Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910, and temperatures will increase in the future. So how will climate change affect future heatwaves in Australia? The CSIRO and BoM have compiled different models for predicting the outcome of climate change in Australia to produce a guide to how different regions will likely be affected. They found that every part of Australia will continue to experience increases in average temperature, and will have a higher frequency of hot days. The duration of hot spells will increase in every region. In many areas in the northern half of Australia, the average number of days above 35C could increase by two to three times. Late in the century, towns such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Broome  may experience days with temperatures above 35C for about a third of the year. These higher temperatures will also result in higher evaporation, which will continue to make drought conditions worse. Melbourne was forecast to reach 44C by mid-afternoon, approaching the all-time hottest day of 46.4C on 7 February 2009, when Australia’s deadliest bushfires killed 173 people, burned through 450,000 hectares and destroyed more than 2,000 homes. A cool change was expected to bring relief by 4pm but gusty north and north-westerly winds were predicted to sweep across the western districts of the state, with a chance of dry lightning, before hitting the capital city in the afternoon. The combination, coming after months of drought in northern areas, has created a very high fire risk. Firefighters in Victoria and Tasmania are on high alert and have warned campers and bushwalkers to rethink their plans to head out early for the long weekend. Large swaths of the Tasmanian wilderness are already burning. Victorian emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp told ABC News Breakfast he had 500 firefighters in control centres across the state and 60 aircraft on standby. “We are ready,” he said. “What I keep saying is are you, as the community of Victoria, ready? Have you downloaded your Vic Emergency app? Do you know who the emergency broadcaster is? Because if you’re travelling around and you’re enjoying the last of the holidays, you need to be able to access good information to make good decisions.” Crisp urged people to be sensible in the heat and said that since December emergency services had received more than 300 callouts for people or animals who had been left in hot cars — averaging about 10 a day on really hot days. There is a total fire ban in both states. The fire danger for parts of south-east Tasmania, around Hobart, has been set at severe. The fire danger rating for the Mallee and Northern Country districts of Victoria is extreme on Friday, with a severe rating for the Wimmera, South West, Central and Western and Southern Gippsland areas. Heatwaves and prolonged drought have caused mass fish kills in western NSW as well as mass deaths of feral camels and horses in central Australia, renewing already loud calls for Australia to take serious action on climate change."

"Josh Frydenberg has defended the Coalition’s record on climate change and says he will work hard to earn the trust of his constituents in the face of a challenge from long-time Liberal and now independent Oliver Yates. Yates, a former Macquarie banker and head of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, confirmed on Wednesday he would run in Kooyong at the coming federal election, declaring Frydenberg deserved to be challenged because of a lack of action on the environment.  Yates told Guardian Australia that Frydenberg, now treasurer, “had plenty of opportunity to stand up in relation to the environment when he was minister, or even now, as a more influential person, but he’s failed to discharge his duty in relation to environmental responsibility”. Frydenberg told reporters climate change was “real” and he defended the government’s policy record. “The Coalition takes very seriously our international and domestic responsibilities and obligations to reduce emissions,” he said. In rebutting Yates’ arguments, Frydenberg did not mention the policy he tried to implement as environment and energy minister, the national energy guarantee, which was scuttled when party conservatives moved against Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership last year. But he said he was “proud of the work we’ve done to support the renewable energy target” – a mechanism Tony Abbott as prime minister attempted to wind back, and conservatives within the government still oppose. Frydenberg said the government continued to fund abatement through the emissions reduction fund, which the Coalition declined to top up in last year’s budget, although the government has signalled more recently that the fund, a vestige of the Direct Action policy, will get a cash injection ahead of the federal election, and its remit could be broadened to look after threatened species and their habitats. He also referenced ongoing work on energy efficiency and said the government would deliver “the world’s biggest pumped hydro scheme” in an expansion of Snowy Hydro. The government is yet to confirm whether it will back an expansion adding 2,000MW of new generation capacity, which was approved by the Snowy Hydro board in mid-December. Frydenberg says the Coalition has presided over a reduction in per capita emissions, but emissions have been rising since the Abbott government repealed the carbon price legislated by the Gillard government. The latest government projections show that Australia will miss its 2030 emissions reduction targets, despite Scott Morrison’s regular assertion that the country is on track to meet its obligations “in a canter”. The report, released in late December, says emissions in 2030 are projected to climb 4% above 2020 levels, driven by higher levels of liquefied natural gas production, growth in agriculture, increased transport activity and a drop in the amount of carbon reduction from activities such as reforestation in the land use sector. It projects emissions from all sectors, except for electricity, waste and land use, will grow by 2030. A new report from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has found that Australia is not on track to meet its 2030 emissions targets under the Paris agreement and needs to bring its environment policies into line with the “scale of the challenge” the country is facing. Yates joins other high-profile independents facing off against Liberals in the coming contest, with a number, including barrister and former Olympic skier Zali Steggall, who will take on Abbott in Warringah, citing inaction on climate change as a central motivation. There is also continuing speculation that Julia Banks, a Liberal who quit the government for the crossbench late last year, will run against the health minister, Greg Hunt, in the Victorian seat of Flinders. Yates will face an uphill battle to unseat Frydenberg in Kooyong, a prized Liberal seat held by party leaders including Robert Menzies. The treasurer and deputy Liberal leader tends his local turf assiduously, and won the seat in 2016 with a primary vote of 58%, which was a positive swing of 2% on the previous federal contest."

"Australia is “on the cusp” of a transport revolution but the country will miss out if it doesn’t end the policy vacuum that has so far kept the electric vehicle industry from growing, according to a Senate committee report released on Wednesday. “[Electric vehicle] uptake in Australia lags behind that of other comparable countries due to a relative absence of overarching policy direction from Australian governments,” the report said.  The result is that there are only around 7,300 electric cars on Australian roads, with most people unable to afford current models. This is negligible compared with countries like Norway and New Zealand, which have clear government policies to support the rollout of the new technology. The committee warned that Australia will miss out on the environmental, health, social and economic benefits of the growing industry should governments fail to act. “Australia is on the cusp of the most significant disruption and transformation of our transport system since the advent of the internal combustion engine,” the report said. “Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, cost savings for vehicle owner-operators, increased job opportunities and economic growth, improved health outcomes and increased fuel security are just some of the benefits that Australia can realise as EV use begins to climb.” The committee made 17 recommendations including calling for a national plan to manage the rollout of electric cars. Other recommendations include a dedicated taskforce to develop this plan, a national target to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles on Australian roads, more “coordination” with operators to expand the existing charging network and a national target for government fleets. There are currently 12,691 vehicles in the commonwealth fleet, but only 12 are electric. On costings obtained by independent senator Tim Storer, it would cost an extra $5m by 2022 to start converting half the government fleet to electric by 2025, or an extra $2.7m to do the same by 2030. Behyad Jafari, head of the Electric Vehicle Council, welcomed the report’s findings as a step in the right direction. “For our part it’s yet another endorsement, this time by the Australian Senate, that there’s a massive amount of evidence to support a mass switch to electric vehicles,” Jafari said. “The report really emphasises the fact that something should be happening. We welcome the report, but also say the recommendations need to be acted on urgently.” According to the Climate Council, transport is Australia’s second-largest contributor to greenhouse gas pollution after electricity, contributing 18% in 2018. This makes electric and other clean-energy transport critical to addressing climate change – a fact not lost on the Australian public. In polling released Wednesday, the Australia Institute surveyed 1,449 people across the country on specific policies to support the uptake of electric cars. While most opposed more direct policies such as a ban on the sale of petrol cars after 2030, it found the overwhelming majority were supportive of encouraging their uptake. Almost four in five people said they wanted the government to expand the network of charging stations and to ensure new cars sold in Australia were more fuel efficient – even if they cost more. Roughly three in four said they wanted to see the government add more electric cars to its fleet and ensure new apartment blocks were required to install electric car-charging stations. Richie Merzian, director of the Climate and Energy Program at the Australian Institute, said the results showed the public support was there and it was time Canberra stepped up. “The appetite for Australians to pay more for their cars if they believe there are core benefits came through quite strongly,” Merzian said. “There’s some really strong support for low-hanging policies that the government could take up. “All that’s missing now is federal government support.”"
"Jeremy Corbyn considered it wasting time at a “billionaires’ jamboree”, referring to a quarter of the cabinet flying to Davos in the middle of the Brexit impasse (The week that was, Environment, 26 January). Greta Thunberg (Mountain mover, 26 January) clearly didn’t think it was a waste of time. Taking 32 hours to get there by train, the 16-year-old activist practised what she preaches. What could be more important than the future of our planet? As she said in her speech: “Either we choose to go on as a civilisation or we don’t.” Our leaders apparently don’t: private jets, Davos “gridlocked with limos” (What we learned at Davos, 26 January). Not a mention anywhere of a crisis, or climate emergency. But if we don’t take this desperate situation seriously, if we don’t act “as if our house is on fire” (Thunberg), Brexit will not matter in the least – Theresa May, Corbyn and thousands of other world leaders will have wasted their time.

"Pasta, protein bars and granola bars made from insect flour are to go on sale in Selfridges to highlight alternative proteins for inclusion in mainstream diets. Amid growing awareness of the environmental impact of livestock farming – and the benefits of reducing meat consumption – the British department store is the latest retailer to tap into the rising recognition of the benefits of eating insects on both nutritional and environmental grounds.  Basil fusilli pasta and raspberry and pumpkin seed granola – made from flour from ground buffalo worms – will go on sale in Selfridges’ food halls this week, along with dark chocolate and fig protein bars made with cricket flour. The products have been developed by the specialist French brand Jimini’s, which sells through Spanish and German supermarkets and is aiming to expand its presence in the UK. The new products are exclusive to Selfridges. Environmental experts have long recommended insects as a sustainable food source that could help end world hunger and reduce the damaging impact of meat production. Insects are also nutritious, containing essential proteins, fats, minerals and amino acids. A regular portion of buckwheat pasta usually contains about 10g of protein, whereas Jimini’s insect fusilli contains 18g. Jimini’s cereal bars contain 20% protein and granola 14% – both products are blended with a selection of fruit and nuts for variety of texture. The products will be promoted in Selfridges initially in themed, pop-up “bug bars” but may remain on sale permanently. Edward Goodman, the food buying director of Selfridges, said: “We are sure our epicurious customers will be surprised and delighted discovering the new range in store.” In the UK, food choices are becoming increasingly important in the debate about how to counter climate change, reflected in the rise of “flexitarianism” whereby a largely vegetable-based diet is supplemented occasionally with meat. In November, Sainsbury’s became the first major UK grocer to stock edible crickets – selling the roasted insects as snacks in small bags from the UK brand Eat Grub in 250 of its stores. “Having sold over 10,000 packs of Eat Grub crickets in less than three months, we’re continuing to see Sainsbury’s customers explore edible insects as a new sustainable protein source,” said Katherine O’Sullivan, Sainsbury’s buying manager. “We’re always looking to provide our customers with new and exciting products such as these.” The global edible insect market is forecast to exceed $520m (£395m) by 2023, according to recent research. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization said at least 2 billion people regularly consume insects and they could help meet the food needs of the world’s growing population. More than 1,000 insect species are eaten around the world but they hardly feature in the diets of many rich nations. In the UK, crickets and other insects have so far been predominantly limited to quirky pop-ups or sales through online outlets and feature on a few restaurant menus."
"Fish fingers and cod and chips are under a far greater threat from carbon emissions than previously thought, according to a recent study that has grave implications for food security. The North Atlantic cod stock in the Barents Sea is likely to first rise and then crash, possibly to almost zero before the end of the century if climate change isn’t addressed, says the scientific paper, published by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme.  The grim forecast is based on the most comprehensive study to date of the effects of climate change on cod, which – for the first time – takes into account ocean acidification as well as warming. It found larvae mortality rates were 75% higher when exposed to the combined pressures of the two factors – both of which are caused by emissions – than to heating alone. As a result, fish numbers, catches and revenues will decline faster than previously estimated. The Barents Sea, which is in the Arctic, is a major source of seafood nutrition for northern Europe. Along with Iceland, it is a key source of cod imports into the UK, which has over-fished its own waters. More Atlantic fish are migrating into this region as a result of global warming. But this ocean has the highest level of acidification in the world because cold water absorbs more carbon dioxide, which changes its pH level. It is also the ocean that is experiencing the fastest rates of heating. While the global average is a rise of 1.1C since the start of the industrial revolution, the coastal breeding grounds of the cod in the Barents Sea have experienced a temperature increase of 3.5C. Unless the warming trend is controlled, the stocks will see a boom and then a bust. A temperature rise of up to 4.5C is beneficial to the cod. By this time, catches are projected to be worth 255 million Norwegian kroner per year (£23m). But after this point, the larvae rapidly start to die off. At 6C of warming (less than 3C for the rest of the world), they completely disappear. Even if nations keep to their Paris commitments, which is currently not the case, global temperatures are on course to rise above 3C, which would mean well over 6C for the Barents Sea. The numbers, which were released on the fringes of this week’s Arctic Frontiers conference in Tromsø this week, may yet prove an under-assessment of the risk because oxygen depletion – another side-effect of man-made climate change – is not accounted for. “We are trying to show the magnitude of risk and it looks very significant,” said Martina Stiasny, one of the co-authors. “This is one of the most important fish stocks in the world. It will be a problem for food security.” Responding to the findings, the Norwegian environment minister, Ola Elvestuen, said the study showed the need for urgent cuts in emissions. “The first task is to stop this happening. This is one more piece of news that shows the need for urgency. We must work to stay within 1.5C. We need to move forward really fast.”"
"Dramatic increases in the rate at which ice on Greenland and East Antarctica is melting are, along with the heatwave gripping Australia, among the latest manifestations of the changes our planet and its atmosphere are undergoing. Concerns surrounding the risk of melting ice causing sea levels to rise were previously focused mainly on large glaciers. But scientists have discovered that the largest recent losses from Greenland’s vast ice sheet, which is two miles thick in places, have occurred in the island’s largely glacier-free south-west. Combined with recent analysis of retreating Antarctic glaciers that were previously thought to be stable, this new research makes unnerving reading. This is because of what it tells us about the extent of likely sea level rises, and warming seas linked to coral die-off and chaotic weather, but also because it highlights the difficulty of fully understanding the climate system.  Last year the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change urged governments to work towards the most ambitious targets in the 2015 Paris agreement, and a global temperature rise not greater than 1.5C. Many experts fear that factors including the election of Donald Trump in the US and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil mean that even the more modest goal of sticking to current commitments, putting the world on course for a 3C rise, remains a huge challenge. Currently, global carbon emissions are still rising. But if people all over the world are getting used to the idea that higher temperatures and increased frequency of extreme weather events are the new normal – recent polling in the US suggests 72% of Americans believe global warming is important, the highest-ever figure – we are arguably less advanced in our understanding of warming oceans.  The sea level rises that scientists expect to accompany a temperature rise of 3C would submerge cities including Shanghai, Osaka and Miami along with parts of Rio de Janeiro and Alexandria – less than a century from now. Among nations, Bangladesh will be particularly severely affected, with one estimate suggesting that 250,000 people are already forced to move each year, making them environmental refugees. Such facts on the ground, as well as predictions, are why climate activists have long linked their cause to wider concerns around social justice. Just as carbon emissions must be limited to protect the livelihoods of people already struggling in areas vulnerable to drought and desertification, sea level rises must be restricted to protect the millions of people who live on coasts and in low-lying areas. The movement of peoples around the world, including but not limited to refugees, is in some cases a direct consequence of changes to the environment. Weather and climate systems are complex, and sea levels are hard to predict confidently. Already, ice sheets and glaciers are surprising scientists by behaving in unexpected ways. But while trying to limit future emissions remains the most pressing task, these ominous findings highlight the need to address the consequences of carbon already emitted. Sea level rises will continue long after emissions have peaked. We will have to adapt to our world’s changing shape."
"The distinguished medical journal The Lancet has issued not one but two apocalyptic warnings about our food in under a month. One of its special commissions reported earlier this month that civilisation itself was at risk from the effects of the current food system on both human health and the Earth’s ecosystems. This week comes the next instalment from another special Lancet commission which finds that pandemics of obesity and malnutrition are interacting with climate change in a feedback loop and represent an existential threat to humans and the planet. The modern western diet has become a highly damaging thing that needs a complete overhaul if we are to avoid potential ecological catastrophe. It concluded that we need to halve global meat consumption, and more than double the volume of whole grains, pulses, nuts, fruit and vegetables we eat. Cue howls of indignation from big food and its cheerleaders, the libertarian right. Those nanny statists have gone nuts eating their own double dose of nuts! Cue cries of distress from champions of local, low-impact agriculture who include grass-fed animals, and their meat and manure, in their sustainable mix. These self-appointed experts don’t understand farming! Cue grim food wheels with only a quarter of a rasher of bacon or a fifth of an egg a day. Those miserabilist medics want us all to go vegan! Yet the evidence that our diets are the largest cause of climate change and biodiversity loss is now overwhelming. The global food system is responsible for up to 30% of total greenhouse gas emissions, the livestock sector on its own accounting for about half of that total or 14.5%. The modern western way of eating is also making very large numbers of people fat and sick as other parts of the world adopt it. Diet-related diseases now cause roughly 11 million deaths a year as preventable cancers, heart disease and strokes, obesity and diabetes have spread along with our way of eating. More than 800 million people are estimated to be chronically undernourished, and 2 billion suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, yet at the same time 2 billion are overweight or obese. In poorer counties you can even find obesity and stunting within the same family as calorie-heavy but nutrient-light processed industrialised foods are adopted. In other words, something has gone horribly wrong and we don’t have much time to fix it. The so-called “reference diet”, published in the first Lancet report, has caused uproar in some quarters. This is a theoretical attempt to answer the Malthusian question: if the global population reaches 10 billion by 2050 (as is anticipated), will there be enough food to meet everyone’s basic nutritional needs without cutting down more forest, polluting more water courses and generally destroying the planet? The answer it comes up with is yes, but only if we share things out differently, and stop feeding a quarter of the world’s grain to animals. The reference diet models each person globally having 14g of red meat a day, 29g of chicken, a fraction of an egg, 250g of dairy, a little fat or oil, very little sugar, and lots of grains and lentils, vegetables and nuts. And here’s where the trouble begins, because calculated day by day and universally these allocations make for a pretty depressing plateful. They contain some odd judgments. Why favour industrialised chicken? Why palm oil? They are plain weird if you try to interpret them as daily instructions without thinking about the diet as a whole or what’s available to people locally – hence the one-fifth of an egg, the quarter rasher of bacon. People don’t shop and eat by numbers and fractions. And the fact that nutrition epidemiology – the study of patterns in diet and disease – has got it wrong before does not help. Remember when fears about dietary cholesterol were used to condemn eggs? These instructions sound top down and, worse, appear to throw responsibility back to the individual. More than 800 million people are estimated to be chronically undernourished, yet 2 billion are overweight or obese But that is to miss the point of these instructions. They are calculations that give a sense of the scale of the problem and a science-based framework for political action. Contrary to some claims, the Lancet commission that undertook the modelling, supported by the philanthropic EAT Foundation, received no funding from industry. And the uncomfortable truth is that meat, and specifically the meat from intensively-fed livestock, processed in the way it generally is in the western diet, is a hotspot when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions and ill health. Well-produced meat and dairy can have a place, but it will be a small one, and it is expensive. Our diets are out of kilter with what’s good for both us and the planet because powerful vested interests and misplaced economic incentives have driven them in that direction, and this is the thesis underlying the commission’s findings. The equivalent of $500bn in agricultural subsidies goes each year to the wrong sort of food – corn, soya, meat and dairy, as cheap raw materials for intensive livestock production and for highly processed foods. About $5tn a year goes in subsidies to the fossil fuels which industrialised agriculture uses so profligately. Big food has spent hundreds of millions advertising unhealthy food and lobbying to block the sort of measures that might help shift consumption. Although individuals can make a difference by modifying their diets, and send clear demands for action to politicians , we cannot redraw the food system on our own. That will require not just governments, but global agreement. The Lancet says the problem is so big and so urgent that we need an intergovernmental convention to agree a way forward, in the way that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control have. Expect plenty of hysterical, dark-money opposition to that. The Lancet, founded in the 19th century, caused uproar back then by publishing the unwelcomenews that food was routinely adulterated. It has once again kickstarted a vital debate about how we eat. If it all sounds too gloomy, it’s worth remembering that the modern western diet is a recent invention. The separation of livestock from the land only took off in the 1950s, thanks to cheap energy to keep animals housed, to synthetic fertilisers increasing grain production for feed, and to mass production of antibiotics to control disease. It’s not so very long since most people ate in the way we now need to rediscover.  • Felicity Lawrence is a special correspondent for the Guardian and author of Not on the Label and Eat Your Heart Out"
"The rise of the gilets jaunes protest movement requires governments to prove that ordinary people and corporate elites are “in this together” in shouldering the costs of fighting climate change, a senior EU figure has said. Frans Timmermans, the European commission’s vice-president, said the movement, first triggered by a proposed rise in fuel tax in France, highlighted the need to share the burden.  He was also critical of people and groups who condemned attempts by the EU and national governments to encourage changes such as dropping single-use plastics or driving cars with lower emissions. “This is the game of those who deny climate change or who deny the need for sustainability,” he said. “They say: ‘They are going to take everything away from us. They are going to take our cars away from us, they are going to take our steaks from us, they are going to take all the things that make life nice away from us. So let’s not go there.’ “It is a false contradiction. If we put our policies in the right order, we have a sustainable society without lowering but even increasing our levels of wellbeing. Is wellbeing only economic growth? Only salaries? Or is wellbeing also being able to breathe clean air and drink clean water?” Speaking before the publication on Wednesday of a “reflections paper” on the EU’s next steps in changing the way Europeans live and work in order to protect the environment, Timmermans said the challenge was to bring about reform in a way that was equitable. “The most important thing the gilets jaunes and others ask themselves is: is this fair, are people taking a fair share of the burden or are [the elites] unburdening all that on us? If you create the impression, rightly or wrongly, that this is just a burden on citizens unloaded by companies that don’t do anything, then people will just block it,” he said. “Politically speaking, one of the most important tasks will be to show that this is something we are doing together in an equitable way, a fair way.” On Monday a second French gilets jaunes leader announced she was founding a political party. Its programme calls for removing privileges from elected representatives, developing “charity houses” paid for by donations from chief executives, a reduction in VAT on essential products and higher taxes for higher earners. Timmermans said there were calls for the EU and member states to slow down in making major societal changes in favour of sustainability, but he warned: “The time is now.”"
"Around 40 climate activists have staged a peaceful occupation of the Scottish parliament’s debating chamber, urging MSPs to introduce much tougher climate targets. Campaigners with the recently formed direct action group Extinction Rebellion posed as tourists on a visit to Holyrood before staging an hour-long sit-in in the chamber. There were no arrests. Police escorted the protesters from the building through a side entrance and they were greeted by cheers from other campaigners gathered outside the parliament. Extinction Rebellion was launched last October with the backing of 100 academics and the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. Friday’s occupation was the group’s first direct action in Scotland, after sit-down protests in Parliament Square, Westminster, and at climate talks in Poland. Robert Alcock, a builder and eco-designer who took part in the sit-in, said the group wanted Holyrood to take up far more ambitious CO2 reduction policies geared towards cutting net emissions to zero by 2025, in line with analysis from the International Panel on Climate Change. Extinction Rebellion wants Scotland to convene a citizens’ assembly to decide how to achieve that goal through consensus. It would be made up of 73 members of the public drawn from Holyrood’s 73 single-member constituencies, and have the power to revise the parliament’s climate bills. The Scottish government insists the country’s climate policies, enacted by Holyrood, are among the most ambitious and far-reaching in the world, and the most radical from any UK legislature. Scotland’s first target to reduce CO2 emissions by 42% by 2020 has already been met, and the parties are now debating a fresh target to hit 90% by 2050 in a new climate bill. Asked why Extinction Rebellion was targeting Holyrood rather than oil companies in Aberdeen or the oil refinery at Grangemouth west of Edinburgh, Alcock said: “This is a very symbolic place because it is representing the people of Scotland, and today is Burns Day, the day of Scotland’s national poet. “While it is relatively progressive compared to other countries it comes nowhere near what is necessary to really address the gravity of the climate emergency.” A Scottish parliament spokeswoman said: “Around 40 individuals on a free public tour refused to leave the chamber for approximately 60 minutes before leaving peacefully at 1.30pm. “The public tour route takes in the debating chamber when parliament is not sitting. There was no impact on parliamentary business.”"
"“Spring is here … and they can’t stop you enjoying it.” That’s George Orwell in his essay Some Thoughts on the Common Toad.  “So long as you are not actually ill, hungry, frightened or immured in a prison or a holiday camp,” he continues, “Spring is still spring. The atom bombs are piling up in the factories, the police are prowling through the cities, the lies are streaming from the loudspeakers, but the earth is still going round the sun, and neither the dictators nor the bureaucrats, deeply as they disapprove of the process, are able to prevent it.” But, of course, now they have. Today spring’s no longer spring – at least not in the old way. With climate change wrecking the seasonal rhythms, scientists find plants emerging from the soil earlier than ever before. Almost everywhere, the ancient patterns have gone awry: last November, for instance, summer temperatures killed a third – yes, a third! – of Australia’s remaining spectacled flying foxes. The atom bombs, the police, the dictators and the bureaucrats remain with us and, God knows, so do the lies streaming from the loudspeakers. But, as the sociologist John Bellamy Foster noted back in 2002, Orwell’s beloved toads are now vanishingly rare, with some 200 different species of amphibians driven to extinction in the last few decades. Some Thoughts on the Common Toad appeared in the socialist newspaper Tribune in 1946 just as the planet entered what environmentalists call “The Great Acceleration”: the period in which the human boot, weighing heavily since the industrial revolution, began to stamp on the face of nature. Throughout the post-war boom, the tremendous expansion of the global economy drew more and more of the world into the circuit of capital. Ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions: all of these, and other indicators, shot violently upward from the late 1940s on. The periodisation highlights a fundamental problem in the fight against climate change today. We know now that scientists understood all the key principles of global warming decades ago. Furthermore, as Nathaniel Rich notes, back in the 1980s a real response seemed eminently feasible as “many prominent Republicans joined Democrats in judging the climate problem to be a rare political winner: non-partisan and of the highest possible stakes”. But the early consensus for climate action coincided with what Naomi Klein dubs “the absolute zenith of the neoliberal crusade”. As a result, the leaders who committed to fighting warming also ruled out any response to emissions incompatible with their free market dogma. Thus, in the negotiations that led to the Kyoto Protocol, the US, with the backing of companies like Enron, insisted that international efforts for climate change mitigation rely on business-friendly, market-based mechanisms such as cap and trade schemes. Even though Washington eventually refused to ratify Kyoto, the methodology championed by it (and institutions like the World Bank) became, by the early 2000s, an unassailable political orthodoxy. Again, the notion that the market offered the best (or indeed the only) mechanism for fighting climate change was always pure ideology. For instance governments can shut down coal-fuelled power stations whenever they like – they don’t need price signals to pass legislation. In the real world, as researcher Jesse Jenkins explained to the New York Times “policies other than carbon pricing have driven the majority of emissions reductions to date”. The ideologically-determined attempts to generate environmental outcomes through market action thus resembled huge Rube Goldberg machines, dependent on ultra-convoluted systems for results that can also be produced by non-market means. But those fossil fuel corporations who supported (and sometimes led) the early campaigns for emissions trading systems saw the redundant complexity of market environmentalism as a feature, not a bug. Companies like BP and Shell understood – better than many environmentalists – that, in practice, a trading system could amount to a massive subsidy for big polluters since they could profit hugely by “selling” emissions they didn’t actually require. Furthermore, because a trade in carbon allowed the purchase of credits associated with carbon offsets (usually in the developing world), tremendous opportunities opened up for creative (and sometimes blatantly dishonest) accounting. An EU study from 2017 found that a full 85% of offset projects actually failed to reduce emissions at all. Many progressives reluctantly embraced free market environmentalism, judging any action to be better than none – particularly as overt climate change denialism grew. But that missed something else that the corporates grasped: namely, that the “put a price on carbon” slogan accepted, by definition, the commodification of the environment. That was, after all, the goal of pricing: transforming nature, in all its complexity and diversity, into an asset legible within a corporate ledger. Fixing a market value on carbon was never supposed to halt the economic activity underpinning the Great Acceleration. On the contrary, it was intended to speed it up. Even if trading schemes do cut greenhouse gases (which, by and large, they don’t), they’re designed, as pro-business measures, not to limit industrial expansion but to foster it. They’re meant explicitly to encourage more economic growth – and that’s something that’s no longer compatible with the preservation of nature. As Foster points out, a continuous 3% average annual rate of growth means that world industry doubles every twenty-five years, grows by a factor of sixteen every century, and 4,000 times every three centuries. Given the current state of the planet, how would that not bring utter ruination? The World Wildlife Fund says that populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians have declined by 60% since 1970. What will be left if we continue economic metastasisation for another half century? In political terms, the embrace by progressives of mitigation schemes so closely associated with big business has proved utterly disastrous. Over the last decades, an “environmentalism” that rewarded rapacious corporations seemed to many ordinary people less a strategy for preserving the planet they depended upon and more a rhetorical bludgeon wielded by an out-of-touch political class. Take the experience in France, where President Emmanuel Macron, pledging to Make the Planet Great Again, introduced another neoliberal nostrum – a carbon tax. A recent study revealed that carbon taxes don’t make a meaningful difference to the climate because governments invariably set them at too low a rate. Why? Well, carbon taxes are innately regressive – they pass the cost of reform onto the consumers who can least afford it – and thus are rarely popular. In France Macron implemented his levy on fuel as part of a broader austerity package – and spurred the Yellow Vest revolt, a rebellion led by workers living outside the metropolitan centres, and with no choice but to use cars. In other words, in the name of environmentalism, Macron managed to alienate France’s poorest – the very people who will suffer most in a warming future and so should have been a key constituency for change. That’s why Thoughts on the Common Toad repays re-reading. In his essay, Orwell takes for granted an affinity between everyday nature and working class people, who can, he suggests, find an alternative to oppression and exploitation in the environment around them. “Even in the most sordid street the coming of spring will register itself by some sign or other, if it is only a brighter blue between the chimney pots or the vivid green of an elder sprouting on a blitzed site. Indeed it is remarkable how Nature goes on existing unofficially, as it were, in the very heart of London.” In other words, Orwell celebrates an uncommodified environment, explicitly because it doesn’t obey the rules of the market. “[T]he pleasures of spring are available to everybody, and cost nothing,” he explains, before exulting at the thought of birds, in the midst of bourgeois Britain, flagrantly avoiding rent. The Great Deceleration we require today means deploying our scientific and technical knowledge to undo the damage we’ve wreaked. It means embracing economic planning, so that we use scarce resources for human need rather than corporate profit; it means confronting the military-industrial complex and abandoning the fossil economy; it means involving ordinary people in the decisions that shape their lives. It means, in other words, constructing a non-market society, as scary as that idea will seem to some In 1946 Orwell, a lifelong socialist, defended an appreciation of nature as something that made “a peaceful and decent future a little more probable”. The joy that he took in toads and kestrels and other creatures that evaded the market’s invisible hand hinted at an older kind of society – and potentially, a newer one. The dictators and bureaucrats might be ruining spring, as they force every living organism to bear the consequences for their profits. But for most of human history we did not live under generalised commodity production, an economic order that’s remarkably recent. And if the past was different, the future can be, too. As we struggle to preserve our only planet, that insight matters more than ever. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"
"Heatwaves and blackouts have been the talk of the town as temperatures climbed over 40C in all states except Tasmania, and once again the commentariat have gone into a renewable-generated bluster. Chris Uhlmann and Alan Moran blamed the high prices on wind power, Pauline Hanson called for people to use more power and Judith Sloan called demand management a bribe. There were three notable things that happened with our energy system during what will become the new normal of extreme heat.  At the end of last week it was hot. Like, record-breaking, fry an egg on the pavement hot. Many parts of South Australian and Victoria faced their hottest days on record. As Australians tried their best to stay cool, almost everyone who had an air conditioner switched it on and we experienced a “peak demand” event. This is a period where our electricity system is stretched to its limit and wholesale electricity prices reach their peak. Updated: pic.twitter.com/IclDc3fpai As our planet warms we can expect more days like Thursday and Friday. While we still have time to avert the worst impacts of climate change, some warming is now locked in and that means the heatwaves we have experienced more than once already this summer are now an inevitable part of Australia’s future. So what should we do about it? Australia needs to get serious about reducing climate pollution, which continues to rise and do our contribution to stop runaway global warming. We can improve our houses and building so they better manage the heat. Australian houses are sometimes called leaky tents; they let in the heat in summer and the cold in winter. It doesn’t have to be this way. Insulation, double-glazing, draft proofing, better building standards, all these things will keep your house passively cool and reduce (though not eliminate) the amount of air conditioning you need. It’s not rocket science, but currently we aren’t doing any of this. We can also upgrade our air conditioners to be more energy efficient. According to energy analyst Tristan Edis, new air conditioners use half the electricity of the majority of air conditioners that were installed in the early 2000s. On hot days, this would make a significant difference. Our coal and gas plants are ageing. As they age, they breakdown and need maintenance more often. Last week was a case in point. In Victoria, Yallourn power station took one of its units offline for maintenance and another had to be taken offline unexpectedly early Friday morning. Also in Victoria, Loy Yang A had a boiler tube leak just before the heatwave hit and was out for the duration. In New South Wales, Liddell and the Tallawarra gas plants were both offline for many days due to unplanned faults. These six coal and gas units totalling 2,225MWs of capacity were not available for at least some of the period of Australia’s most intensive heatwave on record. This is at best a sign that our coal plants are getting old and can’t be relied on at peak times and at worst it was price-gouging behaviour by some of Australia’s largest energy companies. We need to get serious about demand response. Demand response is when households and industry are paid not to use electricity for some nonessential operations for a period of time. While this isn’t a great idea all year round, for a few hours on a few days a year it’s the cheapest and most effective way of maintaining an electricity system. This is standard practice in the US and Europe where they even have markets for demand response. This is urgently needed here, but was resisted by rule-maker, the Australian Electricity Market Commission (AEMC), until late last year. We also need to continue to build new electricity supply in the form of solar, wind, battery storage, pumped hydro and similar. At the end of last week we experienced two types of blackouts. First there were localised blackouts affecting about 25,000 households in South Australia on Thursday night. These were due to fuses blowing in our distribution infrastructure. These fuses are designed to blow when infrastructure gets too hot so that it isn’t damaged. This was the electricity system working as it should. It isn’t surprising given the record temperatures. The second type of blackout experienced was “load shedding”. This is where the market operator temporarily cuts off some energy users from the system to ensure “system integrity” and to ensure it doesn’t fail catastrophically. In Victoria on Friday afternoon, 160,000 customers were blacked-out over a two-to-three-hour period. Load shedding is the action of last resort and Aemo did everything it could before taking this path. It fired up emergency reserves, asked big energy users to power down and appealed to us to lower our electricity use. Australia’s electricity system is incredibly reliable, typically exceeding our reliability standard of 99.998%. That basically means that the electricity supply needed is available 99.998% of the time. Almost all blackouts in Australia (96.6% according to the AEMC) are because of faults in the poles and wires. What happened on Friday was very rare – only 0.2% of blackouts occur because there isn’t enough operational generation in the system. However, particularly for people suffering health conditions as well as older and younger people, power outages are dangerous and they aren’t good for business either. So what should we do about it? We need more on-demand capacity – there is need for storage (batteries and pumped hydro) and dispatchable solutions (concentrating solar thermal and demand response), that can turn on and ramp up quickly. Renewables (hydro, solar and wind) account for about 20% of generation in the National Electricity Market, higher in South Australia. Over the two-day period in question, renewables averaged higher than 20% generation and on Friday afternoon, when power was needed most, a combination of hydro, wind and solar provided over one-third of Victoria and South Australia’s power. However, while wind and solar will provide the bulk of our annual electricity need in the future, there is need for on-demand solutions. These solutions will fill the gaps in the two to six hours overnight where there is a lull in the wind, or when forecasts (demand or supply) are wrong. The good news is that CSIRO and Aemo have found that just such solutions – wind and solar backed by batteries and pumped hydro are also the cheapest new-build options to deliver reliable, clean electricity supply. We need to recognise climate change is causing more heatwaves which brings increased risk of localised blackouts and even load shedding. We need to start adapting to this new normal. One strategy to do this would be to create community cool zones where people can go to stay cool in extreme heat. These cool zones should have backup power that means they will stay cool even during blackouts. Finally, we also need to have strategies for giving people, particularly vulnerable people, more notice of potential blackouts. If we get serious about demand management there will be better systems in place to provide this notice to people and even incentives and support for folks to go to the movies or a community cool zone. While we can never have an electricity system that is 100% reliable, there are straightforward policy and engineering solutions that can increase our electricity system’s resilience to climate change in the future.

"Greenland’s ice is melting faster than scientists previously thought, with the pace of ice loss increasing fourfold since 2003, new research has found. Enormous glaciers in Greenland are depositing ever larger chunks of ice into the Atlantic Ocean, where it melts. But scientists have found that the largest ice loss in the decade from 2003 actually occurred in the south-west region of the island, which is largely glacier-free. This suggests surface ice is simply melting as global temperatures rise, causing gushing rivers of meltwater to flow into the ocean and push up sea levels. South-west Greenland, not previously thought of as a source of woe for coastal cities, is set to “become a major future contributor to sea level rise”, the research states. “We knew we had one big problem with increasing rates of ice discharge by some large outlet glaciers,” said Michael Bevis, lead author of the paper and a professor of geodynamics at Ohio State University. “But now we recognize a second serious problem: increasingly, large amounts of ice mass are going to leave as meltwater, as rivers that flow into the sea.” The research provides fresh evidence of the dangers posed to vulnerable coastal places as diverse as Miami, Shanghai, Bangladesh and various Pacific islands as climate change shrinks the world’s land-based ice. “The only thing we can do is adapt and mitigate further global warming – it’s too late for there to be no effect,” Bevis said. “This is going to cause additional sea level rise. We are watching the ice sheet hit a tipping point. “We’re going to see faster and faster sea level rise for the foreseeable future. Once you hit that tipping point, the only question is: how severe does it get?” The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used data from Nasa’s gravity recovery and climate experiment (known as Grace) and GPS stations scattered across Greenland to analyze changes in ice mass. This showed that Greenland lost about 280bn tons of ice per year between 2002 and 2016, enough to raise the worldwide sea level by 0.03 inches annually. If all of Greenland’s vast ice sheet, 3km thick in places, was to melt, global sea levels would rise by seven meters, or more than 20ft, drowning most coastal settlements. The rate of loss hasn’t been even, however, with the ice melting four times faster in 2013 compared with 2003. Researchers said this was driven by rising global temperatures from human-induced climate change as well as the North Atlantic Oscillation, a periodic weather phenomenon that brings warmer air to western Greenland. The fate of Greenland’s huge glaciers in the south-east and north-west has long been viewed as a key factor in global sea level rise but the Ohio State-led research suggests the ice fields of the island’s south-west may prove an unexpectedly large source of meltwater. Scientists have been gaining a greater understanding of how the two massive ice masses on the planet, in Greenland and Antarctica, are reacting to a warming ocean and atmosphere. Arctic ice loss has tripled since the 1980s, with melting in places such as Greenland and Alaska providing the greatest instigator of sea level rise while destabilizing the very ground underneath 4 million people’s feet. Antarctica is becoming an increasing concern, however, with ice vanishing at its fastest rate in recorded history. The world’s largest expanse of ice is now losing about 219bn tonnes of ice a year, a trajectory that would contribute more than 25cm to total global sea level rise by 2070. Should the entire west Antarctic ice sheet collapse, sea levels would balloon by around 3.5m, albeit over a lengthy timeframe. “We are warming the planet, this is melting ice, and that is raising sea level,” said Richard Alley, a geologist and glacier expert at Pennsylvania State University. Alley added that while there are uncertainties over future sea level rise “if the big ice sheets change more rapidly than expected, they could drive faster or much faster rise than expected”."
"Americans’ concerns about climate change have surged to record levels, new polling shows, following a year marked by devastating storms, wildfires and increasingly dire warnings from scientists. A total of 72% of polled Americans now say global warming is personally important to them, according to the Yale program on climate change communication. This is the highest level of concern since Yale starting polling the question in 2008. Overall, 73% of Americans accept that global warming is happening, outnumbering those who don’t by five to one. This acceptance has strengthened in recent years, rising by 10% since March 2015. The proportion that grasps that humans are the primary cause of warming is smaller, with 62% understanding this to be the case. About two-thirds of Americans believe that global warming is influencing the weather, in the wake of a string of deadly extreme events in the US. About half say the disastrous wildfires in California and Hurricanes Florence and Michael, which flattened parts of North Carolina and Florida, were worsened because of rising global temperatures. “Global warming used to be viewed as a problem distant in time and space,” said report co-lead researcher Ed Maibach, a climate change and public health communications expert at George Mason University. “But Americans increasingly understand that global warming is here and now and are growing concerned about the threat to themselves, their communities and the nation.” The Yale polling, which was conducted in November and December, is backed by findings from separate new research by the University of Chicago and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That poll found similarly wide acceptance that climate change is happening, among seven in 10 Americans. A stark political divide on the science still exists, however: while 86% of Democrats say climate change is happening, just 52% of Republicans concur. Climate change has become an increasingly animating cause for progressive Democrats, with campaigning by emerging grassroots groups and figures such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the newly elected congresswoman from New York, pushing for a “Green New Deal”. While this concept has yet to be fully fleshed out, its broad goal of transitioning to 100% renewable energy has energized younger activists and has gained a foothold among established Democrats. The sense of urgency has been highlighted by a series of sobering reports released by scientists over the past year. A landmark United Nations report from last year warned that the world has little more than a decade to limit catastrophic climate change, which will involve millions of people displaced by sea level rise or subjected to deadly heatwaves, as well as the loss of almost all of the planet’s coral reefs."
"Our house is on fire. I am here to say, our house is on fire. According to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), we are less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes. In that time, unprecedented changes in all aspects of society need to have taken place, including a reduction of our CO2 emissions by at least 50%. And please note that those numbers do not include the aspect of equity, which is absolutely necessary to make the Paris agreement work on a global scale. Nor does it include tipping points or feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas released from the thawing Arctic permafrost. At places like Davos, people like to tell success stories. But their financial success has come with an unthinkable price tag. And on climate change, we have to acknowledge we have failed. All political movements in their present form have done so, and the media has failed to create broad public awareness. But Homo sapiens have not yet failed. Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around. We can still fix this. We still have everything in our own hands. But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems, we most probably don’t stand a chance. We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly. Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that Homo sapiens have ever faced. The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it. We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases. Either we do that or we don’t. You say nothing in life is black or white. But that is a lie. A very dangerous lie. Either we prevent 1.5C of warming or we don’t. Either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control or we don’t. Either we choose to go on as a civilisation or we don’t. That is as black or white as it gets. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival. We all have a choice. We can create transformational action that will safeguard the living conditions for future generations. Or we can continue with our business as usual and fail. That is up to you and me. Some say we should not engage in activism. Instead we should leave everything to our politicians and just vote for a change instead. But what do we do when there is no political will? What do we do when the politics needed are nowhere in sight? Here in Davos – just like everywhere else – everyone is talking about money. It seems money and growth are our only main concerns. And since the climate crisis has never once been treated as a crisis, people are simply not aware of the full consequences on our everyday life. People are not aware that there is such a thing as a carbon budget, and just how incredibly small that remaining carbon budget is. That needs to change today. No other current challenge can match the importance of establishing a wide, public awareness and understanding of our rapidly disappearing carbon budget, that should and must become our new global currency and the very heart of our future and present economics. We are at a time in history where everyone with any insight of the climate crisis that threatens our civilisation – and the entire biosphere – must speak out in clear language, no matter how uncomfortable and unprofitable that may be. We must change almost everything in our current societies. The bigger your carbon footprint, the bigger your moral duty. The bigger your platform, the bigger your responsibility. Adults keep saying: “We owe it to the young people to give them hope.” But I don’t want your hope. I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act. I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is. This is an edited version of a speech given by Greta Thunberg at Davos this week."
"David Attenborough might have urged world leaders at Davos to take urgent action on climate change, but it appears no one was listening. As he spoke, experts predicted up to 1,500 individual private jets will fly to and from airfields serving the Swiss ski resort this week. Political and business leaders and lobbyists are opting for bigger, more expensive aircrafts, according to analysis by the Air Charter Service, which found the number of private jet flights grew by 11% last year.  “There appears to be a trend towards larger aircraft, with expensive heavy jets the aircraft of choice, with Gulfstream GVs and Global Expresses both being used more than 100 times each last year,” said Andy Christie, private jets director at the ACS. This is partly due to the long distances travelled, he said, “but also possibly due to business rivals not wanting to be seen to be outdone by one another”. Last year, more than 1,300 aircraft flights were recorded at the conference, the highest number since ACS began recording private jet activity in 2013. Countries with the highest number of arrivals and departures out of the local airports over the past five years included Germany, France, UK, US, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, according to ACS. The World Economic Forum disputed ACS’s analysis. . Oliver Cann, of the World Economic Forum, said: “We have been offering incentives to participants to use public transport for some years. We also ask that they share planes if they have to use them; something that has been gaining popularity in recent years.” The World Economic Forum’s global risk report, released ahead of this week’s meeting, identified environmental challenges, including the failure to mitigate climate change, as top of the list of dangers facing the world economy. On Monday, broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough warned that “the Garden of Eden is no more”, and urged political and business leaders to make a renewed push to tackle climate change. “We have changed the world so much that scientists claim we are in a new geological age, the anthropocene, the age of humans,” he said. “What we do now, and in the next few years, will profoundly affect the next few thousand years,” added Attenborough, who received a Crystal award from the WEF for his work. Speaking to journalists after his speech, Attenborough warned that economic models needed to change. “Growth is going to come to an end, either suddenly or in a controlled way.” • This article was updated on 23 January to incorporate a response from the World Economic Forum"
"“Why?” is the question I’ve had from friends and family when I’ve told them I’m running for the seat of Kooyong in the next federal election. It’s a good question but perhaps not the right one. Politics in Australia, as it currently operates, isn’t something immediately appealing to anyone in their right mind. I’ve had a successful business career; my kids are all but grown-up.  But the time has come when I’m compelled to act as the situation we face is so dire, and the quality of the actors so poor, and the unwillingness of the Liberal party to reform is so evident that the right question is “how can you just sit there and not stand?” We have to change the way politics is done in Australia so we can address climate change, restore political integrity and ensure business operates within society’s expectations and not as an entity unto itself. Unfortunately, the current Liberal party has lost the plot. Its failure to deal with these issues threatens to sell out the future of all Australians. Without environmental and public assets and public confidence in our politics we’re unable to deal with a warming climate, a growing and ageing population and an unequal economy. Growing up, I learned what it takes to be elected to parliament, door-knocking Doveton to Kooweerup for my father, the Liberal member for Holt, the late Bill Yates. But despite being a member for most of my life, I am done with this form of the Liberal party. Seeing the now prime minister, Scott Morrison, wave around a lump of coal in parliament, and witnessing a follow-up act with brown coal at a Victorian fundraiser made me angry. Environmentally it’s like waving asbestos. If this is the Liberal party, then it has no place for me. I can’t quite explain what has happened but the Liberal party’s culture is sick. Ten years of negative policy actions have created a black hole around the leadership, surrounding them in impenetrable darkness. They’ve ignored or denied claims of bullying, which is evident to all. Now there’s a flood of cabinet ministers rushing for the backdoor. Family reasons aside, the environment in Canberra within the Liberal party is toxic. Faced with this, and when it is made clear that the “broad church” in Kooyong won’t extend to other Liberals with environmental concerns, the time comes to offer an alternative way so that the people of Kooyong can have a voice and be represented in Canberra. The majority of them want action on climate, fair treatment for asylum seekers, businesses to consider people and the environment, and politicians to act with integrity. Currently they feel let down. The Liberal government’s blindness to the dangers of climate change is sickening. It’s about 28 years since the first international report called on governments to act to reduce carbon emission as a known threat to the environment. Since then, global emissions have risen more than 60%. The current government is delaying action, and encouraging global inaction. We can’t afford that. How can Liberals not see this? The Liberal party put the interests of the coal and fossil fuel industry ahead of just about every other industry, and source of employment, in Australia. Our beautiful reefs, right through to our southern wilderness, are being destroyed as you read this. Our rivers and everything that relies on them are dying. Communities are facing crippling droughts and fires. Meanwhile, the government continue to peddle dangerous nonsense that we need new coal-fired power stations, or talking up Adani. Having run the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and as an investor in renewable projects, I understand the jobs, economic benefits and new industries that can emerge while we reduce pollution. I can’t understand why the Liberal party, which prides itself on its economic credentials, fails to see the economic opportunities. The treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s recent speech to the Sydney Institute should mark another point of intense disappointment. It highlights how seriously the Liberal party has lost its way. Now its leadership can’t even make moral sense of its own values and belief. Frydenberg said: “Fairness is achieved through equality of opportunity, not equality of outcomes”, and “intergenerational equity requires fiscal discipline as the next generation should not have to pick up the tab for the last”. If he seriously believes current Liberal policies reflect these two values, then he is totally deluded. The government’s policies are preventing individuals having “equality of opportunity”. Inequality of wealth is growing. Wealth has a direct relationship with the opportunities an individual has from birth. The outcome will not be fair if government policies fail to address the massive financial inequality individuals face. Policies that constantly increase the benefits of those who can afford to pay versus those less well off layer this government’s thinking. Poor suburbs have poor schools, hospitals and services in contrast to wealthy suburbs. I don’t want an American-style split society. Menzies did not suggest it, and it grinds against the identity I thought we shared as Australians, which had pride in egalitarianism and mateship. Secondly, intergenerational equity applies to the climate and our natural resources not just the budget. Those retiring today are leaving oceans filled with plastic, mines that have not been rehabilitated, soil depleted, ecosystems destroyed and our climate in ruins. The tab is being left to the next generation without care or regard. How a Liberal government cannot see the scale of this is breathtaking. We must return integrity to politics. We need real people with real experience to sit in Canberra. We can’t afford another generation of party hacks who believe politics is a game of numbers, slogans and spin. The public have lost trust in their political leaders. We need an integrity commission, proper political donations reforms and a bill of rights that enshrines what it means to be Australian. And we need to stop ignoring the concerns of Australia’s first people before we can become a mature country. We need a strong business sector that works with society. Currently there are deep cultural problems. Corporations and CEOs are there to act in the collective interests of people. They cannot continue to claim that their only job is to maximise profits. They need to understand that they must act in the same way we expect an individual to act as part of a heathy society that protects and cares for each other. Government and business love free trade. But it doesn’t always benefit the people. My first public run-in with the Howard government was over the US-Australian free-trade agreement. The PM’s office called my employer to suggest it was not in my employers’ best interest that I continue to point out the deficiencies of the agreement. It triggered my disbelief in our politicians, and highlighted our lack of individual rights to speak and debate views, as all citizens must do, if they care about their country. Our trade agreements need to be carefully considered to ensure the benefit for our economy and society. We shouldn’t be signing up to deals that could harm Australia’s economic interests or impose major social costs. I will fight to bring greater transparency to the negotiation of international trade deals and to ensure that the economic and social merits of all future deals are independently assessed by the Productivity Commission before the parliament is asked to vote on them. Having said all that, winning this seat will not be easy. But then again, you never know – moderate Liberal, Greens and Labor electors might welcome the chance to have a member in Canberra that reports to them rather than someone who represents a party most of us cannot understand."
"As we are starting to see the effects of climate change materialise in front of our eyes, people are looking for things they can do to help heal our planet. One common theme has been a call to stop eating meat, mainly due to methane emissions from cows. This is a simple answer, but I suggest it is an answer to the wrong question.  How did nature get things so horribly wrong when she allowed cows to evolve? After all, they are evil weapons of climate destruction, aren’t they? Let’s start with a few basics. Cows are ruminant animals. This means they have a multi-chambered stomach, one part of which is called a rumen. This is a fermentation vat containing billions of microbes breaking down the plants the animal eats. As part of this process, some of these microbes produce methane. Lots of animals produce some methane, including horses, dogs, termites, people and even kangaroos. Ruminants evolved 50 million years ago, and today there are almost 200 different species. So ruminant animals have a rich ecological diversity and a long evolutionary history. Other ruminants include the American elk, Chinese goral, Himalayan tahr, Japanese serow, Reindeer, Siberian ibex, water buffalo and yak. There are mountain, marsh, snow and swamp ruminants. There are American, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, even Siberian ruminants. If nature got it wrong when she allowed ruminants to evolve, she got it wrong at a global scale. But maybe she didn’t get it wrong after all? Maybe it’s not her, maybe it’s us? Instead of asking “What do we humans need to do to reduce ruminant methane emissions?”, we should be asking “What have we humans done that has so unbalanced the natural methane cycle?” Bacteria that “eat” methane live in healthy, properly managed soils beneath the feet of healthy, properly managed livestock. (Remember, nature doesn’t do “waste”.) These methane-eating bacteria (methanotrophs) act as a balance to the methane produced by the methane generating bacteria (methanogens) in the rumens of the livestock above ground. This is the missing part of the natural methane cycle that we need to restore. I believe there is a massive difference between “livestock” and “properly managed livestock”. As soon as we take grazing animals off grass and put them into a feedlot or confinement dairy, we have severed their link to the land. This means that we have now prevented nature from doing what she does best, which is utilise any “waste”, cycle and reuse nutrients, and balance the system.  When we manage livestock properly, out on grass and respecting the natural relationship between soils, grasses and grazing animals, we get a cleaner, fresher and properly balanced production system. We get healthy ecosystems, healthy animals, healthy people. If we start asking the right questions instead of the wrong ones, the answers begin to matter. The answer to reducing our impact on the climate is not to stop eating meat, it is to properly manage land and livestock. Tony Lovell actively manages land and livestock to regenerate ecosystems and produce positive financial, social, and environmental outcomes. His goal is to profitably leave all land he manages in better condition each year"

"As all of Australia suffered through a brutal heatwave last week, locals in the outback New South Wales towns of Walgett and Lightning Ridge were better prepared than most. Almost every day in summer is 40C or above here. Usually, the rivers provide relief: swimming in cool water, fishing for golden perch or Murray cod or seeking the solace of a big sleepy red gum that lines the banks. But this year there are no rivers. With the mercury in the mid-40s, the Narran, the Namoi and the Barwon – all tributaries of the vast Murray-Darling river system – are dry, or reduced to a series of green, stagnant weir pools. The mighty red gums, roots exposed, are hanging on for dear life. Heritage-protected lakes and wetlands are empty, and with them have gone the breeding grounds of native birds and fish. Australia has endured a searing summer of drought and extreme heat. Hundreds of feral animals have died of thirst or faced culling as they encroached on properties in search of water. All-time temperature records have been broken in South Australia, with Adelaide reaching 46.6C, while Melbourne had its hottest day since the catastrophic 2009 bushfires, and more fires swept through Tasmania. The Murray-Darling basin, which stretches from Queensland, through New South Wales and Victoria before emptying into the Southern Ocean near Adelaide, should be the lifeblood of the continent in such times. But things have gone very wrong on the rivers. At Menindee, near Broken Hill, thousands of fish were found dead on 6 January, including giant Murray cod up to 40 years old. Government ministers blamed the drought that set in across eastern Australia from April 2017. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said the environmental disaster was down to the fact it “just hasn’t rained”. “We are experiencing a very, very dry period of unprecedented proportions,” he said. “And when it rains, it will come down in such torrents people will probably be saying ‘what are we going to do with all the water?’ That’s Australia.” But the huge fish kill drew the nation’s attention to the wider crisis on the Murray-Darling, which has been the subject of political wrangling between farmers, environmentalists and Indigenous groups for decades. While irrigation has expanded in some of Australia’s driest regions, the Darling and its tributaries have been reduced to a series of muddy pools. It’s not the first time the Darling has ceased to flow, but the unfolding severe ecological and social consequences have caused Australians to question whether its plan to save the Murray Darling basin from environmental disaster is working. “We have witnessed a catastrophic failure of Australia’s supposedly world-leading water management system,” Rene Woods, from the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations says. ******* For decades the states along the river had been handing out water licences to farmers without any thought about what unbridled extraction for farming would mean for the river or downstream states. By the 1990s, the mouth of Murray at the end of the river system silted up. Salt levels became dangerously high, jeopardising Adelaide’s water supply, as well as internationally recognised wetlands. Governments were forced to act and in 2007, after years of difficult negotiations, the states and the commonwealth agreed to a plan that would licence water extraction and buy back a share of water for the environment. This water is owned by the Commonwealth and is released periodically to mimic nature and, in theory, keep the rivers healthy. But from the outset, the plan owed more to political compromise than science. “The best available science assembled for the guide to the the Basin Plan said that we needed 3,200GL to 7,600GL for the environment,” said Jamie Pittock, a professor at the Australian National University and a member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists. But ultimately only 2,750GL was allocated to the environment. Astoundingly, the plan also failed to take into account climate change, despite scientific reports showing that most of the basin will become hotter and drier. ****** The Aboriginal nations of the basin have been all but ignored, too. “In the 1990s, when NSW water reform began, it was really difficult, because we had people say “what have Aboriginal people got to do with water?” They didn’t see that we had a valid place at the table,” Yuwalaraay man Ted Fields says. Aboriginal people have some say over about a third of the country in the basin, but they hold less than 0.01% of Australia’s water diversions. Native title rights do not include ownership of natural waters. They can include the use of water for personal, social, domestic and cultural purposes but an entitlement to extract water doesn’t mean there is any water to extract, or that the water is drinkable. Traditional owners are angry at being shut out of the water conversation. The loss is not just about day-to-day shortages. Gamilaraay and Yuwalaraay elders who have lived on the rivers all their lives say they have never seen conditions as bad as now, and they doubt it can ever be recovered. “This to me is the ultimate destruction of our culture,” Gamilaraay elder Virginia Robinson says in Walgett. “All people think about now is there’s no water. Aboriginal people were very close to nature and that’s all unbalanced now. There’s no nature to go back to.” Buying up water to return to the environment remains deeply unpopular in much of rural Australia because of its impact on farms, rural towns and jobs. At the same time the creation of a water market, where allocations can be traded, has benefited big agribusinesses who moved into industrial scale production of cotton and other high value crops, as well as water trading. The Greens and Indigenous groups have called for a royal commission amid allegations of corruption and poor governance. South Australia has already held its own royal commission into the plan, but was hampered by the federal government’s refusal to cooperate. It will report next week and is expected to warn that key aspects of the Murray-Darling plan are in breach of the Commonwealth Water Act. In Walgett the dry river means the town must live on bore water indefinitely. Bore water is high in mineral content, especially sodium. It kills gardens and discolours basins and bathtubs. It comes out of the tap very warm – there’s no need to turn on the hot tap to have a shower, but there is also no chance for a cool drink. Locals say bore water is not a long-term option as a drinking supply. Water restrictions mean no water can be used during daylight hours, and there are limits on washing, flushing of toilets and the use of evaporative air conditioners, even when with temperatures at extreme levels. The fish kill and the heat have at least brought the problems of water management squarely into the consciousness of city dwellers. The future of the Murray Darling basin is now a major issue in the upcoming federal and NSW elections. Yuwalaraay cultural educator Daryl Ferguson has a message for politicians and voters alike. “Everyone should take a leaf out of our culture – it is about looking after the land. “Everyone says “this is mine, this is my part of the river, this is mine, mine, mine.” “I’m not here to talk about ownership; that’s not our culture. You want to own it? That’s fine. “Just look after it.”"
"McDonald’s, KFC and Burger King have been urged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their supply chains by a coalition of global investors, with the animal agriculture industry criticised for being one of the world’s highest-emitting sectors without a low-carbon plan. Increasing concern that the industry is neglecting climate change and has failed to set emissions targets – unlike other sectors – prompted more than 80 investors representing $6.5tn (£4.94tn) to challenge fast food chain owners to put robust targets in place for their meat and dairy suppliers, in what could prove a landmark demand.  In a letter jointly organised by the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (Fairr) Initiative and sustainability organisation Ceres, the fast food companies – which account for more than 120,000 restaurants worldwide – were censured for expanding without sufficiently mitigating their environmental impacts. “If we are to meet the global climate ambitions set by the Paris agreement, and ensure the availability and sustainable management of global water resources, then global fast good brands need to take concrete action to manage supply-chain emissions and water impacts,” said Heike Cosse, from Aegon Asset Management. “The takeaway from investors is that those firms that fail to meet this challenge face regulatory and reputational risks that put their long-term financial sustainability under threat.” BMO Global Asset Management added that the long-term value of fast food multinationals was under rising threat, citing the growing demand for plant-based food, increased environmental regulation and fears over water pollution from intensive farms. In the letter, the investor coalition – which also included Aviva UK – advised the chains to reduce their impact on freshwater, publish time-sensitive targets and publicly announce their progress each year. Livestock farming is one of the leading causes of deforestation and water pollution, responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions – methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. If global demand for beef increases 95% by 2050 as expected then catering to the growing appetite could have severe consequences. “If you look at the next 20 years, methane is over 80 times more potent at warming the planet than CO2, so pollution from livestock is playing an outsized role in the climate-driven devastation we’re already seeing from superstorms, floods, droughts and wildfires,” said Ian Monroe, chief investment officer at Etho Capital and an earth systems lecturer at Stanford University. In the US the majority of large meat processing plants that pollute streams and rivers face few consequences, according to research by Ceres, and the animal agriculture industry is exempted from reporting its greenhouse gas emissions. Across the world, animal farming uses 83% of agricultural land despite providing only 18% of calorie intake, with consumers in Europe eating around five times the recommended amount of red meat, poultry and dairy products, according to Fairr. The organisation previously warned demand is set to exceed what can be met within “planetary boundaries”, and that the intensification of animal farming is not sustainable, with scientists recommending people adopt plant-based diets. “Every day around 84 million adults consume fast food in the US alone, but the inconvenient truth of convenience food is that the environmental impacts of the sector’s meat and dairy products have hit unsustainable levels,” said Jeremy Coller, founder of Fairr and chief investment officer of Coller Capital. “To put this in perspective, if cows were a country, it would be the world’s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.” He added: “Other high-emitting industries, such as cars or oil and gas, are beginning to set clear yet ambitious climate targets, making animal agriculture one of the world’s highest-emitting sectors without a low-carbon plan.”"
"It was the very last “frost fair” to be held on the frozen waters of the River Thames in London. These events had taken place from time to time during the 17th and 18th centuries, during a colder-than-average period known as the Little Ice Age. By the early 19th century, Britain’s climate was beginning to ameliorate a little. But as a final throwback, the winter of 1813-14 proved to be one of the coldest on record. January 1814 ranked as the third coldest ever: ahead even of 1963, but just behind 1795 and 1684.  As in previous very cold winters, the tidal stretch of the river froze over. January 1814 was also very snowy, while icebergs floated down the river and into the estuary damaging ships. It was also very foggy. Not that the freezing weather deterred Londoners from enjoying themselves. Once again, they erected temporary gin-palaces on the ice, played games of skittles, danced to music, and even roasted whole oxen over open fires. Someone even walked an elephant across the river by Blackfriars Bridge. They could not have known, as the climate warmed and the river was cleaned up, that this would the last time they would ever indulge in such hedonistic but no doubt highly enjoyable pastimes."

"International Falls is known as the “Icebox of America” for good reason. The average high temperature in January is -9C, or 15F. In a typical year, the city will experience 109 days of subzero weather. But this week the nickname seems particularly appropriate. At 8am on Wednesday, the temperature in International Falls, at the very northern tip of Minnesota, was -36.4F (-38C). The windchill was -58F (-50C). The National Weather Service warned that it could get even colder here on Wednesday night – potentially down to -65C (-85F). But in this little city of 6,000 people, people were carrying on as usual, using a few tricks they’ve learned from a lifetime of frigid temperatures. “You gotta have that International Falls shuffle going on,” said Stephanie Heinle, owner of the Coffee Landing Cafe downtown. Heinle demonstrated the manoeuvre by shuffling quickly across the wooden floor of the cafe. It’s a method of walking across ice that minimizes risk, she said. “Because in this weather you can fall and break a hip and if someone doesn’t see you you freeze to death,” Heinle said. Forecasters are describing the icy influx sweeping the American midwest as the coldest weather in a generation. On Wednesday, Chicago is predicted to see its lowest “high temperature” – the warmest point of a given day – since records began, and Minneapolis could also see historic lows. The cold won’t stop there. It’s expected that 75% of the contiguous US will see sub-zero temperatures over the next week, a result of the polar vortex Arctic air pressure system bursting apart in early January. The wind system normally traps cold air at the North Pole, but its splintering has whipped frigid air far further south than normal. Few have experienced the kind of cold currently occurring in International Falls. The temperature in a commercial freezer is -18C (-0.4F). In New York City the all-time coldest temperature was recorded as -26C (-15F), back in 1934. The record low in the United Kingdom is -27.2C (-17F), which has been reached on three occasions, each time in northern Scotland and most recently in the Highland village of Altnaharra, in 1995. On Wednesday the thermometer here never made it past -30C (-22F). Still, at midday Coffee Landing was a hive of activity. There was a birthday party going on in the back, with eight people wearing little strap-on hats, and people bundled in and out, barely mentioning the weather. “I’m not worried at all,” Heinle said. “Because I know it’ll go away. I know it’ll warm up.” When she’s walking around town or running errands, Heinle doesn’t even wear a hat and gloves. “If you’re used to wearing them when it’s only this temperature,” she said – there was a windchill of -45F at this point – “Then when you go snowmobiling or something where you really have windchill, you’re going to be really cold. I know it sounds crazy.” Heinle offered a personal tip on staying warm: “A little alcohol helps.” It was a bit early to take Heinle’s advice, so I shuffled soberly out into International Falls’ main street. International Falls is undeniably beautiful, divided from Canada by the picturesque Rainy river. The paper mill, a big local employer that looms over the city, pumps out steam as it turns wood into pulp, sending cascades of mist down the high street. It covers the trees in a crystalized frost, with the fog creating an other-wordly atmosphere. But it is preposterously cold. Within seconds of stepping outside my nostril hairs had frozen. After two minutes my moustache was covered in ice. I’d prepared well, I thought. I was wearing two pairs of long-johns, a pair of thick jeans, thick socks, insulated boots, two long-sleeved undershirts, a wool jumper, a fleece, a ski jacket, a balaclava, a “deep-winter” hat and two pairs of gloves, but still I was surprised to find my teeth literally chattering. My phone quickly stopped working, as did my voice recorder, and my pen. My hat, purchased for cycling in New York winters, started letting in the cold after about two minutes. My ski-gloves, which my dad found in the back of a rental car in 2006, lasted about 30 seconds. The winter has its upsides for the city. Tourists come to hunt and ice fish, and to drive the picturesque seven miles route around the frozen Rainy Lake. Car companies, including Kia, Hyundai and Land Rover, come too, testing new vehicles in the frozen conditions, and on Monday more than a hundred endurance athletes traveled to the area for the Arrowhead 135, a 135-mile race across northern Minnesota on cross-country skis, fat-tyre bicycles or just on foot. The winner, Jordan Wakeley, managed to set a new record in the race, on a bike, although around half of the 146 entrants dropped out in the freezing cold. It was a boon for the local taxi company, which worked through the night picking up frozen athletes along the trail. But there is no escaping the fact that it is dangerously cold. In a weather warning issued on Tuesday, the National Weather Service said that the wind chill could cause frostbite on exposed skin in just five minutes. “Hypothermia can set in quickly, which may lead to death,” the NWS added. In this weather some households keep their water running nonstop, for months at a time, to prevent pipes from freezing and bursting. People leave their cars running while they eat inside bars and restaurants, to prevent doors from freezing shut and engines conking out. Extra time has to be allocated each morning to pull on layers of clothing, extra money spent on arctic-level jackets and boots. It might raise the question as to why people choose to live here. For International Falls’ mayor, Bob Anderson, the answer is easy. “I love my city,” Anderson said. “You can go ice-fishing, cross-country skiing. We have a beautiful lake that opens up every May through October, a beautiful river. “I just really enjoy the birds, the animals. We have very distinctive seasons, we also enjoy that a great deal.” Anderson, 76, was born and raised in International Falls, and has been mayor since 2012. He worked at the paper mill for 51 years before retiring in 2011, and remembers a nine-day stretch in the 1970s when the temperature never rose above -18C (-0.4F), and a record snowfall in 1996. When the ice descends on the the city it doesn’t thaw for months. But it doesn’t bother Anderson. “The cold is probably akin to the heat in the south. I would not want to be where it’s 110F in the summer time. I know I would melt,” he said. “I enjoy the cold. I’m not bothered by it terribly. You take a few more precautions, do a bit more reading in the winter time, and life goes on. “And for 120, 130, 140 years it’s always been a white Christmas.”"
"When the American artist Danielle Eubank visited the Indian Ocean in Mozambique, she was taken back by the garbage. “There’s pollution everywhere, in the water, on the beach, baby strollers and plastic mats, plastic bags, plastic bottles,” she said. “They’re everywhere.” The artist has painted roughly 200 bodies of water in 22 countries, from the Arctic to the Mediterranean, for her 20-year project One Artist Five Oceans. The goal is to raise awareness about ocean pollution and climate change.  “I have always been a huge environmentalist, I’ve screamed at people and tried to get the message across in so many ways,” said Eubank, on the phone from her Los Angeles studio. “I prefer to show people, ‘Hey look, this is our world, let’s take care of it. Don’t destroy it.’ It’s something very precious, something we all share.” On 28 February, Eubank embarks on a long journey south to the Antarctic Circle for the last leg of her ocean painting project. She will depart from Ushuaia, Argentina, to the Antarctic Peninsula to paint the Southern Ocean. It all started 20 years ago when Eubank was visiting the Doñana national park in Huelva, in the south of Spain, where she spent her days painting on the beach with her back to the water. “Coming from California, I abhorred water paintings,” said Eubank. “For me, I could only see ideas other people had before me – crashing waves, dolphins and mermaids, I just couldn’t get into it.” But that all changed when, after spending days painting the park, she turned to the Atlantic Ocean. “I painted the dunes and got fed up and turned around at sunrise, in the morning,” she said. “I was faced with the water and nothing else. From that first point on, that’s all I wanted to paint – water.” She painted the Arctic Ocean from Svalbard, Norway. “What I noticed about the Arctic, is that the polar ice caps were melting in October,” she said. “The rate the oceans are warming up is the most frightening thing I can think of. Oceans are getting warmer.” When she painted the Indian Ocean, she noticed the illustrious hues. “The Indian Ocean is the most beautiful, it has the most difference in colors,” said Eubank. “It has times when its more golden and aqua, at times. There’s a lot of variations.” Though her series started in Spain, Eubank considers the Pacific the ocean her “home ocean. “I grew up in northern California near the coast,” she said. Having sailed the seven seas and (so far) four oceans, Eubank has visited most of these bodies of water by sea. Not in any kind of boats, but by old-fashioned ships, including one called the Borobudur, a wooden replica of an eighth-century vessel. In a sense, Eubank is honoring a time-worn tradition. “Explorers all had expedition artists; look at Captain Cook, he had William Hodges,” she said. “Back then, because people didn’t have cameras, they would take artists or do sketches themselves to document what they saw.” Sailing by in a showy replica of an ancient boat does get a lot of attention. “Private boats would wave as they passed by,” said Eubank. “When we would come into port, sometimes there would be lines of people along the quay.” As she packs for Antarctica, Eubank will be painting with oils, pencils and below-zero ink in her sketchbooks, which will be clipped to her jacket so they don’t fly into the ocean. “It hopefully will help people look at things in a new way,” she said. The United Nations Environmental Program claims that 80% of all marine pollution is plastic, and that every year, over 8m tons of plastic ends up in the oceans. Apparently by 2050, oceans will carry more plastic than fish, just as the world’s oceans keep getting warmer. Upon returning from Antarctica, Eubank will put together a book of all her ocean paintings and open an exhibition of selected paintings on 24 May at Kwan Fong Gallery in Thousand Oaks, California. Instead of painting piles of garbage, she also hopes her viewers will relish the beauty of these bodies of water, as well. “Our own actions affect what goes into the oceans,” said Eubank. “There’s a lot we can do; like if everyone ate less meat each week, rode a bike, walked and took public transit, it would make an impact. Hang dry your clothes. People are surprised how easy it is to help the oceans and help the climate.”"

"Sir David Attenborough has warned that humankind has the power to exterminate whole ecosystems “without even noticing”, and urged world leaders to treat the natural world with respect, during an interview with Prince William in Davos. Prince William also took world leaders to task at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, asking Attenborough why those in key positions have “taken so long” to address climate change. Attenborough said the connection between the natural world and urban societies had been “remote and widening” since the industrial revolution, meaning humans do not realise the effect their actions have on the global ecosystem. The 92-year-old broadcaster added that it was “difficult to overstate” the urgency of the environmental crisis. Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations. For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.  The 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.  “We’re now so numerous, so powerful, so all-pervasive, the mechanisms we have for destruction are so wholesale and so frightening, that we can actually exterminate whole ecosystems without even noticing it. We have to now be really aware of the dangers of what we’re doing, and we already know that of course the plastic problem in the seas is wreaking appalling damage upon marine life, the extent of which we don’t yet fully know.” He stressed that the natural world “is not just a matter of beauty, interest and wonder” but a coherent ecosystem on which we depend for “every breath we take, every mouthful of food we take.” A healthy planet, Attenborough added, is an essential part of human life. “If we don’t recognise the kind of connections I’ve been describing, then the whole planet comes in hazard, and we are destroying the natural world and with it ourselves.” William pressed Attenborough for a key message for the politicians and business leaders gathered in Davos this week. “Care for the natural world. Not only care for the natural world but treat it with a degree of respect and reverence,” Attenborough said, adding that there was a worrying tendency to waste resources. “The thing that I really care for in our ordinary daily lives is not to waste the riches of the natural world on which we depend. And it’s not just energy ,which of course is very important, but it’s also dealing with the natural world with a degree of respect. Not to throw away food, not to throw away power – just care for the natural world of which you’re an essential part.” The Duke of Cambridge started and ended the session by congratulating Attenborough for winning the Crystal award, which recognises individuals who have helped make the world a better place, at the World Economic Forum on Monday night. William added it was a “personal treat” to be asking Attenborough questions, and quipped that it was a good change of pace from being the subject of interviews himself. Asking why global leaders have taken so long to react to climate change, William said: ““Why do you think world leaders and those in key positions of leadership; why do think they’ve taken so long … there have been quite a few faltering steps to act on environmental challenges?” Comparisons were also drawn between the broadcaster’s burgeoning BBC career in the 1950s, compared with his latest project that sees him team up with Netflix and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) for an upcoming series called “Our Planet” to be released on the online TV streaming site. Attenborough said his early work in the mid-1950s involved himself, one camera and one cameraman, and it was relatively “easy” to impress Britons simply by televising an armadillo. Now the systems are “unbelievable”, taking viewers to the sky and depths of the ocean in ways that 50 years ago, “people couldn’t imagine”. Prince William noted Attenborough’s late shift to environmental activism, noting that for many years the presenter “held back from speaking publicly about environmental issues”. Attenborough said that at the start of his career, it was nearly inconceivable that the environment would be in such a state of crisis and even pockets of animal extinction seemed like the exception rather than the norm. “To be truthful I don’t think there was anyone in the mid-50s who thought there was a danger that we would annihilate parts of the natural world. There were animals that were in danger, that’s true and there were animals that we could see if we didn’t do something they were going to become extinct. “And the notion that human beings might exterminate a whole species … you just hadn’t thought about it,” he said. “Now of course we’re only too well aware that the whole of the natural world is at our disposal, as it were. We can do things accidentally that exterminate a whole area of the natural world and species that live within it.” "
"Your article (Can we feed the world if we ditch intensive farming?, The Briefing, Journal, 28 January) highlights the hugely detrimental impact that industrial farming is having on the quality of our soils . The Campaign to Protect Rural England’s recent report on this very issue echoed many of these concerns, highlighting that soil degradation costs at least £1.2bn a year in England and Wales alone. Soil must be seen not only as a fundamental for delivering productive farming and a healthy countryside, but also critical to tackling climate change – or mitigating its worst effects. Its importance should not be understated. There are solutions, however. By scaling up and incentivising farmers to switch to nature-friendly farming techniques, such as conservation agriculture and agroforestry, we will create a productive farming industry that works with nature and enables farmers to reduce their costs, while still producing the food and services that we need. Rebuilding biological life in soils is vital to enabling this life-giving asset to function as it should. Our soil will once again effectively lock in carbon, store and filter water, support ecosystems and restore the health of the natural environment.Graeme WillisSenior rural policy campaigner at the Campaign to Protect Rural England   • On page 3 of the Journal I read “the modern western diet needs a complete overhaul if we are to avoid potential ecological catastrophe” (Eat less meat – and redraw the entire global food system, 28 January). And on page 10: “Can we feed the world if we ditch intensive farming?” Both of these concerns are predicated on a global population in excess of 10 billion people by 2050. Might it not be easier to persuade people to have slightly fewer children than it would be to move the western world on to a diet of nuts and berries? Of course it would also help to reduce our CO2 emissions and our carbon footprint.Melvyn RustSt Albans, Hertfordshire  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Temperature records have tumbled across South Australia, with the city of Adelaide experiencing its hottest day on record, as the second heatwave in as many weeks hit southern parts of Australia. Adelaide hit 46.6C on Thursday afternoon, the hottest temperature recording in any Australian state capital city since records began 80 years ago.  The Red Lion, a pub in the city’s Elizabeth North suburb, promised to hand out free beers if the mercury rose above 45C. By 1pm, there was a line out the door and round the block. This guy, Muoi Pham, 60, is a legend. Brought free water to those waiting in line at The Red Lion without shade. Gave me a bottle for free too. This is the Elizabeth I know. #adelaide #heatwave pic.twitter.com/t5aGdU2ejk In Port Augusta, 300km north-west, an all-time record was also set, as the city hit 49.5C. Last week, temperatures in Adelaide, home to 1.3 million people, hit 45C, sending homelessness shelters into a “code red”, and sparking fears of another mass fish death in the Menindee Lakes in the neighbouring state of New South Wales. In central and western Australia, local authorities were forced to carry out an emergency animal cull, shooting 2,500 camels – and potentially a further hundred feral horses – who were dying of thirst.  Just so we're clear, being the hottest place on Earth is not the way that I had hoped Australia would be leading the world re. #climatechange when I started working on this thing ... but it's probably what our current level of policy ambition deserves.#climatecrisis #auspol pic.twitter.com/oPnEilRpcv The hottest places in the world right now: https://t.co/IZVNXXi28R pic.twitter.com/y6D2h1FGEV On Thursday, 17 records were broken across South Australia, either of all-time temperatures or January records. Sternhouse Bay (45.6C), Port Lincoln (47C), Minnipa (47.3), and Snowtown (47.3C) were among the hottest, with Snowtown beating its previous record by 1.3C. RECORDS: Stenhouse Bay has easily surpassed its previous record of 44.0C (on 16 Jan & and 2 Feb 2014), and is now 45.6C. Adelaide Airport is also a record at 44.3C (previous record 44.1C 4th Jan 2013). Roseworthy is at 46.9 (prev record 46.7 on 28 Jan 2009). Thursday’s heat is set to spread across the states of Victoria and New South Wales, just days after an earlier record-breaking heatwave passed across the country. Last week, a dozen heat records fell, with nine alone in NSW. The small NSW outpost of Noona, around 800km west of Sydney, recorded the country’s highest ever overnight minimum temperature of 35.9C. The back-to-back heatwaves are part of a summer that the Bureau of Meteorology predicted as being hotter and drier than average, partially as a result of climate change. On Friday, Victoria will become the “hottest place in Australia”, according to Jonathan How from the bureau. The cities of Mildura, Swan Hill and Echuca are set for 46C, which could break records. In Melbourne, as Novak Djokovic and Lucas Pouille settle in for the semi-finals of the Australian Open, the maximum temperature will be 43C, with 44C in some suburbs."

"The climate crisis is intensifying a new military buildup in the Arctic, diplomats and analysts said this week, as regional powers attempt to secure northern borders that were until recently reinforced by a continental-sized division of ice. That so-called unpaid sentry is now literally melting away, opening up shipping lanes and geo-security challenges, said delegates at the Arctic Frontiers conference, the polar circle’s biggest talking shop, who debated a series of recent escalations.  Russia is reopening and strengthening cold war bases on the Kola peninsula in the far north-west of the country. Norway is beefing up its military presence in the high Arctic. Last October, Nato staged Trident Juncture with 40,000 troops, its biggest military exercise in Norway in more than a decade. A month earlier Britain announced a new “Defence Arctic Strategy” and promised a 10-year deployment of 800 commandos to Norway and four RAF Typhoons to patrol Icelandic skies. The US is also sending hundreds more marines to the region on long-term rotations and has threatened to send naval vessels through Arctic shipping lanes for the first time. While these strategic moves have echoes of the cold war, the modest buildup falls far short of that era, and there remains a strong spirit of cooperation in many areas. The current tensions are a result of a world warmed by industrial emissions. The Arctic is heating up twice as fast as the rest of the planet, shrinking sea ice and exposing more water and territory to exploitation and access. “Right now, the reasons we are seeing more military activity is that countries are worried by the spectre of open water,” one of the speakers, Klaus Dodds, a professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London, told the Guardian. “The unique Arctic security architecture has shape and form that come from natural extremities. If the Arctic becomes just another ocean, this breaks down. It’s elemental.” The Arctic’s unique characteristics are under attack from all sides. Below, the once-frozen ocean is now mixed with warmer, more saline Atlantic waters. In the skies above, the polar vortex above is weakening, allowing intrusions of balmy air currents from the south. Sea ice is being lost at a rate of more than 10,000 tonnes per second, according to Tore Furevik, a professor at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Bergen. “We’re heading for a new and uncertain Arctic with ramifications for nature and politics,” he said. “We should strive to be less suspicious, less hostile and more open-minded if we are to deal with a problem that we have so recklessly created.” By 2035, the Arctic is forecast to be free of ice during summer, which will allow ships to sail across the north pole. Business interest is growing. For the first time, last summer, a Maersk container ship navigated the northern sea route from Asia to Europe carrying fish and electronic goods. Energy companies are exploring new oil and gas fields. Once remote regions are becoming geopolitical hotspots. Tromsø, in Norway, which hosted the conference, was once a tiny trading post. Today, it’s a tourism hub and a gateway to the mineral-rich north. “Now we have a historically strange situation with political and economic activity in the Arctic. So many people are knocking on our door, including business and state representatives from China, Pakistan, Singapore and Morocco,” the mayor, Kristin Røymo, told the Guardian. “There is also a very obvious increased naval presence.” This concerns many conference participants, who highlight the peaceful history of cross-border cooperation in the far north. Even during the cold war, there were agreements on fishing, scientific research and reindeer herding that continue today. Norwegian politicians were at pains to downplay the significance of the current military buildup. “There is no direct link between climate change and conflict,” the former defence minister Espen Barth Eide said. “It’s not because there is an immediate threat, it’s that, as an area becomes more important, it’s natural to have a heightened military presence.” He compared the situation to the South China Sea, where China, the US and other nations compete, not by firing weapons, but by demonstrating capacity and presence. “To some extent that is happening now in the Arctic,” he said, although he stressed there were no territorial disputes to inflame passions. The build-up is portrayed almost as a form of climate adaptation – strengthening the military presence along with infrastructure affected by melting permafrost. However, there are tensions. In a keynote speech, the Norwegian foreign minister, Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide, complained about communications interference by Russia in the far north. She plans to arrange a meeting with the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, to discuss the allegation. “Most important is to open political dialogue and talk not just about what we agree on but what we do not agree on,” she said. Norway is also contributing to the climate problem and the strategic tensions. It has just approved a raft of new oil exploration licenses in the Barents Sea and one of its citizens has been caught spying in Russia. Russia is uneasy about recent Nato exercises that have pushed deep into the north, according to Teimuraz Ramishvili, the ambassador to Norway. He told the Guardian the military modernisation on the Russian side was overdue after 20 years of neglect and its significance should not be overstated. “In Europe, you have military installations that are used for peaceful purposes. Why it that OK in Europe, but not in Russia?” he asked. He said Moscow put a high priority on the northern region, where the potential was so great that some talk enthusiastically of an “Arctic age”. “For us, this is a matter of sustainable development of Russian territory. This is not open water, it is Russian territory,” said Ramishvili. “The Arctic isn’t a nature resort. It’s a place where Russians have lived for a long time.” Currently, cargo companies that use the northern shipping lanes need to pay Russia. But this will change as the sea ice recedes and Arctic routes open up in international waters. China, which has declared itself a “near-Arctic nation”, is among the countries exploring this area. Last year, it launched a second Snow Dragon ice breaker and released an Arctic white paper that explored the potential for infrastructure investments in a Polar Silk Road. The US, by comparison, is lagging behind. Although its nuclear submarines have operated under the ice for decades, its surface navy is ill-equipped for the Arctic. “Everyone’s up there but us,” the navy secretary, Richard Spencer, complained last month. “The threat is back on. This is an area … we need to focus on,” he said. Spencer has called for a strategic Arctic port in Alaska and US naval vessels to conduct navigation operations later this year in northern shipping lanes so they have the capacity to conduct emergency operations if necessary. “Can you imagine a Carnival line cruise ship having a problem, and the Russians do the search and do the extraction?” he said. The prospect of a US warship sailing near Russia’s vast northern border would certainly amplify unease, as well as highlighting the geopolitical challenges caused by global heating. Lisa Murkowski, a US senator for Alaska, did not expect the US navy to enter Russian waters, but, considering everything else that is going on, she said any freedom of navigation mission in the region would raise sensitivity. “It’s important for the US to project military strength, but there should be no intention to be unduly provocative,” she told the conference. The problem, she said, was that the White House had not updated its strategy to deal with a fast-changing region. “Under this administration, we are not assigning a significant priority to our role as an Arctic nation. There is a void,” she said. Environmentalists at the conference highlighted the dual role of oil in worsening the tension: both as a driver of climate change and of the push for more resource extraction from the still largely pristine Arctic. Norway came under fire for approving 83 new exploration licenses last week, more than a dozen of which were in the Barents Sea. “The false narrative of this conference is that Arctic countries are doing sustainable development,” said Martin Sommerkorn, head of conservation of the WWF Arctic Programme. “You can’t say that just days after you grant 83 new licenses. That’s completely wrong.”"
"History is littered with examples of rulers building walls to keep out undesirables, invaders and immigrants. The Great Wall of China and Hadrian’s Wall in Britain are among the best-known examples, and there is a 2,000-mile (3,200km) fence between India and Bangladesh. The earliest-known barrier for this purpose was in the cradle of civilisation in Mesopotamia about 4,300 years ago. A 110-mile wall called the “Repeller of the Amorites” was built to keep out the tribe of that name who were known as “a ravaging people with the instincts of a beast”.  This was because they did not grow grain but hunted for their food. The wall did not work, however, because the Akkadian empire was being overwhelmed by a force greater than the Amorites – climate change. A drought in the region that lasted for 300 years destroyed the empire. During that period, the whole Middle East region was subject to mass migrations as various tribes looked for greener pastures as their homelands dried up. Exactly what caused that drought is still not clear, but the effects are exactly those that are beginning to happen worldwide at the moment – an unpredictable climate forcing millions of people to migrate to survive. History teaches us walls will not solve the problem."
