"Lessons from past failures will help push nations towards a robust climate change agreement that will push down greenhouse gas emissions, the White House has predicted. The US has promised to take a leadership role during next week’s talks in Paris, with Barack Obama arriving on Sunday night for a number of high-level meetings designed to spur early momentum.  The UN talks start on Monday and will run until 11 December, with 138 heads of state expected to attend. Obama will hold a bilateral meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping on Monday morning that will send a “strong message to the world of their shared commitment to combat climate change and see a strong agreement reached”, according to Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications at the White House. Following the meeting between the world’s two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, the US president will have one-on-one dialogues with French president François Hollande and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi.  The following day, Obama will meet with leaders of low-lying island nations, such as the Marshall Islands and Kiribati, that are particularly vulnerable to climate change and are keen to see wealthy nations part with the $100bn in climate finance promised at the 2009 Copenhagen talks. He will then return to the US. White House officials said that the president was determined to show leadership on the issue of climate change as it posed a “clear and present threat” to US national security and an “existential challenge” to developing nations that will bear the brunt of extreme weather events and food insecurity caused by warming temperatures. Rhodes said the Paris talks will be approached differently to Copenhagen, which is widely viewed as a hastily patched-together failure.  “By the time [Obama arrived in Copenhagen] things had already unravelled and then had to be put back together,” he said. “The goal here is to give a push with heads of state at the beginning of the process and then allow [secretary of state John] Kerry and others to finalise the details.” The White House anticipates the talks will help meet an internationally agreed target of keeping global warming below a 2C compared with pre-industrial times, even though current emissions reduction pledges amount to warming of around 2.7C. Periodic reviews of emissions cuts beyond Paris will help meet this goal, officials said.  “The stars are more aligned to reach agreement than I have ever seen before,” said Todd Stern, the US chief negotiator. “There is no comparison between Paris and Copenhagen in 2009. We have this opportunity, this moment. Countries are going to have to be willing to depart from some of their fixed positions to seek common good. We can get this done. We will get his done.”  Stern, the US’s long-standing special envoy on climate change, said that he envisaged “normal” problems over striking a deal in Paris that was fair to all countries and which reflected different countries’ abilities to make emissions cuts. “We have a situation where 60-65% of emissions come from developing countries,” he said. “That’s a good thing. It means that developing countries are developing. But you cannot solve climate change on the back of the 35%. “You cannot ask countries to act in ways that are inconsistent with their growth imperatives. Countries need to act in a way that they think they can manage. We can’t just say to developed countries that ‘this is your burden’.” White House officials said they are consulting members of the Republican-controlled US Congress over the talks but would not be drawn on whether the Paris agreement will need approval from the Senate, as treaties normally do.  Kerry has said that the mix of binding and non-binding elements of the deal – emissions cuts will require “transparency and accountability” but will not be legally binding according to the White House – means it doesn’t fit the standard definition of a treaty.  In a bid to generate further momentum for the Paris talks, the White House announced on Monday that federal agencies will further slash their own output of greenhouse gases. The US government, one of the largest emitters in the country, now has an emissions reduction target of 41.8% from 2008 levels by 2025. This target, a slight upgrade on targets first announced in March, will encompass the 360,000 buildings and 650,000 fleet vehicles operated by US government agencies. Nasa will invest in renewable energy and will cut energy consumption at the Johnson Space Center in Houston by 17% through a new heat and power system. Other actions include a cut in petrol use by the Department of Homeland Security and an expanded solar energy array for the Department of Energy. However, Obama’s Republican opponents in Congress continue to oppose key elements of the US’s plan to tackle climate change, as well as providing climate finance for developing countries. A senior Republican figure has also launched a campaign against the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the federal agency that tracks the weather and climate. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House science committee, has demanded internal correspondence from Noaa in a bid to reveal what he believes is a conspiracy to alter climate data to support Obama’s agenda. Smith has focused upon a study published in the journal Science, authored by Noaa scientists, that challenges the theory among some climate science sceptics that there has been a “pause” in the rise in global temperatures.  Kathryn Sullivan, Noaa’s administrator, has refused to hand over the correspondence and has written to Smith to state: “I have not or will not allow anyone to manipulate the science or coerce the scientists who work for me.”"
"Your article (Paris attacks cast shadow over climate talks, 23 November) helpfully draws attention to the different responses we have to crises. The shockingly violent events in Paris and their aftermath received almost blanket media coverage for about a week, during which we appear to have become collectively ready to sacrifice billions of pounds and who knows how many lives to a quick response (bombing Isis in Syria) which, by most rational judgments, will do more harm than good for our interests in the long term. Notwithstanding the emotional and psychological imperative to “do something”, would it not be wiser to do nothing until we know what it would be useful to do? Meanwhile, a more dangerous and sinister enemy than terrorism looms on the horizon in the form of climate change. Despite knowing about this menace for over 20 years and having developed the resources and know-how to defeat it, we have simply allowed the situation to worsen. We know the identity of the “evil masterminds” (the leaders of heavy-carbon industries) behind this ongoing atrocity which is in the process of slaughtering many millions of people and could quite conceivably wipe out civilisation. We also know the identities and whereabouts of the “terrorists” – every one of us who carries out the wishes of the masterminds by burning fossil fuel as if there was no tomorrow and neglecting to invest properly in the renewable energies that can save us.  It’s time we learned how to make use of a crisis. The Paris attacks can be a catalyst for world leaders and their administrators attending the forthcoming climate summit to work collaboratively with courage and determination, charged with the new sense of solidarity and urgency referred to in your article, to begin solving a problem which – though immensely difficult, complicated and challenging – we actually know how to solve.Chris NeillPeper Harow, Surrey • Remember in March the impact of the Guardian’s climate change covers with extracts from Naomi Klein’s book? The next day’s front page had Bill McKibben describing the Paris climate conference as “a last chance for humanity”. My immediate hope was for similar prominence ahead of the conference itself next week, but this Monday’s cover was all advertisements – particularly disappointing when recent carbon news deserves front page treatment. For example, the UK government is going almost naked into the Paris conference chamber. Subsidies to the UK’s successful solar PV and onshore wind industries have been savagely cut. Recently the replacement was announced: a major expansion of natural gas electricity generation. Every kWh that would have been generated by the continued growth of PV or wind power if replaced by natural gas will increase greenhouse gas emissions substantially: nine times more when substituting for PV and 13 times more when replacing wind. The successes of the renewable industries also deserve front page exposure. Good Energy reports that wind and PV have reduced wholesale electricity prices. Data that I reported with European colleagues in Nature Materials shows that the UK was catching up with Germany in PV and wind power before the cuts. Germany has seen a 37% fall in wholesale electricity price in three years. If the cuts were reversed, such a fall would be achievable in the UK by 2018 and wind and PV power could reach their target contributions to an all-renewable UK electricity supply by 2022. Emeritus professor Keith BarnhamLondon • Sam Knight offers an optimistic view of the UN’s proposed forest conservation mechanism – Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) (The long read, 24 November). However, the proposed market-based version of REDD+ that will be discussed at the climate summit in Paris in December is badly flawed. Where there are pressures to convert forests to alternative land uses, the scheme would only succeed when the money that a forest owner would receive from selling REDD+ carbon credits were to exceed the money they would receive from deforestation and using the cleared land for, say, beef or palm oil farming. When this is so, a rational owner would in theory opt to conserve their forests. But should the price of carbon credits fall, and the price of other commodities rise, so that the revenues from farming exceed that which can be earned from REDD+, then the rational response would be to move from conservation to conversion. So a market-based mechanism could only succeed as a durable conservation mechanism when the money that forest owners gain from “selling” carbon exceeds all other alternatives over the long term. And there is absolutely no basis in economic theory – nor evidence from the many REDD+ pilot projects carried out to date – to suggest that this should be so.David HumphreysReader in environmental policy, The Open University • The urgency of the climate crisis requires meaningful action on a scale commensurate with the problem, ie rapidly phasing out the use of fossil fuels, stopping the destruction of forests and other ecosystems and allowing damaged ones to regenerate. Promoting unproven technologies as “solutions” is dangerous because it distracts from those urgent tasks. Unfortunately, many of the supposed “solutions” that Tim Flannery so optimistically writes about (Seaweed, coffee and cement could save the planet, Review, 21 November) are entirely unproven and in some cases quite impossible. Take carbon sequestration in seaweed farms: Flannery proposes using vast seaweed farms to produce fuel as well as food. Such uses would swiftly return all the CO2 in the seaweed to the atmosphere. There are problems with various other claims, too. For example he speaks of “carbon negative cement”, yet the company he cites in his book doesn’t claim that its technology is “carbon negative”, only that it reduces carbon emissions. Or take the “CO2 snow”: the lead author of the scientific study that Flannery appears to rely on has pointed out on a blog that Flannery has misunderstood the findings: temperatures in Antarctica aren’t low enough and pressure isn’t high enough for CO2 to turn into snow. Flannery admits that those are not proven solutions, yet he still says “some of the third way approaches are likely to be in the frontline of the future battle to stabilise our climate”. It’s a far safer bet to stop putting ever more carbon into the atmosphere than to hope that one day we’ll find some technofix that will suck it out again.Almuth Ernsting Edinburgh • History provides us with several examples of societies collapsing through force of habit, including an addiction to meat (Tax on meat not too hard to swallow, study suggests, 24 November). When the Vikings colonised Greenland in the 10th century, they were determined to preserve their tribal customs, which included raising cattle. Because pasture was limited and the growing season only three months, virtually all of the land was used to grow silage to see the cattle through the winter. After nine months indoors, cattle were so weak they had to be carried out to pasture. When the climate turned harsher this agricultural system became unsustainable and the Vikings of Greenland perished. I wonder whether the modern world will fare any better as we career towards climate catastrophe.Dr Robin Russell-JonesStoke Poges, Buckinghamshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"

"Vi siktar mot att bli ett av världens första fossilfria välfärdsländer som visar att det inte bara är nödvändigt att leva utan fossila bränslen, utan att det också är efterfrågat. Världen kan tackla klimatförändringen, men det är ont om tid. Sverige siktar på att bli ett av världens första fossilfria välfärdsländer. Med vårt initiativ Fossilfritt Sverige utmanar vi nu andra länder att göra likadant.  Global uppvärmning hotar själva fundamentet för människans livsmiljö. Torka, översvämningar och ett klimat som är svårare att förutspå drabbar både jordbruk och fiske hårt, och hotar därigenom tillgången till mat för väldens växande befolkning. Den globala ekonomiska tillväxten hotas, liksom år av arbete för att utplåna fattigdomen. Vi tror att det fortfarande finns tid att agera. Om världen snabbt fasar ut användningen av fossil energi till förmån för förnybar energi skulle vi komma långt, inte bara när det gäller klimatet. En utfasning skulle leda till högre energisäkerhet, bättre hälsa och förbättrad livskvalitet. Detta är sidovinster som har övertygat borgmästare världen över om att samarbeta och styra om sina strategier. Klimatåtgärder skapar goda affärsförutsättningar. Inom områden som energi, urban utveckling, jordbruk och markanvändning behöver världen investera 90 biljoner US-dollar under de kommande 15 åren, oavsett klimatförändringen. Samtidigt är dessa områden avgörande för den globala övergången mot minskade koldioxidutsläpp. Att välja gröna investeringar inom dessa sektorer skulle kosta mindre än 5 % extra – en ökning som kan kvittas genom sidovinsten av minskad bränslekonsumtion, enligt den Globala kommissionen för ekonomi och klimat. Dessutom måste man se till alla andra sidovinster och, inte minst, de enorma globala kostnader som det innebär att inte agera inför klimatförändringarna. Sverige har positiva erfarenheter av att förena minskade utsläpp med förbättrad ekonomi och välfärd. Under många år har vi genom att sätta ett pris på kol via koldioxidskatten, haft en effektiv politisk hävstång som, tillsammans med politiskt ledarskap, stödjer utvecklandet av klimatsmarta innovationer. Detta har resulterat i minskade utsläpp och marknadsbaserade lösningar samtidigt som vår ekonomi har växt. Men vi är inte färdiga än. Sverige meddelade nyligen att vi kommer att bli ett av världens första fossilfria välfärdsländer. Vi uppmanar nu andra att anta utmaningen om vem som först kan övergå till fossilfritt. Det finns tre enkla skäl till varför vi ska tävla mot detta mål: 1. Det är vårt ansvar Rika länder har en skyldighet att ta ledningen i kampen mot klimatförändringen, enligt FN:s klimatkonvention. Vissa länder befinner sig helt enkelt i en fördelaktigare situation än andra, och bör därför ta ett större ansvar för att minska utsläppen. På så sätt gör vi vår del för att säkra en bra framtid på vår planet för oss, för våra barn och för kommande generationer. 2. Det är förnuftigt av ekonomiska skäl Vi vill att svenska företag ska utveckla de klimatsmarta lösningar som världen efterfrågar. Därför måste vi agera som proaktiva föregångare och inte vara begränsade av gårdagens teknologi. Det faktum att finansmarknadens aktörer nu har börjat flytta bort sina investeringar från fossil energi är ett uttryck för denna inställning. Att göra en grön omställning skapar också nya jobb. Enligt en nyutkommen rapport från Romklubben skulle en övergång till ett förnybart och resurseffektivt samhälle kunna generera 100 000 nya jobb bara i Sverige. 3. Visa att det är möjligt Inget land är ensamt ansvarigt för så stor andel av utsläpp att det ensamt avgör om världen kommer att lyckas eller misslyckas i klimatfrågan. Men genom att vara ett föregångsexempel och bevisa att minskade utsläpp kan uppnås på ett sätt som driver på den ekonomiska utvecklingen, kan individuella aktörer påverka på ett globalt plan. Är detta vad företag vill? Tanken på ett fossilfritt samhälle omfamnas av många. Det kommer fler och fler initiativ runtom i världen där städer, företag och organisationer ersätter fossil energi med förnyelsebara källor. I Sverige gör näringslivet, lokala myndigheter och andra aktörer gemensam sak för initiativet Fossilfritt Sverige och uppmanar tillsammans deras motsvarigheter runtom i världen att anta utmaningen. Svenska företag som ABB, IKEA, H&M och Ericsson, och Sveriges största städer stödjer initiativet och bidrar själva till minskade utsläpp. Drivmedelsbolaget Preem, som driver bensinstationer över hela Sverige, har beslutat om att senast år 2030 endast erbjuda förnyelsebart bränsle i sina pumpar. Fjärde AP-fonden kommer inom fem år att investera hela sin portfölj på 200 miljarder kronor i strategier för minskade koldioxidutsläpp. Flera svenska kommuner och städer har beslutat att helt övergå till fossilfritt och några av dem siktar på att uppnå detta mål så tidigt som 2030. Världen samlas snart till FN:s klimatkonferens i Paris. Sverige kommer att vara där för att ingå i ett ambitiöst, rättvist och hållbart avtal som förbinder alla länder till fortsatta åtgärder. Vi tar med oss ett brett engagemang från företag och civilsamhället som visar att en fossilfri värld inte bara är nödvändig, utan också efterfrågad. Vi hoppas att många vill anta vår utmaning."

"Prince Charles is taking part in a project to expose major polluting corporations based in Commonwealth nations to big-money legal action if they fail to accurately disclose their impact on climate change or reform their ways. Along with lawyers and academics, the heir to the throne is lending his help to an initiative designed to publicise and develop nascent laws in Britain, Australia, South Africa and Canada which investors in polluting firms could use to drag directors through the courts. The new initiative comes as world leaders prepare to travel to Paris on Monday to open crucial UN climate talks. Negotiators are expected to agree a deal that will cover carbon emissions beyond 2020. The purpose of the prince’s project – the Commonwealth Climate and Law Initiative (CCLI) – is to illustrate to investors what they might do if companies are not frank with them about the damage they are inflicting on the world. The initiative will also lay out the risks in such behaviour to investors’ own future returns amid ever more significant government curbs on carbon emissions. By making investors more aware – and active – it is hoped that corporate behaviour will also change. It is a relatively new area of law but last month the New York state attorney general issued subpoenas to Exxon and Peabody Energy, and began investigations over claims that they misled the public and investors about the dangers and potential business risks associated with climate change and their role in it. In a speech in September the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, warned company directors in the UK that they could be held legally liable for failing to manage climate change risks. He warned that those involved in the mining of fossil fuels, for example, would need to disclose to investors how greater government curbs on emissions would affect their future profitability. The CCLI project is being launched on the first day of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Malta on Friday. The prince is attending and is expected to lobby leaders on the need for greater resolve on climate change. Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the UK account for 13% of global coal reserves and 11% of global oil reserves. Their stock exchanges also have 27% of all listed fossil fuel reserves and 36% of listed fossil fuel resources, making them key parts of those countries’ economies. The prince has been increasingly outspoken on the issue of climate change in recent days, saying in an interview with Sky News that drought exacerbated by climate change was one of the causes of the civil war in Syria. On Thursday, he said in a speech in Malta that if international leaders failed to clinch a deal on climate change at talks in Paris next week, it could leave mankind facing a “perfect storm”. He is providing his support for the initiative through his Accounting for Sustainability project, which he founded in 2004 to change corporate behaviour. Other partners on the project are the University of Oxford’s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment (SSEE), and activist lawyers at ClientEarth, whose patrons include the band Coldplay. Jessica Fries, executive chairman of Accounting for Sustainability, said that pension funds in particular would be wise to grill companies about their role in climate change and how future government regulation could affect returns. She warned firms that they would need to recognise the responsibilities they have to investors or face the consequences. She said: “Climate change poses significant risks for pension funds and companies, in addition to that faced by society as a whole. Trustees and company directors need to ensure that they respond appropriately. A proper understanding of the legal and fiduciary responsibilities is key. This new initiative will explore the issues faced and help to develop a response.” James Thornton, CEO of ClientEarth, said: “The days of treating climate change as a fringe concern are over and the potential for climate change litigation against companies or individual directors is growing. They urgently need clarity on their responsibilities, so this initiative is timely.” Ben Caldecott, programme director at SSEE, said the project was necessary to educate company directors and promote better governance standards.  He said: “Company directors could be at risk of litigation if they mislead investors and the public about climate change. They may also face litigation for having contributed to anthropogenic climate change. This is a very new area, but one with potentially significant consequences. This new initiative will help investors to assess the materiality of these potential liabilities and inform best practice across Commonwealth common law countries.”"
"While all the focus and hope for tackling climate change is on COP 21 in Paris, starting today, secretive global trade deals are already negating any commitments that might be made at the summit. The texts from the various trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TTP), make it clear that they will increase production, trade and consumption of fossil fuels.  What we know of the EU trade deals with Canada (Ceta – Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) and the US (TTIP – Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) points to significant increases in European fossil fuel imports from North America, and a restriction of the policy space to promote low-carbon economies and renewables. Trade deals are particularly bad news when it comes to food and climate change. The global food system is already responsible for around half of global greenhouse gas emissions. The World Bank is projecting that emissions from agriculture and food could account for as much as 70% (pdf) of total allowable emissions to keep below a 2C temperature rise by 2050, if governments continue to ignore the problem. If we are going to deal with climate change, we have to overhaul the global food system. But a new generation of trade deals will amplify emissions from the food system. At a most basic level, trade deals are designed to open up markets and increase trade of the highest emitting foods – meat and dairy. For example, TPP will boost US pork and beef exports to Asia and US dairy exports to Canada. TTIP is expected to open Europe’s border to more US beef. Australia’s dairy exports to China, up 300% in the past eight years, are a big reason why the two countries just signed a trade pact. The flow of cheap imports resulting from these deals will play a part in increasing global consumption of meats by 76% by 2050. Trade agreements also favour food production from intensive farms and large-scale plantations. When China joined the World Trade Organisation and opened its market to soybean imports the result was a dramatic expansion of soybean plantations in the forests and savannahs of the southern cone of Latin America and a corresponding rise in intensive pig production in China, fed on the imported beans. New trade deals will likely do the same for maize imports. Meanwhile, the EU economic partnerships with Africa threaten to undercut traditional backyard poultry, perhaps the lowest emitting source of meat on the planet, with frozen cuts of industrial chicken from Europe, which are high up on the emissions scale. Obama has just retaliated against attempts by South Africa to protect its own local poultry industry. Some of the most serious impacts from trade deals result not so much from the immediate lifting of trade restrictions but the creation of new advantages for foreign investors that lead to longer term changes in what and how people eat. Once Mexico began implementing the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), investment from foreign food companies and retailers flooded in, bringing with it a drastic increase in the consumption of processed foods that are high on the emissions scale, partly because of all the packaging but mainly because these foods are made with high emissions, imported ingredients, such as powdered milk and palm oil. The trade deals also contain measures that allow food companies to challenge popular initiatives that are good for the climate but impinge on their profits. “Buy local” programmes, with their obvious benefits to fighting climate change, are generally considered discriminatory and trade distorting under free trade doctrine. The TTIP, for instance, may forbid initiatives to support the use of local foods in public services like schools and hospitals. The same is true of initiatives to support “green” purchasing or programmes to require purchasing from small- and medium-sized enterprises in the name of mitigating climate change. Both of these types of effort can be contested by companies as discriminatory, under the investor-state dispute mechanisms contained in many trade agreements. While we can say that agriculture has been getting more attention in climate change discussions over the past two years, this has yet to result in a comprehensive assessment of the role of our food systems, much less in meaningful government action. What governments have presented so far is sparse and heavily dominated by the industry’s most polluting companies, as can be seen in the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture, a group dominated by the fertiliser lobby. In trade agreements, where the real binding commitments are made and subjected to corporate-led dispute settlement, governments are moving in the opposite direction and not even acknowledging the mismatch between their trade and climate agendas.

"At least 24 climate activists have been put under house arrest by French police, accused of flouting a ban on organising protests during next week’s Paris climate summit, the Guardian has learned.  One legal adviser to the activists said many officers raided his Paris apartment and occupied three floors and a staircase in his block.   French authorities did not respond to requests for comment but lawyers said that the warrants were issued under state of emergency laws, imposed after the terror attacks that killed 130 people earlier this month.  The author and climate change campaigner, Naomi Klein, accused French authorities of “a gross abuse of power that risks turning the summit into a farce”. “Climate summits are not photo opportunities to boost the popularity of politicians,” she told the Guardian. “Given the stakes of the climate crisis, they are by their nature highly contested. That is democracy, messy as it may be. The French government, under cover of anti-terrorism laws, seems to be trying to avoid this, shamefully banning peaceful demonstrations and using emergency powers to pre-emptively detain key activists.”   Since Thursday, three people have been placed under house arrest in Rens, two in Paris, two in Rouen and one in Lyons, according to campaigners. They may now only leave their houses to sign a post office register verifying their whereabouts, three times a day.  Joel Domenjoud, a legal activist, said that he had been served with a restraining order wrongly describing him as a “principal leader of the ultra-left movement” just hours after a judge refused to hear an appeal against the ban on the climate demo that he had petitioned for.  “I wasn’t there when they came to my house but my neighbour called me to say ‘What’s wrong? The stairs are full of cops from the first to the third floor!’” he said.  Domenjoud says he was then followed by several undercover officers, before returning home, where he was served with the restraining notice.  “I feel angry about it because I think they made a big mistake,” Domenjoud added. “They weren’t looking for people like us activists – or if they were, it shows that they can target people for no reason at all and our civil liberties are in danger.”  Several sources said that officers also raided three squats in Paris – and more across the country – seizing computers, documents and personal effects.  Thousands of climate campaigners, including high-profile Indian activist Vandana Shiva, have vowed to defy the blanket ban on demonstrations. One protest on Sunday will be protected by a ‘human chain’, while a day of civil disobedience will take place when the summit ends on 12 December, dubbed as ‘red lines’ day. Numbers are expected to be smaller than previously hoped, but artists have been working around the clock on creations such as a series of ‘inflatable cobble stones’, alluding to a famous slogan from the May 1968 protests: Beneath the cobble stones the beach. Some protesters argue that the permission granted to football matches, trade fairs and Christmas markets in Paris over the summit period suggests that the authorities’ real concern is to suppress dissent. “We are trying to find grey areas in the law,” said John Jordan, a prominent activist. “At the moment, a demonstration is legally defined as more than two people who share a political message. We are trying to find creative ways around these laws.” During recent protests by Quebec students, participant numbers were kept to below 50 on each march, to avoid a prohibition order. "
"Coal can help countries meet international climate targets emerging from next week’s Paris conference, the Minerals Council of Australia has said. Greg Evans, an executive director of the council, said the industry had a role to play in reducing climate change. “We see coal very much at the centre of this debate because it can lower emissions,” Evans told ABC radio on Friday. “The coal industry has the opportunity, has the technology through helipower and carbon capture and storage, to help deliver these [climate] outcomes.” Australia will take a target to the Paris conference of reducing carbon emissions by between 26% and 28% of 2005 levels by 2030. On Friday Labor announced its target, a 45% cut by 2030. The Paris conference is expected to reiterate the international commitment made in the Copenhagen agreement in 2009 to limit warming to 2C (36F). Evans said the coal industry was “necessary” to Australia and could help get people out of poverty. But Ian Dunlop, a former head of the Australian Coal Association, has rubbished the coal industry’s suggestion that there is a moral case to retain the energy source, an assertion famously adopted by Tony Abbott. “It’s not true at all,” Dunlop told ABC radio on Friday. “There is no moral case for the use of coal, because the use of coal in the way we’ve been using it is going to cause massive poverty. “If we keep on pouring money into coal mines, we’re going to exacerbate poverty and cause more problems.” A survey has found that three out of five Australians believe coal is an energy source of the past and will soon be obsolete.  The survey of 1,507 people, conducted by Essential and commissioned by GetUp!, found that 77% of the respondents wanted the government to help coalminers transition into different forms of employment. About 68% wanted the Coalition to match Labor’s commitment to source half of Australia’s energy needs from renewable sources by 2030. On Friday, an open letter signed by 300 actors, musicians, novelists and others will be published in British newspapers and magazines, including the Guardian. The letter urges world leaders to take climate change seriously as they head to Paris. Evans said the letter was a “stunt”. Dunlop was among the signatories to another open letter, published in October, in which prominent Australians had called for the Paris conference to discuss banning new coalmines. “I don’t think a lot of world leaders have focused on this as yet,” he said on Friday. “But the point is, if you don’t do it, there’s no way of staying below 2 degrees.” Nearly 150 world leaders will arrive in Paris for the conference on Monday, aiming to work out a path towards reducing emissions after 2020."
"It will be fractious and frustrating and it won’t “solve” the problem. But the Paris climate summit that starts on Monday is likely to be characterised as a success anyway.  That’s because negotiators have reset what qualifies as succeeding, and not just to allow world leaders to pat themselves on the back. Counterintuitively, demanding less might, in the end, achieve more than previous ambitious meetings that ended in failure.  For more than 20 years, the world has been struggling to tackle a collective problem that costs a huge amount to solve but immeasurably, unthinkably more to leave unattended.   The UN process has abandoned the old approach of trying to impose on each nation a fair share of the global job of reducing greenhouse emissions and is instead allowing countries to pledge what they feel able to contribute and are prepared to defend as a reasonable contribution to the accepted global goal of limiting global warming to 2C.  We know already that the promises won’t get there. The US president, Barack Obama was upfront about this when Rolling Stone accompanied him on a trip to Alaska in September. “Let’s stipulate right now, whatever various country targets are, it’s still going to fall short of what the science requires. So a per cent here or a per cent there coming from various countries is not going to be a deal-breaker.  “But making sure everybody is making serious efforts and that we are making a joint international commitment that is well-defined and can be measured will create the basis for us each year, then, to evaluate, ‘How are we doing?’ and will allow us, five years from now, to say the science is new, we need to ratchet it up, and by the way, because of the research and development that we’ve put in, we can achieve more ambitious goals,” he said. The president was on the money. Even if every pledge is met (they have so far been received from 166 countries responsible for more than 90% of the world’s emissions) global warming will still hit at least 2.7C and might even rise to 3.5C – an outcome science tells us will still cause Australian cities like Perth to experience 50% more days with temperatures over 45C, reduce winter and spring rainfall in the southeastern Australian food bowl, increase the frequency and severity of droughts and increase the number of days of extreme fire danger in southern eastern Australia. Without an agreement, those impacts would be worse. The idea of the Paris agreement is to lock in those first pledges and then, over time, push countries to each do a bit more to make up the difference. In an interesting speech available on the Department of Foreign Affairs website, Australia’s ambassador for the environment, Peter Woolcott, argues this new bottom up approach is a recognition of the limitations of multilateralism to deal with common problems like climate change in a world where the location and very nature of power is changing. So here are seven things to know about what Paris could do, and what it means for Australia. The Abbott government said it would reduce Australia’s emissions by between 26% and 28% of 2005 levels between 2020 and 2030. Malcolm Turnbull has not changed that target. Analysis by Climate Action Tracker rates that promise as “inadequate” and so does Labor, which says it would aim for a 45 per cent reduction over the same timeframe. The government claims it is in “the middle of the pack”. But while Australian debate sometimes paints that number as static - a done deal - the Paris agreement sees it as an initial offer. The new agreement will build in a process to ratchet up the contribution, proposing a global “stock-take” even before the 2020 start date and regular national reviews every five years. The Australian government has backed the idea of five yearly reviews.  The draft agreement – which instead of getting honed down at the final pre-Paris negotiating session in Bonn, Germany, actually grew to 51 pages, including, as one of a thicket of unresolved “options” on every topic, that the world should aim for net zero emissions by 2050, or maybe 2100, and, at the insistence of the US and developing countries, the goal of “decarbonisation of the global economy over the course of the century”. These somewhat vague long-term goals are intended as flashing light signals to business and to people (like former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott who said coal use would go “up and up and up for decades and decades to come”) that the world must gradually wean itself off fossil fuels. At the recent G20 meeting Turnbull signed on to a call for Paris to “establish a durable platform for limiting global temperature rise to below two degrees”. Hunt has spoken of Australia achieving net zero emissions by the end of the century. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has set a goal of net zero emissions by 2050. The targets pledged in the Paris agreement will not be legally binding because if they were it would require US senate ratification with a ⅔ majority and that won’t happen and then everything would stall. But it will include rules about checking and reporting what countries are doing, so laggards can be “named and shamed” and so countries can be confident everyone else is doing their bit before agreeing to “rachet up”. Australia is lobbying for clear, strong monitoring rules. The central tension in international climate talks ever since Rio in 1992, where the UN Framework Convention was signed, is the developing nations’ fear that rich countries will thwart poor countries’ economic development in order to solve the climate change problem the rich countries’ development has created. In fact the convention specifically divides the world into developed and developing country lists, with very different obligations. But the global economy has changed dramatically since then, and Paris aims to reflect those changes. Australia argues that the same transparency rules must apply to all. Woolcott sees the change as “a microcosm of the problems of the wider UN”. “We are between multilateral worlds – the old world dominated by the West can no longer dictate nor finance alone the solution. The new world has not yet arrived and the emerging powers are reluctant to take on responsibilities which might compromise their freedom of manoeuvre and economic development.” But finance from rich countries is likely to be the trade-off for agreement to universal obligations by developing countries. Which brings us to...  By which we mean an agreement for countries and companies to provide at least $100bn a year by 2020 to poorer countries to help them mitigate and adapt to climate change. This is likely to be one of the hardest-fought parts of the Paris Agreement because developing countries are demanding a specific, and higher, figure after 2020, and there is dissent about how much aid should come from countries like China, which recently pledged $3.1bn. So far, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the total amount promised is around $60bn a year. At last year’s US conference in Lima, Peru, Australia promised $200m to the Green Climate Fund, an organisation then prime minister Abbott described as “the Bob Brown Bank on an international scale” – a reference to the domestic Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which Abbott unsuccessfully sought to abolish. Australia has since resumed its position as co-chair of the fund, a move seen internationally as a sign of a more cooperative attitude. But Australia will still be under pressure to provide more money. Non-government organisations say we should be tipping in about $1.5bn. Given the government’s focus on reining in spending, that is unlikely, but it may look for ways to leverage more private sector spending.  If Paris succeeds in its modest aspirations, the Turnbull government will be under even more pressure to explain how its Direct Action policy can meet the target, and the tougher ones to follow. The government has promised a review of the policy in 2017, after the next federal election. Business has noted the discrepancy between the targets and the capacity of existing policy and assumes tougher rules are coming. While the Australian debate has been obsessed with the alleged costs of reducing emissions, business has long understood some costs are inevitable and is craving the investment certainty of a stable and workable policy – and many business groups are again calling for a carbon price. And in the lead up to the 2016 election, Labor will also come under pressure, because so far it hasn’t announced a detailed policy at all – only an intention to reintroduce some kind of emissions trading scheme. This Paris agreement will be the start of a long, long process. It feels as though these talks get nowhere fast. In 1992 I reported on the Rio de Janeiro meeting, where leaders signed the framework convention promising to take some kind of action. In 1997 that turned into concrete commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce emissions by 2012 with the aim of cutting emissions by 5%. But for many years it was not ratified, and even when it was, countries that failed to meet their targets met no sanction. In 2009, the global talks tried to lock in the next step in the process – promises by both developed and developing countries to reduce emissions – but the chaotic Copenhagen meeting ended with a loose accord, not tied into the UN process until the following year’s meeting in Cancun, Mexico, and countries like Australia – which had nominated a target range (reducing emissions by between 5% and 25% by 2020) stuck with their low-ball offer.  Now the Paris pledges will try to coax the world along rather than shouting and demanding. That may turn out to be more successful. But even if it is, it’s the start – not the end – of the process. 40,000 – the number of people attending, including 25,000 delegates and 3,000 journalists 147 – the number of world leaders attending “leader’s day” on Monday, including Obama and Turnbull. The order in which they will speak at two consecutive speed-speaking sessions can be found here 196 – the number of countries represented 10,800 – the number of police deployed for the summit – 8,000 on the borders and 2,800 at the venue Seven – the number of gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol: carbon dioxide (CO2); methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N20); fluorinated gases (PFC, HFC, SF6); and, since 2013, nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)  €170m – the cost to the French government of hosting the talks. 2.7C – the warming that will still occur if every country keeps its current promises."

"The most obvious response to climate change should be to transform the way the world generates energy. Living standards have risen 40 times over the last 250 years in the west, driven neither by the small state beloved of conservatives nor the large state favoured by socialists. Rather, the growth has resulted from a complicated interaction between capitalism and science and technology, of necessity publicly funded, creating wave after wave of transformations in the character of our economic base and the quality and quantity of what it produces.  The same now has to be done for the world’s energy production. It needs to be technologically transformed to become as near carbon-free as possible, which will only work if there is a substantive global research and development effort led by governments, matching those of conquering space or winning a war, to explore the necessary technologies. Embracing global political solutions such as a global carbon tax or global emission caps are beyond political reach, given the range of entrenched interests, not to mention the stubborn refusal by many conservatives to accept climate change science. It will be innovation that will save the planet. This is the blisteringly obvious truth that should be written in neon in the skies above Paris at tomorrow’s launch of the 2015 UN climate change conference. Its goal is to try to agree binding agreements to limit the increase in global temperature to two degrees centigrade by 2100. Given the investment of Barack Obama, China’s President Xi, Germany’s Angela Merkel and 144 other global leaders in attending, and the plethora of commitments to lower carbon dioxide emissions beforehand, the conference is already likely to succeed, however partially. The issue, rather, is whether, with the range of interests that have to be assuaged, the agreements can be as universal and effective as they need to be. The good news is that, amazingly, 170 countries have produced some kind of response to the UN’s call for an “intended nationally determined contribution” (INDC). Before Paris, the world was set to produce some 65bn tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2030 compared with today’s 50bn tonnes, someone close to the negotiations told me, an increase that would have triggered a dangerous increase in global temperatures. Add up the INDCs and now the likely outcome in 2030 is 55bn tonnes. Even China and the US, hitherto both climate change recalcitrants, have made significant contributions, with China promising its emissions will peak in 2030, if not before, and the US agreeing to a 26% to 28% cut. It is good, but not enough to turn the global trends around. The task in Paris will be to convert those INDCs into harder and tougher commitments, get the 2030 projected aggregate to 50bn tonnes or lower, and then set the world on a trajectory to zero carbon emissions by 2100. If there are to be more than fancy conference promises then there have to be technologies available to replace burning fossil fuels. India, especially, has to be headed off from its plan to follow China’s path of economic development. Currently it burns as much coal as China did a generation ago; if in a generation’s time it burns as much as China does today, even allowing for more carbon efficiency, it will pump an extra 13bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. World temperatures would rise by nearer four than two degrees. But Prime Minister Modi is clear: if the choice is between poverty and climate change, India will choose the latter. The average Indian generates a quarter of the carbon emissions of an average European or Chinese and an eighth of an average American. India is determined to grow and it has huge and easily accessible coal reserves: it intends to burn them just as others burned theirs on their road to development. Modi’s point is dangerous if understandable, except India has another, even more abundant source of energy than coal: the sun. Solar energy used to be clunky and expensive; now plastic photovoltaic electricity and concentrated solar power are challenging that assumption. What is needed is the R&D, along with investment in capacity, to turn solar into a major energy source as competitively priced as open-cast mined coal.But one of the consequences of privatisation is a collapse in energy R&D. The CEGB and National Coal Board, for example, were great investors in scientific research. No more. Today, whether it’s energy utilities or solar equipment manufacturers, the sector spends less than 2% of its sales on R&D compared with, say, 15% for pharmaceuticals. Privatisation has weakened the capacity to combat global warming. Thus the case for governments to fill the gap – the argument of “a global Apollo programme to combat climate change”, authored by Sir David King and lords Browne, Layard, O’Donnell, Rees, Stern and Turner. If global R&D on energy was raised from $6bn to $15bn, focused on new build energy from renewables, principally solar, that could feed into national grids and be guided by a road map committee, the authors think solar energy could be grid competitive with coal as soon as 2022. India could grow as China has done – and world carbon dioxide emissions could definitely peak by 2030. $15bn may seem a far away target but, compared with the hundreds of billions of dollars of subsidies governments give fossil fuel production, it is trivial. Intriguingly the knight and six lords behind the Apollo programme may even be making progress with their argument: Obama and Bill Gates will announce on Monday in Paris a multibillion dollar public private fund, backed by more than a dozen countries along with companies and philanthropists, to back an Apollo-style programme for energy. Decarbonisation is going to become a big global market But India’s solar-powered grids, wind farms or even coal-powered fire stations that capture and store carbon (CCS) will not be built by the British, any more than those in the rest of Africa and Asia. Apart from nuclear, where Osborne last week announced an innovative programme to back small nuclear reactors where we do have some expertise, the story is of domestic retreat on renewables, cancellation of the £1bn CCS challenge fund and hiding behind the EU’s 2030 commitments on carbon emissions. Paris is emerging as a potentially important moment, but from which Britain is semi-detached. It is a moral obligation, global challenge and economic opportunity all going begging."
"On Monday, one of the biggest meetings in the world will begin in Paris. COP21, or the 21st conference of the parties, is the UN’s most significant summit on climate change since the 2009 meeting in Copenhagen, bringing together political leaders and delegates from just about every country in the world. Their mission is to negotiate a new deal on cutting greenhouse gas emissions after 2020 – a deal on which the earth’s future may depend.   Humanity’s emissions are approaching critical mass. Governments know this. Getting every country in the world to agree on something is not an easy task, but international negotiators recognise that in order to avoid climate calamity, global temperatures must not rise by more than 2C.  If current trends persist, that rise will be locked in within 30 years, triggering ever more extreme weather events – from droughts to heatwaves – not to mention the dramatic impact on food cycles, water insecurity and mass migration. Some even argue that climate change is a significant cause of the Syrian war, but whether you accept that or not, there is little doubt that the climate crisis will create many more conflicts. Closer to home, it is predicted that 7,000 UK homes will be lost to rising seas this century – including 800 in the next two decades – with no prospect of compensation for householders.  Indeed, even if we stay within this limit, a rise of 2C is tantamount to a death knell to many small island states. There is also the small matter of a global economic crash, triggered by the overvaluation of fossil fuel reserves – a problem known as “the carbon bubble”. As the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, recently pointed out, future generations may be unable to tackle the issue when it reaches crisis point. Essentially, we need to accelerate the transition to a world run on clean energy. Thankfully, the global climate change movement is swelling and claiming victory after victory.  When it comes to the climate crisis, ultimately, we are all culpable. In the west in particular, almost every aspect of our lifestyles – from our smartphones to our toilets – does environmental damage. Even something necessary and seemingly innocent like a heart bypass operation swells your carbon footprint more than a flight from London to Madrid. Every year, the average person in the UK produces about 12.5 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. The good news is that this figure has dropped as our energy use has become more efficient. The bad news is that according to the body that advises the government on climate change policy, this figure needs to shrink to two tonnes – just to give us a 50% chance of avoiding catastrophe. Thankfully, there are a multitude of ways that you can cut your carbon budget. Here are the most significant: There’s a reason 13 people chained themselves to Heathrow’s northern runway in July. According to climate change expert Chris Goodall, one return flight from London to New York will blow your carbon budget for a year, creating approximately 2.25 tonnes of greenhouse gases. If you must fly, try to reduce your impact by taking trains to nearby countries, combining trips, taking direct flights rather than multiple connections, and offsetting your emissions with ethical companies. The health and financial benefits of cycling are well known, but if you’re investing in a new car, join the surging electric car market. Even the world’s racing car drivers are doing it now, following the launch of Formula E, the green alternative to Formula One. If you do own a car, join a network to share it with others, and if you’re of a competitive bent, learn the secrets of hypermiling, saving fuel and money by changing the way you drive. Now we come to the real elephant - or more accurately, chicken, pig, or cow - in the room. If you’re not a frequent flyer, cutting your meat consumption is probably the single most significant act you could do to help save humanity from itself. The worldwide livestock industry produces more greenhouse gas emissions than all the cars, trucks, trains, planes and ships on the entire planet.  In fact, based on current trends, it looks practically impossible to avoid catastrophic climate change if we retain our current diets. By 2050, emissions from the global agriculture industry will consume the world’s entire carbon budget if we don’t change our habits. But full-bellied veganism isn’t the only way to help. Cutting down on the beef you eat is a significant first step – it warms the planet approximately 14 times more than chicken. You could also join up with other people by taking the Meat Free Mondays challenge. There could be hidden advantages, too: recent research showed that processed meat, such as bacon, ham and sausages, may significantly increase your chances of developing cancer. Insulate your home: draughts are responsible for a quarter of heat loss from a home, but substantial proofing is cheap, will cut your bills, and could save half a tonne of CO2, especially if you live in an older house. If double glazing is too big an investment, purchase radiator reflectors or an insulation jacket for your hot water tank, which will set you back about £15 but save you half a tonne of CO2 and more than £100 in bills per year. LED lights make a difference, too, consuming as little as 10% of the electricity of traditional bulbs. They also lower the nation’s risk of power cuts at peak times and, while they are expensive, you can earn the money back within two years. You can also accelerate the transition to renewables by using them to power your home or business. Get your energy from the wind, sea and sun by switching to a renewable supplier such as Ecotricity or Good Energy.  If home improvements are your thing, go the full mile and find out how to turn where you live into a superhome.  Yes, I said it. The internet may seem like a paper-saving planetary friend, but the carbon footprint of the world’s data centres is now equivalent to all flights taken across the globe. More to the point, the industry is only going to grow. According to research by Greenpeace, the energy needed to power the data centres of publishing corporations now outstrips the demands of their printing presses. But not all internet companies are equal. Some are starting to wake up to the necessity of accounting for their impact on the planet, even if their footprint is still huge. You can use the scorecard created by Greenpeace to browse selectively and put pressure on companies to make the switch to clean energy. Internet data is growing by 20% a year and video streaming is by the far the biggest culprit. This of course means that you must under no circumstances watch videos of cats, even if they are playing keyboards, because for every minute of feline viewing pleasure, you use up 0.1g of greenhouse gases.  (Of course, this is a relatively minor habit for an individual to kick – you would have to watch this video on repeat 22.5m times to have the same impact as that trip to New York.) A few gung-ho liberals seem to think that this is still possible. Saving the planet has been used as a decent excuse for many a party, with new friendships blossoming through the growing system of initiatives that has become known as the sharing economy. Just ask the moneyless man, who spent a year living without cash and yet managed to produce a banquet for 1,000 people, create a cinema powered by bicycles, and start what could well be the world’s first moneyless pub, the Happy Pig. Or ask Chaz and Mick, the nation’s favourite car-sharers, whose 20-mile daily commute has clearly made them the best of friends. Or ask Sam, the founder of the Streetbank network, which helps neighbours to share anything, from gazebos to language skills. Sam and his neighbour ended up sharing so much, they took down the fence between their properties so they could share the gardening too.  You could also trade in your old clothes for new at a swishing party, fix your broken hoover or hairdryer at your local Restart party, make the most of wasted food by starting a People’s Kitchen or Grub Club, and take over the roads of your city on a Friday night by joining cyclists at Critical Mass.

"Remember how Malcolm Turnbull promised to respect the intelligence of the Australian people if he became prime minister? Some of his ministers seem to have missed that memo, because they are now recycling the same discredited Abbott-era claims about the cost of more ambitious climate change action, while ignoring their own up-to-date economic modelling that says deeper emission cuts would come at far lower additional costs.  After Bill Shorten announced that Labor was likely to adopt a much tougher greenhouse target than that promised by the Coalition – a 45% cut in emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels – treasurer Scott Morrison immediately dusted off the Coalition’s claim that the independent climate change authority had found such a cut would “cost” the economy $600bn. Education minister Christopher Pyne said it was a “mad” policy that would “smash” the economy. Environment minister Greg Hunt tweeted his old “$600bn carbon Bill” press release. If Labor wants to use CCA target, they should use CCA modelling. It'll be Shorten's $600bn hit on the economy https://t.co/d6pfjFzakd But the former head of the Climate Change Authority (CCA), Bernie Fraser, has described that $600bn claim as “weird” and “misleading”. And wrong. And the government has its own, much more recent, modelling from leading economist Warwick McKibbin, which found that the difference in economic growth between the government’s target and Labor’s target would be far, far lower.  The government first started using the $600bn figure when the former prime minister Tony Abbott unveiled the new goal of reducing emissions by between 26% and 28% on 2005 levels by 2030. One day before that announcement, the Daily Telegraph revisited modelling done in 2013 for the CCA of a 40% to 60% emissions reduction target, in a front-page story headlined “ALP’s $600bn carbon bill”. The paper argued the cost was attributable to Labor because the party has said it would base its long-term targets on up-to-date advice from the CCA. Labor had at that time not announced its preferred 2030 target. The CCA tried to correct the record straight away. Fraser, the authority’s chairman and a former Reserve Bank governor, immediately issued a statement saying the claim that CCA modelling showed a 40% to 60% target would cost $600bn was “wrong”. In an interview with Guardian Australia at the time, he explained why. “Some people who don’t understand modelling draw inferences that really can’t be drawn,” he said. “This is a good illustration of the difficulties modelling can create when misinterpreted to derive misleading meanings.” “This $600bn figure is not drawn from any logical process and it becomes weirder and weirder the more that you look at it.  “It compares a scenario where Australia has a 44% target by 2030 and the rest of the world is taking very strong action, with a scenario where Australia has no target and does nothing and the rest of the world does very little, almost nothing at all. It is the inferred cost difference between those two scenarios. “If you wanted a figure with some logical credibility or relevance you would model the cost of the government’s 26% target and a 40% target for 2030 and look at the difference between those two.” And in fact the recent McKibbin modelling for the government does exactly that. It showed the government’s 26% target would shave between 0.2% and 0.4% from continued growth in Australian GDP in 2030, and based on similar assumptions, a 45% target would cut between 0.5% and 0.7% from continued economic growth. That means the difference in the economic cost of the Coalition’s 26% cut and Labor’s 45% cut is about 0.3% of GDP in 2030. The Coalition’s $600bn figure, comparing 45% with doing nothing and then adding up the cumulative costs, finds an extra GDP cost in 2030 of more than 2%.  In a way the “weird and misleading” modelling is a perfect microcosm of the weirdness of the Coalition’s climate rhetoric – pretending its own policies can do the job with almost no cost while wildly exaggerating the cost of alternatives. Let’s go back to what Malcolm Turnbull said on that day of drama when he launched his leadership bid. “We need a style of leadership that explains those challenges and opportunities, explains the challenges and how to seize the opportunities,” he said. “A style of leadership that respects the people’s intelligence, that explains these complex issues and then sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case for it. We need advocacy, not slogans. We need to respect the intelligence of the Australian people.” Quite. So why is his party ignoring its own up-to-date modelling with relevant assumptions and continuing with exaggerated cost claims? At this rate we’ll soon be back to the $100 lamb roast. "
"As the UN’s climate talks in Paris begin, the lobbying and public relations push from some of the biggest corporations responsible for climate change has gone into overdrive. What are the messages they’re so keen to spread, and what will they mean for the COP21 conference – and for the climate? A recent report from the NGO Corporate Europe Observatory reveals that what’s on offer at COP21 is nothing short of a climate catastrophe, a guaranteed recipe to cook the planet. But rather than sending the dish back, political leaders have asked for seconds, bringing the very companies responsible for the problem ever closer into the UN fold.  James Bacchus, a trade expert at the International Chamber of Commerce, says: “This issue is important for governments to address but it is far too important to leave to governments alone.” Fortunately for Bacchus, the UN agrees. The problem, however, is that is has also succeeded in creating several platforms to ensure business-friendly proposals are at the heart of climate policy-making, rather than vice versa. New markets, experimental technologies, all endorsed so polluters don’t have to change their business models. The UN’s climate chief, Christiana Figueres – who before taking up her post was principal climate change advisor to Latin America’s leading energy utility, Endesa – has even told the world to “stop demonising oil and gas companies”. Particularly since the economic crisis, powerful lobbies like BusinessEurope (the European federation of employers’ organisations) have positioned climate action as directly opposed to economic growth. The EU’s climate and energy targets for 2030 reflected this, not just lacking ambition but prioritising the competitiveness of the very industries causing climate change. The result is that governments are afraid to tackle climate change for fear of upsetting industry, or when they do, polluting industries are given huge taxpayer-funded handouts. The oil industry would have you believe that natural gas – fracked or otherwise – is the future of clean energy, despite evidence showing that methane leakage during the extraction process can cause more damage to the atmosphere than coal. In reality, it is an attempt by the oil industry to remain relevant in a world where at least 80% of fossil fuels need to remain in the ground to avoid dangerous climate change. Harvard science historian Naomi Oreskes is blunt about the issue. The dash for gas, she says, will “simply increase the total amount of fossil fuels available to burn, accelerating what is already beginning to look like a rush towards disaster.” Industry chiefs argue that putting a price on carbon and making polluters pay for emissions will transform business models. However, ExxonMobil has put an internal price on carbon, between $60 and $80 a tonne, and they’re still investing in fossil fuels. Read between the lines and much of the issue at hand is in fact a fight over regulation: do we leave it to business to choose the lowest priced emissions reductions based on a market price, regardless of the consequences? Or do we want policies supporting renewable energy or energy efficiency, regardless of whether big business believes they are the cheapest option? Tackling climate change means drastically transforming our economies. Governments, not markets, are best placed to do that. The phrase on the lips of many corporate lobbyists is “net-zero emissions”, which means that rather than eradicating all emissions, some can continue while experimental and untested technologies can remove CO2 from the atmosphere elsewhere. Shell interprets it as a green light to burn fossil fuels until the end of the century. But most negative-emissions strategies require huge amounts of land to sequester carbon, with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimating it would require up to twice the landmass of Africa to stay below 2C. In the real world, “net-zero” gives polluters an excuse to continue with business as usual, claiming that future inventions will fix the problem. Expect to hear about the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture in Paris. It is supposed to help small farmers adapt to climate change while reducing emissions, but has been hijacked by synthetic fertiliser companies like Yara and Monsanto. The refusal to define what “climate smart agriculture” is has allowed agribusiness to add a new green tint to business as usual, pushing the same practices that have led to deforestation, land grabs, biodiversity loss and soaring emissions. More than 350 civil society groups are calling on COP21 to reject the concept and the Alliance, labelling it “green-washed false solutions”. At COP21 the Lima-Paris Action Agenda will hold up the cosmetic commitments from the likes of Shell and BP alongside the weak government agreement to hide the lack of ambition. Many gave up hope a long time ago that Paris would deliver. But it could still be a step in the right direction. Hundreds of thousands have already added their name to campaigns urging governments to recognise the damaging influence “big polluters” have over climate policy, and to kick them out of COP21 and all levels of government. If enough people get behind it, Paris could mark a watershed moment: the beginning of the end for the cosy affair between politicians and polluters."
"Thousands of climate change campaigners had planned to blockade the major UN climate summit COP21 in Paris this Sunday, but security concerns following the Paris attacks have seen some demonstrations banned.  Although none of the 130-plus heads of state and government due to converge in Paris have pulled out, the terrorist attacks have changed the mood of COP21 – protests – some long-planned – have been prohibited and security has been stepped up. A potentially huge march organised by environmental groups including Greenpeace and WWF aimed to emulate last year’s People’s Climate March in New York city, and forums held in ‘red inflatable’ blockades around the main summit site are uncertain. Protest organisers of what has been dubbed the ‘Climate Games’ – two weeks of games escalating with a mixture of protests, street art, non-violent action and online hacks – appear to acknowlegde the ban but defend the right to protest. A statement on their website reads:  “We will not bend to the politics of fear that stifle liberties in the name of security. The biggest threat to security, to life in all its forms, is the system that drives the climate disaster. History is never made by those who ask permission.” Current commitments on greenhouse gas emissions run out in 2020, so in Paris governments will need to decide what happens for the decade after that at least, and potentially beyond. Were you planning to protest in Paris but are put off by the ban, or maybe you’re still planning on attending? We want you to tell us what message you want to send to the heads of state and government. We’ll use a selection of responses in a feature about why people protest at climate summits and what they want.

"Björk, David Bowie and a host of musicians, actors, artists, novelists and leading figures in the creative industries have called on negotiators at next week’s climate summit in Paris to reach a deal that staves off dangerous global warming. The letter to the French foreign minister and the UN climate chief in charge of the talks is signed by a selection of A-listers from the British cultural scene, including actors Steve Coogan and Emma Thompson, musicians Damon Albarn and Guy Garvey, and writers Ian McEwan and Philip Pullman.   The heads of national institutions such as the Royal Opera House, the Royal Albert Hall and the National Theatre, along with the chiefs of Bafta and UK Music, are among more than 300 people who have signed the letter asking governments to ensure the Paris deal is “ambitious” and “inspiring.” Nearly 150 world leaders including Barack Obama, Xi Jinping and David Cameron will arrive in Paris on Monday for the UN climate summit, billed as one of the largest diplomatic conferences ever organised.  More than 170 countries have submitted plans to curb carbon emissions in advance of the COP21 conference, which is designed to produce a binding deal on emissions beyond 2020 and financing for poorer countries to deal with climate change. The creative industry’s letter to Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister who will be president of the talks, reads: “We are deeply concerned that our global economic and industrial systems are accelerating rates of extinction, desertification and soil depletion, degrading ecosystems, acidifying and littering our rivers and oceans, and resulting in a relentless rise in greenhouse gas emissions driving irreversible climate change.  “In short, we are overwhelming the planet’s life support systems.” The signatories say that Paris offers an “historic opportunity” and any agreement reached must be binding and keep future temperature rises below 2C, considered the threshold after which dangerous global warming takes hold. “We will come together and intensify our efforts, but we need you to give us confidence in a sustainable future, to share our ambition, and recognize our capacity to strengthen your leadership,” they write. Alison Tickell, who coordinated the letter and runs Julie’s Bicycle, a charity advising the arts on sustainability, admitted that some interventions on global warming by the creative industry in the past had been crass but the sector could play a key role in tackling climate change. “The success of COP21 is not just politics, it’s also about civil society. Climate change is not just about politics, economics or science, but about culture. The arts can move us in a way that science just can’t.” Artists and cultural figures also had much greater “reach” with the public, she added. Kevin Price, chief operating officer at Bafta, said that the TV and film industries were cutting their own carbon emissions and what he called the “real sense of waste”, from the way A-listers are treated to the amount of energy consumed for lighting.  But he said that perhaps the biggest role it could play was in the shows and films it produced: “The potential for our industry to play a role in emissions reduction is profound.” British business groups warned on Thursday that the UK was risking its leadership at Paris with its actions at home, such as George Osborne breaking a manifesto promise this week by cancelling a £1bn carbon and capture storage competition. “Unexpected decisions like this and a slackening off on domestic energy efficiency policy do not fill one with confidence that the UK’s increasingly ambitious climate change targets are entirely backed up with the will and means to succeed,” said Claire Jakobsson, head of climate and environment policy at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation. Separately, 39 French companies including EDF, Total and Orange pledged yesterday to spend €45bn over the next five years on renewable energy and other low carbon technologies. "

"UN climate meetings are curious events where the future of the world’s climate and everything that’s part of it can come down to the removal of square brackets on documents and the strike of a gavel. About 40,000 delegates from more than 190 countries will be in Paris for the next major talks starting on Monday, including more than 130 heads of state and governments.  If previous talks are any indication, then by the end of the second week the venue corridors will resemble a scene from an airport where all flights have been cancelled; most people are not really sure what’s going on, bodies are collapsed on the floor from sleep deprivation and every now and then an important person stands up in the middle to give an update. At least in Paris, there should be no shortage of caffeine and sugary goodness to keep the world from falling into a crevasse of it’s own unexploited fossil fuel reserves. Now 40,000 people sounds like a lot, right? And it is a lot. But for context, consider that more than twice that many went to the oil and gas industry-focused Offshore Technology Conference in Texas this year. Numbers at OTC were down from a record 108,000 last year. But back to Paris. Almost every major media website in the world has been producing its own version of the story that tells you “everything you need to know about the Paris climate talks”, the Guardian included.  That’s because what happens in Paris is challenging to interpret but also stunningly important for the future. But is it the make or break, sink or swim, do or die, cool or fry event that some commentators and campaigners are making out? Well yes. And no. But first, a few basics. The UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) has more than 190 signatories, known as parties.  The convention’s last major agreement, the Kyoto protocol, was put together in Japan in 1997 at the third Conference of the Parties (COP3). The Kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions only included rich developed countries. The 2009 COP meeting in Copenhagen tried, but failed, to negotiate a new deal. At subsequent meetings, the commitments being made under Kyoto were extended until 2020.  Since Kyoto, the world has changed drastically.  As Australia’s lead UNFCCC negotiator Peter Woolcott pointed out last week, back in 1992 there were only three developing countries on the list of the world’s 12 biggest greenhouse gas emitters. Now there are seven.  China has replaced the US as the major global emitter and geopolitical power has shifted towards Asia. So we need a new deal. COP21 in Paris is the culmination of years of work to get that deal done. This time, all countries are being asked to sign it and because the process works on a consensus approach, all parties need to agree or the deal dies. The Climate Institute’s Erwin Jackson, who routinely attends UNFCC meetings, offered me a neat summary of how much further advanced the process is heading into Paris than at previous meetings. At Copenhagen we had a draft agreement that was 200 pages long. At Kyoto it was 80 pages. At Paris, it’s 50 pages. But there has also been a fundamental change in how the UNFCCC is trying to canvas agreement.  At Kyoto and at Copenhagen the UNFCCC was trying to impose targets to cut emissions from on high. This time the target-setting has been done by the countries themselves – a bottom-up approach. It turns out that the Warsaw COP meeting in 2013 was key.  There, a deal was agreed whereby all the parties would go back to their own countries and work on what’s known as an intended nationally Determined contribution. This set in train domestic conversations across the world about how, and by how much, each country should cut its greenhouse gas emissions. So now, those countries are coming to Paris having already “determined” what they see as a fair effort to keep global warming below 2C (which all major UNFCCC parties have agree to). You can see all the INDCs here. But here’s where some misconceptions start. The Paris negotiations won’t be about the targets. The targets themselves won’t even be in the main text of the agreement, which will come out of a process with a title that only the UN could love – the ad hoc working group on the Durban platform for enhanced action. The Paris deal will instead likely make it binding for countries to have an INDC. As things stand, no analysts are finding that the INDCs are enough to keep global warming below 2C. Instead, they set us on a pathway to global warming of about 2.7C or higher by the end of the century. Now that sounds a lot like failure. But a key aspect of the Paris deal will look to enshrine regular reviews of INDCs that would also make sure future pledges are better than previous ones. Or in other words, no backsliding. This calls for an analogy. If getting below 2C of global warming is the destination, then the Paris deal is trying to build a reliable car to get us there. The car will need to be recharged (because it’s electric) and will need a service or two, but the Paris deal aims to plan for these eventualities. Key elements up for negotiation will be to agree the rules around transparency and fairness of those INDCs. Jackson says that the prospects for a deal look better than they did heading into previous meetings. But that’s not to say things won’t be difficult, but given that climate change has become a central issue for many countries and regions, it’s now in their national interest to get this deal done.  The core issue at the end of the day is whether countries are implementing domestically binding policies. The international process can facilitate that. When countries communicate their targets, countries are expected to show how they are a fair and ambitious way to keep global warming below 2C. If Paris is an effective stimulus for further action then it needs to be bankable, transparent and fair. Without all those, it will be difficult to get all countries on board.  A major sticking point will likely be the support, both financial and otherwise, offered to poorer countries from the developed world (developed on the back of massive fossil fuel use). Under the UNFCCC there are negotiations around pledges to the Green Climate Fund to provide US$100 billion a year to poorer countries by 2020 to help them cut emissions and adapt to climate change.  If it’s possible (which it is), an even more complex and contentious issue under the UNFCCC is known as loss and damage. This is an attempt to help poorer countries to cope with climate impacts that they cannot adapt to.  Some richer countries, including the US, are sensitive to the idea that this will lead to a “compensation” fund that will identify “liability”. Compensation and liability are not the sort of words that countries like the US are likely to be happy with. At the beginning of the second week of the talks, the usual group of climate science denialists from conservative and fossil-fuel funded thinktanks will attempt to grab some limelight.  They are even premièring a “documentary” called Climate Hustle that will regurgitate the same old denialist myths. I’ve also written about the links between Climate Hustle and a religious group claiming that “climate policies kill” while promoting creationism. Groups such as these may look like they’re on the fringes, until you remember that in the US, many (but not all) Republicans refuse to accept the evidence that human-caused climate change is real and needs urgent action.  The public in many developed countries, including Australia and the US, continues to be split on the causes of climate change, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence.  New research suggests that this confusion among the public is down to campaigns supported by fossil fuel interests, including ExxonMobil and foundations linked to the oil billionaire Koch brothers.  The talks in Paris will, fittingly (or should that be ironically, or predictably), be taking place at the end of what is almost certain to be declared the hottest year on record and the end of the hottest five-year period on record. You tend to get records like that when you pump out the key greenhouse gas carbon dioxide to levels not seen in millions of years at a rate that is likely unprecedented in the geological record. No amount of French fancies are going to entirely soften that blow."
"The food writer Michael Pollan summed up how to eat healthily: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” It is unlikely that when the British and American governments issue new dietary guidelines the advice will be quite so succinct, or sensible.  National dietary guidelines are being reviewed on both sides of the Atlantic in the light of new evidence on food and health. The timing of the announcements presents a unique opportunity to also consider the impact of diet on climate change, coinciding, as they do, with the climate change summit in Paris. Food and climate change are inextricably linked: global warming and changes in rainfall have a major impact on our food security, and our diets are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Agricultural emissions are thought to account for around 30% of global emissions, with livestock responsible for half of these. Although there is a role for improved farming practices to reduce emission intensity, dietary patterns will need to change to avoid catastrophic consequences. At first sight, adopting a diet that is both sustainable and healthy may seem hard. Just determining the exact carbon footprint of different foods is a challenge. How is the food grown? What land is used? How is it transported and packaged? And there are other important considerations: food production is responsible for about 70% of all human water use, is the leading cause of global deforestation and biodiversity loss, and rearing livestock accounts for 30% of the planet’s land surface. Is it even possible to grow enough sustainable calories to feed the world? But it doesn’t need to be that complicated. For example, ruminants (such as beef and lamb) dominate emissions from livestock and are high in unhealthy saturated fats; conversely, fruit and vegetables are relatively low in greenhouse gas emissions and provide significant health benefits. Therefore, eating more fruit and vegetables but less beef and lamb is likely to be both healthier and more sustainable. And small changes can make a big difference. Producing 1kg of beef requires 15,000 litres of water, 30kg of carbon dioxide or equivalent greenhouse gas emissions, and 5m2 of land. Compare this with potatoes, for example, where producing 1kg requires just 290 litres of water, 0.5kg of carbon dioxide emissions and 0.6m2 of land. Greenhouse gas emissions also have economic implications. In 2007, the UK government estimated that the shadow price of carbon – the cost to society of the problems caused by emitting greenhouse gases – was £25 per tonne of carbon dioxide. If, as was recently suggested by the Chatham House thinktank, this shadow price was factored into the cost of UK food with high emissions, the resulting changes to the UK diet could lead to emission reductions of nearly 19m tonnes of carbon dioxide. This is equivalent to 85,000 Boeing 747 flights between London and New York, the annual energy use of 1.5 million homes, or taking 3.5 million cars off the road for a year. With the US population five times that of UK, one can imagine the implications there. So if sustainable healthy diets don’t have to be complicated or costly, why don’t official food guidelines follow Michael Pollan’s advice? Well, one reason may be because there is not much profit in it. At least not for the players that currently have a big stake in the food market. If people stopped eating packaged foods, sugar or meat it would seriously affect the profits of some of the biggest global food corporations. It is worrying how much our dietary guidelines are informed by industry interests. A 2003 WHO expert report recommended that our daily intake of free sugars should be no more than 10% of total energy. Outcry and threats from the sugar industry meant the recommendation never made it into the WHO’s Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity, and Health. The newly released 2015 WHO guidelines at least do include the 10% restriction on sugar intake. Recently Sweden included sustainability in its dietary guidelines in the face of stiff criticism from industry, an experience mirrored in the US where the American Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) recommended that dietary guidance should take account of food’s environmental implications. Then in October, despite President Obama beginning to take on climate change as part of his presidential legacy, his cabinet secretaries in charge of the 2015 guidelines announced that there would be no place for sustainability. The US Congress is now legislating to prohibit the DGAC from mentioning anything other than diet and nutrient intake in any future report. In the UK, it is unclear whether the dietary guidelines currently under review (a revision of Public Health England’s eatwell plate) will incorporate environmental sustainability. However, such an inclusion would be a surprise given the Conservative government’s recent track record on climate change. Ahead of the talks in Paris, both the US and the UK should be sending a strong signal to the rest of the world that diet has a major impact both on our health and on the future of our planet. The US has emphatically failed to embrace this opportunity and there is very little reason to be optimistic about the UK. The recent row about sugar taxes shows that the current government is unlikely to stick its neck out when it comes to challenging the food industry. This is a missed opportunity with implications far beyond politics and economics: the planet is at stake. • Wilma Waterlander (@wwaterlander) from the University of Auckland also contributed to this article"
"David Cameron will set out his personal commitment to tackling climate change at the opening of a crunch UN conference on global warming in Paris on Monday, and will pledge support for poorer countries likely to suffer most from extreme weather. The UK prime minister will meet world leaders including Narendra Modi of India, Barack Obama of the US and China’s Xi Jinping at the talks, but will also hold sessions with representatives of small islands and the world’s least developed countries.  More than 130 heads of state and government will attend the first day of the two-week talks on Monday, instructing their negotiating teams on coming to a deal. The Paris conference is seen as crucial, as its failure would in effect bring to an end international efforts under the UN to control greenhouse gas emissions. Countries are aiming to agree on financial support to help poor nations to cut emissions and cope with the effects of extreme weather. They also hope to set targets on limiting global emissions that would come into effect from 2020, when current commitments run out. Cameron will tell the conference he wants “a global deal for a global problem”, with a robust legal framework that would ensure the targets are met. He will call for any agreement to include a long-term goal on avoiding dangerous temperature rises. “This will give certainty to businesses and the public across the world that governments are serious about decarbonising.” He will set out his priorities for the conference: putting in place a robust legal framework that will require countries to stick to their emissions targets; providing financial assistance for the developing world; and emphasising the role of business in tackling global warming. Cameron is expected to cite the UK’s own Climate Change Act as a “strong domestic framework” to deal with emissions. The act is being used as a model by some other countries. “I want to see a similarly robust system at the international level,” he will tell the conference. However, the act has been attacked by some Tories. Critics argue that since the election the government has systematically undermined the UK’s reputation for climate leadership. Support for solar and wind energy has been slashed; legislation on efficient new homes has been weakened; and most recently, the chancellor, George Osborne, cancelled a £1bn scheme to promote carbon capture and storage. As part of the legal framework, Cameron endorses the proposed system of a five-yearly review of emissions targets after Paris, which the UN hopes will enable emissions to be cut further in the future, in line with scientific advice. On current emissions pledges, the world is still likely to be in for 2.7C or 3C of warming above pre-industrial levels by the century’s end, according to analyses. Scientists say that 2C is likely to be the limit of safety, beyond which dangerous climate changes will take hold, with droughts, floods, fiercer storms and rising sea levels. A group of developing countries is calling for tougher emissions-cutting targets in order to hold the world within 1.5C of warming. This is because small islands may be swamped if temperatures rise by 2C, and other extremely poor countries are likely to be badly affected. For the developing world, Cameron will call for a deal that includes “clear support to the poorest nations”, pointing to the UK’s pledge of £5.8bn during this parliament to “help them deal with the potentially devastating risks of climate change”. At least half of this money will go to helping countries adapt and strengthen their infrastructure to cope with the effects of extreme weather. The UK prime minister will also place a strong emphasis on the role of businesses in cutting emissions and providing finance. “The issue of climate change is too large for governments alone to deal with. That is why business and private donors must play an active role in shaping our response to climate change, and enabling trillions of dollars of investment in clean technology,” he will say. Although the main focus of any agreement is likely to be on government responsibility, Cameron wants to include provisions for the private sector. “I want the deal in Paris to outline the role that businesses should play. We need to give businesses long-term certainty for investment.” World leaders will address the conference for several hours on Monday, and spend most of the day meeting privately to iron out their remaining differences and create an atmosphere of cooperation that will allow negotiators to hammer out the text of a deal in the remaining days."

"Bill Shorten has suggested he will adopt a far tougher greenhouse target – a 45% cut in emissions by 2030 – compared with the Coalition’s promised cut of 26% to 28%.  The Labor leader is seeking to pressure Malcolm Turnbull, who is en route to the United Nations climate summit, saying the prime minister “is flying to Paris carrying Tony Abbott’s climate-sceptic baggage”. “Malcolm Turnbull won the leadership vote in the party room, but Tony Abbott has won the climate policy debate in the Liberal party,” Shorten will say in an address to the Lowy Institute on Friday. Turnbull has adopted the same emissions reduction target announced by the former prime minister, a cut of between 26% and 28% compared with 2005 levels by 2030. However, Shorten’s own promised target is not yet locked in. He will announce that Labor will use the Climate Change Authority’s recommendations for a cut of 45% by 2030, based on 2005 levels, “as the basis for our consultations with industry, employers, unions and the community”. “We will undertake this process mindful of the consequences for jobs, for regions and for any impacts on households,” Shorten will say. The Labor leader is also attending the climate summit next week. Labor’s environment spokesman, Mark Butler, will undertake the consultations and report back in March next year. Shorten will say Turnbull’s position is worse than climate scepticism, because the new prime minister understands that his Direct Action policy can’t work. “No one has delivered a more incisive critique of Direct Action than the current prime minister ... he had the courage to tell the truth when he was a backbencher, with nothing to lose. Yet now, when power is in his grasp and the evidence is in front of his eyes, he cannot admit what he knows in his heart and head to be true,” he will say. “To my mind, this is actually far worse than scepticism. This is selling out the future of the people of Australia, to placate the right wing of the Liberal party.” Shorten will also announce the longer-term goal of zero net emissions by 2050. Addressing the national press club this week, the environment minister, Greg Hunt, said he expected zero net emissions would be possible “over the course of the century”. Modelling done for the government by leading economist Warwick McKibbin compared a 26%, 35% and 45% reduction target with the costs of doing nothing more after achieving Australia’s 2020 emissions reduction target.  It showed the 26% target would shave between 0.2% and 0.4% from Australia’s gross domestic product in 2030, but the same modelling found that based on similar assumptions, a 35% target would cut only 0.3% to 0.5% and a 45% target would cut between 0.5% and 0.7%. Before leaving on Thursday, Turnbull said he was “optimistic” the Paris meeting would achieve a good outcome. The summit aims to enshrine the 2030 emission reduction promises now made by 173 nations, and agree on monitoring and verification rules and regular reviews to try to increase them over time to a level that would contain global warming to 2C. At the moment the pledges, if implemented, would still see warming of about 2.7C or higher. The government this week announced that Australia was already on track to meet its minimum 2020 target of a 5% reduction in emissions – the target agreed by both major parties if the rest of the world did nothing. Neither the Coalition nor the Labor party has said they would agree to the higher 2020 goals they originally promised, under conditions the independent climate change authority says have now been met. In his speech Shorten will say that within the first year of a Labor government he would announce a new target for 2025. Labor has said it will reintroduce an emissions trading scheme to meet its targets, but has announced no detail."
"Negotiators at key UN climate talks in Paris that open next week are being told by the French government they must iron out their main differences six days before the end of the talks, according to the foreign minister, Laurent Fabius.  World leaders including Barack Obama, Xi Jinping, Angela Merkel and David Cameron are preparing to fly to the French capital to open the COP 21 negotiations, which begin on Monday and aim to produce an international deal to reduce carbon emissions that will kick in from 2020. The highly unusual demand by the French hosts is a sign of their confidence that they believe a deal is within sight and that the huge diplomatic push they have made to ensure the talks succeed has not been knocked off course by the terrorist attacks two weeks ago.  But Fabius’s request to have the final version of the negotiating text signed off by next Saturday will be met with scepticism among some observers of the talks. Frequently, previous incarnations of the UN talks have finished one or even two days after deadline.  Fabius vowed in an interview to forge an agreement that would be “universal, legally binding, durable and dynamic”.  In the wake of the attacks, Fabius confirmed that security would be tightened around the conference centre, which is on the outskirts of Paris, near the airport where a planned attack was foiled and not far from the St-Denis district where the attacks were planned. There will be a total lockdown on the area of Paris surrounding the conference centre on Sunday afternoon, when many of the heads of state and government are expected to arrive, in time for the first official day of talks on Monday. Fabius praised the climate activists who had agreed to call off their planned march through Paris as a result of the attacks. “I have to salute the responsibility of the organisations who would have liked to demonstrate but who understand that if they demonstrate in a public place there is a security risk, or even a risk of panic.” He said: “The first week [of the fortnight-long talks] will be devoted to reducing the number of options in the text,” in which delegates have suggested multiple alternatives in wording on certain issues. “I will ask that by [next] Saturday midday the text will be transmitted to me, the president of the COP, and at that moment everyone will know where we are and the procedure to follow. Obviously, I hope a maximum number of options will have been lifted but I will have to take into account the situation at that moment.” In a veiled reference to the situation at the last climate summit in Copenhagen, when negotiations were thrown into chaos by rumours of a draft text that had been circulated to some governments, he added: “I don’t have a text in my pocket that I can pull out. I have found with the delegations that there is a real willingness to move forward, a willingness to be transparent. “If there is no agreement by Saturday, of course I will take the initiative. I will see the different groups with the facilitators,” he said. “Success is at our door, but it is not yet won.” Fabius, speaking in his resplendent office in France’s foreign ministry, was in ebullient mood. Amply gilded and frescoed, with French windows looking out on to ornamental gardens on the banks of the Seine, the ministry was built with the intention of impressing France’s many allies, and potential enemies. The French are hoping that the discord that has marked previous talks, preventing a legal agreement at the last climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009, will be averted by meticulous planning. Fabius, despite his punishing schedule since the atrocities in Paris, has been habitually squeezing questions on climate change into every meeting with his foreign counterparts and heads of state, as has the French president, François Hollande. Before the talks, governments responsible for more than 90% of global emissions – including all major developed economies and most of the biggest developing nations, such as China and India – have laid out plans for cuts or curbs to their emissions. These will form the centrepiece of any deal, and even if a deal is not reached, these commitments will be hard for governments to renege on. Fabius said the COP 21 talks were “a success in terms of numbers and actions” pledged by countries on emissions reductions. “If we add together all these contributions, we avoid catastrophe, in the form of the consequences of inaction, a world four, five or six degrees [warmer]. But we are still not at 2C or 1.5C, which is the goal of Paris.” Scientists estimate that if the world warms by more than 2C on average above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century, the effects of climate change will become catastrophic and irreversible. A 2C limit has long been the goal of UN climate conferences, and current pledges from all countries are estimated to lead to warming of 2.7C to 3C, although the proposed deal has a provision for increased emissions cuts in future. Fabius urged governments to move beyond the entrenched positions of the past. “We must do our utmost to avoid the blocking of an agreement because of irreconcilable principles. A good approach is to take this issue subject by subject.” On financing, for instance, he said there was general agreement that rich countries would ensure the funds promised to poor nations to help them cut emissions and adapt to global warming would be forthcoming. In a pointed reference to one of the countries that may hold out on an agreement, Fabius said: “I was talking to the prime minister of India and he said for the moment my resource is coal, so he is approaching this on how he can make coal more clean.” But he said that generally the world was moving towards decarbonised energy. “We must not, it seems to me, present this climate question as a constraint, but an opportunity. China is a big leader in the world on solar energy. There are lots of opportunities in different countries,” he went on. “For instance, programmes suggested for Africa – we have to help this development, it can give direct employment, and in the case of Africa can be a factor for growth.”"
"If the crucial Paris climate summit is the highest stakes poker game of international diplomacy ever held, David Cameron will sit down on Monday with little but bluff. The UK has thrown away trump card after trump card, with the latest being £1bn of support for carbon capture and storage, dumped by the chancellor, George Osborne, on Wednesday. Trust is the vital ingredient in the UN climate negotiations, because they are built on voluntary pledges. Each nation has to believe that every other nation will honour its pledges to cut carbon emissions or provide green funds. But the UK government’s actions since it won the general election in May will make other countries think the UK is not good for its stake in the game.  Just six months ago, the Conservative party manifesto promised £1bn for CCS. Last September, Cameron trumpeted the funding at the UN. On Wednesday, that promise was broken. When the goal is as challenging as beating an existential threat to civilisation by re-engineering most of the world’s economy, broken promises are toxic. The Paris summit will succeed if the world is left in no doubt that a low-carbon planet is an inevitability. That means believing that governments will meet their carbon targets. Yet virtually everything done by the Conservative government since May has made meeting the UK’s carbon targets less likely, not more. CCS is seen as essential to meeting carbon targets cost effectively yet Osborne prefers to save £1bn now at the expense of many billions later. (He’s also sending €300m of CCS funding back to Brussels.) With a new dash for gas underway, no CCS means either busting carbon targets or shutting plants before they have paid for themselves. On Thursday, the folly of abandoning the requirement for new homes to be zero-carbon was exposed by the government’s own advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. To meet carbon targets, all the new homes Osborne has promised will have to be expensively retrofitted later. The UK’s homes are the source of about one-third of the nation’s carbon emissions, but are among the leakiest in Europe. Energy efficiency is the cheapest way to cut carbon, as well as help poorer households and save lives in winter, yet Osborne cut funding by 83%. A big green heating scheme was cut by 40%. Like the CCS fund, the green investment bank (GIB) is constantly cited by Cameron as evidence of the UK’s green credentials, a “world first” he told the UN. The GIB has used its government ownership to turn £2.3bn into green infrastructure projects worth £10.1bn - ministers are now selling it off. There’s more, much more. Support for solar power, biomass and biogas are being slashed. Onshore windfarms, the cheapest green energy, are being blocked. All this just as the fast-falling cost of renewables means subsidies are close to no longer being needed. The chancellor is also tilting the playing field by ramping up subsidies for oil and gas, the only G7 nation doing so, and imposing a carbon tax on renewable energy (no, really). Tax breaks for clean cars have gone too. “The UK’s security and prosperity is vulnerable to climate change,” said Osborne’s spending plan on Wednesday. Yet actions speak louder than words. “Do as I say, not as I do,” is a feeble hand for him to give Cameron to take to Paris. A few decent cards remain. The UK’s commitment to foreign aid, and particularly climate aid, has been resolute and substantial: £5.8bn. But, for example, “kick-starting a solar revolution” abroad while ending a promised one at home is a contradictory message. The UK is committing many billions of billpayers’ money to a new nuclear power station, and wants more to follow. Nuclear is low-carbon, but whether it can arrive in time is another matter. The same applies to Osborne’s favourite new technology, small modular reactors, which will be incentivised by a new competition - just as the CCS competition is abandoned. Offshore wind is being strongly supported and the UK is a world leader. But onshore wind is far cheaper, and only opposed by a vociferous minority. When Cameron stands up to speak at the UN summit in Paris on Monday, he may reprise his previous UN climate speech: “Climate change is a threat to our national security, to global security, to poverty eradication and to economic prosperity.” He is right. But with the UK heading back to a 20th century world of gas (without CCS) and nuclear, while cutting the 21st century options of energy efficiency and renewables, will anyone trust his commitment to halting global warming? If not, the UK will be left as the joker in the pack, and saving the planet will be harder than ever."
"Housing built in the UK today and in the next few years may have to be expensively retrofitted with energy-saving technology within the next two decades, according to the government’s climate advisers. The warning from the Committee on Climate Change came as it launched its five-year review to parliament on Thursday, setting out a new “carbon budget” for the UK that would require an emissions cut of 57% by 2032.  The so-called fifth carbon budget would require substantial new investment in renewable energy and other low-carbon power, and new projects such as carbon capture and storage plants. It would also require substantial investments in home energy efficiency improvements, and measures to help households install their own renewable energy, such as solar panels or heat pumps.  The chancellor, George Osborne, unveiled plans for 400,000 new houses on Wednesday. But if those houses are not built to high standards of insulation and energy efficiency, they could put the UK in breach of its carbon budgets.  Lord Deben, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, told the Guardian: “We are in danger of building houses that have to be retrofitted, which would be very expensive. We could build them now to low-carbon standards instead.” The government has scrapped building standards that would have made new houses zero-carbon from next year, without indicating whether new standards would be forthcoming. Ministers also scrapped their flagship insulation scheme, the green deal, again without instituting an alternative, and on Wednesday Osborne cut funding for a separate energy efficiency scheme called ECO.  By the 2030s, according to the committee’s report, about one in seven UK homes would need to be heated with low-carbon energy, and insulation would need to be installed in nearly all UK homes “where it is cost-effective”. Ministers will be advised to accept the targets by the committee, which is the statutory adviser to the government under the Climate Change Act. If they refuse, it could trigger a legal review. No decision is likely until the end of June next year, but the target is likely to be controversial in some sections of the government.  When the fourth carbon budget was published similarly early in the last parliament, Cameron ruled that it would be accepted, but Osborne ordered a review of whether the targets could be met. The fourth budget is now part of government policy.  The committee’s report comes just ahead of a crunch climate change conference in Paris on Sunday , at which heads of state and government will convene in the hopes of forging a new global agreement on greenhouse gas emissions, to take effect from 2020 when current international commitments run out.  The fifth carbon budget marks the halfway point from the first carbon budget period (2008-12) to 2050. The committee said that the UK’s contribution was in keeping with wider international climate action.   To date, the UK’s carbon emissions have been cut by more than one-third on 1990 levels and the committee estimates that if current policies are effective emissions will be reduced by an aggregate of 43-46% in 2020. Under the fourth carbon budget, from 2023-27, emissions must fall by 52%. The fifth budget would require emissions reductions of 3% per year from 2014-30, probably rising to 4% per year from 2030-2050. By the 2030s, the report found, the UK would need to be “largely” powered by low-carbon sources of electricity. The government recently reduced the support available to onshore wind and solar power.  A majority of new cars and vans bought in the UK would need to be fully or partially electric, the committee said, compared to a small number today. This would have knock-on benefits in the form of reduced air pollution, which in parts of the UK is significantly in breach of EU air quality standards.  Deben said: “The UK has been at the forefront of global action on climate change. As a nation, we have begun the transition towards a low-carbon economy. By legislating the fifth carbon budget at the recommended level, the government will take the next important step.” Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate group of businesses and other organisations that support a low-carbon economy, said: “Companies investing in low-carbon infrastructure, many of which are international and have a choice as to which countries they want to invest in, are already looking at projects that will be developed in the next decade. Continued confidence in the UK’s low-carbon ambitions is essential to attracting this investment.” A spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “We are determined to meet our climate change commitments in the most cost-effective way, and have already reduced our emissions by 30% since 1990. We are considering the committee’s advice and will set the fifth carbon budget in law by the end of June next year.”"
"The current front-runner for best slogan for the Paris climate change summit has to be “there is no planet B”; as for images, it is hard to imagine one more potent than the thousands of pairs of shoes laid in tidy lines in the Place de la République that symbolise the march climate activists had scheduled for Sunday then banned for fear of a repeat of the terrorist attack of a fortnight ago. However equivocal some of the political leadership sometimes appears, the popular movement for greening the economy is in good heart. This is the 21st UN conference of the parties on climate change, better known as COP, and there are signs of a new maturity that might be the best omen for the future. It is easy to forget that this is an unprecedented attempt at global cooperation, one which has not only moved from event to process, but from protest to movement. For Paris is not only about world leaders trying to find an agreement acceptable to nearly 200 countries for whom the consequences of global warming will be existentially different. It is now also about the place of non-state players, from the indigenous peoples of South America to the world’s most sophisticated cities, and from the individual decisions that each of us makes to the clean energy initiative being launched on Monday by one of the world’s richest men, Bill Gates. One sign of this maturity is the demand from Laurent Fabius, the French foreign affairs minister in charge of this COP, that a deal on a final text should be agreed by next weekend. That would mean the last week of the conference was spent discussing how to put the final communiqué into action.  But there remain highly contentious decisions still to be taken, key wording left in square brackets in the 20-page negotiating text: including the date when carbon emissions peak, the amount of money available to help vulnerable countries adjust to the impact of changing climate, and the assistance available for developing countries that are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels. The EU has agreed a joint target backed by nationally agreed pledges. Otherwise, engaging countries individually in drawing up their own plans for the speed and scale at which they will cut carbon emissions allows political realities of the kind that have beset both President Obama and successive Australian governments to be accommodated. Critics argue that it risks legitimising foot-dragging, and that is another of the great challenges for the coming fortnight: agreeing a process for monitoring, evaluating and verifying the targets that countries are signing up to – and then putting in a place a system of review that will lead to the targets being ratcheted up until they are tight enough to limit warming to 2 degrees. That is this week’s jackpot, but there will be no individual winner – nor any wide-ranging legally-binding agreement. This is a prize for all, or for none. The danger of the UN-backed annual negotiations is that they can make tackling climate change look like a problem for other people. It is true that it requires global coordination. But that has to grow from national and local interest. It is here that non-state players, among them religions, have a crucial role in helping us to understand that self-interest demands solidarity. There is a dangerous tendency that has long been plain in Australia and the US and is becoming explicit now in Britain, to present climate change as a story of loss and sacrifice rather than one of potential gain. The decisions the Conservative government at Westminster has taken since winning the election in May have underscored the idea that cutting carbon emissions is a costly vanity rather than an industrial opportunity. George Osborne reinforced that message in last week’s autumn statement, which it emerged soon afterwards included the withdrawal of all support for carbon capture and storage, essential if fossil fuels like shale gas are to be used safely. (No wonder that according to the weekend Financial Times, businesses like Ikea and Tesco have co-written an angry letter protesting at the damaging confusion in the government’s energy policy.) Yet to say each of us has a contribution to make is not to underestimate the importance of what happens in the next two weeks. Now is the time to lay the cornerstone for a global strategy to cut and ultimately end carbon emissions. On what happens in a series of temporary structures in the suburbs of one of the world’s oldest and greatest cities depend the hopes for a sustainable future for the planet."
"The river Wharfe has broken out of its enclosure. Normally lovely, languorous, and impeccably well-behaved, it has mutated in the heavy rain and now runs rampant through fields, climbs high up leaf-littered banks of ivy and alder, and carries huge tree trunks away with it like twigs in a game of Poohsticks. Scores of people have come out to watch the spectacle, milling around on roads cleared of traffic, friends and strangers alike chatting together. There is nothing like a bit of threatened calamity to get tongues wagging. Usually as translucent as clear beer, the water has turned a monsoon brown, boiling with the force of countless tonnes and churning white as it surges under the five arches of Otley’s bridge, leaving only a tight gap of air. Some houses are already swamped and the water is lapping at the Victorian terraces of Farnley Lane, but its residents seem impressively philosophical – or simply well-insured.  Although realistically it represents little threat to life and limb, the flood gives a glimpse of something fierce and powerful. I imagine the river could easily fold me away if I fell in, particularly the deafening maelstroms under the bridge. But perhaps more significant is the origin of the water: whereas previous floods have often involved snowmelt from the moors and mountains of the Yorkshire Dales upstream, this one is caused by rain alone. One consequence of the world’s changing climate is predicted to be wetter winters for Britain, and every flood now feels portentous. I walk out of town and up the wooded ridge of the Chevin, where beech trees are losing their last shreds of leaf in the high winds. The top gives a birds-eye view of roads submerged, traffic halted and pastures turned into paddy fields all the way up and down the valley. Like me, people have walked or driven their cars up here to stand on the gritstone boulders of Surprise View and take in the extent of it. They are oddly quiet as they survey the scene. A wild creature is loose in Wharfedale, and it is compelling."
"Hundreds of thousands of people around the world, from Sydney to New York, marched on Sunday to call on world leaders meeting in Paris to agree a strong climate change deal. In Paris, pairs of shoes given by Pope Francis and Ban Ki-moon were among a collection set out in the Place de la République to represent those who were unable to march due to a ban by the French authorities in the aftermath of 13 November terror attacks. People lit candles, sang songs and wandered around the shoes, many of which were later given to a charity for distributing to homeless people. “It’s an incredible monument to the voices that have been silenced but also to that hope for action that comes out of this city,” said Emma Ruby-Sachs, acting executive director at Avaaz, which helped organise the shoe campaign. A peaceful “human chain” formed in central Paris from thousands of people including children holding placards reading “climate justice” and “keep it [fossil fuels] in the ground”. The atmosphere turned ugly when a group of anti-capitalists and anarchists began throwing shoes and letting off loud bangs thought to be fireworks, leading to clashes with police. Riot police were deployed and teargas was used to disperse the unauthorised protest, which resulted in some 200 arrests. “It is more against capitalism [than a call for climate action],” said one of the protesters, who appeared to have hijacked the peaceful event by climate activists. In London, an audience of thousands braved 40mph gusts, dressed as polar bears, holding aloft solar panels and lying on the ground in “die-ins” to highlight the impact of global warming in the developing world. Organisers said more than 50,000 people had turned out. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, addressed the march, accompanied by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and two other shadow ministers. “Those who are sitting around the tables in Paris have an enormous opportunity in front of them. Do not let them flake it or fool us,” Corbyn told an audience of thousands on Park Lane. The Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, said: “David Cameron is taking a wrecking ball to environmental policy.” A group of Sámi, an indigenous people of Sweden who say their way of life is threatened by climate change, sang on stage in London, in between a series of speeches by environmentalists. Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, told the marchers: “This is a fantastic display of people power with thousands taking to the streets to demand urgent action on climate change.” More than 2,200 marches were scheduled around the world, with events in locations ranging from Madrid and Rome, which saw 20,000 people each on their streets, to Benin and Sana’a in Yemen, where about 70 people gathered and held up a banner despite air raids, nearby. In Copenhagen, where the last UN climate summit ended in failure in 2009, people marched saying they hoped for “better results” in Paris. Organisers in Australia and New Zealand said that marches there broke records, with more than 40,000 sweltering in Sydney’s heat and at least 3,000 people gathering in Canberra. Marches also took place in Melbourne and other cities. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who has previously called for companies to divest from fossil fuels, said that if the world carried on as usual after the Paris talks, it might not get another opportunity to stave off dangerous global warming. “Should they develop a legally binding treaty, it will signal the end of the age of reckless consumption, exploitation and greed.”"

"A mistle thrush has proved to be our foul-weather friend over these last few storm battered weeks. High winds summon it to the treetops, a row of limes, where it guards the mistletoe against all comers. Up there it is chasing invisible thieves among the rocking branches, hurling out its rattling call of defiance that might be heard over the roaring gales by all the other birds.  But there are none; nature’s stormcock is alone in its crow’s nest of paranoia. In the calm of morning the bird is conspicuous by its absence, even though the mistletoe clumps are still and ripe for the taking. A thrush-hop from the limes, our silver birch, taller than the house, has had all of its upper branches almost stripped of leaves. A countable number of yellowing remnants quiver in the light breeze, waiting for the drop. Ours is a tree with a single quirky characteristic: every year one sizeable lower branch is out of seasonal step with its fellow boughs and remains fully dressed in green leaves right through to Christmas. Not even Storm Barney could loosen its aberrant resolve. The tree has become a beacon for some people since it attracts a steady drip feed of so-called tree surgeons to our door. Last week I was told our birch was “top heavy”. Another expert warned us that it was “swaying in the wind”. Others claim it is too close to the road, that it is damaging the house foundations with its roots. One offered to “take down your conifer, er beech”. Our response: “It’s a birch and no thank you.” Ours is the only front garden around still in possession of a full sized tree; all the other trees are on public land. There are no perches and larders for neighbourhood birds, no softening and uplifting features to provide relief. The ghost of next door’s cherry tree rose up from our lawn last week, a fairy crescent of toadstools feeding on the rotting roots. I asked a proper arboriculturalist for his opinion on the safety or otherwise of our birch. He told me it might need looking at … in about 50 years’ time."

"With more than 190 countries gathering in Paris this week the world still has a chance to avoid dangerous global warming – but only just. Already more than 160 countries have submitted pledges to reduce or limit their emissions of greenhouse gases by 2025 or 2030. Collectively these represent a substantial improvement on “business as usual”, but they are some way from a path that offers a reasonable probability of restricting the rise in global average temperature above its pre-industrial level to no more than 2C. There is a serious emissions gap over the next 15 years: under the current pledges, emissions will go on rising until at least 2030. Warming of about 2C creates deeply worrying risks of triggering the kind of consequences – such as rapid sea level rise or the release of methane from gas hydrates in the ocean – that could prove catastrophic, potentially causing hundreds of millions of people to move from receding coastlines and more extreme weather. That will mean more migration, more refugees, more conflict and a world without peace and prosperity. That is why the world community, via the UNFCCC, regards warming above 2C as dangerous.  In Paris countries are expected to commit themselves to more ambitious emissions cuts, but there is no room for further delay. Already we are seeing the impact of climate change growing around the world, with more heatwaves, more record rainfall events and more intense droughts. There are signs that the major land-based ice sheets on Greenland and west Antarctica may be becoming unstable. Together they hold enough water to raise global sea levels by about 13 metres. The climate warning signals are all around us. Governments around the world now acknowledge these dangers, and have started moving to low-carbon economies. Some have made more progress than others; some are more ambitious. But the direction of travel is clear. One of the most crucial recent developments is that countries increasingly recognise the compatibility of action to tackle climate change with efforts to overcome poverty and raise living standards. These aims are intertwined and reinforce, rather than compete, with each other. For instance, China has vouched that it is “making efforts to embark on a sustainable development path that is in line with its national circumstances and leads to multiple wins in terms of economic development, social progress and combating climate change”. And Mexico notes that actions to cut emissions and to become more climate resilient will “not only help tackle global warming and reduce social and ecosystem vulnerability, but also promote inclusive green growth in the country”. It is clear that many developing countries understand that the transition to the low-carbon economy will be full of innovation, investment and discovery, and will lead to strong growth – just as we have seen during past waves of technological change, from the industrial revolution through to the digital revolution today. Most countries face huge challenges in terms of their cities, energy systems and land use. But if we respond to these challenges successfully, we can not only manage the risks of climate change but also boost prosperity and wellbeing in many other ways. By mid-century there will be 3 billion more people living in cities – a transformation of huge importance. From the point of view of emissions and the structure of those cities, the next 20 years is of unique importance to world history. If cities are polluted, congested and inefficient, they will be terrible places to live in, and the most serious threat to managing climate change successfully. We can already see what harm fossil fuel-generated air pollution is causing, particularly in the growing cities of India and China, where millions of people are having their lives cut short. Even in London and other European cities, air pollution is severely damaging lives and livelihoods. So designing our cities to be cleaner, less congested and more efficient will have enormous social and economic benefits, as well as reducing the risks of climate change. Many cities will have representatives in Paris to showcase the progress they are making and to change ideas. They will help create the confidence that existing country pledges can be met and bettered. Above all, Paris will provide a moment for political leadership: an opportunity for governments to set aside narrow interpretations of their national self-interest and instead focus on the common good. In doing so, they will invest in ways that directly advance the wellbeing of their peoples. Together, governments must send a clear signal from Paris to the entire world that over the next 20 years we can and will start along a path that offers us, our children and future generations real hope. The prize, still attainable, is a future more sustainable, more secure and more prosperous."

"A day of celebration and hope in Paris disintegrated into rioting and clashes with police on Sunday, after anti-capitalists and anarchists hijacked a peaceful event organised by climate activists earlier in the day. About 200 protesters, some wearing masks, fought with police on a street leading to la place de la République, which has become a gathering place for Parisians since the terror attacks on 13 November that killed 130 people. Witnesses said floral and other tributes were trampled in the melee.  About 100 protesters were arrested and the gathering was cleared by police using batons and teargas.  Earlier on Sunday, there had been a carnival atmosphere in the square before the climate summit due to begin on the city’s outskirts on Monday. Thousands of shoes, including a pair belonging to Pope Francis, had been symbolically laid in the square to represent a climate march that was cancelled by authorities after the terror attacks. The environmental pressure group 350.org had organised a human chain that ran past the Bataclan, the concert venue where dozens of people died in the terror attacks. A gap was left in the human chain to represent the victims. However, at lunchtime a group of anti-capitalist protesters began marching around the statue in the centre of the place de la République. At first they were outnumbered by those from the more peaceful climate groups. When two men began singing La Marseillaise, the French national anthem, they were shouted down by the crowd. “It is a song for war,” said Arora Medieu. “Two weeks ago people sang La Marseillaise to join the sadness the French people had. Today is nothing about what happened two weeks ago. We don’t have to sing for war but to be united for a big, important, beautiful cause.” But almost immediately afterwards the fight began. About 200 anarchists, apparently led by the “black bloc” group, charged at police in a side street. The police responded with teargas and flash bangs. It was, said protester, a demonstration against the “police state” that has cracked down on activism since the terror attacks. “The security state cannot live with manifestation [the French right to assembly],” she said. “The state of France is founded on the right to manifestation.” The situation deteriorated quickly as police restricted access to the square and launched dozens of teargas missiles into the crowd.  Police were pelted with glass bottles, cans, sticks and a skateboard. At one point a series of large bangs made the crowd fall back in fear. It was a reminder of the psychological affect the terror attacks have left on this city, but once the crowd realised that the bangs were set off by police they surged back. The votive candles that have piled up on the monument in the centre of Place de la Republiqué since the terror attacks were also hurled at police. Afterwards the street was littered with broken glass, candles and flowers.  A protester who was handing out eyedrops said people had the right to march for things they believe in, no matter the security situation.  “It’s not just about climate change,” he said. “It’s about the current state in France. The streets belong to us.” By the late afternoon the air in la place de la République was still acrid with the smoke from police canisters. About 250 protesters were kettled by police in one corner of the square, with no one allowed in or out. "

"The world’s birds have begun flocking towards the earth’s north and south poles and upwards to higher ground as climate change begins to transform their habitats, a new report has found.  One quarter of 570 bird species studied globally have been affected negatively by climate change, while 13% have responded positively, says the study by Birdlife International.   Tris Allinson, one of the paper’s authors, told the Guardian: “People regard climate change as something on the horizon and about to happen but the signals from birds are that significant and profound changes are already occurring, with detrimental effects for a large proportion of the birds studied.”  “We are seeing a consistent pattern of birds moving towards the north and south poles in their respective hemispheres, and moving to higher altitudes on mountain slopes,” he added.  Traditional lowland species, such as Keel-billed toucans (Ramphastos sulfuratus), are now being found at elevations of up to 1,500m in Costa Rica, due to climate change. Grey jays (Perisoreus canadensis) have shifted their range northwards by an average 18.5km in the last 26 years. One key trend involves ‘warm-adapted’ species becoming increasingly common in Europe while ‘cool-adapted’ animals experience dramatic declines.  Populations of much-loved animals such as Atlantic puffins and Adelie penguins have both plummeted by 50% in just a few generations.  “We are also seeing changes in birds’ behaviour and in the timing of their migrations, which have knock on effects such as mismatches in their interactions with other species,” Allinson said.  Cuckoos, for example, normally time their annual returns from Africa to make use of nests built by local birds, which then rear their young. As temperatures warm, cuckoos have brought forward their trips, but they are still arriving later than local birds are breeding. Cuckoo populations are now declining in several countries.  Birdlife’s paper, The Messengers, predicts that most bird species will experience shrinking ranges, disrupted breeding seasons, and many are likely to shift their population distributions too slowly to cope with the onset of climate change.  The threat of extinctions and population declines is set to rise rapidly as a result. A third of Europe’s birdlife is already considered endangered.  The majority of North American birds are projected to lose over half their current geographic range by the century’s end while birds in parts of east Africa will lose all their suitable habitats.  Deforestation and sea level rise will likely compound the problem, destroying wetland and forests habitats, while malaria-free habitats are poised to increase dramatically.   But the report also signals some cause for hope, with successful examples of the restoration of peatlands in eastern Europe and the creation of migratory corridors in the Red Sea region, allowing 1.5m soaring birds safe passage between pylons, electricity cables and wind turbines. ‘Stepping stones’ between fragmented environments and reforestation could also help ensure the future of the world’s aviators, Birdlife says, along with environmental safeguards for bioenergy and conservation laws and planning. “Nature has a vital role to play in tackling climate change, but it’s often ignored,” said Edward Perry, another of the report’s authors. “Nature-based solutions not only offer an effective and accessible response to climate change: they also deliver a series of benefits to people and biodiversity.”"
"Does global warming keep you up at night, or do you have trouble believing that the threat is real? Those who remain sceptical as the UN climate change conference begins in Paris tomorrow may find their brain is to blame. Humans feel sudden weather changes, such as cold snaps or heat waves, very keenly, but we’re not so good at sensing small increases in temperature over time. This is partly because our experience of temperature is relative: if you place one hand in hot water and the other in cold water and then put both in a lukewarm bath, you can’t tell how warm the bath actually is – your cold hand will feel it as boiling hot, while your hot hand will feel it as soothingly chilly.  So gradual changes in climate are eclipsed by our short-term responses to the weather, which fluctuates every day. We also adapt to long-term changes, so they are harder to notice: you’ll immediately jump out of a scalding hot bath, while if you get into a lukewarm one and keep adding hot water, you might not even realise when it’s verging on dangerous (if you ignore the rising water levels and rubber ducks in distress). Let that be a warning to the climate sceptics. Dr Daniel Glaser is director of Science Gallery at King’s College London"

"We are all entering uncharted waters as the effects of climate change begin to create categories of migrants that have no precedent: migrants rendered stateless after their island nations disappear; migrants constituting a vast, roaming “environmental refugee” population; migrants fleeing climate-intensified wars and violence like that in Syria and Central America. In a matter of days, global leaders will enter the most delicate and potentially catastrophic discussions about civilization and migration in history. The UN COP21 conference on climate in Paris could decide the fate of people being displaced by climate change – the number of which has been forecast to be as many as 1 billion people, with 200 million being the most widely cited figure.  In September New Zealand rejected Ioane Teitiota’s quest to become the world’s first officially recognized climate-change refugee, and deported him back to the island nation of Kiribati instead. Kiribati is so vulnerable to sea-level rise that its government recently purchased land in Fiji so that it would have a place to relocate its citizens when the islands are eventually submerged, a fate that now seems inevitable. Is this how the west will deal with climate-change refugees? COP21 should be addressing this very question yet, incredibly, the mention of the term migrants may be cut from the final agreement coming out of the critical global gathering. In October a revised draft of the conference agreement showed proposed deletions of any mention of “migrants” from the final conference agreement. Deleting just a over a dozen words will have many unfortunate consequences, including letting the countries of the global North off the hook for continuing with their current strategy. Instead of actually facing the crisis, the global North will just be policing migrants. Before the Paris attacks, the COP21 host country’s president, François Hollande, warned in a press conference in September that, without substantive climate action, “We won’t have hundreds of thousands of refugees in the next 20 or 30 years, but millions.” He also reminded the countries of the global North to fulfill their commitment, made during the 2009 Copenhagen (COP15) talks, to increase aid to the poorest, most climate-vulnerable countries to $100bn a year by 2020. That was before France’s 9-11. Since then, serious talk about serious issues is being replaced by the dangerous and outmoded xenophobic talk that has been making a worldwide comeback in the wake of the Paris attacks. The calls by Marine Le Pen, France’s far-right National Front party leader, to “expel” all the “illegal migrants who have nothing to do here” were echoed throughout the United States, where all Republican presidential candidates sounded immigration alarms. Marco Rubio, for example, called the attacks on Paris part of a larger “clash of civilizations” and also called for the United States to immediately “halt new admissions of refugees from Syria”. This has devastating effects on migrants: painting them as threats, rather than people fleeing threats from civil war, the rising ocean or, as is increasingly the case, violence and conflict that scientists say has been worsened by the effects of climate change. This shift now provides Northern countries another way to mask their unwillingness to deal with the migration crisis that their production and consumption habits have played a role in creating. Yet it is likely that “the burden of providing for climate migrants will be borne by the poorest countries – those least responsible for emissions of greenhouse gases”, according to the International Organization for Migration. The COP21 talks should take a reality-based approach, beginning with actually mentioning the word migrants in the agreement that comes out of the talks, as earlier drafts did. Before the titanic waves of coming displacement, members should also reinstate the idea that Australia (the nation whose outspokenness against dealing with climate migration has it playing the role of Donald Trump on the world migration stage) worked to have stricken from the plan: establishing a “climate change displacement coordination facility” to help with both emergency relief and planned relocations. Also being discussed (at least by the most climate-vulnerable countries) are proposals to include language that opens the door to providing legal protection to climate refugees. These protections aren’t simply a moral imperative; they represent the only civilized approach to climate migration."

"Climate change activists have occupied part of Tate Britain, where they have started to tattoo each other in protest at BP’s sponsorship of the gallery. Tate has closed the 1840s gallery where 35 activists have set themselves up and started to tattoo each other with the numbers of the CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere in the year they were born. They estimate it will take all day to complete the tattoos. Alice Bell, a spokesperson for Liberate Tate, the group that is leading the protest, said: “This makes a statement about the stain that oil has across society, on Tate, on the negotiations and across our culture, society and economics more broadly. The black mark on our skin reflects the taint of BP on Tate.” Scientists estimate that 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a safe level. This was passed around 30 years ago.  UN experts said recently that the Earth’s atmosphere would “enter a new permanent reality” in 2016 when the CO2 concentration is predicted to pass 400ppm. It is currently estimated to stand at 397ppm. UN climate change talks open in Paris on Monday. Amy, 38, a photographer from Australia, was having the number 333 tattooed on her hip, where her daughter has a birthmark. “I’ve never had a tattoo because I’ve never felt strongly enough about a symbol or image to have it permanently placed on my body. But I have a daughter and I am deeply concerned about climate change,” she said. “To have a child is a hopeful act, it is to have faith in the future. But we have to divest fossil fuels from our lives and that includes the arts.” The four activists doing the tattooing are not professionals and have spent two months learning the process, practising on fruit and their own legs. Bell said their protest was “probably more hygienic than most tattoo parlours”. It is the latest in a string of protests by Liberate Tate that aim to highlight the influence of BP on art and cultural institutions. In June the group occupied Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall for 25 hours and scrawled words of warning about climate change across the floor in charcoal. Three years earlier they deposited a wind turbine blade at the gallery, with an official request for it to be made part of the museum’s permanent collection. In January, after a protracted legal battle, the Tate was forced to reveal that it had accepted £3.8m from BP over a 17-year period – an average of £224,000 each year. Protesters said the sum was “embarrassingly small”, while the Tate described it as “considerable”. A freedom of information request revealed that the sponsorship represented 0.3% of Tate’s operating budget in 2013-14.  The 1840s gallery was chosen for the protest because it houses many paintings from the time of the industrial revolution, when the large-scale burning of fossil fuels began in the west. Tate Britain is the oldest gallery in the Tate network, which dates back to the late 19th century when the industrialist Henry Tate donated his art collection to the nation. In Paris on Monday, leaders from almost every country in the world will gather to try to thrash out a deal on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from 2020. More than 2,000 protests in 150 countries are expected to take place on Sunday as part of the Global Climate March. Tate responded to the protest in a statement that read: “BP is one of the most important sponsors of the arts in the UK supporting Tate as well as several other leading cultural institutions. Tate works with a wide range of corporate organisations and generates the majority of its funding from earned income and private sources. The support that these organisations give is extremely important and allows us to deliver a hugely successful and popular programme.  “The Tate Trustees first agreed a sponsorship policy in 1991, and more recently incorporated its principles within an Ethics Policy in 2008. The Board and Ethics committee regularly review compliance with the policy. BP has worked with Tate since 1990 and fits within the guidelines of this policy. Its support has been instrumental in helping Tate develop access to the Tate Collection and to present changing displays of work by a wide range of artists in the national collection of British art.”"
"1 The world really wants a strong deal and this time will get it  There is a universal will to limit emissions. Governments understand the science and know that doing nothing is no longer a political or moral option. Evidence of climate change has grown since the Copenhagen meeting in 2009, and 2015 has already been declared the hottest year ever. Climate change is also much better understood by the public to be a grave threat and this gives politicians the legitimacy to be bold in their actions. Non-governmental groups have created a sense of destiny about the Paris meeting, pressing the idea that this is the world’s last chance to act to avoid catastrophic change, and that a deal is certain: “Now is our time,” says Obama’s special climate envoy, Todd Stern, urging all countries to compromise this week. 2 A green economy makes financial sense A bold new international deal committing all countries to reducing emissions is in everyone’s long-term economic interests. It will signal to business that governments are legally committed to reducing emissions and this in turn will give the private sector and banks the long-term confidence they need to invest in renewable energies and conservation, and should steer financiers, technologists and others away from extracting oil, gas and coal and toward clean energy development. If large carbon markets also emerge, as big business and the UN want, and if rich countries make good on their pledge to mobilise $100bn a year for poor countries to adapt to climate change by 2020, then the long-promised global “green economy” should grow fast, benefiting everyone.  Renewable energy technologies are moving ahead much faster than imagined. The cost of wind power and solar in many countries today is roughly the same as coal or gas, making the switch to green energy and lower emissions much easier for treasuries and ministers to justify to electorates. Within 20 years, it is expected that renewable energy prices will fall further, while fossil fuel energy will grow comparatively more expensive.  3 Nations are ready to commit to real change Countries have already stated their intentions. Ahead of the Paris talks, more than 180 countries representing 90% of global emissions, have submitted their national plans to cut emissions. This is the first time since climate negotiations started 20 years ago that virtually all the world’s nations have committed to being part of the solution. By comparison, the 1997 Kyoto protocol included pledges for reductions by 37 rich countries which together comprised well under half of global emissions. Kyoto did not include the US, which refused to sign up, or China, the world’s two largest carbon dioxide emitters. With the key players aboard, victory is certain. 4 What can go wrong?   The chances of diplomatic success are much higher than in Copenhagen in 2009, which was billed as the finale of years of talks, but ended in diplomatic chaos. The text that negotiators and politicians from 195 countries will haggle over in Paris is shorter and more focused, and many difficult decisions have already been made. The positions of the major emitting countries – like the US and China – are closer to each other than in the past, so it should be easier for negotiators and politicians to compromise. France, as the host country, is very experienced at international negotiations and has ensured that many of the potentially tough decisions, such as finance and the final target, can be put back to later meetings. This will allow, at the very least, a weak deal to be signed, with a stated guarantee that it can be improved later.  5 We’re all in it together The recent terrorist atrocities in Paris will galvanise the 143-plus world leaders due to arrive in the city to make a global statement of solidarity and provide the political impetus to secure a strong deal. No country will want to be identified as the one that stopped a deal. “Paris will soon be known as the place where world leaders stood together on the right side of history,” says the president of the World Bank Group, Jim Yong Kim. 1 Countries may not make the necessary compromises Prince Charles and more than 140 presidents, prime ministers and heads of state will make short, bland statements on Monday about the need to act, after which negotiators and politicians have just a few working days to reach diplomatic agreement. Considering that it has taken 20 years of fruitless negotiations to reach this point, there is no chance that the wide gaps between countries can be closed in just a few days. So the only way any deal can be reached in Paris is if the UN and France, as the hosts, bludgeon through a least-worst agreement over the heads of the many. All countries will come under intense pressure to compromise but some will not want to be dictated to. 2 It’s failed already  The cuts that 180 countries have said they are prepared to make up to 2030 will only hold temperatures to a 2.7C rise, whereas the absolute minimum needed to prevent catastrophic warming by the end of the century is thought to be 2C. More than 100 countries have said they want the UN to set the more ambitious global target of 1.5C, and for them anything that does not guarantee this will be seen as a failure of negotiations. Aviation and shipping are also unlikely to be in the deal because it will be too difficult to get agreement. Poor countries want legal certainty that the rich will do as they promise, but rich countries only want voluntary targets. The reality gap between what countries want and what they may get is just too wide.  3 Who will bear the biggest burden? Countries are still fatally split on key issues like reducing emissions, finance and technology. With so many major differences, it will take a heroic effort by politicians to reach any deal at all. The most important hurdle could be over whether industrialised countries like the US, UK and Japan, which have contributed the most to the historical build-up of emissions, should be obliged to cut more more than developing countries. India, on behalf of many poor countries, will argue that there must be “differentiation” between rich and poor; but the US wants targets that are applicable to all. A collision is inevitable. 4 Where’s the money?  Many of the ambitious plans to cut emissions submitted to the UN depend on up to $1trn being made available to invest in renewable energy, farming and forestry. This money is not available and will depend on flows from new carbon markets and other uncertain financial sources. In addition, only $57bn of the $100bn pledged to be “mobilised” by rich countries to help poor countries adapt their economies to a warming world has been identified. Because developing countries have had long experience of failed promises and pledges they are not going to roll over without financial guarantees. They fear double counting and the diversion of aid flows, and although they will fight hard for money they will meet rock-hard resistance from the rich, who are determined to commit as little as possible. 5 We want a deal but not at any price  There is a genuine will to tackle climate change but not at any cost, and many rich countries delude themselves if they think that climate change and reducing emissions is a high priority for everyone. These talks have been going for many years and there is still a deep distrust of the way that the US and others have avoided having to change their lifestyles but have bullied poor countries to shoulder the burden of cuts. Many countries resent this injustice and want to determine their own development path. They fear that the rich will not have to do much to reduce emissions but they will have to slow down their growth. For them, poverty eradication and economic development are still the most important elements of any deal so they will seek guaranteed financial and techno­logical support if they are to agree to anything. Many oil-producing countries led by Saudi Arabia will also want a weak deal that will not devalue their natural assets. Some Latin American countries like Venezuela and Bolivia will hold out in the name of climate justice for a deal that forces the rich to cut more than the poor. Negotiations are conducted by blocs of countries, consensus is necessary and it is easy to tactically derail the talks or to delay discussions to a point where no strong deal can be negotiated in the limited time available.

"Recipients of Cambridge University scholarships funded by and named in honour of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have attacked the global health charity’s “untenable” investments in fossil fuels. In a letter, 98 present and former Gates scholars urged the world’s largest charitable foundation to drop coal, oil and gas companies from its $43bn fund. “Climate change undermines improvements in global health, as well as in local and international food security: areas the Gates Foundation has championed. As much recent research – including some of our own ongoing work – shows, a stable climate is essential for ensuring the well-being of humans across the world,” the letter read. A recent study by the Lancet and University College London recently found that climate change threatens to reverse half a century of improvements in global health.  Research suggests climate change is allowing malaria-carrying mosquitos to spread to highland regions in Africa, South America and south-east Asia, exposing entire new populations to the deadly disease. The Gates Foundation funds research and field work that has saved countless lives from malaria, polio, tuberculosis and HIV. A Guardian investigation in March found the Gates foundation’s trust held $1.4bn worth of investments in some of the world’s biggest carbon polluters. “It is untenable to separate our monetary investments from the vision of the world we want to see,” the letter continues. “The Gates foundation can and should use its power, money and privilege to pave the way for a more enlightened global economy.” Analysis has shown a Gates foundation divestment would not only have sent a powerful social message about the future economy it desires, it would have saved £1.9bn as shares in coal and oil have tumbled. Divestment has now become a mainstream choice for many fund managers. The South Yorkshire council’s £5.5bn fund announced on Monday that it had stopped buying shares in coal and tar sands oil companies, a move that relegates the two most carbon-intensive fossil fuels. This was followed on Tuesday by an announcement by the world’s biggest insurer Allianz that it would dump £2.8bn worth of coal shares. Insurer CNP Assurances and investment group Caisse des Dépôts later joined Allianz. The London School of Economics will decide on Wednesday night whether to divest its endowment from fossil fuels. A recent report found that if the school had dropped its shares three years ago it would now be £3m better off. The Cambridge signatories acknowledged Bill Gates’ personal concern for climate change, which this year led the world’s richest man to commit $2bn of his personal wealth to renewable energy and climate research. But they questioned his stance against divestment, to which he has held firm despite a major campaign run by this newspaper and signed by 235,000 people calling on his charity to drop its investments. In October, Gates criticised people who thought “divestment alone is a solution” as idealistic. “Whilst I fully agree with Gates that divestment is not the whole solution, pulling resources out of the fossil fuel industries is one important step along the way,” said Ragnhild Freng Dale, a PhD candidate at the Scott Polar Institute. “If the Gates foundation committed to divest, it would not only send a powerful signal to the rest of the world, but also free up money that is needed to invest in research and development of future energy solutions.” The Gates Cambridge Scholarship Trust awards 90 academic grants each year to students who demonstrate a “commitment to improving the lives of others”. The programme was set up with a $210m endowment from the Gates foundation and remains one of the world’s largest university scholarships programmes. Both Bill and Melinda Gates are patrons and they appoint two members of the board. The scholarship holders who signed the letter come from a broad swath of academic disciplines; including clean energy, social sciences, French thought, music and English literature. The Gates Divest organisation has been holding daily protests outside the foundation offices in the city of Seattle. Their call has so far been endorsed by 62 local non-profit organisations, 70 faith leaders and 10 out of 18 city council election candidates.  “Bill and Melinda Gates are viewed as deserved moral leaders. But that’s why their divestment is so important - because where leaders go, others follow,” said Alec Connon, campaign organiser. The Gates foundation does not comment on divestment. The Gates Cambridge Trust did not respond to an email from the Guardian."
"Millions of lives are being turned upside down by life-threatening extreme weather. Communities are no stranger to the disastrous impacts of climate change, but this year’s El Niño is wreaking havoc. Although the warming of the Pacific Ocean is a natural phenomenon, climate change is increasing in the intensity and destructiveness it unleashes in the form of floods, droughts and typhoons. Unicef has warned that an estimated 11 million children are at risk from hunger, disease and lack of water (pdf) in eastern and southern Africa alone, and many more face record-smashing droughts and floods across swathes of Latin America, Asia and the Pacific. Children, particularly the most destitute, are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change. Climate-related disasters and changing weather patterns increase the risk of malnutrition, vector-borne diseases such as malaria, and water and food-borne diarrhoea – all major killers of children who, according to the World Health Organisation, suffer a much greater burden of these climate-related diseases than adults.   Loss of family livelihoods and migration following these events can also leave children exposed to the dangers of child-trafficking and labour, or other forms of exploitation, violence and abuse. And because of the unique period of development that childhood represents, these types of physical and psychological trauma have more severe and lasting effects for children than adults. For all the rhetoric from world leaders on protecting the planet for our children and future generations, consideration of children has been conspicuously absent from international climate negotiations. They are mentioned just once in the current draft text of the Paris climate agreement.   The UN climate talks have been slow to recognise the relationship between climate change and human rights, representing a strange disconnect between this process and other commitments the international community has signed up to. The SDGs – or global goals – recognise that tackling climate change will be essential for advancing poverty alleviation and human development, and firmly ground these goals in the objective of realising the human rights of all. It will be impossible to improve the lives of the poorest and most marginalised children and communities – and to prevent millions more from falling into poverty – if their rights are undermined by catastrophic climate change. The Human Rights Council has recognised this in several resolutions, along with UN human rights experts who have consistently urged governments to place human rights at the core of the climate change agreement. An increasing number of countries are calling for this, too. The Philippines – still reeling from the effects of Typhoon Haiyan – is among the most vocal champions. Joining the dots between countries’ climate policies and actions, and their existing human rights obligations and commitments, can inform and strengthen efforts to tackle climate change.  Recognising this can, firstly, drive more urgent and ambitious action to reduce emissions. The Climate Vulnerable Forum, an increasingly influential group representing 43 of the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries, has led calls for the global agreement to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, rather than the 2 degrees goal previously signed up to by governments. This is on the understanding that the latter poses a serious threat to the fundamental human rights of the one billion people they represent. Second, it can ensure that the very solutions and actions designed to tackle climate change do not themselves undermine human rights. There must be safeguards in place to prevent tragedies – such as the forced removal of communities to make way for green projects – from taking place. In Guatemala, protests over the planned construction of a hydro dam have been linked to the deaths of six indigenous people, including two children. Finally, it can support full and meaningful participation in global and national policy discussions, involving and empowering those whose voices are seldom heard, yet whose lives are indelibly shaped by the impacts of climate change and the policies designed to help them. As former Irish President Mary Robinson has pointed out, “What is the new climate change agreement for, if not people’s rights?” Unicef UK will continue to advocate for the core legal agreement to recognise children and to maintain language that countries shall – in all climate-change-related actions – respect, protect, promote and fulfil human rights for all. The climate talks in Paris must deliver an enduring regime, setting out long- and short-term obligations and mechanisms to bring countries back to the table until people and planet are safe. This is the start of something new: let’s make sure we get it right, protect our children, and leave no one behind.  Joni Pegram leads on climate change policy and advocacy at Unicef UK.

"Thom Yorke has claimed that advisers to Tony Blair tried to force him to meet the then prime minister in 2003. The Radiohead singer’s comments, which were made in an interview with him and Guardian columnist George Monbiot on the French online magazine Télérama, referred back to the time when he was the spokesman for the Big Ask, a climate change campaign by Friends of the Earth.  Yorke said he was asking politicians to acknowledge the existence of climate change, but soon ran into difficulties. He said: “It got into this big fight … [They said] ‘If you don’t agree to meet the prime minister, Friends of the Earth will be denied all access to him.’ Because of the Iraq war, I didn’t want to do it. I felt it was morally unacceptable for me to be photographed with Blair.” A spokesperson for Blair said: “The suggestion is both preposterous and nonsense.” Back in 2008, Yorke wrote in the Guardian that he had “not made a habit of meeting politicians” as part of his activism. In the lengthy interview, Yorke also talked about Radiohead’s commitment to carbon-neutral touring, which he described as like “pissing in the wind”. “If you have a Radiohead show where 20,000 people turn up, happy to see you play, and it’s the only venue in the area and yet the promoter is saying: ‘The only way to get there is to drive,’ you’re faced with this decision and you’re going: ‘OK, do we blow out because there’s no support or public transport and we deprive the fans of a concert in order to reduce our carbon footprint?’” He added: “Initially, it kept me awake at night – which sounds really stupid. I got unhealthily obsessed with it. But when I started to get involved in doing something about it, that helped me a lot. But I always have the impression that I am not doing enough at all.” Yorke recently tweeted that, despite the banning of all public protests for security reasons following the Paris terror attacks, he would be travelling to Paris on 4 December for the COP21 climate change conference to “put pressure on our glorious leaders … now or never.” In 2011, he was also on board for the maiden voyage of the Rainbow Warrior III, the Greenpeace ship built for campaigning and activism. Speaking to Monbiot, Yorke also explained his reluctance to write protest songs about the environment. He said: “In the 60s, you could write songs that were like calls to arms, and it would work. If I was going to write a protest song about climate change in 2015, it would be shit.  “It’s not like one song or one piece of art or one book is going to change someone’s mind.”     "

"This morning I visited the place de la République, in many ways the beating heart of Paris. It’s where people here chose to place their memorial to the victims of the attacks two weeks ago, and there is still a huge crowd, gathered round the central monument in intense, almost ritual silence, taking in the thousands of pictures, candles, flowers and messages left by wellwishers. Just a few steps away, a different ritual was taking place. Thousands of Parisians, denied by police security concerns the chance to hold what might have been the largest single climate change march in history, are bringing their shoes, one by one, to be lined up symbolically along a march route through République. An eloquent expression of their determination to be heard.  The experience of République was emotional for me. You have the sense that history is happening here, that this time and place is a crucible in our journey as humanity, and that the best and the worst in our natures are rising to meet it. It is a test of who we are. And from the tiniest actions of an old woman bringing a pair of shoes, to the grandest of the largest climate summit in history, we human beings are deciding where we stand on ourselves, on our future.  Climate change is in many ways a crucible. It is the greatest threat we have ever faced, and will require us to come together as never before, in the most ambitious solution we’ve ever attempted. That solution is clear, the only answer we have: to transform our economies to be powered by 100% clean energy. But will we be wise enough, skilled enough, brave enough, to answer the call of our people, of our children and their children? For 20 years we have talked in these climate conferences. Progress has been glacial. The largest corporations in the world are almost all oil companies. The top four have the same budget as the government of China. The top 10 have the same budget as the US government. They are states, superpowers unto themselves. And to save our species from the threat of catastrophic climate change, they must radically change, or die. So far, most of them have chosen to fight for shortsighted profit, and our demise.  So every year, they send their pocket-politicians to hamstring the world’s progress. In the past it has been the former US President Bush, or Canada’s ex-Prime Minister Harper. In the consensus-based politics of the UN, just a few spoilers are enough to torpedo any ambitious agreement. The standard tactic is to indignantly demand more action, or politically impossible action, from other countries before agreeing to act yourself. This year’s spoiler may be India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, who is very close to big coal, and faces a historic choice: will he be a genuine champion of the world’s poor, or the planet’s chief lobbyist for the coal industry? But more than ever, we have no cause for despair. Eighteen months ago, that’s where most people were, with good reason – political will on climate change was very, very hard to find. Then, hundreds of thousands of citizens chose hope, and belief in ourselves, and came together in the largest climate change mobilisation in history on 21 September 2014. It utterly changed the atmosphere. The marches were joined by dozens of top political leaders, and almost every head of state responded to it directly. “We must answer the call,” said Obama the next day.  The year since has seen unprecedented progress on climate change. The world’s biggest polluters have made new commitments to cut emissions, and for the first time these commitments are coming from developing countries too. We have begun to address this problem together, as one people. Attention to the issue is sky high, with the pope asking Catholics to join our marches this weekend, Google and YouTube sending people to sign our movement’s climate petition, mayors around the world committing to clean energy in their cities, and so much more. The first marches to happen this weekend are the largest in their country’s histories, twice the size of last year’s mobilisation. Paris cannot take this progress away from us, and the climate movement will persist and ultimately win whatever happens here. But it’s precisely because we have so much momentum to succeed that Paris is a real test of humanity. Climate change is a long fight – our children will be fighting it – and we can’t give up because one conference does not produce a quick fix. We must set our sights on an ambitious and achievable next step, and fight hard for it.  That ambitious next step is a grand bargain to be struck between the global north and south. One in which all countries agree, for the first time, to a powerful goal of transitioning the world to 100% clean energy. This commitment would have an immediate impact on trillions of dollars of private investment, that would begin shifting further from dirty energy to clean energy. That shift is already driving an exponential increase in clean energy, currently providing 22% of the world’s electricity and climbing. Already, renewable energy is cheaper than coal in many countries. A declaration that the days of fossil fuels are numbered would accelerate that trend.  But transitioning our economies will cost money, and it’s not fair to ask the poorest countries, many of whom haven’t created this problem, to pay the full bill. So the bargain is that rich polluters agree to a price tag, of $100bn per year, to help developing nations fund this transition. The world has dithered on climate change for too long. But this year has been different, and this summit may be too. Different because of that old woman dropping off her shoes at la République, and the young volunteers who stood in the cold and thanked her.  The people of the world are coming to understand that there are no spectators on these issues. Citizens are marching, acting online, and burning up phone lines. We understand that what our governments do or don’t do is on all of us. That’s why the next two weeks, and the outcome of Paris, is a test of all humanity. Will Indians let their government shill for the coal industry? Will Americans let their government skimp on the price tag for a clean energy transition? Will Brazilians and Europeans demand that their governments refuse to accept a weak deal? This is a moment where we show who we are as a people. What happens next, depends on all of us."
"Countries most vulnerable to climate change have seized the political initiative at the start of the UN climate talks in Paris by challenging the US, China and Europe to raise their ambitions and set a long-term temperature goal of 1.5C rather than the 2C target. As more than 140 world leaders made short opening statements on Sunday, 44 countries that are members of the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis), along with other vulnerable countries, declared that the 2C goal being backed by all major blocs would seal the fate of hundreds of millions of people in countries like Bangladesh, the Philippines, Sudan and Vietnam.  “Our members are particularly vulnerable to climate extremes and climate change impacts and we are acutely aware of the vanishingly little time remaining to adopt a legally binding climate treaty,” said Thoriq Ibrahim, environment and energy minister of the Maldives and chairman of Aosis. “We are very concerned that the INDCs [intended nationally determined contributions] have us heading for about 3C of warming. This would spell disaster for many small island states and other vulnerable countries. It is therefore critical that the Paris agreement is ‘designed for ambition’ to quickly get us back on track,” he said. Aosis wants countries to “peak” their emissions urgently. “A long-term temperature goal of well below 1.5 degrees must be reflected in the Paris agreement, along with an indicative pathway for achieving it, including urgent peaking and deep mid-century emissions reductions,” said Ibrahim. The alliance comprises mainly small, low-lying states in Africa, the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Pacific and South China Sea, including Belize, Cape Verde, the Maldives, Jamaica, Singapore and Papua New Guinea.  In a statement, the group said: “Warming has now reached 1C. At the same time, our islands are experiencing the impacts of an ongoing extreme El Niño and the science is telling us that such events will occur twice as often over the 21st century if we do not act strongly and decisively. Additional magnitudes of warming will only increase the risk of such severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts.” On Monday, the leaders of countries from the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) will join the Aosis group in calling for a more ambitious target. The CVF, which includes larger countries such as the Philippines and Bangladesh, will break ranks with the G77 group that traditionally represents the views of most developing countries and sign a declaration urging a 1.5C target. “We are the countries who will suffer the most from climate change and against whom all the big [negotiating] groups like the US, EU and G77 are aligned. We are the majority: 106 of the 195 countries of the world want this 1.5C target. But there is no democracy here. It’s a power game and the powerful are not on our side,” said the CVF’s spokesman, Saleemul Huq. “We accept it is not realistic, but it is the right thing to do.” The declaration will also be signed by Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland. The French hosts are acutely aware of how controversial the 2C figure is and are keeping open the possibility of an agreement based on 1.5C. “This agreement will need to be differentiated, fair, sustainable, dynamic, balanced and legally binding, and will need to ensure that ... the global temperature does not rise by 2C – or even 1.5C – compared to the pre-industrial era because of greenhouse gas emissions. Each of these terms refers to specific provisions on which we have been unable to conclude fully in the past,” the French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said on Monday. The initiative by the two climate vulnerable groups before the start of negotiations raises the political temperature in Paris. The two blocs have strong support from civil society groups around the world that do not accept the 2C target.  Mohamed Adow, Christian Aid’s senior climate adviser, said: “Although today the leaders of the rich and powerful nations will make all the headlines, it is vital that the voices of the world’s most vulnerable countries are heard. “These countries have grown tired of empty words from world leaders and they cannot afford any more in Paris. They are reaching out between and across traditional negotiating blocs to help build a better and safer future for all of us. “We are in danger of making these communities the global ‘canaries in the coal mine’ and letting them suffer by allowing global temperatures to rise even two degrees above pre-industrial levels. For these countries, a two-degree world is a miserable one and they are right to use their high moral authority to call for bolder and more ambitious action from this summit.” In its statement, Aosis added: “The latest science confirms what we are seeing with our own eyes: the World Meteorological Organisation reports that 2011-2015 has been the warmest five-year period on record and that this year is on track to be the hottest ever.” • This article was amended on 1 December 2015 to clarify Saleemul Huq’s position.

"Thousands of people have marched in Brisbane and more were planning to march in Darwin on Saturday, following Friday’s 40,000-strong rally in Melbourne. Crowd reports in Brisbane varied from 5,000 to 10,000. The People’s Climate March – a worldwide event – took place on Saturday, and organisers said thousands took part in 35 New Zealand centres – the smallest being on Raoul Island, where the island’s entire population of seven turned out. The Brisbane march was plagued by hot, humid weather, but those rallying to call for urgent action on climate change in the lead-up to the Paris climate talks next week seemed undeterred. The ABC reported the 5,000-strong crowd gathered at Queen’s Park before marching through the CBD and across the river to South Bank. The Pacific Climate group addressed demonstrators about the risk of catastrophic sea level rises. Rallies are planned in Adelaide, Canberra, Sydney, Hobart and Perth on Sunday. Before the Brisbane march, thousands had also gathered in Wellington, Auckland and Christchurch in New Zealand. A reported 15,000 marched in Auckland – although some media outlets put the figure as low as 4,000 – 8,000 in Christchurch and 7,000 marched on NZ parliament in Wellington, according to media reports. Climate activist and actress Lucy Lawless addressed the Auckland event. Altogether, 30 marches were scheduled across New Zealand for the weekend. March organiser Steve Abel told the New Zealand Herald that collectively, it was by far the biggest climate change march to be held in New Zealand. “Instead of seizing the opportunities from moving to a low-carbon future, the New Zealand government is lagging behind its people and the world by taking a weak target to Paris and refusing to take real action on climate change,” Auckland march convenor Kristin Gilles told AAP. New Zealand is taking a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030 to the Paris talks. “The government should listen to the thousands of New Zealanders who took to the streets today and come up with a stronger, more ambitious plan for reducing climate pollution,” said co-leader James Shaw. However, the prime minister, John Key, has said the 30% reduction is credible. Australian Associated Press contributed to this report."

"The UK government has cancelled its £1bn competition for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology just six months before it was due to be awarded, breaking a pledge in the Conservative party’s election manifesto. The abandonment of a technology championed by David Cameron and seen as vital in tackling global warming will be an embarrassment to the UK, just days before a major UN climate change summit in Paris. Industry figures called the move “devastating”, while experts said it would make meeting the UK’s binding carbon cuts “almost impossible” and more expensive.  Two projects had been in the running to build plants demonstrating CCS at commercial scale. One was backed by Shell and SSE at Peterhead. The White Rose consortium was based at Drax, the UK’s largest power plant, but was in trouble after Drax halted its investment in September. The government informed the London Stock Exchange at 3pm, stating: “Following the chancellor’s autumn statement, HM government confirms that the £1bn ring-fenced capital budget for the CCS competition is no longer available. We will engage closely with the bidders on the implications of this decision for them.” The decision was not mentioned in Treasury documents. “This is devastating,” said Luke Warren, chief executive of the CCS Association. “Moving the goalposts just at the time when a four-year competition is about to conclude is an appalling way to do business. It is a real blow to confidence for companies investing in CCS. This technology is critical for the UK’s economic, industrial and climate policies.” Shell said the Peterhead project was now dead and its CCS work would be focused in other countries. “Shell remains committed to CCS – as our involvement in demonstration projects in other parts of the world shows – and we view it as an important part of a low-carbon energy future,” said a spokesman. CCS traps the carbon dioxide from coal and gas power plants and buries it underground so it cannot warm the climate. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded CCS is hugely important to tackling climate change in the most cost-effective way. Without CCS, the costs of halting global warming would double, the IPCC said. The UK government’s own advisors, the Committee on Climate Change, agreed and said in October: “CCS is very important for reducing emissions across the economy and could almost halve the cost of meeting the 2050 target in the [UK’s] Climate Change Act.” The Conservative’s 2015 general election manifesto said: “We have been the greenest government ever ... committing £1bn for carbon capture and storage.” Lisa Nandy, Labour’s shadow energy secretary, said: “CCS offers huge economic opportunities for Britain. Year after year the prime minister has personally promised to support CCS, so this is a huge betrayal.” Claire Jakobsson, at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, said CCS could save the UK £32bn a year by 2050 and abandoning the competition was a false economy: “In choosing to save a relatively small sum of taxpayer money in 2015, the government is unnecessarily committing vast amount of future energy consumers’ money.” The UK’s energy policy was reset on 18 November and aims to build many new gas-fired power stations. To meet carbon targets, any new stations would have to stop generating by 2030 unless CCS is fitted, but the cancellation of the CCS competition makes this less likely. “If we are serious about building a clean and secure energy sector we need a diverse energy system, and CCS is central to this,” said Jenifer Baxter, at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. “Without CCS this will mean we are locking ourselves into relying on unabated fossil fuel power for generations to come.” George Osborne’s autumn review and comprehensive spending review also cut spending on home energy efficiency by £132m - an 83% reduction - on the same day that over 40,000 excess deaths were announced for the last winter. The UK has some of the worst housing in the EU and improvements in efficiency are needed to meet carbon targets. Another £700m - 40% - was cut from a scheme supporting green heating. The chancellor announced a doubling of investment in energy research and technology over five years. He singled out mini nuclear reactors - called small modular reactors (SMRs) - as a promising technology for the UK. Foreign SMR companies have been courting the UK in recent months. The spending review pledged “at least £250m over the next five years in an ambitious nuclear R&D programme that will revive the UK’s nuclear expertise ... This will include a competition to identify the best value SMR design for the UK. This will pave the way towards building one of the world’s first SMRs in the UK in the 2020s.” A new large nuclear power station at Hinkley Point is set to receive billions in subsidies. “The chancellor is slashing renewables and energy efficiency investment, and eliminating CCS funding, making it almost impossible to meet our carbon budgets,” said Sepi Golzari-Munro, at climate policy thinktank E3G. “Rather than building the low-carbon infrastructure fit for the future, he has doubled down on building the infrastructure of the past.”  "

"Labor’s target on climate change is “heroic” and aimed at making a political point rather than helping the environment, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said.  Turnbull is one of the nearly 150 world leaders who will be discussing post-2020 emissions reductions targets at a key United Nations climate conference in Paris, due to begin on Monday. He takes with him the government’s target of a 26% to 28% cut of 2005 levels by 2030, a target announced by Turnbull’s predecessor, Tony Abbott, and environment minister, Greg Hunt, in August. Labor released its own target a day after Turnbull, who is currently in Malta for the Commonwealth heads of governments meeting (Chogm), left Australia. It has pledged to cut 2005 emissions by 45% by 2030. Turnbull has criticised the target as unrealistic. “All I would say about [opposition leader] Mr Shorten’s targets is what everyone else has said from leading economists to industry associations to commentators, that he sets some high targets but he has given no indication of how they could be met,” Turnbull said during a press conference in Malta on Saturday.  “So it is a heroic offer that he has made. Their costs would be very, very considerable. I think it’s a political rather than an environmental statement.” Several frontbenchers, including the Hunt, have said Labor’s plan will cost the Australian economy $600bn.  But that claim was discredited by leading economist Warwick McKibbin, who found that a 45% reduction in emissions would result in a loss of between 0.5% and 0.7% of Australia’s gross domestic product (GDP). $600bn is about 2% of Australia’s GDP. By comparison, McKibbin’s modelling found that a 26% reduction, as proposed by the Coalition, would see a loss of about 0.2% to 0.3% of GDP. The Business Council of Australia welcomed Labor’s target as “one starting point that needs to be considered”.  “If we are to transform the Australian economy, a long-term abatement goal is critical for delivering investor confidence,” chief executive Jennifer Westacott said.The shadow foreign minister, Tanya Plibersek, told reporters on Sunday the target had been recommended by “a number of very serious economists and environmental scientists”. “If we’re going to get to net zero emissions eventually, we need to track a trajectory to get there. The sooner we start making cuts to our carbon pollution, the cheaper it’ll be to get there and the more effectively we’ll get there,” she said. Shorten, who departed for Paris overnight, was critical of the Coalition’s target. “Malcolm Turnbull is flying to Paris carrying Tony Abbott’s climate-sceptic baggage,” Shorten said on Saturday. “Under Malcolm Turnbull and his Liberals, Australia goes to the Paris climate change conference as the only developed nation that has gone backwards on climate action in the past two years.” “It is frankly embarrassing Australia is being officially represented at these critical talks by a Liberal government determined to hold Australia back on taking action on climate change,” he said. Leaders at Chogm this weekend agreed to set up a $1m Commonwealth Climate Finance Access Hub to help small island nations and other developing nations deal with climate change.  “These countries have asked for assistance in accessing the climate finance they need to effectively deal with climate change and develop investment-ready projects,” the official communique from the meeting said."

"International climate talks have progressed in recent years at what the UN secretary general has called a “snail’s pace”. The sheer complexity of reaching an ambitious international agreement has stymied the negotiations. That is why national legislation should be at the heart of the anticipated new Paris agreement to tackle climate change. A country “commitment” put forward in Paris will be more credible – and durable beyond the next election – if it is backed up by national legislation. And this must ideally be supported by cross-party lawmakers who put in place a credible set of policies and measures to ensure effective implementation, and hold governments to account so Paris delivers. There are good reasons to devolve responsibility to governments to deliver on this vital agenda. In contrast to the slow speed of international negotiations to combat global warming, national legislation is advancing at a very impressive clip.  In a report published in May by the Grantham Institute at the London School of Economics, which covers 98 countries plus the EU states, which together account for 93% of global greenhouse gas emissions, it was revealed that there are more than 800 climate-change laws and policies now in place across the world, rising from 54 in 1997. Since 1997, when the Kyoto Protocol was agreed, the number of such laws and policies has doubled every five years. This fundamental shift in the centre of gravity of the climate change debate is one that few have yet recognised. And it challenges the conventional wisdom that progress on tackling global warming has waned in recent years.  It is thus increasingly clear that the agreement that looks likely to emerge in Paris will be driven by national legislation that is already in place. And implementation of a deal will only be effective through national laws, overseen by well-informed legislators from all sides of the political spectrum. That’s why the 11-point plan drawn up last year by the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, which has 47 member states, calls for formal recognition of national climate legislation in the legally binding part of any Paris agreement. The council’s bottom-up framework, which has been influential in international discussions, also advocates stronger involvement of parliaments so as to advance climate laws, disseminate best practice, build capacity and promote common approaches across countries.  Far from undermining the UN talks process, this bottom-up approach has been a decisive development catalysing the prospect of a new comprehensive global deal in Paris. Advancing domestic measures on global warming and experiencing the benefits of reducing emissions are crucial building blocks that have created the political “window of opportunity” to enable an agreement to now potentially be secured. Many countries now view the response to climate change as one of national self-interest, and growing numbers of nations, across every continent of the world, are trying to maximise the benefits of global warming measures by embracing low-carbon growth and development and to better prepare for the impact of climate change.  This is a big shift from before when much of the political debate on global warming had been framed around narratives of sharing a global burden – with countries often trying to minimise their share. Lawmakers are thus a fundamental part of an effective strategy to tackle the world’s environmental challenges. Along with governments, they can now help co-create, and follow through to implement, what could be a foundation of global sustainable development in coming decades for billions across the world. But lawmakers still have much work to do. As a 30 October report published by the UN has concluded, these national laws, and future commitments that will be made at Paris, are not yet enough to limit global average temperature rise to 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels, the level scientists say we must not breach if we are to avoid the worst risks of global warming. While this is disheartening, these national-level actions are putting into place the legal frameworks necessary to measure, report, verify and manage greenhouse gas emissions. The ambition must therefore be that these national frameworks are replicated in even more countries and ratcheted up in coming years.  Legislators must be at the centre of international negotiations and policy processes. They have shown themselves to be nimble and pioneering at advancing climate measures – and those may prove to be indispensable qualities in the fight against climate change."

"Bonfire night years ago was a cold and frosty time, when trees had lost their leaves. But this November plenty of trees were in full leaf, despite all the wind and rain, and there was an impressive show of autumn colour. This was all thanks to rains earlier in the year that kept trees in good heath, and plenty of sunshine and mild weather in the autumn, with hardly any frost before last weekend’s cold snap.  The absence of frost also kept garden flowers going, and some gardeners will be watching lawns grow lush but remain too wet to cut. It even felt like summer again as wildflowers bloomed – harebell, knapweed, meadow cranesbill, meadow buttercup and vetches. These are plants that usually flower at the height of summer, but they achieved a second flush through November. Perhaps the biggest surprise was some spring flowers also coming out; primroses, wild strawberries, and common dog violets were spotted, and there were even reports of blossom on apple trees and brambles. These had all been hoodwinked by the balmy weather this month. Now the cold snap will have helped kill off many of the flowers and leaves still on the trees. It’s a moot point, whether this amazing autumn has had anything to do climate change, but over the decades autumn changes have been coming later. Tree leaf colours have been arriving later across Europe since the 1980s, and in Britain oak leaves are falling a week later than 30 years ago. All of this has probably been driven by higher temperatures and rising levels of carbon dioxide."

" World “leaders” have been arriving in Paris by the scores over the weekend – there will be more than a hundred prime ministers and presidents making speeches as the climate talks open on Monday.   But most of them won’t, in fact, be leaders on climate. And one who truly is – Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives – will be languishing in a cell on a prison island in his nation, instead of pressing the case for carbon cuts.   Nasheed was the star – almost the only star – of the disastrous Copenhagen climate conference six years ago. Six years ago today he was the first head of state to arrive, and he went straight from the airport to a packed meeting hall where he led a giant crowd in chant after chant. “My message to you is to continue the protests. Continue after Copenhagen. Continue despite the odds. And eventually, together, we will reach that crucial number: Three - five - oh.”  He was electric. A tiny man, he was swallowed up in a sea of TV cameras and boom mikes the second his speech was done, but the crowd didn’t want to let him go. And with good reason. No one had ever before managed to quite sum up the predicament of the front-line states with as much wit and power. Nasheed, for instance, had taught his entire cabinet to scuba dive, so they could hold a formal meeting underwater against the backdrop of a dying coral reef, there to pass a resolution for the UN demanding action to return the planet to an atmosphere of 350 parts per million CO2. He climbed up on the roof of his own presidential house with his own presidential hammer to install solar panels. He pledged that his archipelago nation would become the first on earth to go carbon neutral.  And all around the world people responded. Since the highest point in the Maldivian archipelago is mere meters above sea level, he spoke with a credibility few others could muster.  And he spoke, too, with the credibility that came from fighting for freedom. The Mandela of the Indian Ocean, they called him, after his long struggle to oust the dictator that had ruled the Maldives for three decades. He’d spent five years in prison before forcing the elections that brought him to power, and turned his incredibly beautiful nation into a democracy.  Temporarily, as it turned out. The satraps of the old dictator never gave up, and eventually they pushed him aside in a military coup. Now, as before, he is in prison – the latest reports I’ve heard say his health is failing, and that he’s not been given proper medical attention. Amnesty International and the great human rights lawyer Amal Clooney are doing their best – but they’re up against thugs, pure and simple.  Thugs who, among other things, have abandoned plans for carbon neutrality in the Maldives. Indeed there are reports that the country will open its waters for oil-drilling. Oh, the Maldives will have a presence in Paris this week, and doubtless its “leaders” will speak fine words. But they won’t mean anything. Not like Nasheed’s, anyway, which captivated the world:  “I am not a scientist, but I know that one of the laws of physics, is that you cannot negotiate with the laws of physics. Three – Five – Oh is a law of atmospheric physics. You cannot cut a deal with Mother Nature. And we don’t intend to try.”"
"The world has “come late” to realising the potential devastation of climate change, Prof Tim Flannery says, but the former Australian of the Year believes there is now a global understanding of the need to cut emissions “hard and fast” to avoid calamitous global warming. Flannery, also formerly the chairman of the Copenhagen Climate Council, said world leaders were more committed now to thrashing out a binding global climate agreement than they were at the Copenhagen climate summit five years ago.  The 2009 conference achieved a broad commitment from countries to lower emissions by 2020, but derailed over disagreement between developed and developing countries over the strength of the cuts. The conference was condemned as a failure because countries would not sign a full treaty. Speaking on the sidelines of the Sydney climate change rally on Sunday, Flannery told The Guardian he was more confident the COP21 talks in Paris could achieve strong binding targets.  “People understand the urgency now, people understand how late it is to act, so we’re better prepared. The politicians understand it better, the bureaucrats understand it better.” “People understand the need to cut ‘hard and fast’ now, before it’s too late, and we are locked into something truly catastrophic.” He said while Paris was a vital, and almost final, chance for global leaders to commit to binding targets, it would not be the end of tightening of global emissions. The Paris targets, if met, Flannery said, would bring the world down to a global temperature rise of between 2.7 and 3.5 degrees from pre-industrial levels. This year the global temperature has reached one degree above those levels. World leaders and the UN have posited that global warming must be limited to two degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100, to avoid catastrophic climate change and sea-level rise. But Flannery said, “people are now looking for solutions, and seeing that they can be found”, citing a halving in the cost of solar power since the Copenhagen talks five years ago. “I was heavily involved in Copenhagen as the chairman of the council, and when I used to talk to business they always used to talk about the cost, now when they talk, they talk about the opportunities. That mindset has changed.” A failure to reach binding agreements in Paris would have calamitous climate impacts, felt most acutely in neighbouring Pacific countries, but also domestically: “we would reach the level where the Great Barrier Reef would begin to die”."
"The world can tackle climate change, but time is short. Sweden aims to be one of the world’s first fossil fuel-free welfare nations. With our initiative Fossil-free Sweden, we now challenge other countries to do likewise.  Global warming threatens the very foundation of human wellbeing. Drought, flooding and a less predictable climate hit both agriculture and fisheries hard, thereby threatening access to food for the world’s growing population. Global economic growth is under threat, along with years of work to eradicate poverty.   We believe there is still time to act. If the world phases out the use of fossil energy quickly in favour of renewables, considerable ground will be gained, not only in terms of the climate. A phase-out would lead to greater energy security, better health and improved quality of life. These are co-benefits that have convinced mayors around the world to collaborate and redirect their strategies. Climate action makes good business sense. In areas such as energy, urban development, agriculture and land use, the world needs to invest $90tn over the next 15 years regardless of climate change. At the same time, these sectors are crucial for the global low carbon transition. Greening investments in these sectors would cost less than 5% extra – an increase that can be offset via the co-benefit of reduced fuel consumption alone, according to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.  Then there are all of the other co-benefits to consider and, not least, the enormous estimated global costs of inaction in the face of climate change. Sweden has positive experience of combining emissions reductions with an improved economy and welfare. For many years we have used effective policy levers that put a price on carbon, using a carbon dioxide tax accompanied by political leadership that supports the emergence of climate-smart innovations. This has resulted in reduced emissions and market-based solutions while our economy has grown. But we are not done yet. Sweden recently announced that we will become one of the world’s first fossil-free welfare nations. We are now encouraging others to accept the challenge to see who can go fossil-free first. There are three simple reasons why we should race towards this goal: Rich countries have a duty to take the lead in combating climate change, as established in the UN Convention on Climate Change. Quite simply, some countries are in a more favourable position, and should therefore take a greater share of the responsibility for reducing emissions. In this way, we will do our part to ensure a good future for ourselves, our children and future generations on this planet.  We want Swedish companies to develop the climate-smart solutions that the world is demanding. We must therefore be proactive early-adopters, and not be restrained by yesterday’s technology. The fact that financial market actors have now started to move their investments away from fossil energy is an expression of the same logic. Going green also creates new jobs. According to a recent report from the Club of Rome, a transition to a renewable and resource-efficient society could potentially generate 100,000 new jobs in Sweden alone.  No one country is responsible for such a large proportion of emissions that it alone determines the world’s success or failure on the climate issue. But by leading by example and proving that reduced emissions can be achieved in a way that promotes economic development, individual actors can have an impact on a global scale.  Is this what business wants? The idea of a fossil-free society is embraced by many. There are more and more initiatives around the world in which cities, businesses and organisations are replacing fossil energy with renewables. In Sweden, the business sector, local authorities and other stakeholders are coming together through the Fossil-free Sweden initiative and jointly issuing a challenge to their counterparts around the world. Swedish companies including ABB, IKEA, H&M and Ericsson and Sweden’s major cities are supporting the initiative – and themselves contributing to reduced emissions. Fuel company Preem, which operates petrol stations throughout Sweden, has decided to only offer renewable fuels at its pumps by 2030. The Fourth Swedish National Pension Fund will invest its entire SEK200bn portfolio in low-carbon strategies within five years. Several Swedish towns and cities have decided to go completely fossil-free, and some of them aim to achieve this goal as early as 2030. The world is about to gather for the UN climate conference in Paris. Sweden will be there to enter into an ambitious, fair and durable agreement that binds all countries to further action. We carry with us broad engagement from business and civil society, showing that a fossil-free world is not only necessary, but also sought-after. We hope that many will take us up on our challenge."

"Climate change rallies rolled on across Australia on Sunday, following well attended protests in Melbourne on Friday and Darwin and Brisbane on Saturday. On Sunday, it was the turn of Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide, Hobart and Perth. Australia’s climate-sensitive neighbours in the Pacific were a key focus for the climate change rally in Sydney, with representatives of communities from Pacific nations – including Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati and Tonga – prominent at the front of the march from the Domain to Circular Quay. Dressed in red, they carried signs that read: “2C too late”, “We can’t walk on water”, and “Raise your voice, not sea levels”. Previously, Pacific leaders such as Kiribati’s Anote Tong, and PNG’s Peter O’Neill have implored Australia to be the voice of the Pacific at climate change talks in Paris beginning Monday. More than 40,000 people braved Sydney’s heat for the rally Sunday afternoon, calling on Australia to play a lead role in brokering binding emissions targets for the world to keep global temperature rise below 2C, and to commit to greater domestic emissions cuts than the 26% to 28% the government is currently proposing. Despite the seriousness of the subject matter, the mood of the march was rumbustious, even festive. A salsa band played Arrow’s “Hot, Hot, Hot” all the way down Macquarie Street. Sydney’s lord mayor, Clover Moore, told the march the COP21 meeting beginning in Paris on Monday would be “the most important meeting of our life time”. “On it depends the future of our planet,” she said. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced Australia would contribute $1m towards the establishment of a Commonwealth climate finance access hub, to help small island states access funds for climate mitigation and adaptation. “These countries have asked for assistance in accessing the climate finance they need to effectively deal with climate change,” he said in a statement. The deputy opposition leader and shadow foreign affairs minister, Tanya Plibersek, spoke to reporters before the Sydney rally and said Australia’s contribution to the fund was “pathetically puny” and failed to comprehend the scale or imminence of the Pacific’s climate problem. “Climate change is not a distant future threat for our Pacific neighbours, it is happening right now. You are seeing storm surges washing away coastlines, you are seeing saltwater creeping into fresh water sources, you are seeing drought preventing crops growing properly, making it harder for communities to feed themselves.” Unlike Sydney’s spirited march, it was a very peaceful, family-oriented affair in Canberra, as people brought their children to march with them from Parliament House to the tent embassy, near Old Parliament House. Police estimate about 3,000 people showed up, while protesters think the number was closer to 6,000. Canberrans are fairly cautious about protesting, as many are public servants and are often reluctant to make political statements. One of the coordinators of the event, Emma Robinson from the Conservation Council, said she was not surprised that so many showed up in the capital. “Climate change is and has always been everyone’s business,” she said.  The event was staffed by about 80 volunteers, most of whom were Canberra locals and part of the Conservation Council.  Former chief scientist of Australia, Penny Sackett, said that protests like Sunday’s made people feel as though they were taking action on climate change. “People can become discouraged because it appears as though [political] change does not happen swiftly enough,” she told Guardian Australia.  She said the march was a message from voters to world leaders who are about to meet on climate change in Paris. “We’re watching.” The Perth event started sombrely. At 3.25pm, at least 5,000 people sat in silence in Hay Street Mall to mark people who have lost their lives, homes and livelihoods to the effects of climate change. The group, in their colour blocks, had marched 2km from Wellington Square and stretched the whole 300-metre length, watched by bemused Christmas shoppers clutching plastic bags and taking photos of the crowd. The march was led by a group from the Noongar Whadjuk nation and addressed by Christian, Islamic, Jewish, and Hindu faith leaders.  The aim, Perth assistant bishop Tom Wilmot said, was to show unity and tell political leaders that the will of the people was for change. “We can have prosperity without growth,” Wilmot said. Kevin Jolley, president of the firefighters union of WA, who addressed the crowd in his heavy fire gear, said WA had already seen the devastating impact of climate change in its worsening bushfire seasons. Six people died in bushfires in November, four in fires near Esperance, WA, and two in fires in South Australia.  It’s the deadliest Australian bushfire season since 2009, when 173 people died in the Black Saturday bushfires, and, Jolly said, it was only the start of the southern fire season. “There are no [climate] sceptics at the end of a fire hose,” Jolly said."

"Beijing’s residents have been advised to stay indoors after air pollution in the Chinese capital reached hazardous levels. The warning comes as the governments of more than 190 nations gather in Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change. China, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, is suffering from serious air pollution, largely attributed to smog from coal-fired power plants. The onset of winter and the need for more heating of homes means the problem has intensified in the capital, which has an estimated population of 20 million.  At noon on Saturday, the US embassy in Beijing reported the level of the poisonous, tiny articles of PM2.5 at 391 micrograms per cubic metre.  The World Health Organisation considers the safe level to be 25 micrograms per cubic metre of the particulates. Since Friday, the city had been shroud in grey smog, reducing visibilities to a few hundred metres. The ministry of environmental protection has forecast severe pollution for the greater Beijing region, as well as the west part of Shandong and the northern part of Henan until Tuesday, when strong winds from the north are expected to blow away air pollutants. The ministry has advised the public to stay indoors. Residents of Beijing posted photographs of the pollution on Twitter.  Authorities blame coal burning for winter heating as a major culprit for the air pollution. The ministry said it had sent teams to check on illegal emissions by factories in several northern Chinese cities. In the past, authorities have shut down factories and pulled half of the vehicles off the roads to curb pollution. But such drastic measures are disruptive and only used when Beijing feels it needs to present a better image to the world, such as hosting major global leaders and events. Earlier this month, air pollution reached almost 50 times above the recommended levels in Shenyang, in the country’s north-east.  On 9 November, levels of PM2.5 reached 1,157 micrograms per cubic metre in the city, reducing visibility to as little as 100 metres. Officials said the dangerous smog was caused by a surge in coal-fired electricity use, as the region’s central heating systems kick into gear for winter."
"We, the creative community as represented by the signatories below, ask all those responsible for negotiating the post-2020 climate change framework to agree an ambitious and inspiring international agreement. The creative community – design, broadcasting, publishing, film, gaming, fashion, literature, music, the performing and visual arts, galleries and museums – can make a unique contribution to the global sustainability challenge. Collectively we shape not just our material world, but our conceptual world too, including the values that underpin our lives. The creative industries generate wealth and employment but we also innovate, we shape and express cultural values, influencing how people feel and the choices they make: as such we have huge potential to prompt, and reinforce, positive and sustainable change.  We are deeply concerned that our global economic and industrial systems are accelerating rates of extinction, desertification and soil depletion, degrading ecosystems, acidifying and littering our rivers and oceans, and resulting in a relentless rise in greenhouse gas emissions driving irreversible climate change. In short, we are overwhelming the planet’s life-support systems. The outcomes of the COP21 climate change conference and the political decisions taken over the next months will determine many of the long-term conditions that will affect us today and for many generations to come. In combining our collective strengths, the creative community will amplify world leaders’ commitments to positive change and strengthen the implementation of good policy decisions those leaders make now. An international policy framework with a long-term and realistic goal of limiting greenhouse gas emissions below 2C of warming will give us the confidence to deploy our considerable energy towards a sustainable and equitable future. A healthy creative community relies on collaboration. Using this as a first principle for action we will: • Take action ourselves to make our businesses and our industries more sustainable, actively managing our impacts.• Speak out to our audiences and customers, using our creative voices to affect the public narrative and create social consensus for action on climate change and environmental degradation.• Work together to influence and support policymakers who have the capacity to accelerate positive change, to make the right decisions.• Take a leadership role with a cultural mandate for action, which exceeds the commitments of governments.• Do what we do best and use our creativity and our collaborative culture to help find, and scale, solutions to global environmental challenges. We ask Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change and Laurent Fabius, foreign minister of France and president of COP21, to agree to a comprehensive, binding international framework agreement on greenhouse gas emissions reductions, with mechanisms to assess, review and revise commitments over the long term. We ask for: • An ambitious commitment to climate action, starting now, that will limit future global warming to below 2C relative to pre-industrial levels.• A legally robust and accountable global climate governance framework and implementation strategy that we will be able to support.• Realistic delivery timetables which account for the long term and which enable us to invest in future-focused and collaborative creative practice.• Financial mechanisms to stimulate extensive infrastructure for poorer nations to support them in achieving their reduction commitments while permitting equitable development.• Significant investment in low carbon infrastructures which we can champion and deploy.• Alignment with the sustainable development goals. We understand the gravity of climate change and the historic opportunity represented by COP21. We will come together and intensify our efforts, but we need you to give us confidence in a sustainable future, to share our ambition, and recognise our capacity to strengthen your leadership. We must, we can, and together we will act on climate change.Wil-Dog Abers Musician, OzomatliRoy Ackerman MD Pulse FilmsAckroyd and Harvey ArtistsSidsel Agensø ActorDamon Albarn MusicianKarina Albers

"The growth of global carbon emissions virtually stalled last year after a decade of rising rapidly, figures published on Wednesday show, just days before world leaders meet in Paris for international talks on climate change. The slowdown in the growth of the emissions that have caused record-breaking heat in recent years was largely down to China, which bucked its trend of ever-increasing coal use, the Netherlands environment agency said. Chinese emissions went up 0.9% in 2014, the same amount as the US, as it used more gas for heating. India’s emissions jumped by 7.8% while the European Union’s emissions dropped by an “unprecedented” 5.4%, but the Indian increase was the largest contributor to global emissions growth in 2014 and effectively cancelled out the EU fall. Together, the four are the world’s biggest emitters, covering 61% of global emissions. Worldwide emissions increased by just 0.5% in 2014, compared to 1.5% the year before, 0.8% in 2012 and an average of 4% a year over the previous decade, when emissions grew dramatically. The slowdown last year occurred despite the global economy growing by 3%, suggesting a “decoupling” between GDP and emissions. The agency, which is considered one of the world’s top authorities on emissions data, said it appeared the world was moving into a new period of slower growth in emissions. “It is likely that the very high global annual emission growth rates, as observed in the years 2003 to 2011, will not be seen in the coming years,” it said in a statement. The findings from the environment agency go some way to explaining the negotiating positions that countries and blocs are expected to take in Paris next Monday.  While the EU, US and China are all strongly backing an ambitious climate deal, India was accused at recent G20 talks in Turkey of holding back progress towards a Paris treaty. The EU’s climate chief, Miguel Arias Canete, told reporters in Brussels that the EU would resist any moves to lower the world’s sights in Paris.  “When you have 196 parties, the easy way out is to agree a minimalistic agreement,” he said on Wednesday. “We will work day and night to have an ambitious agreement that is fit for purpose.” The EU wants to see a legally enforceable protocol that is subject to five-yearly reviews. Canete argued that this would prevent backsliding and provide a mechanism to ramp up climate pledges until the world is on a pathway to global warming of no more than 2C.  Emissions-cutting offers currently on the Paris table would put the world on course for 3C of global warming, according to EU estimates. Scientists believe this could trigger a dangerous escalation of climate instability. “We have to make the 2C [target] operational in the protocol,” Canete said. “We must enshrine it as a global binding objective for all parties.” “This is not something discretionary or a political decision,” he said. “It is science-based.” The bloc is also pushing for a binding benchmark emissions target for 2050. "
"Did he, perchance, know what was coming? On Monday, two days before chancellor George Osborne produced his spending review, Conservative mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith wrote prominently in the London Evening Standard of discussions he’d been having with senior police officers, Boris Johnson, home secretary Theresa May and the chancellor himself about the need to protect that amorphous law and order construct “the front line”. Transport and housing, he rightly pointed out, are vital issues for Londoners too. Moreover, they are linked. “One unlocks the other,” he correctly wrote. “Crossrail 2 alone could facilitate 200,000 new homes by better connecting outer and inner London.” That is why, he concluded, “it is essential that TfL’s investment programmes are not curtailed.”   Goldsmith pointed out, not for the first time, that Transport for London (TfL) and other public bodies own large quantities of brownfield land on which new homes should be built and he re-stated his now-familiar ambition to “regenerate” borough-owned housing estates built in the post-war decades. More money should be spent on this, he declared.  You will never believe what happened on Wednesday. Not only did Osborne announce there would be no cuts to the police budget after all, he also increased TfL’s investment funding from a previously-announced £10bn to £11bn until 2019/20 and pledged to “regenerate more run-down estates.”  He also said that some of money raised from a new, 3% higher stamp duty rate to be levied from next April on purchasers of buy-to-let properties and second homes will be invested in “local communities in London” and elsewhere “which are being priced out of home ownership”. And he revealed an enhanced government scheme with the same goal in mind: “London help to buy” will enable people who can raise a deposit of 5% of the price of a newly-built home to get an interest-free loan worth “up to 40%” of its value.  “My honourable friend the member for Richmond Park has been campaigning on affordable home ownership in London,” Osborne said. “Today, we back him all the way.”  Yes! He was backing Zac!  Within hours, Goldsmith was hailing the splendid deal that he and fellow London Tories had hammered out with the chancellor, fulfilling the very hopes he had expressed in his Standard article.  You’ve got to hand it to Goldsmith. He is preposterously privileged but not too posh to push his shoulder against an open door - there is, of course, no way Osborne wasn’t going to deliver what he had asked for in the Tory-friendly London newspaper. But you’ve got to acknowledge, too, that the headline point Goldsmith made in his Standard piece is true: “To deliver for London, its mayor must work with the government.”  It is a truth upon which much of his mayoral campaign platform looks set to be built. As Goldsmith underlined, the capital’s mayors depend heavily on cash from central government to get things done: only 7% of the taxes raised in the city are retained by its own layers of government, whose representatives must lobby, much like ministers, over the size of the portion of what it exports it gets back.  His foreground case is that he has the independent spirit and negotiating will to extract what London needs. The supplementary message is that he, a Conservative, is more likely to get it from a Conservative government scheduled to be in power throughout the next mayoral term than a Labour mayor in the form of Sadiq Khan. It is a case that Khan will need to counter. Osborne has helped Goldsmith to make doing so a bigger challenge. Khan has dubbed the mayoral contest a “referendum” on Tory housing policy. If so, Goldsmith will hope that Osborne has just bought him a bunch of votes from the “priced out”.  Critics say that the chancellor’s measures changes are of completely the wrong sort and, in any case, don’t add up to much. But the higher the prices of houses in the capital rise, the greater the longing to own one becomes: scores of would-be buyers are still crowding in to dowdy terraces in Plaistow. Goldsmith can now proclaim that he’s talked Osborne into improving their chances of scrambling on to first rung of “the ladder.”  He also told his Standard readers that he is “working to secure” a guarantee from the government that “at least two low-cost homes” are built in London for every council house sold to pay for the extended right-to-buy provisions of the Housing [and Planning] Bill. That endeavour too is likely to bear fruit, which Goldsmith hopes will be saleable. Khan may need to persuade voters that it’s rot. The Tory candidate will also claim credit for the Met’s budget not being cut even if, post-Paris, it would have been reprieved anyway. As for transport funding, while Osborne has handed out more than expected to TfL for now, which should take of big investment programmes like the Tube upgrades, Crossrail and so on, he has also set about taking away its operational subsidy earlier than previously advertised.  Grants for the day-to-day running of services will be phased out by 2018, two years earlier than TfL had anticipated. That means more upward pressure sooner on public transport fares, which Khan has promised to freeze for a full, four-year mayoral term. Get ready for a Goldsmith assault on that pledge’s credibility. Khan, with characteristic energy, has spent the weeks since becoming Labour candidate cannily building his defences against obvious lines of attack and getting himself known. Goldsmith, by contrast, has seemed fairly quiet. But now his campaign pitch is taking shape - with the help of some influential friends. "
"Britain will enter the Paris climate change talks this week with its credentials as a responsible, low-emission power generator in tatters. That is the stark conclusion of one of the country’s leading energy experts, Professor Stuart Haszeldine of Edinburgh University. Haszeldine believes George Osborne’s last-minute decision to axe the government’s £1bn support for a scheme to capture and bury carbon dioxide emissions from power stations was a final act that utterly undermined British negotiators’ status in Paris. The news of the carbon storage cutback, released after the chancellor’s autumn statement last week, arrived in the wake of other major cuts over the past year in renewable energy programmes, including solar power, wind energy and home insulation projects. Several companies, including Royal Dutch Shell and South of Scotland Electricity, had invested more than £100m developing technology for use at two carbon-storage projects in Scotland and Yorkshire. Carbon dioxide was going to be extracted from power station emissions, liquefied and pumped into underground chambers – until the government halted funding for the project. Haszeldine described the decision as “a betrayal” that desperately weakened the influence of the UK as a nation that was serious about halting climate change. “Among the lessons from this disastrous reputation failure, and time-wasting and money-wasting failure, must be that energy policy and infrastructure delivery is too important to be left to short-term politicians,” said Haszeldine, a geologist and an expert on carbon storage. Britain is considered well placed to develop carbon storage. It has considerable engineering expertise, while its depleted North Sea oilfields could act as perfect storage sites for carbon dioxide extracted from power station emissions. The fact that Britain has abandoned this approach only days before negotiators from 190 countries arrive in Paris to discuss climate change is all the more striking and was probably made to find money to avoid making cuts in tax credits, for police funding and for Syrian bombing, said Haszeldine. “It certainly shows where the government’s priorities lie.” These views will be echoed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Sunday when he accuses the Tory government of refusing to take a lead in moving the world away from its growing fossil fuel consumption. The Labour leader will speak at the London climate march, one of dozens being held around the world to pressure politicians to reach a deal in Paris. “There are no more hugs for the husky, instead it’s a passionate embrace for the carbon polluters,” he will say, referring to the image of David Cameron posing with a sled dog on a trip to the Arctic in 2006. At the time Cameron pledged a future Tory government would be Britain’s greenest. Since then, his governments have destroyed “the solar industry, removed vital safeguards to reduce the risks of fracking, cancelled support for carbon capture and storage, and cut support for wind turbines,” Corbyn will say. In another climate protest in London, activists on Saturday night occupied part of Tate Britain gallery where they started to tattoo each other in protest over the gallery’s acceptance of sponsorship from BP. The Tate said it had closed the 1840s gallery where 35 activists had set themselves up. Alice Bell, a spokesperson for Liberate Tate, the group that is leading the protest, said they were making “a statement about the stain that oil has across society, on the Tate, on the negotiations and across our culture, society and economics more broadly.”"
"It was December 2009. I remember sitting on a plane on my way to Copenhagen. I wondered if this would be the historic moment when the world came to its senses. There was hope in the air. Indeed, I was greeted by stickers on the subway that renamed Denmark’s capital “Hopenhagen”. I smiled.  There was widespread anticipation – nurtured frantically by the host nation – that the UN-sponsored climate summit (COP 15) would be “historic”. That the impasse on global climate change would be broken. That major CO2 emitters – the US, EU, China, India – would agree on a meaningful binding agreement that would (a) limit their emissions, (b) support developing countries in their transition to low-emission futures, and (c) create a mechanism to assist vulnerable countries in coping with the costs of adaptation and climatic disasters that, by then, had already become inevitable. That, of course, did not happen. Today I am again on a plane, on my way to Paris for COP 21. This time, I am not holding my breath. Not smiling. The hype around Paris is not dissimilar to what one remembers before Copenhagen. Except the aspiration is even lower, the proposals less bold. The scientific consensus on the threats posed by climate change even more definitive. And the interests of developing countries even more marginalised. I am not a cynic – just old. Old enough to remember the dashed hopes of Kyoto (COP 3, 1997), the purposeful energy of Berlin (COP 1, 1995), the naïve optimism of Rio de Janeiro in 1992 where the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) was first adopted, and even the calls for urgency when the negotiation process was first launched by the United Nations in 1990. Most of all, I am old enough to realise that 11 December, when the Paris COP 21 officially ends, will mark to the day the 25th anniversary of the start of these negotiations. Let that fact sink in: we have now been talking about an international agreement for a quarter of a century. We have no agreement. And there is none in sight. One has to wonder if all the hot air that has been generated by all this talk was worth the carbon cost of all our globe-trotting to these COPs. Yet, talk is all that is on offer at Paris. Any mention of a “binding” agreement is squashed as being unrealistic, given the peculiar sensibilities of the US Congress. The sensitivities of the European Union, especially hosts France, to another Copenhagen-style failure have conspired to produce a constant ratcheting down of aspiration. Instead, we are told to put faith in the ridiculously named INDCs – the intended nationally determined contributions. Major emitters were adamant that they could not make any “commitments” or “pledges”. Those, of course, sound like things that have to be actually done. “Intentions”, on the other hand, are fungible. They are voluntary, even optional. Some INDCs do, indeed, make bold claims. But, in many cases, we are expected to believe that countries that chose to not fulfil their binding Kyoto commitments will now be faithful to these voluntary intentions. In other cases, the intention is kicked so much into the future or riddled with so many caveats as to become meaningless. Meanwhile, in the real world, emissions continue to pile on and impacts stack. Many of the most vulnerable countries have such low emissions of their own that they can do nothing themselves to remedy the problem that they did nothing to cause. For example, my own country, Pakistan, contributes less than 1% of global emissions, but is a frontline vulnerable state. Melting glaciers, messed-up monsoons, intense heat waves, erratic and severe floods: these are not just projections for the future, these are realities Pakistan is already having to adapt to. Research suggests that by 2040, agriculture productivity could drop by 8-10%; by 2050, the cost of adaptation could be as high as $14bn a year. Vulnerable developing nations need climate change to stabilise at 1.5C or less. The INDCs cannot deliver that. Vulnerable nations worry most about adaptation – and adaptation is already marginalised on the COP 21 agenda. I am on my way to Paris. I still hold hope, but not much. Without a binding agreement, without a relentless focus on limiting climate change to 1.5C, all that Paris offers is more talk. For that, it is already too late. It is time for action, Paris friends. Not empty promises."
"Environmental campaigners have accused ministers of bypassing local democracy after the government said it would have the final say on controversial plans for fracking in Lancashire whatever the recommendation of a local planning inspector.  An application by energy company Cuadrilla to drill for shale gas at two sites in Lancashire had been due to be decided at a planning appeal in February. But the communities and local government department has intervened by saying the secretary of state, Greg Clark, will make the final decision because of the national importance of the schemes.  Labour has accused the government of trying to impose fracking on local communities. In a letter to the council, sent on Clark’s behalf, the department said: “The secretary of state hereby directs that he shall determine these appeals instead of an inspector.” The letter, published by the Blackpool Gazette, reads: “The reason for this direction is because the drilling appeals involve proposals for exploring and developing shale gas which amount to proposals for development of major importance having more than local significance and proposals which raise important or novel issues of development control, and/or legal difficulties.” Cuadrilla is appealing against a decision in June by Lancashire county council to refuse its plans to frack for shale. The appeal will still go ahead but planning inspector Wendy McKay will now make a recommendation to Clark rather than a ruling in the dispute. The government decided in August to fast-track planning applications for fracking operations if local authorities threaten to block them. Industry and the government have been frustrated at the slow rate of progress on exploratory fracking for shale gas and oil in the UK after David Cameron said last year the government esd “going all out for shale”. The shadow energy secretary, Lisa Nandy, said: “It’s hypocritical for ministers to support devolution and local democracy for decision-making over windfarms, only to then trample over the views of local communities when it comes to fracking. The government has completely failed to win public support for these drilling projects, which is not surprising as they abandoned important environmental safeguards. By seeking to impose fracking, public concern is only likely to deepen.” Donna Hume, senior energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, accused the government of pursuing fracking whatever the cost. She said: “The fact that Lancashire council’s rejection of fracking could now be overturned by central government is a slap in the face to local democracy and the thousands of people in the county who strongly opposed it. “For those who live in areas also under the threat of fracking, there will be extreme concern that any carefully considered local decision could be reversed by a government intent on pursuing fracking at any cost.” She added: “With mounting evidence that drilling for shale gas risks impacting on people’s health, polluting the natural environment and causing more climate change, it is only right that decisions are made locally by those who have to live with the consequences.” Cuadrilla said Clark’s intervention was “part of a long established planning process … We look forward to presenting our case at the public inquiry commencing in February.” Greenpeace UK’s energy campaigner, Hannah Martin, said: “The same minister who told local councils they should be ‘masters of their own destiny’ could now overthrow one of the most important and difficult decisions Lancashire councillors have ever made.”"
"Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has encouraged other Commonwealth leaders to send a powerful signal to other nations that strong climate change action is needed.  Turnbull was speaking at Friday’s special climate change session at the Commonwealth leaders’ summit in Malta, also attended by special guests French president Francois Holland and UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon. On Sunday, Turnbull flies to Paris for the key COP21 summit aimed at achieving a global accord on tackling climate change and reducing carbon emissions. He urged those around the table on Friday to sign up to the Commonwealth leaders’ climate change statement. “Ahead of COP21 it is a powerful signal to other countries of the world to show a similar level of ambition and commitment to working together for a strong result in Paris,” he said. Turnbull announced an Australian contribution of $1m to the Commonwealth climate finance access hub to be based in Mauritius. The hub will help the least-developed countries and small island developing states including those in the Pacific to access funds for environmental projects in response to climate change. Turnbull said Australia would join the working group to explore the Commonwealth’s $US1bn ($A1.38bn) green finance facility initiative, also aimed at developing nations. Hollande told reporters after the climate change session that what he sought in Paris was “a binding agreement, a universal agreement, one that is ambitious”. “Man is the worst enemy of man. We can see it with terrorism,” he said, after flying in from Paris where he led ceremonies on Friday to remember the victims of the 13 November terror attacks in the city. “But we can say the same when it comes to climate. Human beings are destroying nature, damaging the environment. “It is therefore for human beings to face up to their responsibilities for the good of future generations.” Ban said he was encouraged by the “strong commitment” shown by Commonwealth leaders to tackle climate change. Earlier in the day, avowed republican Turnbull met the Queen and exchanged pleasantries with her. The pair met at a luncheon for new Commonwealth leaders hosted by the Queen at Malta’s San Anton Palace on Friday."
