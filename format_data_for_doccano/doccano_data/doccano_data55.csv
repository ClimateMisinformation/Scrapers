"The car is where I’ve discovered most about my parenting. There was that time when I, a very young father, oh-so-briefly and absentmindedly left Number One Daughter in her baby capsule on the roof of the clapped-out Morris. It all turned out fine. So much so that she is now about to have her own child. And there was the time when Number One Son, aged about two, bellowed from the back of the car, “Ahh fuck – you idiot!” I’d just slammed on the brakes, inspiring him to speak with perfect intonation in precise mimicry of ... words I may have previously uttered from behind the wheel in a similar situation. Which brings me to something Number Two Daughter, a nearly-teen, said in the car a few months ago. “Mum and Dad – I don’t want you to be upset at this or anything,” she began. She had our attention. “Yes?” came our chorus. She continued, “OK and when I talk about you in what I’m about to say I don’t actually mean you personally – I mean your generation. OK?” “Yes ... ” “Well, you’re wrecking the world for my generation. The world is more unsafe than when you were kids, more and more species are going extinct, there are more refugees and the world is meaner to them, there are more wars, there’s more terrorism and more racism and you haven’t stopped climate change. No offence – but it’s true. You’re ruining the world.” Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday For good measure she also threw in something about being priced out of the housing market. It’s impossible to overstate quite how devastating this was. Devastating – because it’s mostly true. Those of us gen Xers in our early to mid-50s inhabit a world that is vastly more dangerous and uncertain than the one we were bequeathed. Us gen X men were the first generation since federation not to be forced or urged to go to war. We all had free tertiary education, stable government, a strong national and global economy, reasonable job prospects and security and, despite ridiculous interest rates in the mid-1980s, every prospect of owning our own homes. In the 1980s our chief global concern was nuclear Armageddon at the tail end of the cold war. Today the daily threat might be China, Iran or North Korea, with the constant, of course, given the bellicosity and unpredictability of Trump, always America. Many Australian conservatives let slip much about their fears of a Trump White House as the beast roared on its way up – his hatred of women and minorities, his temperamental unsuitability, in short all of the things our children so easily identified and empathetically condemned as they would the schoolyard bully. My daughter and her friends talk of Trump constantly as a present and future threat to their world. Meanwhile, toxic nationalism, in Australia and elsewhere, is more potent than it has been since the world wars, manifesting here in even greater oppression and marginalisation of Indigenous people, and the political vilification of asylum seekers and their banishment to earthy hell. The militarisation of Australian history and culture continues apace at the expense of gentler, more thoughtful forms of patriotism. Terrorism was frightening for us, though largely in the abstract – a thing that mostly happened elsewhere, and quite rarely, rather than the global and domestic threat it is for our kids. It did not cross our minds when we boarded a plane, attended a big public event – or walked through a mall in the city. The early science was there for us on climate change and ozone depletion. Governments needed little convincing of their reality and had begun to act. The change was not deliberately contorted, like today, as a matter of belief (despite the science) that divides politics, media and society – and delivers a status quo of stalemate between enlightenment and darkness that bequeaths to our young bleaching reefs, vanishing species and rising sea levels. Some parents go to great lengths to shield their children from the worst realities of the world – war, famine, the threat of global warming, toxic racism, terrorism. We’d never tried – or wanted – to do that. The days have always began and ended in our homes with radio news and current affairs. There have always (until recently) been daily newspapers, and family conversation has inevitably included a fair amount of domestic and geopolitics. We wanted to raise informed, socially and politically engaged, and caring, young people. We have tried, as parents and as people engaged with the world, who want to make it and this country better, to argue our causes. Some days there are wins. Others, it feels like progress is stuck in a morass beyond our control, at the whim of those at the very top of the power tree. I inherited a better world, indeed, a better Australia, than my mother and father. But were I gone tomorrow, I doubt my kids would say the same about their parents. But I’m not done yet – and I heard everything Number Two Daughter said in the car that day. The one thing I did not hear was any hint of fear. She sounded defiant and courageous. But never afraid. Perhaps that’s one of the things we did get right. • Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist"
"At some point in June, the Australian government will announce it has spent up to $2.3bn over three years on a scheme that the prime minister believes is a reckless waste of public money. That is not how it will be expressed. If the past is a guide, the government is likely to quietly issue an understated press release saying the latest auction of the emissions reduction fund – the scheme better known as Direct Action, which the former environment minister Greg Hunt described as the centrepiece of Australia’s efforts to tackle climate change – has been a success.  However, the specifics of how the money is to be spent will be all but impenetrable to most people.  First, a recap: Hunt hastily conceived Direct Action over the summer of 2009-10 after Tony Abbott pipped Malcolm Turnbull by a vote in a ballot for the Liberal leadership, having run on a platform of quasi-climate scepticism and withdrawing Coalition support for requiring big polluters to pay for the carbon dioxide they emitted. With Kevin Rudd a popular first-term leader, Abbott becoming prime minister seemed a remote possibility. But he proved a brutally effective opposition leader, Labor imploded and the 2013 election was a blue-tied landslide. Hunt set about implementing a $2.55bn policy that, even within the Coalition, many thought unlikely to ever be legislated. It would have been cheaper if the government negotiated to buy the land rather than pay landowners to protect it. The emissions reduction fund pays farmers and businesses to cut carbon dioxide emissions below what they would have otherwise been. It does this through a reverse auction – people nominate how cheaply they believe they can reduce emissions and bureaucrats choose the cheapest bids. The government buys carbon credits from the successful projects once emissions cuts are verified.  According to the scheme’s architect, it is great value for money. In the run up to the landmark Paris climate conference in 2015, Hunt said early auction results were “stunning”. He looked forward to telling the United Nations meeting about how Australia had built “one of the most effective systems in the world for significantly reducing emissions” that would meet our recently announced 2030 target, a cut of at least 26% cut below 2005 levels. Turnbull described it another way. While on the backbench, he observed that Direct Action would involve billions of taxpayers’ dollars being spent paying farmers to create offsets so industry could freely pollute, a plan he described as “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale”. He noted that, from Abbott and Hunt’s perspective, the policy at least had the virtue that it could be easily scrapped if climate change proved not real, or if the rest of the world was doing nothing about it. Today, the evidence of the impact of climate change continues to mount, the world has made significant, though inadequate, commitments to address the problem, and the emissions reduction fund rolls on. It has now been Turnbull government policy longer than it was Abbott government policy. The Clean Energy Regulator, which runs the fund for the government, has signed contracts to buy credits equivalent to 191.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide over the next decade or so – about 3% of what Australia is expected to emit in that time. About 30.5m have been acquitted so far.  But national emissions, which fell between 2012 and 2014 under the carbon price scheme introduced by Labor and the Greens and abolished by the Coalition, are tracking upwards year-on-year. A thinktank analysis late last year found Australia was the only wealthy country where emissions from energy combustion were at a record high. Though it continues, the government’s enthusiasm for its self-described main climate policy has visibly waned since Turnbull returned to the leadership in 2015. The “Direct Action” label has disappeared from the government’s lexicon. Frydenberg does not spruik the emissions reduction fund’s wares with Hunt’s brio, and its notional funding has been slashed. In the dying months of Abbott’s prime ministership, he and Hunt promised it would be topped up with $200m a year between 2018 and 2030, lifting public spending on offsets to nearly $5bn. But there was nothing for it over the next four years in the recent budget. While political and media attention has fallen away, projects being bankrolled by the emissions reduction fund may become increasingly important in the years ahead assuming the government is successful in negotiating into life its plan for the electricity sector – the national energy guarantee, or Neg. As proposed, it would allow electricity retailers to buy carbon offsets as an alternative to reducing emissions, potentially creating a larger secondary market beyond the government for farmers and businesses to sell the credits they generate. Big polluters covered by the other part of Direct Action – what the government calls the “safeguard mechanism”, which was promised to stop industrial emissions increasing emissions to wipe out the cuts the government is paying for – are already using the offsets in small amounts. Two questions, then: what are taxpayers getting for their billions? And how robust are the projects that are counted as emissions cuts? About 80% of projects with contracts under the emissions reduction fund are in the rugby league states north of the Murray. The overwhelming majority of those are in a corridor of land between Cobar in western New South Wales and Quilpie in south-western Queensland and involve restoring or protecting plant life. Vegetation projects – regenerating degraded habitat, tree-planting and “avoided deforestation” schemes in which landowners are paid to not clear their land – are expected to deliver two-thirds of the cuts promised to date.  Using these projects to create offsets isn’t a new idea. Many existed under the Carbon Farming Initiative introduced under Labor in 2011. The notable difference between the parties is who pays for the credits. Under Labor, they would have been mostly sold to business. Under the Coalition, it is taxpayers who have been doing the buying. The regeneration projects have broad support – few would argue that they do not perform valuable work or store carbon dioxide. University of Queensland research fellow Megan Evans found they can have not just environmental benefits, but be good for regional communities, bringing investment and jobs. However, some critics have questioned what happens after the “permanence period” – either 100 or 25 years, depending on the contract, in which the land must not be cleared. As the law stands, bulldozers could come out as soon as the period is up. Equally, fire or drought could sweep through at any point and release what has been protected. Yet supporters believe that once a market is established, the rationale to use carbon farming to make marginal land profitable will continue. Avoided deforestation projects, which have been signed up to deliver 26m tonnes and – based on the average $11.90 per tonne of carbon dioxide paid under the scheme – could receive more than $300m of public money, are more contentious. They rely on a counterfactual though – it is impossible to know if a landowner ever really intended to clear the land. Tim Baxter, a legal academic with the Australian-German Climate and Energy College, doubts many with government contracts did. He says some landowners had permits to clear their land for more than eight years before registering with the fund. At the other end of the scale, one project received a permit to clear just 49 days before registering. “Both raise serious questions,” he says. Thinktank the Green Institute looked at the cost per hectare and found that it would have been far cheaper in most cases if the government negotiated to buy the land rather than pay landowners to protect it. But early evidence from satellite data suggests avoided deforestation projects could be making a difference. In an analysis published by the government’s Climate Change Authority, academics Megan Evans and Andrew Macintosh found a steep decline in deforestation in western NSW since 2012, while other parts of the state showed little change in land-clearing rates. Evans did say, however, it was a desktop analysis only and it is not yet clear what has caused the decline. About half of all outback vegetation abatement projects are being managed by the Sydney-based environmental markets company Green Collar. Its chief executive and co-founder, James Schultz, says the methods used to estimate the emissions reductions from avoided deforestation and habitat regeneration projects are based on conservative assessments of what drove changes in land-clearing rates in the past, such as commodity prices and input costs. “The method doesn’t pretend to say ‘this is a precise estimate of exactly what happens with clearing over every square inch of every property’,” he says. “They’re all estimates. The important thing is the estimate is well within the margins of what we think happens in the real world. They’re all going to be under-estimates of what is delivered.” While it is necessarily imperfect, Schultz says Australia’s carbon offsets scheme is world-class and rigorously policed. “We do hundreds of audits a year and then the Clean Energy Regulator does spot audits across the top of that,” he says.  According to Baxter, a glaring omission from the rules is the impact of climate change itself. Australia’s scientific agencies suggest that, under the goals of the Paris conference, western NSW is projected to be on average 2.3 degrees warmer and have 8% less rainfall by 2100, a shift that would make it more akin to outback Queensland. “The difference between the closed woodlands of Bourke and the open woodlands of its future is a loss of approximately half its foliage cover – and a commensurate loss of carbon stored in the forests,” Baxter says. “The law doesn’t deal with that.”  An arguably larger question hangs over landfill sites that receive credits for capturing and combusting methane that leaks from decomposing rubbish. As revealed by Guardian Australia, an independent expert committee has recommended the government not extend contracts with sites that use the methane to generate electricity as they are what economist Paul Burke calls “anyway” projects – they would have existed without the fund and have a viable revenue stream from selling electricity and renewable energy certificates. This has been a long-standing criticism of landfill gas projects, dating back to their inclusion in earlier schemes. Critics say it means they are creating “junk” credits that do not reflect additional emissions cuts. Frydenberg is yet to say whether he will accept the committee’s advice. Less employed emission reduction fund methods – including supermarkets installing new lighting systems and companies reducing pollution from vehicle fleets – have also drawn flak. Burke, from the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, says the fund should never have been extended to include industrial emitters, energy or transport as there were more effective ways to cut emissions in those parts of the economy – some form of carbon price, for example. “I don’t think it’s a good idea for the Australian public to be paying for Coles and Woolies to change their lights,” he says. As Turnbull has pointed out, in Australia the offsets scheme is the policy. And it is barely making a dent. Added up, it is difficult to know what taxpayers are getting for their investment. There has been surprisingly little academic research into what it is delivering. Some insiders privately say the Clean Energy Regulator does not do enough to ensure the projects they sign contracts with will be able to deliver, pointing particularly to the experimental techniques involved in storing carbon in soil. Even supporters believe as designed it is unlikely to deliver the cuts the government has promised. What is clear is that there is little support inside and outside government for using taxpayers’ money to offset a fraction of Australia’s growing emissions. An offset scheme is generally used in conjunction with other policies to help make cuts as cheap as possible for those having to make them. As Turnbull has pointed out, in Australia the offsets scheme is the policy. And it is barely making a dent. The most recent greenhouse gas data shows pollution is up in every sector of the economy that gets money from the emissions reduction fund. Deforestation is outstripping habitat restoration by a rate of five-to-one based on government data. Emissions from waste, agriculture and big industry all rose last year. Recent auctions indicate industry interest has slumped, in part because the government seems indifferent to the scheme. James Schultz, whose company is perhaps the greatest beneficiary under the emissions reduction fund, is among those who wants the government to change tack. “I’m a strong advocate for a more pure market-based mechanism,” he says. “It is just not economically efficient to have the taxpayer pay for it rather than private industry.” The only sector in which there has been a fall in emissions is the one not covered by the emissions reduction fund – electricity, due to the closure of some coal-fired power. Electricity is also the area where there are obvious steps being taken to introduce a policy. The government wants to bring in a Neg with a target of a 26% cut by 2030 – a level scientists say is far short of what is needed in the power sector. Some analysis has suggested this goal would be reached regardless given the pace of the transition under way.  The government is also moving to make changes to the safeguard mechanism that covers big industrial emitters. Currently, polluters are set an emissions limit – known as a baseline – at the highest level they emitted between 2009 and 2014. Though the scheme is supposed to stop emissions rising, companies can apply to get a higher baseline. This freedom to increase emissions without penalty did not stop 16 industrial sites breaching their baseline last year and having to hand in millions of dollars-worth of carbon credits, mostly bought from emissions reduction fund projects – a sign that Australia has an operational carbon market, albeit a small one. The government is now considering making the safeguard mechanism less tied to historic emissions. A climate policy review released in December suggested emission limits could be loosened so they “increase with production, supporting business growth”. This has widely been interpreted as letting companies emit more without penalty. Insiders say an effective reboot of the scheme could also be used to tighten the baselines for the majority of polluters that are now emitting below – sometimes well below – their historic highs. It would prevent these businesses being able to argue in future that they should be given free carbon credits for beating an outdated historic baseline and selling them to polluting companies that are breaching their limit. Those familiar with the thinking say there may also be a shift in the way the baseline is expressed from total emissions to emissions intensity – that is, how much a company emits for each widget it makes. This would allow emissions at a site to “increase with production” as the government has promised without immediately blowing out the baseline. This could leave industrial emissions soaring unchecked. But it is also being interpreted as potentially laying the groundwork for a future emissions intensity scheme – the kind the government emphatically ruled out for the electricity sector amid uproar from the Coalition’s right wing.  The argument goes that a trading scheme – or two, if you count the Neg – could eventually provide a future government with a market for Australia’s carbon credits if it chose not to put more cash into the emissions reduction fund.  Of course, these sort of predictions have been made before and the government’s position is that it opposes any form of carbon price or trading. Its message is that it will not stand in industry’s way and wants to encourage new and expanding operators to invest in Australia without penalty. But it is worth remembering that Hunt promised the safeguard mechanism would cut industrial emissions by 200m tonnes between 2020 and 2030 to help meet the Paris greenhouse target. Guardian Australia last week asked Frydenberg if this remained the government’s position. He did not answer the question."
"Farmers have challenged National party claims that conditions in drought-stricken regions in eastern Australia should not be politicised by attributing them to climate change. Farmer and former Nationals leader John Anderson said this week that while the drought was the worst he had experienced, it was not unprecedented. He told the Financial Review farming records for his property, which had been in his family for more than a century, showed droughts of equal severity between 1902 and 1904 and again in 1940. “I’m not a climate change denier but I would be very wary about using this as a political device,” he said.  The deputy prime minister and Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, also said: “I’m a believer that the climate is always changing and it’s been changing since Moses was a boy.” Verity Morgan-Schmidt is from a multigeneration farming family in Western Australia and is CEO of Farmers for Climate Action. She said the comments were “a disservice to many of our farmers who are already facing the reality of climate change”. “My family has been on properties out in Western Australia for over 100 years. We can say this has well and truly moved beyond natural cyclical patterns,” she said. “The idea that we could be accused of playing politics by accepting reality is a bitter pill to swallow. The science is clear. Climate change is increasing the severity of extreme weather events that include drought. “The vast majority of farmers and National party voters that we speak to are growing increasingly frustrated at the lack of action on climate change at a federal level.” The south-east of Australia has experienced record high temperatures this year during an unseasonably dry and hot autumn, prompting fire bans and warnings from authorities. In its latest winter outlook, the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting warmer and drier than average conditions across large parts of the country. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, said: “There is a well-established link between climate change and the frequency and harshness of droughts in Australia.” In its latest drought statement, the Bureau of Meteorology listed May 2018 as the third-driest May on record. The Climate Council has identified an 11% decline in the growing-season rainfall (April–October) in south-east Australia since the mid-90s, the period including the millennium drought.  It has highlighted “particularly strong drying trends” in south and southwestern Australia in the months of May and July and says it is likely climate change is making drought worse in both south-east and south-west Australia, some of the most productive farmland in the country. “The bottom line is climate change is making weather patterns more extreme and unpredictable and that has serious consequences for Australia’s agriculture production,” the Climate Council’s research director and acting CEO, Martin Rice, said. “In southern Australia we are seeing the influence of climate change and drought. We’re seeing less cool season rainfall and that’s having an impact on agriculture. Rice said hotter than average conditions and heatwave conditions in northern parts of New South Wales were leading to drier conditions and there had been an “abject failure” in climate policy at a federal level.  “Hot temperatures bring dry conditions and we can expect to see an increase in drought if we don’t reduce emissions,” he said. “Farmers generally are on the frontline of climate change and they are experiencing worsening extreme weather events, particularly heat-related events and that has an impact on their business.”  The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who is touring drought-affected regions, and the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, have acknowledged climate change is a factor."
"Royal Dutch Shell faces a shareholder challenge over climate change this week, as investors insist oil and gas firms should offer more transparency and action on carbon emissions. A growing number of pension funds have backed a resolution at Shell’s AGM on Tuesday that calls on the company to set tougher carbon targets that are in line with the goals of the Paris climate deal.  The proposal has been backed by the Church of England, the Dutch pension fund Aegon and, most recently, Nest, the workplace pension scheme set up by the UK government, which has £7m invested in Shell. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, a Dutch campaign group that brought the resolution, said: “Investors have a choice: vote for Shell’s ‘whatever world’ or vote for the world of the Church of England, a world in which all companies set targets to limit climate change to well below 2C.” The resolution has been highlighted by 60 large investors managing more $10.4tn (£7.72tn) in assets, though they stopped short of publicly backing it.  “Regardless of the result at the Shell AGM, we strongly encourage all companies in this sector to clarify how they see their future in a low-carbon world,” the investors – who include Axa Investment Managers and Legal & General Investment Management – wrote in an open letter. It is the third year in a row that Follow This has brought a climate resolution to Shell’s AGM. Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive, has admitted the resolutions played a role in convincing the firm to announce a plan to halve the carbon footprint of the energy it sells by 2050. Follow This has welcomed the move but said it is not enough. Meanwhile, influential shareholder advisers have urged investors to oppose the CEO’s remuneration package, which rose to €8.9m (£7.79m) in 2017.  Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) said Van Beurden’s €3m (£2.63m) bonus was not warranted, given how the firm performed on its sustainable development targets. The advisory group Pensions and Investment Research Consultants (Pirc) also recommended opposition. A Shell spokesperson said the company “strongly disagreed” with ISS’s concerns, noting that the advisory group had supported the policy that put the bonus framework in place. The spokesperson added: “We share the objective of Follow This for Shell to show leadership in the energy transition but we consider their resolution unnecessary as we have already outlined an approach, through our industry-leading net carbon footprint ambition, that is wider-ranging and more progressive.” The rival oil firm BP also faces a potential challenge – over pay – during its AGM in Manchester on Monday, the first time the London-based firm has held the event outside the capital in more than a century. The British firm said about 40% of its shareholders lived north of Birmingham, and Manchester’s location and transport links would be convenient for retail investors.  The company’s healthy profits off higher oil prices mean the extraordinary 2016 shareholder revolt over chief executive Bob Dudley’s £14m pay package is unlikely to be repeated. But some proxy adviser groups have urged investors to reject Dudley’s £9.5m remuneration for 2017, which Pirc said was at an “unacceptable” ratio of 48:1 compared to average employee pay. "
"In 1988 – the same year Nasa’s James Hansen warned Congress about the threats posed by human-caused global warming – water expert Peter Gleick wrote about the wet and dry extremes that it would create for California: California will get the worst of all possible worlds – more flooding in the winter, less available water in the summer.  Three decades later, California has been ravaged by just this sort of weather whiplash. The state experienced its worst drought in over a millennium from 2012 to 2016, followed immediately by its wettest year on record in 2017. The consequences have been similarly extreme, including hellish record wildfires, narrowly-avoided catastrophic flooding at Oroville Dam, and deadly mudslides. A study published last month in Nature Climate Change found that these wet and dry extremes will only worsen in California as temperatures continue to rise. As lead author Daniel Swain wrote: most of California will likely experience a 100 – 200% increase in the frequency of very wet November-March “rainy seasons” … California will likely experience an increase of anywhere from 50% to 150% (highest in the south) in the frequency of very dry November-March periods … Since California is so dependent on precipitation during its relatively brief winter rainy season, even a single dry winter can quickly lead to adverse drought impacts upon agriculture and the environment. Last week, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment also published a report detailing the indicators and impacts of climate change on California. The most dramatic impacts include wildfires that are larger and more frequent, and the most severe drought since recordkeeping began. Underlying these events is a long-term warming trend that has accelerated since the mid-1970s. In addition, spring snowmelt runoff is decreasing, sea levels are rising, glaciers are shrinking, lakes and ocean waters are warming, and plants and animals are migrating. In short, climate change will continue to have severe consequences for California, whose economy recently surpassed that of the UK to become the fifth-largest in the world. But the state has also become a leader in trying to minimize those climate damages. In 2006, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the Global Warming Solutions Act into law, whose most significant component was a carbon cap and trade system. The bill required California to reduce its greenhouse gas pollution to 1990 levels by 2020, and the state is on track to meet that goal despite a growing population and thriving economy with an $8.8bn surplus. California has proved that an economy can thrive with a price on carbon pollution in place. In 2016, California passed an update to the California Global Warming Solutions Act requiring a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas pollution by 2030 on the way to the target 80% reduction below 1990 levels by 2050. California’s annual per capita emissions (11.5 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per person) are currently on par with those of Germany and Japan, and 40% lower than the US average. California is investing in climate change solutions, like pilot projects using farms to sequester carbon. More than half of the state’s electricity is generated by carbon-free sources (21% hydroelectric, 12% solar, 9% nuclear, 6% wind, 6% geothermal), and another 43% comes from natural gas. While California can take steps to further reduce the greenhouse gas pollution from its electric power (for example, it just became the first state to require solar panels on new homes), electricity now comprises less than 20% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation is the biggest culprit, now accounting for 37%. That’s why California’s war with the EPA over vehicle fuel efficiency standards is so important. With its low-carbon power grid mix, California can achieve significant transportation emissions cuts by transitioning to electric cars. So far they comprise about 4.5% of the state’s vehicle fleet (340,000 electric cars), well above the national average of 1.1%, but with a long way to go yet. The state’s goal is to have 1.5m electric cars on the road by 2025 and 5m by 2030, with a $2.5bn initiative to install another quarter million charging stations in California to meet the growing electric vehicle infrastructure needs. California has become a leader both in experiencing climate change impacts and taking action to mitigate them. The state has provided a perfect example that contrary to current Republican Party beliefs, climate change has serious economic and human costs, whereas economies can thrive after putting a price on carbon pollution. America needs leaders with the foresight of California’s."
"Drax Group will lead a £400,000 trial to capture and store carbon at its north Yorkshire power station in an attempt to kickstart a technology that has repeatedly failed to get off the ground in the UK. The company was part of earlier efforts to build a £1bn prototype carbon capture coal plant, but pulled out in 2015 after it missed out on renewable energy subsidies. Now the firm will try again with a pioneering form of the technology, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), to cut emissions from one of its four biomass-burning units. Experts believe the project is a world first.  In theory, BECCS can reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, as the trees for the power station absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, while the carbon dioxide released from generating electricity does not enter the atmosphere. Most of the UN climate science panel’s scenarios for stopping dangerous global warming assume the use of such “negative emissions” technology, though critics have said it would not work at scale.  Drax has partnered with University of Leeds spin-off C-Capture for the project, which starts this month. The carbon will be stored in a compressed form on the site, which the firm hopes to sell to an as-yet-unidentified partner for industrial processes. Energy minister Claire Perry said the pilot was “hugely exciting”, while the Carbon Capture & Storage Association called it an “important step”."
"Securing a former prime minister to speak at your organisation is no doubt a coup for many groups. Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy recently got Kevin Rudd. Australia’s Nelson Mandela Day committee has snaffled Julia Gillard for their next annual lecture. What about our most recent former PM, Tony Abbott? Next month, Abbott will deliver the “2018 Bob Carter Commemorative Lecture” to the Australian Environment Foundation (AEF), where the ticketing site says he’ll talk about “Climate Change and Restraining Greenhouse Gas Emissions”. The AEF is an “environment charity” that promotes views that wind turbines make you sick, that human-caused climate change isn’t really a thing, and that environmentalists (the other sort) are killing farmers, fisheries and the economy.  Abbott’s lecture will no doubt pick up from his speech in London in December, where he delivered a suite of climate science denial talking points to the Global Warming Policy Foundation. So who, or what, is the AEF? To look into its history, and the people involved with it, is to take a deep dive into Australia’s climate science denial network. But first let’s look at the AEF right now because, as an “environmental charity”, Abbott’s next port of call doesn’t seem to do very much. Latest figures available from the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission show that in 2016, the charity declared an annual income of just $1,175. The AEF’s YouTube channel has just 11 subscribers and has posted only one video, from December 2016. In May 2017, the AEF lent its logo to a letter to US President Donald Trump to offer “enthusiastic support” for his commitments to withdraw from the UN Paris climate agreement. But between July 2017 and February 2018, there was virtually nothing posted on its website. Much of that website, including the “Climate News” section, is content from former Institute of Public Affairs fellow Alan Moran and postings that variously dismiss human-caused climate change and renewable energy, in particular wind power.  The charity has two other trading names listed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission – the Australian Climate Science Coalition (ACSC) and ListenToUs – but both of these seem to be defunct. The ACSC at one time was receiving cash from a US affiliate, the American Climate Science Coalition, itself an offshoot of the International Climate Science Coalition. The ACSC received $107,000 from its American donors in 2009 and 2010, after which the donations stopped. The ACSC didn’t do any actual climate science, but did host talks from folks like climate science denier and self-titled “high priest of climate scepticism” Christopher Monckton, who once compared then Australian government climate policy advisor Professor Ross Garnaut to a Nazi.  The AEF’s ListenToUs website was an attempt to generate an online social media campaign against carbon pricing. But now, either the AEF has a new line in promoting “Male Strippers Melbourne” and “Home Cleaning Melbourne” or some sort of hackery or lapsing of domain names has eventuated. When Abbott delivers his lecture, he’ll be introduced by Dr Peter Ridd, the controversial marine scientist sacked from James Cook University for alleged multiple breaches of its code of conduct.  Ridd has been a director at the AEF since 2005. That’s a neat segue into the AEF’s history. In late 2004, the Institute of Public Affairs – by then already pushing out climate science misinformation – held its “Eureka forum” to work out how to push back against “environmental fundamentalism” that, it claimed, was “denying farmers, foresters, fishermen, prospectors, miners, beekeepers, 4WD enthusiasts and others access rights, property rights, water rights”. As part of this push back, the AEF was formed in early 2005 with the Institute of Public Affairs as its business address. Then IPA boss Mike Nahan and IPA staffer Jennifer Marohasy were both founding directors. These days the IPA says it has nothing to do with the AEF. Over the years, the AEF has consistently promoted climate science denialism. The group has campaigned against marine parks, carbon taxes, climate science and wind farms, which it says make people sick. For several years, the AEF gained a little notoriety thanks to TV celebrity Don Burke serving as its chairman. The AEF’s current chair, lawyer Tom Bostock, was also a board member of the Lavoisier Group – another collection of conservative white males that came together in 2000 to fight Australia’s engagement in United Nations climate agreements and to attack the science of human-caused climate change. Another AEF director is Tom Quirk, a former director at the IPA and a member of the ACSC advisory panel when that project was a thing. Quirk is involved with another effort to convince right wingers that human-caused climate change science is a massive con.  The unincorporated “Climate Study Group”, of which Quirk is a member, has been running a series of odd adverts in the Australian. The half-page ads have evoked the philosopher Socrates and some cod-psychology to claim sea levels are not rising, global warming isn’t caused by rising levels of greenhouse gas, and we should all be preparing for a coming ice age. So what of Abbott’s lecture? The AEF says it “established the lecture series to commemorate the life and work of Bob Carter”, who was an AEF director at the time of his death in 2016 (Carter was affiliated with 10 or more climate science denial groups around the world).  Abbott’s lecture will be the second in the “series” – the first was delivered in November 2016 by Canadian denialist Tim Ball (that’s the one YouTube video on AEF’s channel). At the time, Ball was in Australia with former One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts. Ball’s speech was a classic of the climate denial genre, mixing conspiracy theories, hatred of “leftists” and disregard for any evidence contradicting a view that climate change is the “biggest deception in history”. Ball claimed the United Nations, led by a favourite enemy of climate science denialists, Maurice Strong, was attempting to exert global control over people’s lives to push a socialist agenda. Ball even used a slide of a quote from Strong, supposedly uttered at the 1992 Rio Earth summit, which read: “Isn’t the only hope for this planet that the industrialised civilisation collapses? Isn’t it our responsibility to bring that about?” This quote is widely used among climate science deniers as evidence of the nefarious motives of the UN. The quote was actually from two years earlier, when Strong was talking to a journalist about the plot of a novel he hoped to write (incidentally another Maurice, Tony Abbott’s former lead business advisor Maurice Newman, has also used the fake quote in a 2015 opinion column in the Australian. Until recently, One Nation also ran the quote on its website). I emailed three of the listed AEF directors – Ridd, Bostock, and Alan Oxley, the former Hawke-era diplomat and now chairman of the APEC Study Centre at RMIT University.  I asked about the charity’s activities, how they secured Abbott’s appearance and the charity’s apparently defunct projects (including the Melbourne strippers) but I didn’t get a response."
"Enough concrete has been produced to cover the entire surface of the Earth in a layer two millimetres thick. Enough plastic has been manufactured to clingfilm it as well. We produce 4.8bn tonnes of our top five crops, plus 4.8 billion head of livestock, annually. There are 1.2bn motor vehicles, 2bn personal computers, and more mobile phones than the 7.5 billion people on Earth. The result of all this production and consumption is a chronic, escalating, many-sided environmental crisis. From rapid climate change to species extinctions to microplastics in every ocean, these impacts are now so large that many scientists have concluded that we have entered a new human-dominated geological period called the Anthropocene.   This dangerous new epoch ends the unusually stable planetary conditions over the past 10,000 years that allowed farming and complex civilisations to emerge. With the spectre of rapid environmental change leading to societal collapse looming, what is to be done? Using modern science to reanalyse human history can help us understand future problems in more fundamental ways. Our analysis shows that just five successive types of human society have spread worldwide: hunter-gatherer, agriculturalist, mercantile capitalist, industrial capitalist and, following the second world war, today’s consumer capitalist society.  Each subsequent stage relies on greater energy use and greater generation and flows of information and knowledge. These result in a much larger population, rising per capita productivity and greater collective agency. Seen in this light, a new sixth type of society will require both greater energy provision and improved systems to communicate knowledge and manage information.  To usher in a new way of living, the core dynamic of ever-greater production and consumption of goods and resources must be broken, coupled with a societal focus on environmental repair. Two increasingly discussed ideas do just this.  Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a policy whereby a financial payment is made to every citizen, unconditionally, without any obligation to work, at a level above their subsistence needs. Small-scale trials of UBI show most people would still work, but UBI could break the link between work and consumption. We all do it, saying: “I work so hard, I deserve that fancy meal, new gadget, or long-haul flight.” Consumption is the payback for being ever-more productive at work. Indeed, it makes little sense to curb consumption when we know we will have to be ever-more productive at work regardless of our choices.  UBI reduces dependency, giving people the agency to say no to undesirable work, and yes to opportunities that often lie out of reach. With UBI we could all think long-term, well beyond the next payday. We could care for ourselves, others, and the wider world, as living in the Anthropocene demands. Another idea is Half-Earth – the simple but profound idea that environmental repair could come fromallocating half the Earth’s surface primarily for the benefit of other species. Half-Earth is less utopian than it first appears, as we have become an urban species. Mass-scale forest restoration is already underway, with commitments across 43 countries to restore 292m hectares of degraded land to forest, 10 times the area of the UK.  And at a deeper level, our views on nature are forged by the society we live in. Acknowledging the Anthropocene re-establishes that humans are part of nature, and so rewilding projects, where large areas are managed to allow natural processes to run, are increasingly popular. Slowly, a new nature aesthetic is being born.  But can we really escape booming production and consumption? The fate of species encountering vast new resources is exponential growth and then collapse, epitomised by the rapid expansion and eventual death of bacteria growing in a Petri dish. While rarely recognised, we humans have recently become the exception to this rule: birth rates on all continents are declining and the global population is on track to stabilise. More information, in the form of girls’ education, has done something truly extraordinary in the context of 4bn years of life.  UBI would give people the right to choose when it comes to fulfilling their own basic needs, and rewilding Earth does the same of other species’ needs. This would be a legacy of a new chapter in Earth’s history that we could be proud of. "

"The natural world is an incredible wonder that inspires us all, but despite our love of wildlife and wild places, there is no doubt that it is facing catastrophic decline, here and abroad. George Monbiot (The UK government wants to put a price on nature – but that will destroy it, 15 May) suggests that in efforts to save the natural world there are grave dangers in putting a “price on nature”. Yet one reason we are failing to do what is necessary is because nature is still seen as “nice to have”, rather than essential in sustaining our health, wealth and security. Many companies, economists and governments regard environmental destruction as a regrettable but inevitable consequence of economic growth – the “price of progress”. If we don’t change this mindset, then there will be little prospect for the revolution in ideas that is needed to avoid a mass extinction event and disastrous climatic changes.   Nature underpins our economy, society and very existence. Talking about the economic contribution of the natural world does not lead to a price on nature, but rather it helps explain its hidden values. Talking about how we rely on healthy nature does not require conservationists to abandon their love of nature, their spiritual connections with it or the moral case for action. It does, however, add one more crucial argument for the kind of changes we need to secure.Tony JuniperDirector of advocacy and campaigns, WWF • George Monbiot says trying to account for the value of nature will inevitably lead to its commodification and destruction. But our global economic system already places economic values on the natural world – and has done so for centuries. The problem is that the price placed on ecosystems and biodiversity is effectively zero. Our economies see these things as worthless because we have failed to measure, understand and account for the true value of nature’s riches. Markets remain largely blind to these benefits, and thus we consume them to the point of destruction. Monbiot is incorrect when he says that “price represents an expectation of payment, in accordance with market rates”. In fact, price represents the attribution of economic value. Natural capital does not prepare nature for sale; it calls attention to the worth of what is lost. We have argued that all human prosperity rests on nature, and Monbiot is correct to point out that many natural resources are irreplaceable. Unfortunately, until we place a proper value on natural capital, the global economic system will continue to merrily saw away at the branch we’re all sitting on. Decades of well-intentioned conservation have done little; a new approach is required. Properly valuing the huge, irreplaceable natural contributions that we all depend on is a good place to start.Cameron Hepburn Professor of environmental economics, Smith School, University of Oxford, and director of economics of sustainability, INET, Oxford Martin School, Alex Teytelboym Associate professor, Department of Economics, University of Oxford, Francois Cohen Senior research officer, INET Oxford Martin, Kirk Hamilton Visiting professor, Department of Geography and Environment, LSEGreen Economy Coalition  • I would certainly agree that calculating the value of nature only in economic terms is sterile and meaningless. However, in dealing with a government that demonstrates its only values are driven by economic considerations, the Natural Capital Committee has been a consistent supporter of environmental causes and gained the support of many environmental groups such as the Woodland Trust and Green Alliance. No doubt some conservatives would want the committee to take a narrow approach to their terms of reference, but they have clearly taken as wide an approach as possible and support many of the causes that Monbiot holds dear. Using economic and financial arguments for environmental causes, as Mr Monbiot often does himself, should not be seen as a threat, but as a source of vital support.Ira UnellNottinghamshire • George Monbiot rightly cites Michael Sandel’s excellent book What Money Can’t Buy. I have found Sandel’s analysis to be enormously helpful in my work with city leaders. After the financial crash of 2008 many advocated new laws to rein in greed and force bankers to act more responsibly. These steps are still needed. But, as Monbiot affirms, Sandel identified an even bigger challenge: “The most fateful change that unfolded during the past three decades was not an increase in greed. It was the expansion of markets, and of market values, into spheres of life where they don’t belong.” Making a stand against market values is now more important than ever.Robin HambletonEmeritus professor of city leadership, University of the West of England • Jason W Moore in Capitalism in the Web of Life argues that appropriating “cheap nature” (raw materials, energy, food, labour, including women’s reproductive labour) is the fundamental condition allowing capital to extract its surplus from the production process. Forcing up the price of “nature” is therefore one of the best strategies for hastening the demise of capitalism, an outcome devoutly to be wished for all on the green left. True, putting up a “This is not for sale” notice (fencing off rewilded land, leaving oil in the ground) is one of the best tactics for pushing up prices. But we still need to eat, to reproduce, and to produce the means of subsistence, and sometimes an exorbitant price (for example, on pollinating insects, on childcare or on clean water) might work better. So maybe the best approach is purely tactical: keep both critiques, incompatible as they are, in mind, and apply whichever is more likely in particular circumstances to achieve the desirable outcome. This approach best reflects the point that actually there is no natural world separate from the sphere of human endeavour; each is the creation of the other, and both market values and intrinsic values are human constructs for us to manage as best we can.Richard MiddletonCastle Douglas, Dumfries and Galloway • I think George Monbiot may have missed the point. What if we valued nature at replacement cost? What if we charged palm oil producers the cost of restoring the environment so that numbers of orangutans returned to former levels? What if we valued nature generally at what it would cost to regenerate the passenger pigeon, the dodo, or countless other species of animals, birds, fish and plants – and the ecology on which they would depend? In practical terms, since we have no idea how to do that, the cost and therefore the value would be infinite. Let economists put that in their models and see what happens.Robert DimmickReading, Berkshire • If the government and conservation organisations continue to insist that monetary values be ascribed to woodland and wildlife, the risk is that a development scheme that can create value £1 in excess of the supposed worth of your local woods will be economically compelling and will inevitably go ahead, replacing “natural capital” with housing capital or retail capital. Perhaps a solution would be to say that many natural “assets” are of infinite value, being unique locally or having an indefinite past and future (if left alone). People could be encouraged to list their local meadows, riverbanks, etc as being infinitely valuable, and then it would be impossible to mount an economic argument that they should be built upon.Dominic RaynerLeeds • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"Tar sands are the dirtiest fossil fuels. These are low-quality heavy tar-like oils that are mined from sand or rock. Much of the mining occurs in Alberta Canada, but it is also mined elsewhere, in lesser quantities. Tar sands are the worst. Not only are they really hard to get out of the ground, requiring enormous amounts of energy; not only are they difficult to transport and to refine; not only are they more polluting than regular oils; they even have a by-product called “petcoke” that’s used in power plants, but is dirtier than regular coal.  This stuff is worse than regular oil, worse than coal, worse than anything. Anyone who is serious about climate change cannot agree to mine and burn tar sands. To maintain climate change below critical thresholds, tar sands need to be left in the ground. This fact is what motivated me to testify to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission last November, to inform my state’s ruling commission about the impact of tar sands on the climate. Canadian energy company Enbridge has petitioned to put a pipeline through my state to carry this dirty tar to refining sites on the coast.  The proposed pipeline is called “Line 3.” The pipeline would carry approximately 760,000 barrels per day – the new pipeline would make it easier and cheaper for the oil companies to transport tar sands and consequently, would boost their bottom line. We already move over two million barrels per day through Minnesota in Enbridge pipelines. This new pipeline would encourage them to extract and sell more tar sands. So, how much pollution would this pipeline carry? 170bn kilograms of carbon dioxide each year. The emissions are equal to approximately 50 coal power plants. These are huge numbers, but more importantly, approval of pipelines like this make it more likely that all of the tar sands in Alberta will be extracted. If that happens, global temperatures will increase by approximately 0.65°F (0.36°C). An astonishing number – approximately three decades worth of global warming. If you care about climate change, then it is not logically possible to approve any pipeline or other infrastructure that may further worsen our climate. We are already screwing up the climate enough as it is.  The decision-making body in my state has heard climate arguments before. In fact, in 2016, the same body ruled against the coal giant Peabody. That ruling decided that fossil fuel companies low-balled the social cost of carbon. Back then, Peabody brought in a group of climate contrarians to argue their nonsense. My colleagues and I were able to convince the Commission that the facts were clear – we are causing climate change, and our decisions today can make tomorrow’s climate worse. This ruling was used when evaluating the social cost of carbon pollution for a new Line 3 pipeline. A judge found that emissions from this project would impose $287bn in social costs over 30 years. In this case, the oil company Enbridge did not invite any contrarian climate scientists. They simply focused on arguments that a new pipeline will be safer to operate (fewer spills) and lessen other issues like rail traffic. They effectively conceded the climate arguments. The decision will be revealed later this month. But already, an Administrative Law Judge has given a recommendation that the new pipeline be built, but in the exact same location as the current pipe. While this recommendation presents large costs to Enbridge, it completely misses the science. The judge’s opinion made no mention of climate change. How can a decision on extracting tar sands be made without considering climate effects? Just last week, the staff of the commission also recommended construction of the new pipeline. They too omitted climate change from their decision. I was proud to be able to stand alongside tomorrow’s leaders. Courageous youth became parties to the litigation and helped arrange the testimony of various climate experts like myself. One of the youth involved in the litigation, Frances Wetherall, summarized her view and told me why she was involved in the case. With every barrel of oil burned, my future children and grandchildren’s chances of a long and happy life diminish. I can’t stand by while Big Oil profits off the destruction of future generations. Whether or not these youth prevail in this case, their courage, intelligence, and drive give me hope for a better future. I am hopeful that the commission dismisses these opinions. It is clear to me that not only must tar sands be kept in the ground, but actions to assist in their extraction make one complicit. I believe that decisions have consequences and we must take responsibility for our decisions. We cannot say “climate matters” and then facilitate tar sands extractions. We also cannot say “we didn’t know” when our children ask us why we made poor decisions.  I would hate to be a fossil fuel lawyer, or executive, or lawmaker who fights for climate destruction today and has to justify his actions to his kids tomorrow. History will be a very harsh judge to them; but of course it will be too late for the rest of us. I’ve said this before and I will say it again, if we cannot say no to tar sands, what can we say no to? Disclosure: I testified as an unpaid expert witness on behalf of Youth Climate Intervenors."
"You kind of expect popes to talk about spiritual stuff, kind of the way you expect chefs to discuss spices or tree surgeons to make small talk about overhanging limbs. Which is why it was so interesting this week to hear Pope Francis break down the climate debate in very practical and very canny terms, displaying far more mathematical insight than your average world leader and far more strategic canniness than your average journalist. In fact, with a few deft sentences, he laid bare the hypocrisy that dominates much of the climate debate.  The occasion was the gathering of fossil fuel executives at the Vatican, one of a series of meetings to mark the third anniversary of Laudato Si, his majestic encyclical on global warming. The meetings were closed, but by all accounts big oil put forward its usual anodyne arguments: any energy transition must be slow, moving too fast to renewable energy would hurt the poor by raising prices, and so forth. In response, Francis graciously thanked the oil executives for attending, and for “developing more careful approaches to the assessment of climate risk”. But then he got down to business. “Is it enough?” he asked. “Will we turn the corner in time? No one can answer that with certainty, but with each month that passes, the challenge of energy transition becomes more pressing.” Two and a half years after the Paris climate talks, he pointed out, “carbon dioxide emissions and atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases remain very high. This is disturbing and a cause for real concern.” Indeed. What’s really “worrying”, though, “is the continued search for new fossil fuel reserves, whereas the Paris agreement clearly urged keeping most fossil fuels underground”. And in that small sentence he calls the bluff on most of what passes for climate action among nations and among fossil fuel companies. Yes, Donald Trump notwithstanding, most countries have begun to take some steps to reduce demand for energy over time. Yes, oil companies have begun to grudgingly issue “climate risk reports” and divert minuscule percentages of their research budgets to renewables. But no one has been willing to face the fact that we have to leave more than 80% of known fossil fuel reserves underground if we have any chance of meeting the Paris targets. No company has been willing to commit to leaving the coal and oil and gas in the earth, and almost no nation has been willing to make them do so. Instead, the big fossil fuel countries continue to aid and abet the big fossil fuel companies in the push for more mining and drilling. In Australia, the Turnbull government backs a massive new coalmine; in Canada, the Trudeau government literally buys a pipeline to keep the tar sands expanding; in the US, the federal government might as well be a wholly owned subsidiary of the fossil fuel companies. In fact, as Francis points out, it’s not just that these companies and countries are committed to digging up the reserves they currently have. Even more insanely, they’re out there exploring for more. Companies like Exxon devote billions and billions of dollars to finding new oil fields, even though we have far more oil than we could ever safely burn. All of this is morally wrong, as Francis points out. “Decisive progress cannot be made without an increased awareness that all of us are part of one human family, united by bonds of fraternity and solidarity. Only by thinking and acting with constant concern for this underlying unity that overrides all differences, only by cultivating a sense of universal intergenerational solidarity, can we set out really and resolutely on the road ahead,” he says. Which is great – it’s the job of religious leaders to remind us to think beyond our own self-interest. But Francis also understands that our current approach makes no mathematical sense. We can’t have a nice, slow, easy transition because we can’t put barely any more carbon in the atmosphere. We must solve the problem of energy access for the poor by using renewables, not fossil fuel, because “our desire to ensure energy for all must not lead to the undesired effect of a spiral of extreme climate changes due to a catastrophic rise in global temperatures, harsher environments and increased levels of poverty”. Above all, we’ve got to pay as much attention to actual reality as we do to political reality: “Civilization requires energy, but energy use must not destroy civilization!” It’s odd to have the pope schooling energy executives on the math of carbon. But actually, no odder than NFL quarterbacks schooling politicians on racial injustice, or high school kids schooling a nation on the danger of guns. Amid the unprecedented wave of nonsense coming from DC, it’s good to remember that there are still people of all kinds able to pierce through the static and the shouting. Good common sense speaks even more loudly when it comes from unexpected corners."

"Guido Rich, 28, an Inuit hunter from Rigolet, Labrador, brings his Ski-Doo to a careful stop on the sea ice, mindful of the precious cargo it hauls: the body of an 800lb male polar bear. It takes Rich and two other men to roll the animal off the sled and on to the ice, while his wife and young children watch. His sister, Natasha Pottle, who shot the bear the night before, hands her brother the plastic bags used to store liver, hair and fat samples that will be sent away for lab testing. The animal will provide valuable information for Labrador’s biologists, a small windfall for his family and meat for the community. Rich has barely begun cutting into the hide when a parade of people from the village start arriving to take pictures, offer observations or just watch respectfully. “When you get a bear, everyone in town knows it,” Rich said. Scenes like this are being repeated up and down the rugged, remote coast this year. Despite vanishing sea ice and shorter, milder winters, Labrador’s polar bear population is actually growing – which means a bigger harvesting quota for Inuit hunters. There are more than 2,500 polar bears in the vast coastal area that includes Labrador and northern Quebec, according to Environment Canada – far more than was expected earlier in the millennium – and further signs the bears continue to rebound despite the impacts of climate change. Indeed, although scientists and Inuit sometimes clash over the estimates, the polar bear population of coastal Labrador is among the healthiest in the world. They jumped on the harp seal boom ... we're seeing them further south than in the past “When I grew up, a polar bear was kind of this mythical creature because you didn’t see them very often. You didn’t hear tell of people seeing them,” said Jim Goudie, wildlife manager for Nunatsiavut, the regional indigenous self-government. “This abundance of polar bears is not something my father’s generation grew up with. It’s only since the mid-80s there’s been the boom. Now there’s polar bears everywhere.” The reason, biologists suspect, is the boom in the harp seal population. As Newfoundland’s seal fishery has collapsed under international pressure, the harp seals of the north-west Atlantic have proliferated. They now number about 7.4 million animals – more then seven times the population in the 1970s. That has created a veritable feast for Labrador’s polar bears, who have shifted their diet from ring seals to their more southerly, promiscuous cousins. “They jumped on the harp seal boom,” Goudie said. “They appear to have adapted for this moment in time … We’re seeing them further south than in the past.” Labrador’s Inuit have hunted polar bears for thousands of years. But only recently have they been able to so carefully monitor and protect the population, thanks to a unique, indigenous-run conservation program managed by Nunatsiavut. The bear shot by Pottle was one of 12 killed by Inuit hunters this season under Nunatsiavut’s quota system, which doles out bear hunting licences through a lottery. A hunter has one week to get a bear before the licence expires and is transferred to another person. Only Inuit residents can apply for a licence, and it’s illegal to sell a licence to a big game hunter who is not from the region. In Inuit culture, a polar bear remains a deeply respected animal, called Nanuk in the Inuktitut language, and getting one is still considered the mark of a great hunter. The harvest remains such an important part of local tradition that it has its own statute in Nunatsiavut’s land claim with the federal government. But Pottle isn’t putting on any airs. Shooting her first polar bear was a terrifying experience, she said. “I was scared,” she said. “It was intense. We chased the tracks out on to the ice and there he was. Then our Ski-Doo stalled and he started coming toward us. That’s when I started calling for my brother.” Her brother, carrying the rifle on his back, circled around to keep the animal at a safer distance. Then he handed the gun to Natasha and told her to shoot. “She was crying, and I said: ‘What’s wrong?’ She said she’s never going polar bear hunting again,” he said. “I said: ‘It’s your licence. You’ve got to shoot it.’” The bear meat will be divided up and shared among the region’s community freezer program, which provides food for the elderly and others who can’t hunt for themselves. Wasting the meat is prohibited by Nunatsiavut law. Failure to share the meat or submit samples for testing means a hunter can be banned for five years. “Some people say it’s our right. But I’ve always viewed it as a privilege. We ask a lot of [hunters], but you’re getting something that not every Canadian has the right to go out and do,” said Goudie. “That’s why I think Nunatsiavut leads not only Canada, but also the world, when it comes to conservation management and buy-in to our system.” Inuit hunters can sell a bear pelt for $4,000 to $5,000 to a local taxidermist, who will auction it off to buyers around the world. In previous decades, when the international market for pelts was booming, the same bearskin could fetch as much as $30,000. Under Nunatsiavut’s program, a computer chip is embedded in the pelt to prove it was harvested through a legal hunt. Much like the coastal Inuit themselves, the polar bear’s world relies heavily on reliable, vast expanses of sea ice. As the region’s sea ice vanishes because of warming oceans and milder winters, the bear has had to adapt. The animals appear to be thriving, but winter is becoming increasingly unpredictable. The loss of sea ice has been dramatic, according to climatologist Robert Way. He points to the Canadian Ice Service historical database, which shows Nunatsiavut’s northern region has lost about a third of its ice cover in the past decade. Conservationists say the Nunatsiavut model is a lesson for other regions trying to manage their polar bear population. Goudie argues the Inuit, sometimes criticized by animal rights activists for allowing the bear hunt, have a vested interest in preserving the polar bears that live among them. “For Inuit, it would be like losing an entire piece of their culture,” he said."
"When the lines between scientific facts, legitimate disagreements and uncertainties about climate change are being deliberately blurred – not least by world leaders like Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan – the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has never been more important. It is the IPCC’s task to make sense of the landscape of scientific findings, where they agree, and why they may differ. The authors of the IPCC’s sixth assessment report – hundreds of scientists across many disciplines – have a massive task on their hands, ahead of its publication in 2021.  When the volume of scientific information continues to grow exponentially, so does the difficulty of maintaining a clear overview. Tracking and reading all of the relevant publications on climate change has become impossible, as more emerge in a single year than was previously the case over an entire, or multiple, assessment periods. Even if there was no further growth over the next three years, the relevant literature to be reviewed for the IPCC’s sixth assessment will be somewhere between 270,000 and 330,000 publications. This is larger than the entire climate change literature before 2014. So conducting a scientific assessment is increasingly a “big literature” challenge.  Managing the literature is vital if we are to ensure the credibility of the IPCC in future. We need to let computers help us to read and digest information we can no longer comprehend on our own.  The IPCC needs to lead the way towards a new era of computer-assisted assessments. Machine learning and natural language processing must be used to understand and synthesise a huge volume of relevant material. New categories of experts – from scientometrics, computational linguistics and data analytics – will need to be involved.  Decision-makers also want knowledge from the research community that can contribute to meaningful solutions. But systematic progress in learning about climate solutions has been limited within the IPCC to date. The quest to understand what policies work well – and under what conditions – remains in its infancy.  This problem is particularly acute in the social sciences. Some argue that social science evidence doesn’t lend itself to generalization. But a bigger challenge is the lack of appreciation for research synthesis as a scientific endeavor in its own right. The dearth of synthetic evidence in policy and social science literatures makes it impossible for the IPCC to aggregate the knowledge that is diffused across thousands of individual studies.  Changing the culture of the social sciences to better support scientific assessment and accumulated learning about climate change solutions won’t be easy. While the IPCC can act as a catalyst, any shift will also require more capacity in synthesis methods, and support for collaborative networks. Research funders and governments also need to direct more funding towards research synthesis.  The good news is that there are models for such a transformation. Researchers in medicine, education and psychology have been forced to grapple with similar challenges over recent decades –and systematic research synthesis is now well established within these fields as a basis for policy advice.  The misleading impression that any single scientific study has the same standing as all others is toxic for a culture of evidence-informed policymaking. By elevating research synthesis to the gold standard of scientific policy advice – and using big data and machine learning techniques to deliver it – we can strengthen the IPCC and provide a stronger response to the Trumps and Erdogans of this world, who want to cherry-pick evidence to suit their own agendas.

"June is usually thought of as a rather moderate month, weather-wise. Heatwaves tend to happen in July and August, and although there were famous falls of snow in parts of England on 2 June 1975, such events are mercifully very rare. Occasionally June will surprise us. Last year, the month started with unsettled conditions and heavy rain. But from the middle of the month temperatures began to rise, with very warm air from continental Europe bringing temperatures above 30C every day from the 17th to 21st, reaching a peak of 34.5C (94.1F) at Heathrow Airport on the 21st, the highest June temperature since the long hot summer of 1976. That helped push the average temperature up for the month, so that, despite a return to cooler, fresher weather, this was the equal fifth warmest June in the UK since records began in 1910.  Yet June 2017 was also surprisingly wet – the sixth wettest June on record. It was the wettest ever in Scotland, where more than 112mm (4.5 inches) of rain falling in Moray during a single day, and temperatures at the famous “cold spot” of Altnaharra fell to a chilly –2.3C."
"Already beset by degraded landscapes and a toxic environment, insects are going to suffer a catastrophic decline in numbers unless climate change is controlled, according to new research from the University of East Anglia. This is on top of the alarming collapse reported in Germany, where 75% of the flying insect biomass has vanished from protected areas in less than 30 years. Insects are the backbone of a healthy ecosystem and the consequences of their absence will be global. Is there anything we can do other than despair? Insects will need stepping stones to move around the country as the climate changes. Here are some ways you can help.  If you have a garden, make it part of the solution. Insects need food and we have destroyed 97% of our wildlflower meadows. The charity Buglife has a great guide that shows which plants help which insects: winter flowers such as hellebore, erica and mahonia for pollinators such as bees; evergreen shrubs and climbers for bugs such as woodlice and spiders. Insects need water – make sure you have some in your garden. Watching bees drink at the bird bath is fun; better still is watching dragonflies emerge from your wildlife pond. Look beyond your own patch and lobby your council to turn verges into highways for insects. Plants help insects, which help mammals, bats, amphibians, reptiles and birds to thrive. We need to fix the system, not just an isolated component. B-Lines, a series of insect pathways running through the countryside, are the best way to help on a national scale. You can help by writing to your MP and asking them to support Ben Bradley’s Protection for Pollinators bill. The “B-Line bill” will make the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs take this innovative landscape ecological solution seriously. It passed the first stage of the process through parliament unopposed."
"When Simon Leather was a student in the 1970s, he took a summer job as a postman and delivered mail to the villages of Kirk Hammerton and Green Hammerton in North Yorkshire. He recalls his early morning walks through its lanes, past the porches of houses on his round. At virtually every home, he saw the same picture: windows plastered with tiger moths that had been attracted by lights the previous night and were still clinging to the glass. “It was quite a sight,” says Leather, who is now a professor of entomology at Harper Adams University in Shropshire. But it is not a vision that he has experienced in recent years. Those tiger moths have almost disappeared. “You hardly see any, although there used to be thousands in summer and that was just a couple of villages.”  It is an intriguing story and it is likely to be repeated over the next few weeks. The start of summer is the time of year when the nation’s insects should make their presence known by coating countryside windows with their fluttering presence, and splattering themselves on car windscreens. But they are spectacularly failing to do so. Instead they are making themselves newsworthy through their absence. Britain’s insects, it seems, are disappearing. This point was underlined last week when tweets from the naturalist and TV presenter Chris Packham went viral after he commented on the absence of insects during a weekend at his home in the New Forest. Packham said he had not seen a single butterfly in his garden, and added that he sleeps with his windows open but rarely finds craneflies or moths in his room in the morning. By contrast, they were commonplace when he was a boy. “Our generation is presiding over an ecological apocalypse and we’ve somehow or other normalised it,” he later said. Certainly, the statistics are grim. Native ladybird populations are crashing; three quarters of butterfly species – such as the painted lady and the Glanville fritillary – have dropped significantly in numbers; while bees, of which there are more than 250 species in the UK, are also suffering major plunges in populations, with great yellow bumblebees, solitary potter flower bees and other species declining steeply in recent years. Other threatened insects include the New Forest cicada, the tansy beetle and the oil beetle. As for moths, some of the most beautiful visitors to our homes and gardens, the picture is particularly alarming. Apart from the tiger moth, which was once widespread in the UK, the V-moth (Marcaria wauaria) recorded a 99% fall in numbers between 1968 and 2007 and is now threatened with extinction, a fate that has already befallen the orange upperwing, the bordered gothic and the Brighton wainscot in recent years. An insect Armageddon is under way, say many entomologists, the result of a multiple whammy of environmental impacts: pollution, habitat changes, overuse of pesticides, and global warming. And it is a decline that could have crucial consequences. Our creepy crawlies may have unsettling looks but they lie at the foot of a wildlife food chain that makes them vitally important to the makeup and nature of the countryside. They are “the little things that run the world” according to the distinguished Harvard biologist Edward O Wilson, who once observed: “If all humankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed 10,000 years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos.” The best illustration of the ecological importance of insects is provided by our birdlife. Without insects, hundred of species face starvation and some ornithologists believe this lack of food is already causing serious declines in bird numbers, a point stressed by the naturalist and wildlife author Michael McCarthy. “Britain’s farmland birds have more than halved in number since 1970,” he points out. “Some declines have been catastrophic: the spotted flycatcher, a specialist predator of aerial insects, has both declined by more than 95%, while the red-backed shrike, which feeds on big beetles, became extinct in Britain in the 1990s.” Further confirmation of the link between insect and bird numbers was provided last week with the publication of a study by Aberdeen University researchers which showed that the plunge in numbers of cuckoos in some areas of England was closely linked to declines in tiger moth caterpillars on which cuckoos feed. “There is now a lot of correlational evidence to show that when certain insects do badly, very often the birds that feed on them get into trouble as well,” said David Gibbon, of the RSPB. However, insects also play invaluable roles in other parts of the environment – for example as pollinators of our orchards and fruit fields. And again, scientists are worried. “People think that it is just bees that pollinate orchards, but there are huge numbers of flies that also pollinate – and they are all also threatened,” said Leather. In addition, flies, beetles and wasps are predators and decomposers who control pests and who generally clean up the countryside. “Just think of the work of the dung beetle,” added Leather. “If they go, the land would be covered with the excrement of cows, sheep and other animals. But perhaps the most alarming indication of the ecological apocalypse we face was provided a few months ago by researchers who published a startling paper in the journal Plos One. Their work was based on the efforts of dozens of amateur entomologists in Germany who began employing strictly standardised ways of collecting insects in 1989. They used special tents called malaise traps to capture thousands of samples of insects in flight over dozens of different nature reserves. Then the weight of the insects caught in each sample was measured and analysed – revealing a remarkable pattern. The annual average weight of insects found in the traps fell by 76% over the 27-year period of their research. Most alarming, however, was the discovery that the decrease was even higher – 82% – in summer, a time when insect numbers should reach their peak. Such figures give strong numerical support to the veracity of anecdotes about splattered car windscreens and moth-plastered patio windows becoming a thing of the past. Equally stark is the fact that although meteorological patterns fluctuated to some degree during the years of the study, it was clear that weather was not the cause of the declines. But perhaps the most alarming aspect of the research was the realisation that these grim drops in insect numbers were occurring in nature reserves – in other words, in areas where the landscape was highly protected and should be the most friendly of habitats for insects. Conditions elsewhere were likely to be a lot worse, the scientists warned. “Insects make up about two-thirds of all life on Earth [but] there has been some kind of horrific decline,” Professor Dave Goulson of Sussex University, said at the time. “We appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are currently on course for ecological armageddon. If we lose the insects, then everything is going to collapse.” The fact that insect biomass has been declining at a steady rate for almost three decades strongly suggests some profound influences must be at work. Most entomologists believe habitat change lies at the heart of the problem. “There have been massive alterations to the way we use the land and it is hard not to believe these are closely involved in what we are seeing,” said Leather. As he points out, intensively farmed wheat and cornfields support virtually no insect life, and this means that as intensive agriculture spreads there are fewer and fewer islands of natural habitat left to support them. And then there is the issue of urban spread. Housing schemes continue to encroach on our woods and heaths so that streets and buildings generate light pollution that leads nocturnal insects astray and interrupts their mating. “That is the reason we see most changes to insect life in south-east England, for that is where we see the greatest spread of cities and towns,” said Leather. In addition to habitat changes, there are the dangers posed by pesticides, in particular neonicotinoid pesticides, which have already been blamed for recent crashes in bee populations. These chemicals are water soluble and so leach out of fields after they are applied to crops. According to research quoted in the journal Science last year, these pesticides have since been found in high concentrations in nectar and pollen in wildflowers near treated fields. Though still not at levels sufficiently high to kill insects directly, they do affect their abilities to navigate and communicate. In the face of this mixture of ecological woes, it is perhaps not surprising that insects in Britain are faring so badly. Whether or not they face an ecological apocalypse is a different matter, for not every expert shares a sense of doom. Professor Helen Roy of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, for example, sees cause for hope. She told the Observer that there were too many success stories – tales of insects that were recovering in numbers and thriving – to feel a sense of despair. “Obviously, many species are suffering, but I am an optimist and I just don’t think it is right to call this an apocalypse,” she said. Roy pointed to explosions in the number of ladybirds and painted lady butterflies that have occurred in the past as evidence. “There are huge variations in numbers of a particular insect species in a year and huge variation in the places you see them.” She also pointed to one study of pollinators that showed while 32% became less widespread between 1980 and 2014, 16% became more widespread. “It is not all doom and gloom,” Roy added. This view was supported by David Gibbons of the RSPB who agreed that not every investigation about insect numbers revealed a tale of irrevocable decline – though he added that he still believed the overall picture was worrying. “It is hard not to see a link between some of the bird number declines and drops in insect populations we are experiencing. There are very close correlations in many cases. But proving there is a causative link – in establishing the one effect is leading to the other – is much more difficult.” An illustration of the problem is provided by one of the few cases where a causative link between insect loss and bird-number declines has been established: the grey partridge, Gibbons said. “During the 70s and 80s, pesticides were killing off plants on which sawflies and other insects fed. Grey partridge chicks feed on these insects and so this process led to a decline in their numbers – and that has since become dramatic.” In fact, the grey partridge’s drop in numbers has brought its population to less than 5% of its figure last century. The crucial point is that researchers were able to show that these twin declines were connnected by manipulating herbicide levels in places where chicks were being reared. When herbicide levels went up, insect levels went down and so did bird numbers. “That manipulation provided the causative link,” said Gibbons. “It was possible to change insect numbers and so see the impact. However, such research is difficult to carry out and is very rare.” And of course, threats to our birdlife are only one aspect of the dangers posed by losses of insects in the UK. As entomologists point out, they also keep our soil fertile, degrade waste, pollinate our orchards and control pests such as the aphid. “We cannot afford to lose them and that’s what makes this issue so urgent and so important,” Leather concluded. “That’s worth keeping in mind as the summer evenings begin – and we see hardly any insects.” Many of Britain’s native species of ladybirds are suffering serious declines in numbers, thanks to the arrival of the harlequin ladybird. It has been declared the UK’s fastest invading species, after reaching almost every corner of the country in just a decade. It preys on native ladybirds and is believed to have caused the decline of at least seven species, including the popular two-spot ladybird, which – when last assessed in 2012 – had slumped by 44% in numbers. More than 2,500 moth species have been recorded in Great Britain, of which around 900 are called larger moths. In the report The State of Britain’s Larger Moths 2013, it was revealed that larger moths had declined by 28% between 1968 and 2007. This was most noticeable in southern Britain where there was a 40% decline. By contrast, numbers showed no significant change in northern Britain, where disappearing species are balanced by moths spreading north because of climate change. Seventy of the 100 crop species that provide 90% of food worldwide are pollinated by bees. In the UK, there are more than 250 species of bee: 25 species of bumble bee, 224 species of solitary bee and one honey bee species. According to a government report in 2014, figures there has been an overall decline in wild and honey bees over the past 50 years. The figures also revealed evidence that there has been parallel declines in the plants that rely on them for pollination. The State of the UK’s Butterflies report – produced in 2015 by Butterfly Conservation – provided further evidence of “the serious, long-term and ongoing decline of UK butterflies”. Overall, 76% of the UK’s resident and regular migrant butterfly species had declined in either abundance or occurrence (or both) over the past four decades, it was found. “This is of great concern not just for butterflies but for other wildlife species and the overall state of the environment,” the report noted. These insects eat large volumes of slugs and aphids and large numbers of weed seeds, thus helping to stop fields being overrun by unwanted plants and pests. However, a study, published in the Journal of Applied Ecology in 2012 - which looked at 68 beetle species at 11 locations around the British Isles over 15 years - found that three-quarters of those examined had declined in number over the periodOf these, half had fallen at rate equivalent to 30% per decade."
"The rise of Napa began with an upset. Warren Winiarski would know – his wine, a cabernet sauvignon, was a firm underdog at a legendary 1976 blind tasting in Paris, which pitted the best of France against the little-known California region.His winery, Stag’s Leap, shocked the wine world by taking top honors. “It broke the glass ceiling that France had imposed on everyone,” he recalls. “People’s aspirations were liberated.”Today Winiarski, 89, is speaking not of liberation, but of limits. A growing coalition of industry veterans and longtime residents fear that Napa has become a victim of its own success, pointing to the ecological transformation of the valley floor from dense oak woodland to a sea of vine-wrapped trellises. And they are posing a thorny question: has a unique agricultural region reached a tipping point at which agriculture itself becomes the threat? “We’re not thinking ahead,” says Winiarski. “What’s at stake is a national treasure.” Against this backdrop, a local environmental initiative has sparked fierce debate. The effort, known as Measure C, would cap the amount of oak woodland that could be cleared for future vineyards – in effect limiting the growth of some of the world’s most famous wine brands. Nearly 500 wineries now call Napa County home. Many are in the valley itself, which is just 30 miles long and five miles wide and welcomes 3.5 million visitors a year. Global recognition has attracted big beverage companies. Tourists have clogged the narrow two-lane roads. Wealthy “lifestyle vintners” have scooped up second homes and attempted to build private helicopter pads.  “With great success came great money and outsiders,” explains James Conaway, a journalist and author who has been covering Napa since the 1980s. He describes the valley of 30 years ago as egalitarian and idealistic, a mixed agricultural community that raised wine alongside livestock and fruit trees. “Now it’s monoculture with a vengeance. Hundreds of miles of steel trellising holding up the vines from one end of the valley to the next. It has an industrial sheen.” Through the windows at Winiarski’s hilltop home, the transformation can be surveyed with ease. Vineyards stretch in all directions, rows of green as orderly as soldiers. The Silverado Trail, a famous wine tasting route, cuts a path to the west. To the east lie hills covered in oaks – trees that, Winariski points out, once carpeted the valley floor.  Napa’s oaks have become a flashpoint in the story of wine’s takeover. Ninety-five per cent of those on the valley floor have been felled, the vasty majority replaced by grapes. Now developers are eyeing the surrounding hillsides.  Napa county has California’s densest concentration of oak woodland, thanks to the rich foliage that still carpets the hills. While much of it is privately owned and not public land in the classic sense, the woods are regarded as a public resource – a place of recreation and biodiversity, a vital part of the valley’s watershed and a fierce point of pride. But more than a third sits on potentially agriculturally productive soil – a 2010 management plan estimated that by 2030, up to 3,065 acres of mixed woodland would be lost due to vineyard development. “Forests are the best negative emissions technology we have,” says Jim Wilson, a former brewing quality manager at Anheuser-Busch and a leader in the band of grassroots activists behind Measure C. “Should Napa’s wine industry get a pass?” The measure is the culmination of years-long battle – one that’s involved knocking on doors, gathering thousands of signatures, and fighting an opposition which, according to a private newsletter seen by the Guardian, plans to spend nearly $1m to defeat it. Wilson’s side, by contrast, has raised just over $160,000. The effort has consumed his life, but then, Napa is his life. “I was born here in 1955,” Wilson says. “I raised a family on my wife’s ranch.” Their home – a patchwork of steep hills, creeks and woodlands on the county’s east side – is wild and uncultivated. During a walk beneath the oaks on a recent morning, his love for the forest is palpable.  “When you take forest out, you negatively impact carbon sequestration,” he explains. The trees play a crucial role in capturing rain and replenishing groundwater, he said, while their root systems prevent soil erosion.  Voters will decide on the proposal by 5 June, but the campaign has sharply divided the wine community. Veteran vintners like Winiarski have gone against the industry trade groups, who are united in their opposition. The Napa Valley Vintners, a key trade body, initially supported the measure but later pulled a surprise U-turn. Wilson and his co-organizers say pressure from powerful industry figures turned the tide. The Vintners declined to comment on the reversal, but an official statement said the majority of its members “conveyed opposition”. “This decision does not change our longstanding commitment to promoting, protecting and enhancing the Napa Valley and to upholding its goals of advocating for the local wine industry while preserving this special place for future generations,” it added.Ryan Klobas, the policy director for the Napa Valley Farm Bureau, warns the measure is “full of unintended consequences” and calls its proposed regulation too complicated for voters to grasp. “You’re asking everyone to become a technical expert overnight. This is an issue better left to the board of supervisors.” But longtime residents such as Ginny Simms – an environmental advocate who served on the county’s board of supervisors in the 1970s – believe corporate greed is at the root. Napa today is a multibillion-dollar industry, where global beverage companies such as Treasury Wine Estates, Gallo and Constellation – which own brands such as Corona and Svedka vodka – have acquired smaller wineries for their portfolios. “The real issue here is power,” says Simms, 90. “Opponents want to run the county in a way that is favorable to the expansion of all wineries and wine events. Which leaves the people of Napa voiceless.” Despite the talk of pushing back against power, some worry more regulation would actually favor the wealthy by boosting the price of the little free land that remains. Don Clark is a mid-sized grape grower and vineyard manager from Texas, who came to Napa in 1994 and was lucky to buy affordable land. “We may have been the last generation who could come here as a young farmer,” he says. “The barriers to entry are almost impossible now.” Startup costs have soared – Clark’s last vineyard development client spent half a million dollars on various legal, consultation and county fees, as well as archeological and environmental studies, he says. Clark and others point to a landmark 1968 ordinance known as the Agriculture Preserve – the first of its kind in the US – which deemed agriculture the “highest and best” use of Napa’s land. Measure C therefore undercuts a fundamental right to farm, these opponents argue.  But proponents say the measure is born of love, not reproach, for the wine world, and is simply about responsible farming. “Something’s very wrong with the way we are thinking about our resources,” Winiarski says. “They are finite. And yet we go on with development as though we could do that indefinitely.” • This article was amended on 21 May 2018 to clarify the distribution of wineries in Napa County. "
"Investment in the UK’s low-carbon economy has fallen dramatically, endangering jobs and putting in doubt the government’s commitments on climate change, an influential committee of MPs has warned. Funds going into renewable energy, the mainstay of the low-carbon economy, fell more than 50% in 2017, having dropped by 10% in 2016, bringing annual investment in the sector to its lowest since the financial crisis in 2008.  The environmental audit committee (EAC) said on Wednesday that the government would be unable to meet its pledges on carbon emission reductions, if the collapse continued.  The MPs also said the government was failing to implement policies to cut emissions from transport, heating and industry, and called on ministers to consider raising a “sovereign green bond”, as other countries have done, in order to stimulate investment. The criticisms come even as the government has boasted of a clean growth strategy, and a 25-year environmental plan that will address climate change along with other green priorities such as pollution and biodiversity.  Mary Creagh, chair of the EAC, said: “The clean growth strategy was long on aspiration, short on detail. The government must urgently plug this policy gap and publish its plan to secure the [billions of pounds of] investment required to meet the UK’s climate change targets, and explore how a sovereign green bond could kickstart its strategy.”  Cuts to taxpayer-funded support for renewable projects, along with planning obstacles that have effectively ruled out new onshore wind turbines across much of the country, have deterred energy companies and their financial backers. The market for energy efficiency measures, such as home insulation, has also seen a sharp decline since the government scrapped its flagship policy, and the Green Investment Bank was sold off. Alex White, senior policy officer at the Aldersgate Group, said: “There are willing investors in the green economy, but not enough projects to invest in. Boosting the pipeline of green infrastructure projects will be critical to meet the UK’s environmental goals and should be the first priority in green finance. Policy detail is key [for investors].” Alongside the EAC report, researchers and NGOs have called for a “greening” of the Bank of England, to meet carbon targets and encourage clean growth. Positive Money, a thinktank, called for the monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, to have to take the risks of climate change into account in making its decisions, a controversial recommendation that would require wide reviews of how climate change could make an impact on inflation. The report, A Green Bank of England, also suggested that the Bank of England should be given a specific remit on environmental sustainability, which would affect its decisions and advice to government, and should no longer buy bonds issued by fossil fuel companies. Lord Deben, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory advisors, said linking the Bank of England’s work to climate change was essential, as was linking the performance of other government departments on the issue. “We have compartmentalised our reactions to climate change – we say, we have a minister for this, so the secretary of state for health or the chancellor do not think they have responsibility for it.” He said: “The Bank of England can make a huge difference by using its own direct powers, and by influencing [others].” He was backed up by Barry Gardiner, Labour’s shadow secretary for international trade, who said: “We have to make it clear to the Bank of England that it is given a specific remit to deal with these issues, not to limit its activity to more conventional banking activity.” The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has repeatedly warned of the risks of climate change to the financial sector, and the need for action by companies, investors, government and regulators to ensure the necessary transition to a low-carbon economy happens beneficially, rather than by shocks to the finance system. Sovereign green bonds, recommended by the EAC, are financial borrowing instruments issued by governments to raise cash for environmental improvement projects, with part of the return on the projects going to market investors. They enable governments to take advantage of the low interest rates on borrowing available to them, while investors are attracted by the relatively low levels of risk. Poland made a bond issue in 2016, with Belgium following suit this year, and countries around the world from Nigeria to Indonesia have also entered the market. The Bank of England would have to take the lead in issuing such bonds in the UK. The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it would respond to the EAC proposals in due course. A spokeswoman said: “We’re committed to meeting our climate change targets and will have invested £2.5bn in low-carbon innovations by 2021.”"
" Last week the Irish Environmental Protection Agency confirmed that Ireland will miss its 2020 international emissions target by a wide margin. The goal is 20% cuts on 2005 levels; in reality we’re on track for 1%.   It further predicted that the gap between stated ambition and reality will, if anything, widen over the coming years. Starting from 2020 this will almost certainly mean fines – potentially of millions of euros – being levied by the European commission. Plans such as a 20% increase in milk production to satisfy export markets in China and beyond point Ireland unambiguously in the wrong direction. Peat, the most dirty fuel of all, is still commercially extracted and burned to produce some of the country’s electricity. As well as increasing our carbon footprint it degrades our national ecosystems. Microgeneration of electricity cannot be pushed back on to the grid, even for free, making Ireland a sore thumb anomaly internationally and curtailing domestic renewables uptake. Electric vehicle take-up remains abysmally low. Ireland has a lot to do just to play catch-up, let alone take a leadership role, in tackling climate change. Ireland has also been heavily in the news recently over the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment, which prohibited abortion. The role of the Citizens’ Assembly, an exercise in deliberative democracy, in the process has, quite rightly, been lauded. It proved that given time, access to expert evidence, the absence of the proverbial megaphones of vested interests, and a conducive environment to discuss issues, citizens can, and will, come to informed and nuanced opinions. Less well known, at least outside Ireland, is that the assembly have considered a number of additional topics. These included how the state can help make Ireland a leader in tackling climate change. As noted already, Ireland’s progress to date on this issue has been wholly inadequate. It was my privilege to serve on the expert advisory group of the assembly for its climate deliberations. Citizens were presented over two weekends with what amounted to a crash course in, not just the evidence basis for climate change, but also what critical aspects of their life, such as energy, transport, agriculture, and our homes might look like 30 years hence, were Ireland to become a leader in tackling climate change. They were also shown inspiring present day exemplars such as the Dublin fire brigade station that has gone carbon neutral, through community owned renewable energy efforts in Tipperary, to organic low-impact farmers.  Crucially, these discussions were undertaken without the voices of vested interests, from both ends of the spectrum. These all too often tend to obfuscate, and discussions of climate change in the public sphere turn into a slanging match. At the end of the two weekends citizens voted on a range of questions. If the citizens are as representative of broader society as implied by the eight amendment deliberations, where the assembly ballot results almost exactly matched the referendum result, then the results were awe-inspiring. They should act as a real wake-up call to both the current government and future governments. Every single question given to the citizens attained at least 80% agreement. Most attained close to unanimous agreement. Real efforts were made to ensure that the questions given were balanced and nuanced and properly reflected trade-offs that would be required in the real-world. There were no questions, for example, about subsidies without a commensurate counterweight of a source of increased revenues to cover the costs.  But they also recognised aspects such as equity that could and should be achieved. So, for example, there was a question around raising taxes on carbon intensive activities. But the funds would then be ringfenced and used to enable the transition to lower-intensity activities, with priority given to those in fuel poverty and community owned activities. The citizens were almost unanimous in desiring an act similar to the UK Climate Change Act with a watchdog similar to the Climate Change Committee charged with setting sector-wise targets but given real teeth – the ability to sue the government or other public bodies for non-conformance. The citizens also voted strongly for the imposition of tax and subsidy basis for the farming sector to penalise carbon intensive activities and encourage more climate friendly behaviours in the sector. They also wanted Ireland to reimagine its approach to transport, in both urban and rural areas. The recently unveiled 2040 strategy of the government, if enacted in full, starts to make substantive progress in addressing many, but by no means all, of the issues raised. But, unless and until strategy is translated into action and results across successive governments the jury must remain out. There is clearly an enormous appetite to make Ireland live up to its reputation as the emerald island by being a leader in addressing climate change. Citizens recognised the competitive advantages of energy independence and first mover advantage, as well as co-benefits such as air quality improvements. Will our politicians give the same due diligence to the Citizens’ Assembly’s climate change considerations as the eighth amendment? Time will tell. • Peter Thorne is the director of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units at Maynooth University and a coordinating lead author on the IPCC sixth assessment report"
"One morning last week, Mohammad Javed wheeled an air conditioner on to the pavement outside his catering business in Delhi, placed his chair a metre away, sat down and did not move all day. When the machine ran out of water, he asked passing boys to fetch a bucket. When he had to give directions to workers in the building across the lane, he shouted. Every few minutes, he took a long swig from his water bottle and spat the contents on to the ground without swallowing. “Ramadan,” he explained. Northern India, like neighbouring Pakistan, is in the grip of a heatwave, with temperatures reaching 47C. A blanket of hot air has settled on Delhi clearing pavements across the usually busy capital. India is particularly vulnerable to temperature increases associated with climate change. Since 1992, about 25,000 Indians are estimated to have died because of heatwaves. Yet the country is quietly optimistic that it can prevent at least some of those deaths. In the past two years, the numbers dying from heat-related illnesses has fallen sharply, from 2,040 in 2015 – when roads melted in the searing heat – to half that the following year and to a little over 200 in 2017, according to government data. Public health advocates say this has been a triumph of common sense. A combination of public awareness campaigns, training for medical staff and simple policy changes – such as unlocking the gates of public gardens during the day –have averted thousands of deaths for little cost. The catalyst was a heatwave in May 2010 in Ahmedabad, the largest city in the western state of Gujarat, that killed more than 1,100 people, and prompted authorities to seek help. “The first thing was making people aware that heat can kill,” said Parthasarathi Ganguly, a professor of public health and former World Health Organisation official. “India is a tropical country, so people are used to heat: they take it as a natural phenomenon. They say, it will be hot – what’s new?” Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com Under Ahmedabad’s action plan – first implemented in 2013, when temperatures rose so high it risked triggering organ failure – school days were reduced, government work programmes ceased, and free water was distributed in busy areas. White reflective paint was applied to roofs in slum communities, cutting temperatures in homes by up to five degrees. In hospitals, staff were trained to identify early signs of heat stroke, including dizziness or severe diarrhoea. Instead of waiting in stifling wards, patients were rushed to dedicated cool rooms equipped with fans, ice packs and, electricity supply permitting, air conditioning. “Doctors don’t go on vacation any more when it’s hot,” said Anjali Jaiswal, of the US-based National Resource Defense Council, which advised on the plan. “They watch the temperature and make sure the hospital is staffed.” Ahmedabad already had plenty of charities willing to distribute water. “They see it as an act of god,” Ganguly said. The city government simply allocated each charity a zone, to ensure the whole city was covered. The gates of city gardens, usually closed in the daytime, were opened so that hawkers, traffic police and rickshaw pullers could seek shade. “The council didn’t spend a rupee,” Ganguly said. The first test of the new system was in May 2014 when, he says, temperatures again reached the levels that had killed so many. “According to our initial estimates, 800 fewer people died,” he said. “In terms of cost per lives saved, it is one of the most effective interventions in public health until now.” Since then, 11 more cities have adopted similar heat action plans, and one is currently in the works for Delhi. India’s national disaster management authority is aiming to reduce the death toll from excessive heat to zero. So far this year, government officials say, the heat has killed 11 people. Temperatures will drop across India at the end of this month with the arrival of the monsoon rains.

"Achieving the toughest climate change target set in the global Paris agreement will save the world about $30tn in damages, far more than the costs of cutting carbon emissions, according to a new economic analysis. Most nations, representing 90% of global population, would benefit economically from keeping global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the research indicates. This includes almost all the world’s poorest countries, as well as the three biggest economies – the US, China and Japan – contradicting the claim of US president, Donald Trump, that climate action is too costly.  Australia and South Africa would also benefit, with the biggest winners being Middle East nations, which are threatened with extreme heatwaves beyond the limit of human survival. However, some cold countries – particularly Russia, Canada and Scandinavian nations – are likely to have their growth restricted if the 1.5C target is met, the study suggests. This is because a small amount of additional warming to 2C would be beneficial to their economies. The UK and Ireland could also see some restriction, though the estimates span a wide range of outcomes.  The research, published the journal Nature, is among the first to assess the economic impact of meeting the Paris climate goals. Data from the last 50 years shows clearly that when temperatures rise, GDP and other economic measures fall in most nations, due to impacts on factors including labour productivity, agricultural output and health. The scientists used this relationship and 40 global climate models to estimate the future economic impact of meeting the 1.5C target - a tough goal given the world has already experienced 1C of man-made warming. They also assessed the long-standing 2C target and the impact of 3C of warming, which is the level expected unless current plans for action are increased. “By the end of the century, we find the world will be about 3% wealthier if we actually achieve the 1.5C target relative to 2C target,” said Marshall Burke, assistant professor at Stanford University in the US, who led the new work. “In dollar terms, this represents about $30tn in cumulative benefits.” The estimated cost of meeting the 1.5C target is about $0.5tn over the next 30 years,” he said: “So our evidence suggest the benefits of meeting the targets vastly outweigh the costs.”  “We also calculated what’s going to be the additional economic cost if we hit 3C instead of 2C. This will cost the globe an additional 5-10% of GDP, relative to 2C; that is tens of trillions of dollars. These are very large numbers,” he said. The researchers acknowledge there are significant uncertainties in their economic modelling, but said they are confident that keeping climate change to 1.5C is very likely to benefit the vast majority of the world’s people.  The exact size of the benefit will depend, for example, on whether new technologies are created that help societies adapt to global warming, such as clean, cheap air conditioning, or whether climate tipping points are passed, bringing more severe damage such as rapid sea level rise. “The caveats apply to both the impacts and the adaptation,” said Prof Noah Diffenbaugh, also at Stanford University. The economic analysis did not include the impacts of climate change on areas that are harder to quantify, such as the natural ecosystems that are vital for clean air and water and fertile soils, or the health benefits of burning less fossil fuel. Including these would make the benefits of action even greater. Prof Maximilian Auffhammer, at the University of California Berkeley, US, and not part of the research team said: “Translating the impacts of climate change into economic damages is challenging. Pinning down just how large the effects of climate will be on the long-term growth of GDP needs to be a high priority for future work.” “I think the authors of this study are doing the best job possible, by basing their estimates on a rigorous analysis and clearly stating their assumptions,” said Prof Wolfram Schlenker, at Columbia University, US. "
"Investments amounting to trillions of dollars in fossil fuels – coal mines, oil wells, power stations, conventional vehicles – will lose their value when the world moves decisively to a low-carbon economy. Fossil fuel reserves and production facilities will become stranded assets, having absorbed capital but unable to be used to make a profit. This carbon bubble has been estimated at between $1tn and $4tn (£3tn), a large chunk of the global economy’s balance sheet.  Investors with high exposure to fossil fuels in their portfolios will be hurt, as those companies and assets cease to be profitable. Jobs will be lost in fossil fuel production and related industries. If the bubble bursts suddenly, as a new paper in Nature suggests it might, rather than gradually deflating over decades, then it could trigger a financial crisis.  Arguably yes, in that it corrects what has long been a market failure. Currently, fossil fuel prices do not reflect the environmental damage the fuels do, in climate change and air and water pollution. If they were priced to take these external factors into account, they would cost much more and businesses would seek alternatives – that is the idea behind carbon pricing. However, adding those external costs at a stroke would send energy prices soaring, with far-reaching effects across the economy. That is why economists prefer to phase in more realistic pricing for carbon-rich fuels over time. And the converse is also true: if renewables and energy efficiency were to result in an unexpected plunge in demand for fossil fuels, independently of government actions, that could send fossil fuel prices through the floor, triggering a crisis among the millions of investors in those assets. Probably, but it could encourage some countries to pump out more, at least in the short term. For instance, if demand for fossil fuels drops suddenly then the OPEC countries could flood the market with cheap oil and gas, leaving those with more expensive assets – shale, tar sands, Arctic drilling – unable to compete. Again, not quite. Lots of other actions are still needed, not least because the world could adjust to lower fossil fuel demand with a glut of energy production. The transition to a low-carbon economy is happening, but still much too slowly. At current rates, we will smash through the 2C ceiling promised under the Paris agreement, with rises of 3C and higher forecast. Without strong further commitments on climate change from major nations, we will reach our emissions targets too late and face a future of locked-in global warming that will result in floods, droughts, heatwaves and losses to global agriculture. China relies on high-cost fuel imports at present and is benefitting from its investments in renewables, as is Japan, which has also invested heavily in energy efficiency. The EU is likely to be another winner as it has also moved early to pursue a low-carbon path. Middle Eastern oil-rich states have built their economies on fossil fuels, so would need to diversify, which some are beginning to talk about. Russia could see its domestic fossil fuel industries collapse. Canada and the US could also be at risk: with their production of high-cost unconventional oil and gas from tar sands and shale, they are vulnerable both to a drop in demand and a drop in fossil fuel prices, unless their industries have invested in renewable energy and greater efficiency. A reversal of major nations’ support for low-carbon technology and a reversion to an over-reliance on fossil fuels, which in many cases would have to involve large taxpayer subsidies for the latter."
"The battle to construct a third runway has been going on for much longer than your estimate of 31 years (Editorial, 6 June). It first gained government approval as long ago as 1946 but was abandoned by the incoming government in 1952. Since then there have been further attempts and in 2009 it once again gained parliamentary approval. This was overturned by the coalition government one year later when David Cameron declared: “No ifs, no buts, no third runway.” This might have been the end of the matter but the ‘aviation mafia’ is nothing if not persistent and never gives up.Philip SherwoodAuthor, Heathrow: 2000 Years of History, Harlington, Middlesex • There is one vital element of the Heathrow runway debate that has not been aired this time (again) and is surely the central point. In the 1970s, an energy study warned us of the finite nature of oil-based transport. According to the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in 2016, there are 1.3tn barrels of proven oil reserves left in the world’s major fields, which at present rates of consumption should last 40 years. So if it takes 20-30 years to build the third runway, that means just 10 years of use. And that does not take into account current population expansion rates and the likelihood of greater demand on oil reserves over the next 30 years. A third runway at Heathrow is utterly futile and pointless. Air travel in its current form is dying. We need new solutions, new energy sources – not tired out old arguments.Nigel CubbageMerstham, Surrey • Climate change is a good reason for opposing a third runway at Heathrow. Air pollution is another. The chief executive of Heathrow, John Holland-Kaye, has circulated local residents reassuring them that he takes this issue very seriously. In fact Heathrow uses diesel generators to refuel around 40% of its planes. It has been offered renewable energy generated locally but turned down the proposal as it was slightly more expensive. So pollution and sustainability do not seem to feature in Holland-Kaye’s business decisions. Nor it seems in the government’s. The real reason for Chris Grayling’s announcement is that Brexit will free the UK from the EU air quality directive; and we already know that Michael Gove’s new Environment Agency has no regulatory teeth. It can issue advisory notices regarding pollution levels at Heathrow, but the government will be immune from prosecution. Those who have hitherto failed to comprehend the cynical rationale behind Brexit need look no further than Heathrow.Dr Robin Russell-JonesChair, Help Rescue the Planet • The Guardian continues raking in the ad revenue from flight and travel companies while moralising to us about the impact on the upper atmosphere of all this air travel.

"Morondava in Madagascar, the skyline in Senegal and Kruger national park all have something in common. These places are home to some of the largest trees in the world – baobabs, known to live for thousands of years. These amazing trees have trunks that can reach 30m in circumference or more. In Togo, there is a proverb: “Wisdom is like a baobab tree: no one individual can embrace it.” In many African cultures, the tree is sacred. There are nine species of baobab in the world, and Madagascar, one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, is home to six. The African mainland and the Arabian peninsula have two, and Australia has one. Africa’s most notable species is the Adansonia digitata, named after the French botanist Michel Adanson, who undertook an 18th-century exploration of Senegal. He stayed there for five years and contributed to the publication of 1757’s Natural History of Senegal.  Some of the most impressive trees from back then are still around, those from Madagascar especially: for example, the Adansonia grandidieri, or giant baobab, which can reach a height of 30m. It remains the most famous species of baobab in Madagascar. The rarest baobab species in Madagascar are the Adansonia perrieri and A. suarezensis. All three of these species are threatened and are on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and recent assessments have suggested that the latter two species be reclassified as critically endangered. A. perrieri’s habitat is being lost to agriculture and development, whereas A. suarezensis’s biggest threats to survival are lightning, water logging, black fungus and drought. To make matters worse, the large animal species responsible for carrying seeds may have become extinct and hence reduced the wider distribution of the plant species. Africa’s “tree of life” may not have much longer left. It forms an integral part in people’s livelihoods. In west Africa, it is also called the “palaver tree” because of its social functions: when there is a problem in the community, meeting under the baobab tree with the chief or the tribesmen would be synonymous with trying to find a solution to that problem; it reinforces trust and respect among members of the community. Its extinction would not simply be an environmental tragedy. The tree grows in very harsh conditions but is completely adapted to its environment: it sheds its leaves during the dry seasons to reduce water loss; it has a tap root system long enough to reach moisture or even water; and the thick bark protects it from bush fires. From a scientific point of view, the baobab tree is truly a complete plant. The leaves are used in traditional medicine to cure infectious diseases, while the fruit is high in nutrients and is used to make health foods. The seeds yield oil that is prized by the cosmetic industry. The trunk stores water and can be harvested by thirsty travellers. Yet these highly important species are threatened with extinction, due to climate change and human development. Some species may not survive the next century. While plants have generally adapted to extended droughts, climate change is different, and with the Anthropocene we are already witnessing the loss of these impressive trees. The greatest irony is that the African continent has hardly produced any greenhouse gases and yet is already bearing the brunt of the vagaries of climate change. Africa’s largest, oldest inhabitants, that have played silent witness to numerous generations, are already paying a heavy price for the environmental crimes of foreign lands. • Ameenah Gurib-Fakim PhD is a former president of Mauritius, a biodiversity scientist, and has written extensively on the flora of the south-west Indian Ocean"
"What’s in a cloud? Water, certainly, but also tiny particles known as “aerosols”. Whether they originate from wildfires, volcanoes, sandstorms, ship emissions or power stations, aerosols alter the properties of a cloud. By providing a surface for water to condense on to, they can help water droplets to form. But exactly how aerosols alter clouds is not clear. Now a new satellite study is helping scientists to see inside a cloud.  Nicolas Bellouin, from the University of Reading, and colleagues compared ordinary satellite images of clouds with infrared images. Clouds that appear plain white in ordinary images contain different shades and patterns when viewed in infrared. From wildfires in Siberia to volcanoes erupting on the Pacific islands of Vanuatu, and the trail of smoke from power stations in northern England, Bellouin and his colleagues show that polluted clouds tend to redistribute the same amount of water over a greater number of droplets. Their findings are published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. This observation contrasts with some climate models, which indicate that increasing aerosols should help clouds to become “wetter” by increasing their capacity to hold water. The findings also suggest that climate models are overestimating the ability of aerosols to offset global warming."
"Ice in the Antarctic is melting at a record-breaking rate and the subsequent sea rises could have catastrophic consequences for cities around the world, according to two new studies. A report led by scientists in the UK and US found the rate of melting from the Antarctic ice sheet has accelerated threefold in the last five years and is now vanishing faster than at any previously recorded time. A separate study warns that unless urgent action is taken in the next decade the melting ice could contribute more than 25cm to a total global sea level rise of more than a metre by 2070. This could lead eventually to the collapse of the entire west Antarctic ice sheet, and around 3.5m of sea-level rise. Prof Andrew Shepherd, from Leeds University and a lead author of the study on accelerating ice loss, said: “We have long suspected that changes in Earth’s climate will affect the polar ice sheets. Thanks to our satellites our space agencies have launched, we can now track their ice losses and global sea level contribution with confidence.” He said the rate of melting was “surprising.” “This has to be a cause for concern for the governments we trust to protect our coastal cities and communities,” Shepherd added. The study, published in Nature, involved 84 scientists from 44 international organisations and claims to be the most comprehensive account of the Antarctic ice sheet to date. It shows that before 2012, the Antarctic lost ice at a steady rate of 76bn tonnes per year - a 0.2mm per year contribution to sea-level rise. However since then there has been a sharp increase, resulting in the loss of 219bn tonnes of ice per year - a 0.6mm per year sea-level contribution. The second study, also published in Nature, warns that time is running out to save the Antarctic and its unique ecosystem - with potentially dire consequences for the world. The scientists assessed the probable state of Antarctica in 2070 under two scenarios. The first in which urgent action on greenhouse gas emissions and environmental protection is taken in the next few years, the second if emissions continue to rise unabated and the Antarctic is exploited for its natural resources. The scenario which plays out largely depends on choices made over the next decade, on both climate-change and on environmental regulation, they conclude. Co-author Profe Martin Siegert, from the Grantham Institute, said: “Some of the changes Antarctica will face are already irreversible, such as the loss of some ice shelves, but there is a lot we can prevent or reverse. “To avoid the worst impacts, we will need strong international cooperation and effective regulation backed by rigorous science. This will rely on governments recognising that Antarctica is intimately coupled to the rest of the Earth system, and damage there will cause problems everywhere.” As well as being a major cause of sea-level rise, scientists say the oceans around Antarctica are a key “carbon sink” - absorbing huge amounts of greenhouse gases helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Siegert said: “If the political landscape of a future Antarctica is more concerned with rivalry, and how each country can get the most out of the continent and its oceans, then all protections could be overturned. “However, if we recognise the importance of Antarctica in the global environment, then there is the potential for international co-operation that uses evidence to enact changes that avoid ‘tipping points’ – boundaries that once crossed, would cause runaway change, such as the collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet.” Greenpeace which is campaigning for a large tract of the ocean surrounding the Antarctic to be made into the world’s biggest ocean sanctuary, said government’s must heed the warning. Louisa Casson, of Greenpeace UK’s Protect the Antarctic campaign, said: “Governments can take a historic step forward in October this year if they decide to create an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, protecting 1.8 million square kilometres in what would be the largest protected area on Earth. “Ocean sanctuaries create havens for marine life to build resilience to a changing ocean, but also crucially help us avoid the worst effects of climate change, by preserving healthy ocean ecosystems that play a vital role storing carbon.”"

"Businesses are moving forward faster than ever on climate change despite the intransigence of US president Donald Trump, the former climate chief of the UN has said. “There is a big difference between the economics of climate change and the politics of climate change,” said Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention of Climate Change, who oversaw the landmark Paris agreement on climate change.  “Investors are seeing a tipping point in terms of climate change” and more investors are now taking the risks into account when allocating funds, she said. The growing interest of investors in low-carbon activity will, she said, determine the global response to climate change much more than the actions of Trump. Speaking on the anniversary of Trump’s public decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement, and ahead of a G7 meeting where climate change will be high on the agenda, Figueres said not only businesses but also other governments were moving ahead of the US on the issue. “The US is in a frankly un-understandable position,” she told the Guardian. “How is [withdrawing from Paris] going to strengthen the US economy? How is it going to open up new opportunities for the US when the rest of the world is becoming increasingly decarbonised?” She pointed to the large number of US businesses and cities that had reaffirmed their commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions and investing in low-carbon technology. “They are saying they will continue to decarbonise,” she said. “It’s very difficult when the White House is speaking in one direction and the real economy is continuing moving in a different direction. “Is the White House going to stop this advance [by businesses]? I don’t think so.”  Figueres had praise for the UK, which she said was leading the world in areas such as offshore wind. “In the country that saw the birth of the industrial revolution, we are seeing a new industrial revolution,” she said. Brexit was not a reason to change the UK’s determination to move to a low-carbon footing, she said, as Britain could benefit from green economic growth. Figueres was also scathing about those who claim the world cannot now avoid warming of more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, the limit set out in the Paris agreement based on scientific advice that warming above this level would cause catastrophic and irreversible changes. “To say we can’t avoid [such a future] and give up, that is irresponsible. That is completely unacceptable to me.” She expects a key report due from the International Panel on Climate Change later this year to underline the need for urgency in cutting emissions, but said it was still possible to stave off the worst effects of warming and that the world should focus on such efforts. “I was told in 2009 it was already too late. Had we had a global framework 10 years ago, it would have been better. 20 years ago would have been better yet. 25 years ago would have been better, better, better yet. But the point is that we are dealing with the reality that we have.”"
"More than $1bn of public money being spent on cutting greenhouse gas emissions by planting trees and restoring habitat under the Coalition’s Direct Action climate policy will have effectively been wiped out by little more than two years of forest-clearing elsewhere in the country, official government data suggests.  The $2.55bn emissions reduction fund pays landowners and companies to avoid emissions or store carbon dioxide using a reverse auction – the cheapest credible bids win. The government says it has signed contracts to prevent 124m tonnes of emissions through vegetation projects – mostly repairing degraded habitat, planting trees and ensuring existing forest on private land is not cleared.  Based on the average price paid by the government for a tonne of carbon dioxide, the projects will receive about $1.48bn from taxpayers as they deliver their cuts over the next decade. Meanwhile, forest-clearing elsewhere in the country has released more than 160m tonnes of carbon dioxide since the emissions reduction fund began in 2015. Emissions projections data estimates another 60.3m tonnes will be emitted this year – equivalent to more than 10% of national emissions. An analysis by the Wilderness Society suggests the official figures underestimate the rate of land-clearing, and in reality the projects paid for from the Direct Action emissions reductions fund would have had their work nullified in even less time. The Wilderness Society climate campaign manager, Glenn Walker, said other data sources suggested the projections data was almost certainly an underestimate. He said the government’s forest-clearing emissions counted areas felled for farming, mining and other industry, but not those from native forest logging for timber, which are absorbed into another category. Australian National University scientists have estimated native forest logging may contribute another 38m tonnes a year. Walker said the official forest-clearing figures also underplayed the amount of mostly agricultural land-clearing in Queensland. State data showed that 395,000 hectares were felled in 2015-16, releasing 45m tonnes of emissions from that state alone. The Wilderness Society estimates suggest 600,000ha of land were cleared across the country in 2016, an area equivalent to about half of greater suburban Sydney, and the most in a decade. Walker said the government had shown it wanted mass land-clearing to continue, pointing to evidence that federal environment department notices asking Queensland landholders to explain suspected illegal clear-felling on their land had been withdrawn after lobbying by Liberal National MPs and senators. “It’s a disgrace that there is a massive public investment going into tree planting while the government sits back and not only watches but encourages the mass destruction of forests,” Walker said. The environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, did not directly respond to questions about how the rate of land-clearing squared with the government’s emissions goals. He said a departmental review of climate policies last year confirmed that Australia had a comprehensive set of emissions reduction policies, and that the emissions reduction fund was internationally recognised as one of the world’s largest domestic carbon offset markets. Land-clearing spiked in Queensland after the former Liberal National premier Campbell Newman relaxed laws preventing mass deforestation. The Palaszczuk Labor government has repealed the changes to restore earlier protections but legacy clearing permits remain for about 115,000ha. The federal government is resisting calls that it should use national environmental laws to stop land-clearing that threatens endangered species, saying it is a state responsibility. Frydenberg is currently considering a draft department of environment recommendation that a Queensland farmer be allowed to clear most of a 2000ha block of Cape York forest that is home to endangered species. Scientific advice suggests allowing it would likely increase sediment runoff on to the Great Barrier Reef. The government is also facing calls that it make changes to the emissions fund. It has committed $2.28bn on what it says is 191m tonnes of abatement, but questions remain over whether some types of projects backed by the fund – such as capturing methane from decomposing rubbish at landfill sites to convert into electricity – are actually limiting emissions or just being rewarded for what they would have done anyway. “Avoided deforestation” projects – paying farmers to not clear land – are also contentious. Habitat restoration and tree-planting projects have broader support. In a recent paper in the journal Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, University of Queensland research fellow Dr Megan Evans found that well-designed incentives could encourage landowners to back reforestation on otherwise agricultural land, with broad benefits for the environment and community. But she found that Australia’s reforestation program was being undermined by land-clearing elsewhere on the continent.  She said people were likely being held back from signing up for reforestation projects by inconsistent messages from government. “If, as a society, we have a goal to reduce emissions, we need to ideally point all the policy messages towards that goal,” she said. “Unfortunately this hasn’t been happening.” Australia’s total national emissions continue to rise. The most recent national greenhouse accounts showed a 1.5% increase last year. The government has pledged to cut emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030. Emissions from what is known as “land use, land use change and forestry” – a vast category that takes in forest-clearing, native logging, tree planting and the natural impact of and recovery from disasters such as fire, flood and drought – rose by 0.5%. The 60m tonnes from forest-clearing cancelled out what would have otherwise been an emissions sink. The next emissions reduction fund auction is scheduled for 6 and 7 June. • Support our independent journalism with a one-off or monthly contribution"
"There’s recently been a spate of sea level rise denial in the conservative media, but in reality, sea level rise is accelerating and melting ice is playing an increasingly large role. In the first half of the 20th Century, average global sea level rose by about 1.4 millimeters per year (mm/yr). Since 1993, that rate has more than doubled to 3.2 mm/yr. And since 2012, it’s jumped to 4.5 mm/yr.  Thermal expansion (ocean water expanding as it warms) continues to play the biggest role in sea level rise, but its contribution of about 1.3 mm/yr is now responsible for a smaller proportion of total sea level rise (30% in recent years) than its contribution since the 1990s (40% of the total). That’s because of the acceleration in melting ice. Glacier melt is accelerating, recently contributing about 0.75 mm/yr to sea level rise, up from 0.65 mm/yr since the 1990s. But the biggest jumps have come from ice in Greenland and Antarctica. Greenland had been responsible for about 0.48 mm/yr sea level rise since 1990, but in recent years is up to 0.78 mm/yr. A recent study in Nature Climate Change found that Greenland contributed about 5% to sea level rise in 1993 and 25% in 2014.  A new study published in Nature using data from a range of satellites found that Antarctica’s contribution has tripled from about 0.2 mm/yr since the 1990s to 0.6 mm/yr since 2012, during which time global sea level rise also spiked. Accelerated ice melt from Antarctica, Greenland, and glaciers have all played a role in the faster recent sea level rise. The question is whether it’s a temporary jump, or if we need to worry about a continued acceleration in Antarctic ice loss. Another recent paper published in Earth’s Future found that rapid losses from Antarctic ice are plausible. The study found that in moderate to high carbon-emission scenarios, an average expected sea level rise of 2 to 2.5 feet by 2100 could actually become 3 to 5 feet once Antarctic ice sheet dynamics are taken into account. The vast majority of Antarctica’s current ice loss is coming from West Antarctica, where about 75% of the glaciers are located below sea level. In East Antarctica, which has so far remained stable, only about 35% of the glaciers are below sea level. Warming ocean waters are melting the Antarctic ice from below, which is particularly problematic for that low-lying ice in West Antarctica. Research suggests that the collapse of the Western Antarctic ice sheet is already unstoppable. Short-term variations in sea level rise do happen. Sea level actually briefly fell in 2010 due to a strong La Niña cycle, which typically results in an increase of rain and snow falling over land. This resulted in a number of epic deluges and flooding across the globe; more water on land temporarily meant less in the ocean. However, Antarctica and Greenland could potentially cause rapid sea level rise. As James Hansen explains in the video below, there have been periods in the not-so-distant past when sea levels rose at an average rate of 1 meter every 20 years. In past eras when temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were similar to those today and to the Paris climate targets, like in the last interglaciation and the Pliocene, sea levels were about 20 to 80 feet higher. Unless we manage to actually cool global temperatures, we’re certainly due for significantly more sea level rise. The large ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica will continue to melt for as long as 1,000 years. That’s why sea levels were so much higher in past eras whose climates remained at hot temperatures like today’s for thousands of years.  It takes time for ice to melt. The question is, how fast will it happen? Sea level rise unquestionably poses a long-term threat, but how much of a short-term threat largely depends on just how stable the Antarctic ice sheet turns out to be. The recent acceleration of Antarctic ice loss, while not yet definitive, is certainly cause for concern. 16. Greenland is melting faster right now because it is being subjected to rapid Arctic warming. But everybody knows that Antarctica has vastly more *potential* to lose ice than Greenland does."

"Global carbon markets have been revived from the brink of collapse as, after years in the doldrums, recent developments have provided a much-needed boost, according to a new report from the World Bank. China has made strong progress on its new carbon markets, which when complete will be the biggest in the world, while the EU initiated reforms of its carbon trading system which have already had an effect on prices.  Though these fledgling efforts need to be confirmed in the coming few years, more carbon markets are also likely to come forward: 88 of the countries that have completed the first stage of the Paris agreement, representing more than half of global emissions, have said they are using or plan to use carbon pricing as a tool. The World Bank, in Tuesday’s annual report on carbon pricing, found that governments raised about $33bn in revenue last year from putting a price on carbon through carbon trading or taxes, a 50% increase on the previous year. John Roome, senior director for climate change at the World Bank, said: “Governments are starting to see the effectiveness of carbon pricing in their efforts to cut carbon, while also raising revenues for climate and other policies. Carbon pricing mechanisms are proving to be essential elements of the toolkits [to meet the commitments made in the Paris agreement].” Dirk Forrister, chief executive of the International Emissions Trading Association, told the Guardian the report showed “widespread interest in using pricing systems to meet the Paris goals”. He said: “The market is beginning to accelerate. We anticipate a major role for China and the market for international aviation [which when operational from 2020 will] more than double the amount of carbon subject to market pricing.” In addition to the national carbon markets across the world, there are more than 20 that have been set up at a regional level. If taxes on carbon are also included, the value of the world’s carbon markets and carbon taxes is likely to be about $82bn this year, compared with $52bn in 2017, according to the World Bank report. Carbon pricing has long been considered a key way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and numerous efforts have been made to develop markets where organisations can trade “rights” to produce carbon, with an overall cap on the allocation of rights ensuring emissions are limited. Economists consider carbon trading, which was enshrined in the Kyoto protocol of 1997, an efficient tool to encourage businesses to cut their greenhouse gases in the most cost-effective ways, but the problem has been that governments – the main creators of carbon markets – have been unwilling to impose costs on their industries. As a result, the caps on carbon have usually been too weak and the resulting price of carbon too low to generate a strong signal to the markets. Carbon markets are also supposed to benefit developing countries, as under UN systems rich countries can buy credits from poor countries that have instituted protections for their forests, or other ways to reduce greenhouse gases."
"The Australian Senate’s declaration last month that climate change is a “current and existential national security risk” was clearly intended to inject much-needed urgency into the country’s climate policy stalemate. Bringing together the unusual bedfellows of military generals and environmentalists to warn about the dangers of climate change, it has the possibility to break though Australia’s culture wars on the issue. However, by framing climate change as a security matter, it also has significant consequences in shaping how we respond to a warming planet. As the climate crisis unfolds, is the military the institution we want to turn to for solutions? The Australian Senate inquiry was initiated by the former Greens senator Scott Ludlam and heard from diverse actors, including humanitarian agencies and defence strategists. It examined the likely impacts of extreme weather on military infrastructure, the economy and the wider region. It concluded that “climate change is exacerbating threats and risks to Australia” and called for improved military preparedness, better studies of “risks” to Australia, and enhanced coordination between government agencies. The question rarely asked is whose security are we talking about - security of what, for whom and from whom? In this, Australia is following a well-worn path forged by the European Union and the United States. The Pentagon in 2003 was the first to talk about climate security, framing climate change as a “threat multiplier” that would exacerbate conflict, terrorism, mass migration and social instability. In 2008, the EU concurred saying that global temperature increases of more than 2 degrees (current predictions suggest we are heading for more than 3 degrees) would “lead to unprecedented security scenarios”. Security is a modern day weasel word – who can be against security? The question rarely asked is whose security are we talking about - security of what, for whom and from whom? The US, EU and now Australian strategies, though, clearly state they are talking about the security of their respective nations in the face of “threats” usually coming from the consequences of climate change in neighbouring countries.  The submission from Australia’s Department of Defence to the inquiry put it this way: “When climate impacts are combined with ethnic or other social grievances, they can contribute to increased migration, internal instability or intra-state insurgencies, often over greater competition for natural resources. These developments may foster terrorism or cross-border conflict.” They argued that this “could lead to an increase in the demand for a wide spectrum of Defence responses including maintaining law and order following disasters”. The image they paint is a dystopian one, which assumes that climate change disruptions will lead to a dog-eat-dog world, causing conflicts and wars, and prompting millions to migrate – and this will require the military to deal with the ensuing chaos.  The effect of this approach is to turn the victims of climate change into potential threats and to make a militarised response to the impact of climate change the default response. The Australian Senate report is more nuanced than some US Pentagon reports in advocating for a range of strategies, including additional climate finance and better disaster resilience planning.  But by blurring the distinction between the military’s ideas of security and other “human security” approaches, it embraces and reinforces a military response to climate change. This can be seen in the report’s strong appeals to the military to expand its role in disaster relief, even though this typically is the most costly form of relief and can end up militarising humanitarian disasters as the world witnessed graphically in New Orleans in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina where deployed National Guards ended up shooting at flood victims.  The Senate report has less focus on the way the impacts of climate change will vary dramatically depending on the level of poverty and vulnerability of the affected community. Nor does it challenge the economic structures or laws that have led to this inequality and vulnerability, such as the role of Australia’s trade policies in undermining rural livelihoods and disrupting food systems. This is not surprising. After all, the essence of “security” is to secure what already exists. This means securing a world order in which Australia’s per capita income is 25 times that of nearby Kiribati or Solomon Islands and where even in Australia 2.9 million people live under the poverty line. It is an approach that seeks to build walls to exclude the dispossessed rather than tackle the underlying causes that cause people to migrate – shown today most visibly in Australia’s inhumane treatment of refugees in Nauru.  Australia’s experience of unprecedented heat waves and fires in recent years has already shown that climate change will have a big impact on the country and the wider region. But how those impacts play out will depend to a great degree on how we choose to respond. An approach that relies on military forces and barbed wire will worsen the crisis and create a world no one wants to live in. Real security emerges from recognising our interdependence, tackling injustice and inequality, and working together to protect those who are most vulnerable. • Nick Buxton works at the Transnational Institute based in the Netherlands and is co-editor of The Secure and the Dispossessed: How the Military and Corporations are shaping a climate-changed world (Pluto Books, 2015)"
"Tony Abbott has claimed he was misled by bureaucrats before he signed Australia up to the Paris international climate agreement in 2015 during another sortie by government conservatives against the national energy guarantee. Opponents of the government’s energy policy used the opportunity of the regular Coalition party room to resume their attacks on the policy that goes to a critical meeting of state and territory energy ministers in early August. With these two parliamentary sitting weeks the last remaining window for internal opponents to try and blow the policy off course, Abbott raised objections, as did Eric Abetz, Andrew Gee, Ian MacDonald and the voluble Liberal Craig Kelly. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Kelly, who is the chair of the government’s backbench committee, continued to insist that emissions reduction in the electricity sector should be delayed, and that large energy users shouldn’t be part of the putative system. According to people present, Abetz, the Tasmanian Liberal, attempted to argue during Tuesday’s meeting that Abbott hadn’t given hard commitments when he took the decision to sign the government up to the Paris agreement – that Australia’s undertakings were always aspirational. Abbott then told colleagues he’d been misled by bureaucrats during the Paris commitment process about the impact of the commitment. At the time he took the decision Abbott said something quite different. In announcing Australia would adopt an emissions reduction target for 2030 of 26% to 28% on 2005 levels, Abbott said: “There’s a definite commitment to 26% but we believe under the policies that we’ve got, with the circumstances that we think will apply, that we can go up to 28%.” Materials circulated to the Coalition party room at the time also made it clear that Australia would need to reduce its projected emissions by around 900m tonnes in order to hit the 26% to 28% target. The government said at the time an emissions budget approach should be used “that is, achievement of our target should be measured in terms of emissions over the period 2021-30 and not simply at our emissions at a point in time in 2030”. Abbott, the former prime minister, also argued on Tuesday that the owners of the Tomago aluminium smelter were opposed to the Neg, which imposes reliability and emissions reduction obligations on power retailers and some large energy users from 2020. The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, begged to differ, noting they were supportive of the policy, as were several other big corporates.  During the discussion, the Queensland National Scott Buchholz raised concerns about high energy prices. The New South Wales Liberal Trent Zimmerman rose to support the policy. Tuesday’s skirmish in Canberra followed a phone hook-up of state and territory energy ministers last Friday. During that conversation, Frydenberg told his Coag counterparts the emissions reduction trajectory in the national energy guarantee would be steady over 10 years, not back-end loaded as some of his conservative party room opponents have demanded. The policy moves into its decisive phase of consideration over the coming weeks, with Frydenberg determined to stare down internal opponents and get wavering Labor states over the line. The 10 August meeting will either make or break the Neg. Any single state or territory has the power to veto the policy, and a number are concerned about the lack of ambition in the emission reduction target. Federal Labor is declining to offer Frydenberg much political cover. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, on Tuesday pointed to persistent government in-fighting on the issue. Shorten noted an “insurgency from the right” and he said the Neg had “fairly lame targets”. The Turnbull government will not be able to land the policy in the federal arena without Labor’s support, and the opposition is yet to say what it will do. For months the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has pointed to the lack of ambition in the Neg emissions reduction target as being a significant problem, and he has argued Labor would need to scale it up significantly in the event it ultimately accepted the mechanism."
"“How can the weather ever be boring?” asks the hero of David Haig’s fascinating play. Admittedly the character is a meteorologist but he has a point: other countries have a climate whereas we in Britain have weather. But finally catching up with Haig’s much-travelled play, first seen in Edinburgh in 2014, I was struck by how it expands to acquire meanings beyond its immediate subject.  Haig has seized on the historical fact that there was much tension surrounding the timing of the D-day landings in Normandy in June 1944. General Eisenhower, in charge of European operations, had set a precise date of 5 June. However, James Stagg, chief meteorological adviser to the allies, arrives at the HQ at Southwick, Hampshire, and warns of severe weather conditions on the appointed day. If he is right, the invasion will be a disaster leading to massive loss of life. But he is vehemently opposed by his American counterpart, Colonel Krick, and Eisenhower is left to make the crucial decision as to whether to delay the operation.   Since we know the outcome, you might say there is little tension. Haig, however, gets round that in several ways. One is by giving us detailed information about the shifting weather patterns in the Atlantic so we begin to grasp the dilemma faced by Eisenhower.  Haig also sets up a contrast in character and method between the rival meteorologists. Krick relies on analogue charts recalling weather patterns in previous years; Stagg, a tenacious, hard-headed Scot, bases his forecasts on hourly scientific readings and precise knowledge of the complexity of British weather.  Haig constantly reminds us what is at stake but his play transcends its context. Given that the story involves Britain and the European mainland – though, in this case invasion rather than withdrawal – the conflict between a self-deluding optimism and a pragmatic realism takes on an unexpected resonance. I was even reminded of the debate about climate change, where wilful denial is confronted by inescapable fact.  Haig seems reluctant to bring his play to an end and overstresses the coincidental pressure on Stagg, whose wife is due to give birth even as D-day is imminent, but he has found rich drama in the interaction of war and weather.  As an actor, he is also ideally equipped to play Stagg. Haig’s forte is playing men in the grip of an idee fixe: in farce that can be very funny but here it means he endows Stagg, head always thrust forward in a state of permanent inquiry, with a peculiar brusque intensity. Even if Stagg’s worries about his wife occasionally intrude, Haig also makes something deeply moving out of the moment when the character’s quivering anxiety breaks through his surface stoicism.  Malcolm Sinclair is exemplary as Eisenhower showing how the poker-backed professional soldier is awed by his sense of responsibility. Laura Rogers also tactfully suggests the thwarted adoration of Ike’s driver, Kay Summersby, for her boss and John Dove’s finely calibrated production boasts good support from Philip Cairns as the Pollyanna-like Krick and David Killick as a garrulous electrician. It may be a traditional play but it is one where, as so often, history acquires the power of metaphor.  • Until 1 September. Box office: 020-7395 5405."
"In September 2017 Roosevelt Skerrit, the prime minister of Dominica, stood up in front of the UN general assembly. “Eden is broken,” he said. Skerrit had travelled to New York from his devastated island nation, battered to bare-root nakedness by Hurricane Maria, which spat out homes and lives, leaving behind flooding, landslides and a crumpled infrastructure. The category five storm splintered the island’s ancient forests, a Unesco world heritage site, ripping away the lush canopy to reveal a broken, brown reality.  The storm also razed the island’s Windsor Park cricket stadium – and on Thursday a Rest of the World team take on the West Indies at Lord’s to raise money for its restoration, and that of James Ronald Webster Park in Anguilla, ruined by hurricane Irma just two weeks earlier. The game is a shining example of cricket acting for the common good. It will raise much-needed funds and the tickets, which are £10 for children, are reasonable. The game is being held during the half-term holiday and will be shown on Sky. It brings together players from around the globe including Rashid Khan, Shahid Afridi, Thisara Perera, Dinesh Karthik, and Mitchell McClenaghan under the captaincy of Eoin Morgan for the Rest of the World. But there is something missing. There has been no discussion of the reasons why the weather seems to be changing, what might be done to prevent it or why the hurricane season of 2017 was both so unprecedented and so brutal. No one weather event can be categorically labelled as “caused by climate change”. But scientists are confident that climate change is bringing more extreme weather events, and that it increases the severity of hurricanes, like Irma and Maria, as greenhouse gases trap energy in the atmosphere driving more powerful winds. Rising temperatures have led to higher sea levels, which in turn means bigger storm surges. Higher water temperatures lead to more evaporation of water into the air, and that means more rain and therefore a higher risk of flooding. Skerrit is in no doubt what is to blame for his island’s repeated battering. In April he spoke of the country’s plans to become the world’s first climate resilient nation. But, he asked, what of the rest of the planet? “In the current system, those who reap the financial benefits from the emissions of greenhouse gasses are not those who carry the costs. As a result, there is an underinvestment in limiting climate change, mitigating its costs and reducing climate-related damage. That is no longer a viable situation. The time for talk, conventions and declarations is over. The time for action is now,” said Skerrit. So what does cricket do? There is for the game both a responsibility and an opportunity in tackling climate change. Cricket, and its followers, have an emotional and physical bond with the land in a way that few other field sports do. From the dustbowls of Ahmedabad to the lush pastures of the Somerset levels, cricket is its environment. It affects the batting conditions, the way the ball moves, the choice of players on the field, the way the game is played.  A roll-call of incidents from the the last few years suggest the scale of future challenges the game will have to face, and the risks of doing nothing. Last October Irma and Maria hit the Caribbean; this February the Western Province Cricket Association cancelled all club and school cricket because of severe drought in Cape Town and the surrounding areas.  In 2016, 13 IPL games were moved from Maharashtra as parts of the state endured their worst drought for 100 years, and the control of water became a legal issue this April when the Mumbai high court forbade the Maharashtra Cricket Association from receiving water from the Pavana dam for its matches in Pune.  Last December, air pollution in Delhi during the India v Sri Lanka Test resulted in players vomiting on the pitch and wearing face masks. Play was repeatedly held up and oxygen cylinders were brought into the dressing rooms. In England, 10 county grounds sit in cities where pollution levels exceed WHO recommendations. In the last month, a heatwave in Karachi has killed at least 65 people. And earlier this year, a report by the Climate Coalition named cricket as the game in the UK most likely to be affected by climate change.  “There is clear evidence that climate change has had a huge impact on the game,” said Dan Musson, the ECB’s national participation manager, “in the form of general wet weather and extreme weather events.” Glamorgan, the sole Welsh voice in county cricket, have lost 1,300 overs of cricket since 2000 because of the weather. Their head of operations, Dan Cherry, is frank. “Losing so much cricket is a county’s worst nightmare – it affects the club at every level,” he has said. “It’s difficult even for first-class counties to be commercially viable with such an impact.” Steve Birks, the Trent Bridge groundsman, told the Cricket Paper only this month: “The rain is getting tropical, it is getting heavier. We’re getting thunderstorms more often when it rains – I think that’s when you can tell the difference.” Cricket must adapt to what the World Bank calls “the new climate normal” but it must also become part of the solution. On the day of the IPL final, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) signed an agreement to promote green cricket, “greening operations and engaging cricketers and fans in green initiatives”. The following months will give us an idea of how much the BCCI really cares, and how much is greenwash. Becoming a world leader, a shining example of good environmental practice would attract to cricket the much-desired growth audience – as well as being the right thing to do. Young people, in particular, care about the future of the planet in a way they might not care about, say, 100-ball cricket. Increasingly sponsors too are likely to look at environmental performance when calculating where to put their money. So many things could be done quite easily – large and small – from carbon audits to sensible tour planning to reduce the number of flights, from encouraging spectators to travel to matches in sustainable ways to curbing single-use plastic use. Some grounds, Lord’s and the Oval particularly, but also Edgbaston and Cardiff, are acting unilaterally, but cricket, and sport in general, is crying out for environmental leadership – how fabulous it would be if Thursday’s match banged heads together. With 2.5bn fans worldwide, cricket has the potential to influence human behaviour in profound ways. • This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

"Shell investors have rebelled over the company’s executive pay, as the Anglo-Dutch oil company came under pressure to take stronger action on climate change. While chief executive Ben van Beurden’s €8.9m (£7.79m) pay package for 2017 was approved, more than a quarter of shareholders voted against the firm’s remuneration report at its annual general meeting on Tuesday. Gerard Kleisterlee, the chair of the remuneration committee, blamed the result on proxy advisers. Influential shareholder adviser ISS had urged investors to reject the pay award because of the company’s performance on sustainable development targets and an accident in Pakistan which led to the deaths of 221 people.  The rebellion is the latest in a series of revolts against corporate pay, including 37% of shareholders voting against or abstaining on AstroZenca’s remuneration report last week. Melrose, Inmarsat and Unilever have been hit this year with significant votes against pay packages, though Shell’s fellow oil major BP avoided one on Monday. Shell also faced a grilling from investors over how sincere its action is on reducing carbon emissions, with about half the questions related to climate change during the four-hour AGM.  However, the company defeated a resolution calling for it to set tougher emissions targets in line with the Paris climate deal.  The resolution was backed by 5.54% of shareholders; a similar resolution in 2017 was backed by 6.3%.  “Investors are sending a clear signal to Shell and all oil and gas companies, that they will not accept a goal of halving net carbon emissions by 2050 [set by Shell],” said Mark van Baal of Follow This, the group which brought the proposal.  He noted that seven of the Netherland’s 10 biggest asset owners had supported the resolution. Van Beurden repeatedly defended the company’s record on climate change, referring to its target to halve the carbon footprint of its products by 2050 and company scenarios showing how the world could keep temperatures below 2C. “This ambition is truly industry-leading, nobody else comes close. It is seriously ambitious,” he told the AGM, adding that the resolution would tie the firm’s hands. “Your company wants to lead, so let us. So follow us,” he quipped in reference to the activist shareholder group’s name. Van Baal accused the chief executive of misleading investors that Shell’s carbon targets were aligned with a sub-2C world. “I’m not misleading shareholders,” van Beurden retorted. The chief executive said that at some point the firm would have to grapple with how to tie its carbon targets to executive pay, without giving a timeframe for action.  The company also faced questions over the impact of its operations in Argentina, Nigeria and the Netherlands, conditions and terms for workers, and an ongoing corruption trial in Italy."

"It probably should be no surprise that last night’s royal wedding became part of the political debate this week. But the criticism by government members highlighted yet again the Liberal party’s policy of pretending to care about something while simultaneously doing everything to work against it. Peter Dutton and Tasmanian senator Eric Abetz bought into the issue of the ABC’s coverage of the royal wedding off the back of erroneous reporting in News Corp papers suggesting the ABC had flown hosts Annabel Crabb and Jeremy Fernandez to London in business class. Abetz, who is never one to miss an opportunity to slight the ABC, echoed Dutton’s thoughts when he suggested he would “would like to see the justification for flying those two over when there is a crew permanently in London”. It is the standard operating procedure of the Liberal party: cut funding to the ABC that in effect is designed to ensure it struggles to do a professional job, then either criticise it for not being up to scratch or, when it does something professionally, criticise it for wasting money. It’s the cannot-win argument. Had the ABC taken the cheaper option, Abetz and his ilk would have screamed about how the ABC disrespected the monarchy and Australians by not treating the event with the appropriate level of attention. But really, all this talk about the ABC from Abetz and Dutton is just a continuation of the long run of the Liberal party being disingenuously concerned about things it is actively against. Take the gender ​gap in parliament. There are a lot of furrowed brows within the Liberal party at the moment after the ​ dumping of frontbencher Jane Prentice as a candidate at the next election, and challenges to Victorian senator Jane Hume and NSW MP Ann Sudmalis, have made it rather all too clear just how few women they have in the parliament. Only 13 of the 76 Liberal party MPs are women – rather a long way from its target of having 50% of women contesting “winnable seats” by 2025. And yet, rather than introducing a quota to achieve this target, which has been proven to work (as the ALP has done and which now has women accounting for 47% of its MPs), it has instead chosen to throw money at the problem. Kelly O’Dwyer has established a fund to help financially support ​female candidates. And while no doubt the aim is good, even this very market-based option has been attacked by those within the Liberal party. Demonstrating the strong inherent bias against doing anything to improve the gender gap, ​ Eric Abetz (yes, once again) suggested the fund was not “necessarily consistent with the Liberal philosophy”. Actually the fund is very much in keeping with that philosophy – it will do nothing to overcome the systemic bias against women but it looks like they’re trying to do something about it. We get a policy that barely looks like they’re trying to achieve something and which is designed not to achieve its aim It’s much like their position on climate change. Many in the Liberal party wish to do nothing about it, and those who do are mostly content to do something that looks like something while studiously avoiding the one solution that has been shown to work. The latest greenhouse gas emissions data released by the Department of Environment last week showed that during the carbon price period emissions continually fell, and since its end they have continually risen. And yet Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg – in the spirit of the Liberal party philosophy – have to come up with a policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that avoids not just putting a price on carbon but even looking like doing so. Thus we get a policy that barely even looks like they’re trying to achieve something and which is clearly designed not to achieve its aim. And of course, economic policy is not excused from the pretence of care or accompanying lack of policy. The latest wage growth figures showed yet again that wages have not risen in real terms in the past year. This is a problem for the government because, while the Liberal party has long been a champion of keeping wages growth down in the name of “competitiveness”, its budget is very much in favour of it. The budget’s predictions for strong income tax growth in 2020-21 and 2021-22 are based on wages growth returning to 3.5%. Were that to occur, the budget predicts real wages would grow by 1% in those years. And yet how is this to be achieved? Right now the only wages policy is company tax cuts in the hope that increased investment will improve productivity, which will then (eventually) flow through into stronger wage growth. But in the meantime, the Liberal party has actively sought to reduce workers’ collective bargaining power through increased intervention in union activity, cheered the removal of penalty rates, and strenuously argued against any government intervention that might see a greater increase in the minimum wage. And add to that their long history of criticism whenever a union either seeks or achieves a decent pay raise. Back in January 2014, the then minister for employment, Eric Abetz (yes, again), warned that unless businesses stood up to unions’ pay demands, we risked seeing a “wages explosion”. At the time, overall wages were growing at just 2.7% and not one industry had annual wages growth above 3.5%, which is now the target for all wages for three years’ time. Should wages growth ever actually reach the optimistic levels predicted in the budget, you can bet Liberal party MPs will decry the unions destroying our competitiveness and seek to implement ever more interventionist policy to reduce what power they have left. And no doubt, in the tradition of the cannot-win argument, they will then criticise unions for failing to deliver for their members. "
"Josh Frydenberg has told his state and territory counterparts the emissions reduction trajectory in the national energy guarantee will be steady over 10 years, not back-end loaded as some of his conservative party room opponents have demanded. Frydenberg, the federal energy minister, was clear during a phone hook-up on Friday that Canberra wanted least-cost abatement in the electricity sector, and that meant implementing a linear emissions reduction trajectory between 2020 and 2030, according to sources familiar with the conversation. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Guardian Australia understands that the Australian Capital Territory’s energy minister, Shane Rattenbury, raised concerns during the call about the low ambition of the Neg target, which is a 26% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030, and Frydenberg was pressed to be explicit about the proposed trajectory of emissions reduction – although the tone of the call was said to be constructive overall. After the hook-up Rattenbury, who is a Greens member, continued to express concerns the Labor states have raised over many months about the “woefully inadequate emissions reduction target” in the scheme. “I am concerned that this process will be jeopardised by the Coalition’s refusal to negotiate on issues that are critical to achieving energy reforms in the interests of all Australians,” he said late on Friday. He said he was yet to see evidence that the national energy guarantee would reduce power costs. “It’s more likely that this is a smoke-and-mirrors cost-shift from electricity to other sectors, such as transport and agriculture, that will likely see Australians paying more overall.” “This intransigence on part of the commonwealth suggests the Coalition doesn’t even want an outcome on electricity reform, and would rather discard some of the good proposals the Energy Security Board has put forward on national energy laws.” Friday’s phone hook-up was convened to allow ministers to be briefed on the final design principles of the Neg by the architects of the scheme, the Energy Security Board (ESB), before a critical meeting of the energy council of Coag in August. The 10 August meeting will either make or break the Neg. Any single state or territory has the power to veto the policy. The Neg would impose reliability and emissions reduction obligations on energy retailers and some large energy users by 2020. The ESB has now circulated updated advice about technical elements of the scheme, and Frydenberg has also circulated an updated discussion paper setting out how the emissions reduction obligation will work. The text of the emissions paper, seen by Guardian Australia, doesn’t specify whether the emissions reduction trajectory will be linear or the “hockey stick” proposal being championed by the head of the Coalition’s backbench committee on environment and energy, Craig Kelly. The “hockey stick” trajectory means emissions reduction would be largely deferred to the second half of the decade between 2020 and 2030. Frydenberg will need to take legislation giving effect to the electricity target through the Coalition party room for approval in the event the states agree to the guarantee in August, and Kelly signalled he could cross the floor if Frydenberg implemented a linear emissions reduction trajectory in a recent podcast interview with Guardian Australia. The commonwealth’s paper also keeps open the idea that participants in the energy market would be able to purchase offsets, like carbon credits, to help them meet their emissions reduction requirements under the scheme, but the government is now floating a cap. The paper says capping the amount of offsets that can be used under the scheme “could preserve the investment signal provided by the guarantee, as the market would have certainty about the minimum level of emissions reduction the electricity sector would contribute to meeting the annual electricity emissions targets”. The new paper also restates a commitment to exempting emission-intensive trade-exposed customers entirely from the obligation to reduce emissions. A separate paper from the ESB has signalled that the first 50,000MWh of any market customer’s load will be exempt from the emissions reduction requirement “as an additional measure to support retail market competition”. The exemption means that small players in the energy market will be exempt from the emissions reduction obligation for some or all of their load. “This measure will help smaller market customers meet the emissions reduction requirement, while not having a material impact on overall coverage.” The ESB recognises that the exemption might encourage participants in the national electricity market to split into smaller entities “to gain the benefit of this exemption and avoid responsibility for meeting the electricity emissions target” – and it flags a new anti-avoidance regime to address the risks.  Bruce Mountain, head of the Victorian Energy Policy Centre, said the policy was emerging as more Frankenstein’s monster than a light hand. “The growing predominance of low-emission sources in Australia’s electricity production brings challenges that need to be dealt with, but the ESB’s approach is without precedent; there are much simpler ways to deal with these challenges using the existing mechanisms,” Mountain said. “Complexity has a cost, and customers are forced to bear it. The complex approach the ESB is proposing is unnecessary and easily avoidable.” Guardian Australia foreshadowed earlier on Friday there have been tensions behind the scenes in working groups collaborating with the ESB about the treatment of large energy users in the scheme. The chief executive of the AiGroup, Innes Willox, said after Friday’s phone hook-up there were issues to be ironed out. “One issue that will be important to resolve is whether an opt-out from the reliability obligation for large energy users, as currently proposed, should be replaced with an opt-in arrangement.” “Either way the outcome needs to support a competitive market for electricity where the long-term interests of energy users are met.” Despite the concerns, Willox said the Neg remained the best hope of settling Australia’s decade-long climate and energy wars. “We will do our part to get an outcome in August that delivers what we need on price, reliability and emissions.” “Industry, electricity suppliers, and the wider community all have a stake in the success of the national energy guarantee and in ending a decade of policy uncertainty.”"
"Emissions tests that are impossible for carmakers to cheat show that almost all diesel car models launched in Europe since the “dieselgate” scandal remain highly polluting. The test uses a beam of light to analyse the exhaust plume of a car as it passes and automatic number plate recognition to link the measurement to a specific model. More than 370,000 such measurements taken in the UK, France and other countries have been compiled into new rating system called The Real Urban Emissions Initiative (True) and made available to the public on Wednesday.  Volkswagen was exposed as cheating emissions tests in September 2015. But, without breaking the letter of the law, almost all car manufacturers were producing diesels that emitted far more in real-world driving conditions than in official lab-based tests. This was done by optimising vehicles to pass standardised tests, but the beam test is conducted as cars pass and so cannot be manipulated. The True analysis shows that new diesel models released in 2016 were still on average five over times above the EU’s official baseline limit of 0.08mg of nitrogen oxides (NOx) per kilometre. The 2017 models were a little cleaner, but still nearly four times over.  NOx pollution is at illegally high levels in numerous EU nations. It is estimated to cause 23,500 early deaths a year in the UK, where government plans to cut pollution have been repeatedly ruled so inadequate as to be illegal. Separate research published on Wednesday calculates that diesel cars and vans, which make up less than half the UK’s fleet, cause 88% of the health damage from light vehicles.  The beam tests are continuing and will be able to single out highly polluting models in future. “I see this remote sensing mostly as a screening tool, to see which vehicle models behave suspiciously,” said Peter Mock, at the International Council on Clean Transportation which produced the True rating in partnership with the FIA Foundation and other groups.  Those models highlighted as highly polluting could then be tested by putting a portable emissions measuring system (Pems) on a car, which is more accurate but also much more expensive. Diesel cars shown by the True data to emit far more NOx than the official baseline when on the road included two-litre Fiat Chrysler models – 18 times more – and 1.6-litre Renault Nissan models – 14 times more – though the cars passed legally required tests. “If I was a customer, I would look at these figures at the moment and have to conclude I should not buy a diesel car,” Mock said, noting that the petrol versions are far cleaner. “Even Euro 6 [the most recent standard] diesel vehicles are not performing well at the moment so pretty much all of them should not have access to city centres.” Greg Archer, at campaign group Transport & Environment, which is part of the True initiative, said: “The True rating exposes the legacy of dieselgate – tens of millions of dirty diesels that are still on the roads producing the toxic smog we daily breathe. It identifies the worst performing models and regulators must act to require carmakers to clean these up.” The True rating is a “brilliant” screening tool and also good at monitoring pollution from cars as they get older and enter the used car market, said Nick Molden, chief executive of Emissions Analytics, which performs 300-400 Pems tests every year on new car models and publishes another rating system called the Equa index. But Molden cautioned that the True rating system, which averages the same models across several years, will not show when the latest model has radically cut its pollution. He cites the example of a Mercedes model that improved significantly between 2014 and 2017: “It went from quite dirty to really quite clean.” Since September 2017, new cars have had to pass a road-based test, but an EU compromise with the industry means emissions can still legally be double the baseline limit. Molden said car manufacturers are now very wary of being caught launching cars that fail emissions tests and some new diesel models are very clean, sometimes 50% below the baseline. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, said: “Thanks to massive investment, each generation of vehicle is more advanced than the last, with significantly lower pollutant emissions. This is acknowledged by the [True] report, and consumers can be assured that new cars on sale today are the cleanest ever and fully compliant with EU emissions standards.” The new analysis of the health impact of diesel in the UK was conducted by experts at the University of Oxford and University of Bath in advance of Clean Air day 2018 on 21 June. They used data on the number of vehicles and mileage, along with government estimates of the harm caused by pollution. The researchers found the health damage from diesel vehicle emissions are about 20 times greater than from electric vehicles and five times more than petrol vehicles. Christian Brand, at the University of Oxford, said: “Cars and vans are responsible for 10,000 early deaths each year, and diesel vehicles are the main problem unfortunately.”"

"Last week, the Washington Post obtained a White House internal memo that debated how the Trump administration should handle federal climate science reports.  The memo presented three options without endorsing any of them: conducting a “red team/blue team” exercise to “highlight uncertainties in climate science”; more formally reviewing the science under the Administrative Procedure Act; or deciding to just “ignore, and not seek to characterize or question, the science being conducted by Federal agencies and outside entities.”  In short, the White House considered ‘debating’ established climate science, casting doubt on scientists’ conclusions, or just ignoring them. Accepting and/or acting on the findings of the scientific experts is not an option they’re willing to consider. So according to this memo, the administration considered 3 options--(1) framing reality as being up for debate; (2) developing their own view of reality; or (3) ignoring reality--and went with option 3.Interesting that ""accepting reality"" was not an option. https://t.co/ejqBOEa0B0 Meanwhile, a paper published in Nature last week concluded that limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures would save more than $20tn as compared to a temperature of 2°C. The carbon pollution cuts needed to achieve the 1.5°C target would cost about $300bn more than efforts to meet 2°C. In other words, the economic benefits of the more aggressive target would outweigh its costs by a factor of about 70-to-1. Current international climate policies will only limit global warming to about 3–3.5°C global warming, and America’s policies are “critically insufficient” to meet either the 2°C or 1.5°C targets. Under the Trump administration, the US has no plans to try and cut its carbon pollution, and in fact the administration has been taking every possible step to undo established climate policies and increase pollution from the coal and oil industries, even though global warming will especially hurt Trump country. Basically, taking aggressive action to curb global warming would save the world a lot of money, and it would especially benefit the economies in southern, conservative states. But it wouldn’t be good for the fossil fuel industry, and the Trump administration has prioritized short-term corporate profits above all else, including American welfare and lives. There’s a 97% expert consensus that humans are causing global warming, and the scientific research is clear that the consequences of continued rapid climate change could be devastating for the economy and for all species on Earth. The case for the Trump administration approach – ignoring and casting doubt on the conclusions of climate science experts – is that of a bad gambler. It’s not a 100% consensus; maybe the less than 3% of climate contrarians are onto something. Perhaps the experts are wrong and climate change won’t be so bad. If the stakes were something inconsequential like a Trump steak, that would be fine, but it should go without saying that betting the future of humanity and life on Earth on a less than 3% long shot is a bad idea. The stakes could not be higher. Prudent risk management dictates that we should be taking serious steps to mitigate the chances of such a disastrous outcome. That’s why Americans buy home and auto and health insurance. It’s why fewer than 17% of Americans today are smokers, down from 42% in 1965. Not only is global warming denial terrible policy, but it’s bad for the long-term health of the Republican Party. There’s a climate change generation gap – most young Americans realize that humans are causing global warming, and young conservatives want their leaders to do something about it. Climate change impacts will only become more severe over time, and today’s youth know that they’ll have to live with the consequences of our actions today. They simply can’t afford denial, and the GOP risks losing these voters forever by willfully ignoring the problem that poses an existential threat to young Americans. There are a few glimmers of hope in the party. Trump’s new Nasa administrator now accepts climate science. Eight House Republicans signed a letter to leaders of the Appropriations Committee urging them to reject any provisions in the 2019 spending bill that would undermine efforts to combat climate change. The conservative Climate Leadership Council proposed a free market, small government, revenue-neutral carbon tax ready to go as soon as the GOP can elect a leadership that’s willing to make a great climate change deal. But right now the GOP is still stuck being, as Governor Bobby Jindal (R-LA) described it five years ago, “the stupid party.” Its leadership won’t even consider the possibility that 97% of climate science experts are right. That denial is going to be very expensive, and as Americans increasingly accept the realities of climate change, it will also land the GOP on the endangered species list."

"The frequency of coastal flooding from high tides has doubled in the US in just 30 years, with communities near shorelines warned that the next two years are set to be punctuated by particularly severe inundations, as ocean levels continue to rise amid serious global climate change concerns. Last year there was an average of six flooding days per area across 98 coastal areas monitored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) – an all-time record. More than a quarter of these locations tied or broke their records for high tide flood days, the federal agency states in a new report. Known as “sunny day flooding”, these events swamp streets and homes with water simply from the incoming tide, without the aid of a storm. Noaa said that in 2017 areas across the US north-east and Gulf of Mexico were worst hit, with Boston, Massachusetts, and Atlantic City, New Jersey, both experiencing 22 days of flooding, while Galveston, in Texas, was soaked on 18 different days. Noaa warned that cyclical climatic conditions during 2018 and 2019 “may result in higher than expected flood frequencies” in around half of the coastal sites it measures.  The longer-term trend is even more certain, Noaa said, with melting glaciers, thermal expansion of sea water and altered ocean currents pushing the sea level steadily higher and causing further floods.  “Breaking of annual flood records is to be expected next year and for decades to come as sea levels rise, and likely at an accelerated rate,” the report states. “Though year-to-year and regional variability exists, the underlying trend is quite clear: due to sea level rise, the national average frequency of high tide flooding is double what it was 30 years ago.” The Noaa report is “comprehensive” and “clearly illustrates the increasing problems along our coastlines”, said Ben Horton, a sea level rise expert at Rutgers University. “There is flooding on all our coastlines, places where people live and work. There needs to be a national response to that.”  Last year was marked by three high-profile hurricanes that pummelled the US, triggering flooding that resulted in dozens of deaths and billions of dollars in damage. Scientists have found that warming temperatures, driven by human activity, is making hurricanes stronger, but it is also exacerbating more chronic nuisance flooding events by pushing up the level of the ocean. “There’s a clear upwards trend of this type of flooding,” said Andrea Dutton, a geologist at the University of Florida. “Extreme events like hurricanes may be the breaking point but this sort of frequent flooding is the taste of what is coming in the future on a permanent basis. We need to rethink our relationship with the coastline because it’s going to be retreating for the foreseeable future.” Dutton said that south Florida, where weather forecasts in some places now come with tidal warnings, and fish are a regular sight on flooded roads, is particularly vulnerable. The low-lying region sits on porous limestone, which pushes up floodwater from underground, and many communities are unable to easily retreat because they back on to the Everglades wetlands. “They used to get just one day a year of tidal flooding, now it’s two months of it in the fall,” she said. “Engineering can help delay things but ultimately the oceans will win. We are going to have to live with the water.” Globally, the seas have risen by an average of nearly three inches since 1992. Parts of the US coastline are unusually prone, with Noaa forecasting last year that the oceans could swell by more than eight feet by 2100.  Despite the risk posed to the US by sea level rise and flooding events, there is no national plan to deal with the issue, with much of the adaption work left to states and counties. The Trump administration has rescinded previous rules to build federally funded infrastructure with climate change in mind and has sought to reverse various measures aimed at taming global warming. “We need to take this report as a warning to prepare ourselves, or we will just sit around and wait for disaster to happen,” Dutton said."

"A member of Congress has suggested that the White Cliffs of Dover tumbling into the English Channel was causing rising sea levels.  Republican Mo Brooks of Alabama pushed back at the notion that rising sea levels were the result of global warming in a hearing of the House Science, Space and Technology on Wednesday.  Instead, Brooks pointed to silt deposition as well as erosion as a cause of rising sea levels. Questioning scientist Phil Duffy of the Woods Hole Research Center, Brooks postulated that silt and mud washed by rivers into the ocean caused water levels to rise as it settled on the sea floor. “Now you have got less space in those oceans because the bottom is moving up,” he said.  He went on: “What about the White Cliffs of Dover … [and] California, where you have the waves crashing against the shorelines, and time and time again you have the cliffs crashing into the sea? All of that displaces water which forces it to rise, does it not?” Duffy answered: “I’m pretty sure on human timescales, those are minuscule effects.” The questioning went on as Brooks argued the Antarctic ice sheet was actually growing. A recent study reported that the ice sheet had shrunk by 1,463km from 2010 to 2016. Duffy disagreed, noting that “we have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage”, citing “the National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration” for his data. However, Brooks insisted: “Well, I’ve got a Nasa base in my district, and apparently, they’re telling you one thing and me a different thing.” Brooks said: “There are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing. Now, you could make a different argument if you want to talk about Greenland or the Arctic.” Brooks, a graduate of Duke University and University of Alabama School of Law, was first elected to Congress in 2010 from his North Alabama district. In 2017, he mounted an unsuccessful bid for the US Senate vacated by attorney general Jeff Sessions. Brooks finished third in the Republican primary behind the eventual nominee Roy Moore as well as appointed incumbent Luther Strange."
"The decision to go ahead with the third runway at Heathrow was taken two years ago; Chris Grayling’s confirmation yesterday marked the point when it seemed to its promoters that enough of the opposition on the ground had been defeated, so it was safe to proceed with a final vote in three weeks’ time. If that is won, and all goes according to plan, the bulldozers will go in around 2021, when the inevitable cycle of cost overruns and slipping deadlines can begin, 31 years after the project was first mooted. By then the UK may be two years into a lengthy “transitional” post-Brexit period, and the bright economic forecasts which are used to justify the plan may be no more use than hot air balloons. There is a case that air travel has made life better for many people and that more of it would continue to do so. Nearly two-thirds of Heathrow’s present traffic is leisure flying. Mass tourism has boosted the economy of many countries and greatly enlarged our experience of the world, and perhaps our sympathies as well. However unpleasant the experience of a modern airport can be, through which we are run like rats in a maze of shopping malls and security checks, it still seems better to many of us than being trapped in our own countries all year round. Heathrow as it stands today is an unimposing portal to Britain. Failing to expand it is simply sabotaging the country. Beyond that, the country is dependent, like all others, on air freight. So the plans for expansion are in some ways well motivated. We can even overlook the fact that they are promoted by Mr Grayling, a man notoriously unable to make even trains run on time.  Much of the opposition is simply nimbyism. Those West London Tory MPs who claim to be opposed to Heathrow’s third runway on environmental grounds, and then propose that it be built onto Gatwick or Stansted instead illustrate this clearly. There is some amusement to be derived from the rumoured machinations to allow the foreign secretary (the MP for local Uxbridge) to be out of the country on the occasion of the vote, so that he does not have to live up to his stated determination to oppose it even if he has to lie down in front of the bulldozers, but this is a frivolity, like most things about Mr Johnson. The serious objections to the plan remain, as they have been for most of this century, the environmental ones. The simple fact is that it is impossible to combine a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 with the strategic encouragement of air travel. Mr Grayling’s statement made much play of technological advances. Aircraft will be quieter, cleaner, and greener, he said. It is entirely possible that they will be quieter, and the promise of an enforceable night time curfew when even the quieter planes will be silent must have done much to still some of the opposition from under the flight path. But the lasting damage the planes do is silent and far from the airport. It is their emissions in the upper atmosphere which drive climate change and all its disastrous effects. Nor can those be confined to the poorer parts of the world, as we’re already seeing. As the world warms, the price of mass tourism will be paid in mass migrations. It is true that aircraft have got lighter and more fuel efficient, but this is of no benefit to the environment if there are more of them, flying more often – and that is the underlying logic of the Heathrow expansion. In the long term, which gets closer every day, the only answer to the problem of fossil fuels is to keep them in the ground. Doing so demands that we keep aircraft on the ground as well. MPs should reject this plan when it comes to the vote."
"After hearing that the glaciers of the Rocky Mountains are rapidly vanishing, financial consultant Garrett Fisher took a novel course of action – he flew a light aircraft, built in 1949, low and alone over the mountains in order to photograph them. Fisher spent much of his summer in 2015 flying over places such as Yellowstone, Glacier National Park and Grand Teton National Park, taking stunning pictures of retreating glaciers for a new book.  Fisher said the enormity of the loss was apparent from his plane, where he took in whole ecosystems such as the Wind River Range in Wyoming, which contains several major rivers that provide water for a large surrounding area. “I’m completely resigned that they will all disappear; I was basically racing to see them before they are gone,” Fisher said. “There’s a bit of bleakness that our planet is going into unchartered territory.” Glaciers, which are vast masses of snow and ice that move under their own weight, are receding at varying rates around the world due to rising global temperatures. Glacier National Park in Montana has seen some of the most dramatic recorded losses, with glaciers set to disappear from the park as early as 2030. Globally, glaciers have lost around 400bn tons in mass a year since 1994, which is raising concerns for the millions of people and animals that rely upon glaciers for melt water. The retreat of huge glaciers in Antarctica and Greenland is also driving sea level rise. The decline of glaciers has previously been illustrated by comparative pictures showing how the modern ice masses looked several decades previously, and more recently. But individual images of modern glaciers can also contain evidence of retreat, according to Lisa McKeon, a physical scientist at the US Geological Society. “Pictures don’t really show the loss in ice volume but they can show the loss of area,” she said. “You can see previous moraines, which are rocks pushed by a glacier’s movement, far from the current edge of the glacier.” McKeon has previously exhibited her own collection of comparative photos of glacier retreat at various galleries, where she left a comment book for visitors to log their thoughts. “I’ve perused the comment book for the past two years or so, there’s a lot of sadness there,” she said. “It’s change. It evokes a sense of loss.”  Fisher’s book contains 177 pictures, many of them taken in precarious conditions, as the wind tossed the 69-year-old Piper PA11 plane that Fisher’s grandfather refurbished after he found it in a dilapidated condition in a North Carolina barn in the 1980s. “I learned to fly in this plane,” said Fisher, who is from New York state but has spent a lot of time in Colorado and studied Rocky Mountain National Park there. “There is no heat, the door had to be open when taking pictures so there was an ungodly cold. The plane only has 100 horsepower but when you get to 15,000ft it only has around half of that. I would just go off on my own and hope the engine didn’t fail.” Flying over Glacier National Park, in Montana, was the most challenging because of the “most absurd terrain, the extreme wind, the concentration of grizzly bears if I did have to land – I really didn’t want to go down there,” Fisher said."

"Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions continue to soar, increasing for the third consecutive year according to new data published by the Department of Environment and Energy. The Turnbull government published new quarterly emissions data late on Friday which reveals Australia’s climate pollution increased by 1.5% in the year to December 2017.  The expansion in LNG exports and production is identified as the major contributor to the increase, but the data shows a jump in emissions across all sectors – including waste, agriculture and transport – except for electricity, the one area that recorded a decrease in emissions. In particular, the department’s data shows a 10.5% increase in fugitive emissions from the production, processing, transport, storage, transmission and distribution of fossil fuels such as coal, crude oil and natural gas, driven by an increase of 17.6% in natural gas production. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon It comes at a time when the government has been pressuring states and territories to lift bans on fracking for new unconventional gas development and just weeks after the Northern Territory announced it would end its ban on fracking. Publication of the data also comes after Australia recorded its hottest and driest April in 21 years.  Australia’s emissions levels are now higher than they were in 2012 and have climbed 3.6% since the carbon price was repealed in 2014. Between 2007 and 2013, under the previous federal government, carbon pollution declined by more than 11%.  The Australian Conservation Foundation said on Monday it was embarrassing that a developed country such as Australia was recording rising climate pollution, and the Turnbull government was failing on climate policy. “This data confirms pollution is rising from transport, industry and gas production because there is no plan from Canberra to replace burning polluting coal, oil and gas with clean energy,” the ACF’s Gavan McFadzean said. “The federal budget contained no new money to incentivise industry and landowners to clean-up their act. The Climate Change Authority will be worse off to the tune of $550,000. Yet there is money for miners: the diesel fuel rebate remains in place.” The organisation also questioned why the government was years behind markets such as the United States and Canada in the introduction of tougher pollution standards for vehicles.  Labor’s climate change and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said seasonally adjusted data showed emissions jumped by 0.83% in just the last quarter alone. “Yet, just last week, Malcolm Turnbull’s government delivered a budget which has no policy to drive down pollution and combat climate change,” he said.“Acting on climate change is not a priority – it is not even on the agenda – for this out-of-touch government.” Blair Palese, 350.org Australia’s CEO, said “with numbers like these, Australia may as well not be signed up to Paris to act on climate because we’re making no progress at all.” “We can blame the federal government’s inability to stand up to fossil fuel interests and its failure to give any meaningful support to renewable energy for Australia’s increasing emissions.” Matthew Doman, director at the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) said it was not surprising that the industry’s emissions profile had grown alongside an increase in production. “The report highlights that the growth in emissions from gas production is less than the growth in gas production,” he said. “This highlights that the emissions intensity of Australian gas production is declining as the industry becomes more efficient and improves its carbon performance.” He said the industry managed fugitive emissions in a range of ways, including through the use of “green completions”, a process that captures and filters out impurities from wells instead of burning them off.  Comment has been sought from the minister for environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg."
"Donald Trump barely had time to leave a sun-drenched Rose Garden after announcing the US exit from the historic Paris climate change agreement before the backlash began. The voluntary deal, aimed at curbing global temperature rise to under 2C, was “draconian” and would cause a “very diminished quality of life” for Americans, Trump said on 1 June last year. “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” the president added. Almost immediately, Bill Peduto, the mayor of Pittsburgh, retorted via Twitter: “I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future.” In the year since, an alliance of American cities, states and green groups have flung themselves at the gaping void left by Trump’s decision to remove the world’s second-largest carbon polluter from a deal aimed at preserving the livability of much of the planet. This coalition has experienced a bruising 12 months during which successes at a local level have been regularly overshadowed by an administration intent on tearing down any edifice of climate policy.  Pittsburgh is one of 405 municipalities representing 70m Americans that are signed on to the Climate Mayors initiative, which has blossomed in the past year. More than 80 US cities - some, like San Diego, run by Republicans - have committed to 100% renewable energy.  A broader group of several thousand businesses – including Amazon, Levi Strauss & Co and Google – cities and states have pledged to follow the Paris goals via the We Are Still In coalition, spearheaded by the billionaire former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and the California governor, Jerry Brown. Brown has attacked Trump’s “reckless disregard” for climate change and said California will launch its own climate-monitoring satellites if Republicans hobble Nasa’s science programs.  “The collective commitments of business and state governments have sent a powerful signal that they are not stepping into line with the federal government when it comes to their attitude to climate – and they must continue with determination,” said Helen Clarkson, chief executive of the Climate Group, which runs a 100% clean energy pact joined by companies such as Apple, Kellogg’s and Visa.  This backlash has spurred cities to quicken the pace in certain areas – New York is to electrify its bus fleet and Los Angeles has promised to abandon coal-fired electricity. New York has also vowed to divest from fossil fuels and is suing the world’s largest oil companies for their role in escalating sea level rise, heatwaves and natural disasters. Meanwhile, states such as California and New Jersey have heightened targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions while ramping up solar and wind energy capacity.  Environmental groups, bolstered by a surge in donations after Trump’s election, have pushed for the retirement of US coal power plants, with some success – more than half of the coal facilities operating in 2011 have been earmarked for retirement, primarily due to strong competition from cheap natural gas. “Trump was a momentum killer so the job now is to rebuild momentum,” said Bill McKibben, co-founder of the climate group 350.org. “It’s powerful to see cities and states stepping up. Global warming is the biggest thing humans have ever done and in a rational world we’d all come together to address it. But we don’t live in a rational world, so smaller entities are having to fill the gap.” Still, the antipathy of the Trump administration towards climate action is taking its toll. US energy emissions are at a 25-year low due to trends in energy efficiency and the decline of coal. But at a juncture when far deeper emissions cuts are required to avoid 2C of warming, the US is in danger of stalling – by 2025, the US is set to achieve only half of the reductions it pledged in Paris, according to a new analysis. The Trump administration threatens to overwhelm the defiance shown by cities and states by reversing vehicle emissions standards, loosening regulations around oil and gas drilling and working to scrap Barack Obama’s centerpiece clean power plan. Trump, who donned a coal miner’s helmet during the 2016 presidential campaign, has claimed he has “ended the war on beautiful, clean coal”. Trump’s promise to withdraw from the Paris deal – which can’t become reality until November 2020 due to notice periods – hasn’t caused the agreement to unravel. But it has certainly shifted the international dynamics of the accord, despite the best efforts of US cities and states to provide a countervailing view. “It’s good news that other countries haven’t walked away,” said Todd Stern, who led talks for the US in Paris. “The less positive part is that it has been very damaging for the US. In the absence of the US, we are seeing some countries try to pull back on what was agreed to in Paris. When you have the largest historical emitter not part of the deal, that is obviously not good.”  Last year the US was rattled by three savage hurricanes that caused record damages, serving as a sobering reminder that even if anti-Trump jurisdictions ameliorate the worst of the reversals, it may not be enough to stave off some punishing consequences. “Everyone is doing their best but it’s not like there are levers of power to pull in Washington at the moment,” said McKibben. “The problem with climate change is that it’s a timed test. The physics of the planet aren’t in a holding pattern. You lose a few years and there goes an ice cap.”"
"Thirty years after a former Nasa scientist sounded the alarm for the general public about climate change and human activity, the expert issued a fresh warning that the world is failing “miserably” to deal with the worsening dangers. While Donald Trump and many conservatives like to argue that climate change is a hoax, James Hansen, the 77-year-old former Nasa climate scientist, said in an interview at his home in New York that the relevant hoax today is perpetrated by those leaders claiming to be addressing the problem.   Hansen provided what’s considered the first warning to a mass audience about global warming when, in 1988, he told a US congressional hearing he could declare “with 99% confidence” that a recent sharp rise in temperatures was a result of human activity. Since this time, the world’s greenhouse gas emissions have mushroomed despite repeated, increasingly frantic warnings about civilization-shaking catastrophe, from scientists amassing reams of evidence in Hansen’s wake. “All we’ve done is agree there’s a problem,” Hansen told the Guardian. “We agreed that in 1992 [at the Earth summit in Rio] and re-agreed it again in Paris [at the 2015 climate accord]. We haven’t acknowledged what is required to solve it. Promises like Paris don’t mean much, it’s wishful thinking. It’s a hoax that governments have played on us since the 1990s.” Hansen’s long list of culprits for this inertia are both familiar – the nefarious lobbying of the fossil fuel industry – and surprising. Jerry Brown, the progressive governor of California, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, are “both pretending to be solving the problem” while being unambitious and shunning low-carbon nuclear power, Hansen argues.  There is particular scorn for Barack Obama. Hansen says in a scathing upcoming book that the former president “failed miserably” on climate change and oversaw policies that were “late, ineffectual and partisan”. Hansen even accuses Obama of passing up the opportunity to thwart Donald Trump’s destruction of US climate action, by declining to settle a lawsuit the scientist, his granddaughter and 20 other young people are waging against the government, accusing it of unconstitutionally causing peril to their living environment. “Near the end of his administration the US said it would reduce emissions 80% by 2050,” Hansen said. “Our lawsuit demands a reduction of 6% a year so I thought, ‘That’s close enough, let’s settle the lawsuit.’ We got through to Obama’s office but he decided against it. It was a tremendous opportunity. This was after Trump’s election, so if we’d settled it quickly the US legally wouldn’t be able to do the absurd things Trump is doing now by opening up all sorts of fossil fuel sources.” Hansen’s frustrations temper any satisfaction at largely being vindicated for his testimony, delivered to lawmakers on 23 June 1988.  Wearing a cream-coloured suit, the soft-spoken son of Iowan tenant farmers hunched over the microphone in Washington to explain that humans had entered a confronting new era. “The greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate now,” he said.  Afterwards, Hansen told reporters: “It is time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here.” He brandished new research that forecast that 1988 was set to be the warmest year on record, as well as projections for future heat under three different emissions scenarios. The world has dutifully followed Hansen’s “scenario B” – we are “smack on it” it, Hansen said last week – with global temperatures jumping by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century. These findings hadn’t occurred in a vacuum, of course – the Irish physicist John Tyndall confirmed that carbon dioxide is a heat-trapping gas in the 1850s. A 1985 scientific conference in Villach, Austria, concluded the temperature rise in the 21st century would be “greater than in any man’s history”. The changes in motion would “affect life on Earth for centuries to come”, the New York Times warned the morning after Hansen’s testimony. Three decades of diplomacy has blossomed into an international consensus, albeit rattled by Trump, that the temperature rise must be curbed to “well below” 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times. But in this time emissions have soared (in 1988, 20bn tons of carbon dioxide was emitted – by 2017 it was 32bn tons) with promised cuts insufficient for the 2C goal. Despite the notable growth of renewable energy such as solar and wind, Hansen believes there is no pathway to salvation without a tax on carbon-producing fuels. “The solution isn’t complicated, it’s not rocket science,” Hansen said. “Emissions aren’t going to go down if the cost of fossil fuels isn’t honest. Economists are very clear on this. We need a steadily increasing fee that is then distributed to the public.” Hansen faced opposition even before his testimony – he recalls a Nasa colleague telling him on the morning of his presentation “no respectable scientist” would claim the world is warming – and faced subsequent meddling and censorship from George HW Bush’s administration.  He eventually retired from Nasa in 2013 and promptly reinvented himself as an activist who was arrested, wearing his trademark hat, outside the White House while protesting against the Keystone oil pipeline. The dawdling global response to warming temperatures means runaway climate change now looms. The aspirational 1.5C (2.7F) warming target set in Paris could be surpassed by 2040. Huge amounts of ice from western Antarctica are crashing into the ocean, redrawing forecasts for sea level rise. Some low-lying islands fear extinction.  “It’s not too late,” Hansen stressed. “There is a rate of reduction that’s feasible to stay well below 2C. But you just need that price on carbon.”  John Holdren, who was Obama’s chief science adviser, told the Guardian that the Paris agreement achieved what was possible without support from Congress and that legally binding lawsuits would be “problematic”. However, he added that while he had reservations about Hansen’s policy ideas he was one of the “true giants” of climate science. “Poor Jim Hansen. He’s a tragic hero,” said Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard academic who studies the history of science. “The Cassandra aspect of his life is that he’s cursed to understand and diagnose what’s going on but unable to persuade people to do something about it. We are all raised to believe knowledge is power but Hansen proves the untruth of that slogan. Power is power.” That power has been most aggressively wielded by fossil fuel companies such as Exxon and Shell which, despite being well aware of the dangers of climate change decades before Hansen’s touchstone moment in 1988, funded a network of groups that ridiculed the science and funded sympathetic politicians. Later, they were to be joined by the bulk of the US Republican party, which now recoils from any action on climate change as heresy. “Obama was committed to action but couldn’t do much with the Congress he had,” Oreskes said. “To blame the Democrats and Obama is to misunderstand the political context. There was a huge, organized network that put forward a message of confusion and doubt.” Climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who testified at the same 1988 hearing about sea level rise, said the struggle to confront climate change has been “discouraging”. “The nasty anti-science movement ramped up and now we are way behind.” “I’m convinced we will deal with the problem,” he said. “[But] not before there is an amount of suffering that is unconscionable and should’ve been avoided.” "
"A James Cook University boss says media reports about its sacking of controversial marine scientist Peter Ridd are “misleading and untrue” and that his academic freedom had always been upheld. In an exclusive interview with Guardian Australia, deputy vice chancellor Prof Iain Gordon said he was frustrated at reports claiming Ridd was sacked for his fringe views on climate change or for his rejection of the scientific evidence linking human activity to degradation of the Great Barrier Reef. • Sign up to receive the top stories every morning “We defend Peter’s right to make statements in his area of academic expertise and would continue to do that until we are blue in the face,” Gordon says. “The issue has never been about Peter’s right to make statements – it’s about how he has continually broken a code of conduct that we would expect all our staff to stick to, to create a safe, respectful and professional workplace.” Ridd’s case has been followed extensively in conservative media, where it has been claimed he was fired for his rejection of the science of human-caused climate change and of evidence that the Great Barrier Reef is threatened by global warming and poor water quality from dredging and farm run-off. Ridd was sacked in May, prompting an outcry among conservative commentators and climate science deniers.  Politicians including the former prime minister Tony Abbott, the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, the assistant science minister, Zed Seselja, and independent MP Bob Katter have gone on the record expressing concern about Ridd’s sacking. The National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) last week called for JCU to reinstate Ridd, arguing he was allowed to publicly question the university’s decisions. Michael McNally, Queensland NTEU secretary, wrote: “Given the nature of the (entirely predictable) extensive media coverage, all management have done is to feed a rightwing media narrative that universities are conformist and actively suppress heterodox views on topics such as climate change.” In November 2017 Ridd started court proceedings against JCU over the misconduct allegations and, later, his sacking, and raised $260,000 in a crowdfunding campaign to cover legal costs. The disciplinary process began after Ridd wrote a December 2016 email to a News Corp Australia journalist with a report attached, claiming the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, which is based at JCU, was knowingly using “misleading” historical pictures of degraded reef. That email was forwarded to a JCU academic, who complained, leading the university to investigate and issue a formal censure, saying Ridd had broken the university’s code of conduct. Ridd defended his actions and denied his alleged breach.  Against the university’s instructions, Ridd later spoke about the disciplinary proceedings, repeating some of his criticisms and then, in later interviews, claimed the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies “can no longer be trusted”. Both AIMS and the coral studies centre have staff based at JCU. Ridd later published “private and confidential” correspondence on a blog and wrote about the issue on a crowdfunding page, while repeating other claims in further interviews and on his website. “There has never been any constraint on Peter to express his opinion,” Gordon says. He pointed to a “viewpoint” paper Ridd had cowritten for a journal in late 2017 that had laid out his claims about a lack of quality control in scientific studies related to the Great Barrier Reef. Some of the scientists Ridd had criticised responded, saying his claims were largely based on misinterpretations and “selective use of data”. Gordon said: “That is what you would except an academic to do – to publish their views on the ways in which data is interpreted and that gives other academics the chance to rebut his particular views. “So this is not about academic freedom. It is to do with the code of conduct at the university and the ways in which he had transgressed that code of conduct that we would expect any member of our staff to adhere to.” He said the university was now trying to “put the record straight” about why it had disciplined and then sacked Ridd, amidst media claims he was muzzled because of is his views on climate change, reef science and his academic freedom was not upheld. “The university characterises the coverage of this issue in the media as untrue and misleading,” Gordon says. “There is a significant amount of information out there that would allow people to come to a conclusion other than those that some outlets are coming to. “This appears to be Peter using the media attention to achieve some ends to his own that I don’t always understand. “It is a mystery to me and I’m genuine about that. We would not have wished this matter to end in the way that it did, but ultimately we have to ensure we uphold the ethics and the code of conduct of this organisation.” In a termination letter published on Ridd’s website, the university lays out a series of allegations relating to “serious misconduct” which Ridd is challenging in an ongoing court case. Among the allegations, the university says Ridd had “perpetuated a view that you were not allowed to talk to your wife about the disciplinary process, when in fact this was contrary to what you were told by verbally, and in writing … ”. He had denigrated a colleague, disclosed confidential information and “failed to take reasonable steps to avoid or manage a conflict of interest between your own interests and the interests of the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) and the interests of the university”. The IPA has been a key promoter of climate science denialism for two decades, publishing books and sponsoring speaking tours. The Melbourne-based thinktank has supported Ridd, helped his crowdfunding campaign and given him $8,566 to pay for initial legal advice. Ridd’s case against JCU is adjourned until later this month."
"Chris Sayer pushed his way through avocado branches and grasped a denuded limb. It was stained black, as if someone had ladled tar over its bark. In February, the temperature had dropped below freezing for three hours, killing the limb. The thick leaves had shriveled and fallen away, exposing the green avocados, which then burned in the sun. Sayer estimated he’d lost one out of every 20 avocados on his farm in Ventura, just 50 miles north of Los Angeles, but he counts himself lucky. “If that freeze was one degree colder, or one hour longer, we would have had major damage,” he said. Avocado trees start to die when the temperature falls below 28F (-2C) or rises above 100F (38F). If the weather turns cold and clammy during the short period in the spring when the flowers bloom, bees won’t take to the air and fruits won’t develop. The trees also die if water runs dry, or if too many salts accumulate in the soil, or if a new pest starts chewing on its leaves. “All of which is quite possible in the next few decades, as the climate shifts,” Sayer said. The weather had been strange lately, Sayer told me. In the past year, Californians have lived through a historic drought, a massive wildfire that blotted out the sun and a strangely warm winter followed by that unseasonable freeze. When I visited in April, his lemon trees were already loaded with ripe fruit – that usually doesn’t happen until June. “Things are screwy,” Sayer said. The trees are totally confused From the vineyards of the north coast to the orange groves of southern California, farmers like Sayer have been reeling from the weird weather. “We are already suffering the effects of climate change,” said Russ Lester, who grows walnuts at Dixon Ridge Farms, east of Sacramento. “I can look out my window and see trees that don’t have a leaf on them and others that are completely leafed out. “The trees are totally confused.” It might feel like we’re peering into the distant future when we hear that by 2050, temperatures may very well climb four degrees, seas could rise a foot and droughts and floods will become more common. But for farmers planting trees they hope will bear fruit 25 years from now, that seemingly distant future has to be reckoned with now. A lot of the country’s tree crops grow in California, which produces two-thirds of the fruits and nuts for the United States. The same is true of grapevines, which bear abundant fruit for about 25 years (they slow down after that, but can keep going for hundreds of years). It’s in large part because so many farmers are making these long-term gambles on orchard crops that a recent scientific paper noted: “Agricultural production in California is highly sensitive to climate change.” Jay Famiglietti, the senior water scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, goes even further: “It’s a virtual certainty that California will get drier. I don’t think it’s a climate that’s conducive to orchard crops anymore.” In other words, for anyone trying to make money off long-lived crops, climate change is already here. And yet new saplings are pushing out of the ground all over the state. If these farmers were planting an annual crop, like cilantro, they’d be making a bet on the weather for the next 45 days. But they’re planting trees, which means making a bet on the next 40 years. After years of putting it off, Sayer is about to place such a four-decade bet by planting a bunch of new avocado trees. There’s no way Sayer can foresee oncoming climate disaster, if that’s what’s hurtling toward the land his family has worked for the past 130 years in Ventura. He can see just a little bit of what might be coming – as if he’s straining to glimpse signs of danger while blinkered. When I asked him how it felt, he said: “Like I’m about to cross a very busy road with my hood pulled over my head.” When Katherine Jarvis-Shean was a doctoral candidate researching the decline of cold winters a few years back, she thought more farmers should be freaking out. “I used to think, ‘Why aren’t you guys more worried about this? It’s going to be the end of the world.’” After all, many fruit and nut trees require a good winter chill to bear fruit. But after spending a few years as an extension agent for the University of California – working directly with farmers and translating science into techniques they can apply on the land – she understands better. It comes down to this: farmers have a ton of concerns, and the climate is just one of them. “If you decide what to plant based on climate, but then can’t make the lease payment, that’s not sustainable,” Jarvis-Shean said. If you are worried about water running out in 15 years, you might think it’s a good idea to cut down half the state’s almond groves – but if those almond trees are still putting money in your pockets, that wouldn’t make sense until the killer drought hits. That’s the crux of the matter for Sayer, and other farmers I interviewed. They’re concerned about the changing climate, but they always come up with ingenious plans to adapt to bad weather. It’s much harder for them to adapt to an overdrawn bank account. They would grow in any postapocalyptic hellscape you could imagine Sayer grows mostly lemons right now, but they’re not long for this world. “You can see these lemon trees are getting a little rangy looking,” Sayer said, gesturing toward a leafless branch. “This is going to be their last harvest, then they’ve got a date with the chipper.” Sayer knows lemons. He knows how to coddle them in old age, how to nudge them to produce more, how to keep them alive when rains fail, how to protect them from aphids, and snails, and scale insects, and the nematodes in the ground. But this land has provided a home to a citrus orchard for 70 years, and each year more pests accumulate to suck the life from the trees. So Sayer needs to move on from lemons, and he’s settled on avocados. From a climate perspective, the leather-skinned fruit are a risky choice. Avocado trees like their surroundings not too hot and not too cold, and they always need water. One study estimated that climate change would hurt California avocado trees so much that the state’s production could be cut in half by 2050. As the sun burned off the marine layer of clouds over the orchard, Sayer patiently laid out the reasoning that led him to plant avocado trees. He explained that climate poses risks that are easy for outsiders to see – when you’re reading about historic droughts in the newspaper and driving past acres of withered crops, it seems crazy to plant orchards. But farmers often have to contend with other risks that outweigh the danger of bad weather. Sayers puts them into three categories: climate risk, market risk and execution risk. If he were only worried about climate risk, Sayer said, he’d plant prickly pear. “They would grow in any postapocalyptic hellscape you could imagine,” he said. But who would buy them? Most Americans don’t put prickly pear on their shopping lists. So there’s a huge market risk. Then there’s execution risk: the chance that Sayer screws things up. If he didn’t have to worry about that, Sayer might follow his neighbor’s lead and start growing annual crops. He pointed across the road from his farm, where orchards once stood, at a flat expanse of strawberries dotted with hustling pickers. There’s always an appetite for strawberries so they pose a low market risk. And because strawberries get planted every year, they’re not such a big gamble on the changing climate. If a freak storm kills everything growing in Ventura, for instance, Sayer’s neighbor would lose that year’s strawberry crop while Sayer would lose a 30-year avocado investment. Smoothies, toast, ice cream, you name it – that consumption has increased sevenfold since 2000 But the execution risk of switching to strawberries – figuring out how to grow them, buying the right equipment and learning how to sell them – is too high for him. “We’re talking about years of learning,” Sayer said. “It would be like me deciding to go back to college to study medicine.” He’s 52, and not prepared to start fresh. Sayer has one other option that would eliminate all the climate, market, and execution risks: Pave his farmland and build houses. When I visited in April, workers were constructing apartments on what used to be farmland at the end of his street. If more farmers start taking climate risks seriously, a surge of subdivisions could start sprawling across some of the most fertile farmland on the planet. But the thought of that saddens Sayer. He wants to farm. After weighing all those risks, he decided to bet the farm on avocados. These trees are no climate savior – far from it. But Sayer been experimenting with them for decades and understands how they work. He knows he can sell avocados, because he’s tapped into a network that reserves spots for the fruit in every grocery store, and turns sunburned avocados into frozen guacamole. Also, you might have noticed the market is strong: Americans are chowing down so much avocado tonnage in new, creative ways – smoothies, toast, ice cream, you name it – that consumption has increased sevenfold since 2000. Orchards can endure weird weather brought on by climate change, but if they don’t get any water, the trees will die. In the past, California farmers have always survived droughts by sticking deeper and deeper straws into the ground to suck up groundwater. But since 2014, the state has had a law against depleting aquifers, and farmers soon won’t be able to take out more water than goes in. That policy alarms growers, especially since they can no longer depend on snow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Mountains hold water – in the form of glaciers – through the colder months, then release it during the warmer months. But as the climate heats up, more of the precipitation that fell in California as snow will turn to rain. That means more floods in winter and more droughts in summer. To adapt to this boom-and-bust cycle, a few farmers around California are letting swollen rivers spill into their orchards. If carried out on a large scale, this would slow down rushing flood waters and let them percolate into aquifers. After four years of experimentation in almond groves, scientists have found that this inundation hasn’t hurt the trees. They’ve also identified nearly 700,000 acres under almond trees suitable for recharging groundwater, said Richard Waycott, president of the Almond Board of California. At the same time, growers continue to use less freshwater for irrigation and draw more water recycled from city drainpipes. It looked like someone had irradiated the place with toxic chemicals In another example of climate adaptation, farmers are developing a kind of hyper-local climate engineering, spraying clay dust over their trees to create shade and cool them down in unseasonably hot weather, according to David Zilberman, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. Elsewhere, scientists have planted a pistachio orchard where no self-respecting pistachio farmer would ever put a tree: in the middle of the southern California desert near Coachella. Most pistachio trees grow 200 miles north, where colder winters allow them to settle into their natural cycles. But in a few decades, that traditional pistachio land could have the climate of Coachella. It’s a type of time travel; the idea is to find a version of the future that already exists. The pistachio trees aren’t at all happy in the desert: “It’s just terrible out there,” said Craig Kallsen, another extension agent for the University of California. “It looked like someone had irradiated the place with toxic chemicals.” All the same, a few pistachio trees are beginning to produce leaves. By growing this orchard in this analogue of the climate future, researchers like Kallsen can see which varieties stand up to heat, and then zero in on the genes that allow those trees to adapt. Using those genes, researchers hope to breed trees that can thrive in a hotter, drier world. Sayer is also adapting by growing different varieties of avocados, but the most visible climate adaptation in the orchard was the knee-high carpet of grasses and turnip stems we waded through as we made our way among the trees. “Back in the 1970s, bare dirt between the rows was considered clean and tidy,” Sayer said. “If you had a blade of grass sticking out, oh man, that wasn’t good.” Letting plants grow beneath the trees seemed like a squalid, lazy, weed-spreading hazard. When he and his father first began planting between the rows in 2005, it felt taboo. Other farmers would sidle up to them at the coffee shop and ask in an undertone: “What’s going on with your orchard? Is that a cover crop?” A cover crop protects the soil from heavy rains and helps turn it into a habitat for worms, beetles and thousands of microbes. As we walked through the dappled sunlight, the ground beneath my feet was yielding like a giant sponge. Sayer has calculated that, since first planting the cover crop, his lemon orchard can absorb 2.5m gallons more water in a downpour. “Since every scenario I’ve seen involves water stress, better soil is going to put us in a better position, because it holds and absorbs more rain,” he said. Better soil is going to put us in a better position Lester, the Sacramento-area walnut grower, also plants cover crops. And he has an audacious justification for planting new trees: He hopes to reverse climate change. Cover crops pull carbon from the air into the soil and – if we can figure it out – all of agriculture could become a giant carbon dioxide sponge. Lester powers his operation with solar panels and a walnut shell burning furnace (releasing carbon his walnut trees recently sucked out of the air), making his farm carbon negative. “Call me optimistic, but I believe if all farmers adopted healthy soils technology, agriculture can play a huge role in stopping, slowing down, maybe even reversing climate change,” Lester said. Not all farmers are as scientifically literate as Lester or Sayer; many shrug off climate change as just another shift in the weather. But even the ones who readily accept the science of climate change continue to plant trees. Perhaps they are overly optimistic. Perhaps they are just human: it’s not in our nature to ignore threats right in front of our face so we can focus on those in the seemingly far-off future. Agriculture can play a huge role in stopping, slowing down, maybe even reversing climate change After I’d spent the day with Sayer, his decision to plant more avocados made sense: It’s the choice that allows him to keep farming. He’s making preparations based on the best climate projections he can get, while also setting himself up to react to the unexpected. He can see a path to profitability, though he allows that his vision into the future – in terms of both climate and weather forecasting – is severely restricted. If you recall, he likened planting a new round of avocado trees to crossing a busy road with a hood over his head. There was a second part to that analogy: “At least I know which way to look for the oncoming traffic.” Nathanael Johnson is a senior writer at Grist and the author of two books, Unseen City: The Majesty of Pigeons, the Discreet Charm of Snails & Other Wonders of the Urban Wilderness, and All Natural*: *A Skeptic’s Quest to Discover If the Natural Approach to Diet, Childbirth, Healing, and the Environment Really Keeps Us Healthier and Happier.

"The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, will speak to his state counterparts on Friday as the Energy Security Board finalises the design principles for the national energy guarantee (Neg) and a critical meeting of the Coag energy council looms. Members of the Energy Security Board – the architects of the Neg – met on Thursday to sign off on a new technical document that will be distributed to stakeholders after Friday’s phone hook-up with ministers. Guardian Australia understands the new paper will trigger a final phase of deliberations before the settled policy framework will be shared with Frydenberg and the state ministers on 2 August, ahead of the critical meeting of the energy council on 10 August. The 10 August meeting will either make or break the national energy guarantee, with any state or territory having the power to veto the policy. Ahead of the push to the finish line, Environment Victoria has warned that the proposed emissions reduction target for electricity under the guarantee “is woefully inadequate”. The group says if electricity emissions are reduced by only 26-28% below 2005 levels, other sectors of the Australian economy such as manufacturing, transport and agriculture will have to reduce carbon pollution by 700m tonnes to ensure Australia meets its Paris target. Emissions in these sectors are currently rising and the Turnbull government has produced no policy roadmap to drive emissions reductions in these sectors. A new briefing paper from Environment Victoria warns that if emissions reductions in the electricity sector are back end loaded to the second half of the decade between 2020 and 2030 – an option favoured by some government conservatives – “then more disruptive action will be required later to meet Australia’s cumulative national target”. “In this scenario, between 2021 and 2030, manufacturing, transport and others would need to find emissions reductions equivalent to nearly five years of the electricity sector’s current pollution levels”. The paper also calls for the notice period for adjusting the emissions reduction target in the national energy guarantee to be changed from five years, which is the Energy Security Board’s current guidance, to three. It notes that if the ALP wins the next federal election and implements its proposed emissions reduction target of 45% after five years have elapsed, then emissions reductions in the sector would have to occur at a rate of 15% a year. “This would be historically unusual, disruptive to the economy and could threaten the ability of the government to achieve its Paris commitments. However, with three years notice, the rate of reductions required would be halved and are within the range of reductions achieved by a number of countries in their electricity sectors in recent years,” it says. The National Security Board has seconded a range of experts, bureaucrats and industry players to help draft the policy in a very tight time frame, with working groups considering a range of issues in detail over the past month. The Turnbull government’s policy would impose reliability and emissions reduction obligations on energy retailers and some large energy users by 2020. Guardian Australia understands there has been tension behind the scenes about large energy users and their role in the new policy, including who is caught by the reliability obligations and whether the system should be opt-in rather than mandatory. There have also been arguments about how transparent an emissions registry created under the scheme should be. Some stakeholders want the registry open to the public, and others only want to report their compliance to the regulator. As well as differences of views over technical details, political pressures loom. A number of state energy ministers want the emissions reduction target for electricity to be more ambitious – a demand Frydenberg is not in a position to deliver given a more ambitious target would have to be signed off by the Coalition party room. The Labor states also want the policy to allow a future government to be able to ramp up the level of ambition for emissions reduction without facing significant parliamentary hurdles – again, a demand that is difficult for Frydenberg to deliver given a noisy pocket of opposition in the Coalition party room. The policy faces two hurdles – the first at the August Coag energy council meeting, and the second in the Coalition party room in the event Frydenberg emerges with a sign-off from state counterparts."
"Pope Francis has told oil company chiefs that the world must switch to clean energy because climate change risks destroying humanity. “Civilisation requires energy, but energy use must not destroy civilisation,” he said at the end of a two-day conference at the Vatican.  The pontiff said climate change was a challenge of epochal proportions, and that the world needed to come up with an energy mix that combatted pollution, eliminated poverty and promoted social justice. The unprecedented conference, held behind closed doors at the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, brought together oil executives, investors and Vatican experts. Like the pope, they back scientific opinion that climate change is caused by human activity and that global warming must be curbed. “We know that the challenges facing us are interconnected. If we are to eliminate poverty and hunger ... the more than 1 billion people without electricity today need to gain access to it,” Francis told them. “But that energy should also be clean, by a reduction in the systematic use of fossil fuels. Our desire to ensure energy for all must not lead to the undesired effect of a spiral of extreme climate changes due to a catastrophic rise in global temperatures, harsher environments and increased levels of poverty,” he said.

"In case anyone wondered, this is how the world ends: with the cutest, progressivest, boybandiest leader in the world going fully in the tank for the oil industry. Justin Trudeau’s government announced on Tuesday that it would nationalize the Kinder Morgan pipeline running from the tar sands of Alberta to the tidewater of British Columbia. It will fork over at least $4.5bn in Canadian taxpayers’ money for the right to own a 60-year-old pipe that springs leaks regularly, and for the right to push through a second pipeline on the same route – a proposal that has provoked strong opposition. That opposition has come from three main sources. First are many of Canada’s First Nations groups, who don’t want their land used for this purpose without their permission, and who fear the effects of oil spills on the oceans and forests they depend on. Second are the residents of Canada’s west coast, who don’t want hundreds of additional tankers plying the narrow inlets around Vancouver on the theory that eventually there’s going to be an oil spill. And third are climate scientists, who point out that even if Trudeau’s pipeline doesn’t spill oil into the ocean, it will spill carbon into the atmosphere. Lots of carbon: Trudeau told oil executives last year that “no country would find 173bn barrels of oil in the ground and just leave it there”. That’s apparently how much he plans to dig up and burn – and if he’s successful, the one half of 1% of the planet that is Canadian will have awarded to itself almost one-third of the remaining carbon budget between us and the 1.5 degree rise in temperature the planet drew as a red line in Paris. There’s no way of spinning the math that makes that okay – Canadians already emit more carbon per capita than Americans. Hell, than Saudi Arabians.  Is this a clever financial decision that will somehow make Canada rich? Certainly not in the long run. Cleaning up the tar sands complex in Alberta – the biggest, ugliest scar on the surface of the earth – is already estimated to cost more than the total revenues generated by all the oil that’s come out of the ground. Meanwhile, when something goes wrong, Canada is now on the hook: when BP tarred the Gulf of Mexico, the US was at least able to exact billions of dollars in fines to help with the cleanup. Canada will get to sue itself. No, this is simply a scared prime minister playing politics. He’s worried about the reaction in Alberta if the pipe is not built, and so he has mortgaged his credibility. His predecessor, Stephen Harper, probably would not have dared try – the outcry from environmentalists and First Nations would have been too overwhelming. But Trudeau is banking on the fact that his liberal charm will soothe things over. Since he’s got Trump to point to – a true climate denier – maybe he’ll get away with it. But it seems like a bad bet to me. Faced with the same situation – a revolt over the Keystone XL pipeline – Barack Obama delayed for several years to avoid antagonizing either side. He ultimately decided he couldn’t defend the climate cost of building it, and so became the first world leader to explicitly reject a big piece of infrastructure on global warming grounds. Trudeau has made the exact opposite call, and now we’ll see if pipeline opponents cave.  I was in Vancouver two weeks ago to help activists raise money for lawyers, and I would guess that the civil disobedience will continue – so far, two members of parliament have been arrested, an escalation we’ve never seen even in the States. Coast Salish elders have built a “watch house” along the pipeline route and, as at Standing Rock, other native activists have been pouring in – I’m guessing that making this petro-colonialism officially state sponsored will only harden people’s resolution. The showdown will be powerfully symbolic: kayaktivists, for instance, have paddled peacefully around the pipeline’s terminal, at least until Kinder Morgan put up an ugly razor wire barrier in the middle of the harbor. Now it’s Trudeau who owns the razor wire, Trudeau who has to battle his own people. All in the name of pouring more carbon into the air, so he can make the oil companies back at the Alberta end of his pipe a little more money. We know now how history will remember Justin Trudeau: not as a dreamy progressive, but as one more pathetic employee of the richest, most reckless industry in the planet’s history. "
"Climate change will bring a dystopian future reminiscent of one of her “speculative fictions”, with women bearing the brunt of brutal repression, hunger and war, the Booker prize-winning author Margaret Atwood is to warn. “This isn’t climate change – it’s everything change,” she will tell an audience at the British Library this week. “Women will be directly and adversely affected by climate change.” The author, whose landmark novel The Handmaid’s Tale has been turned into an acclaimed TV series depicting a dystopian future in which women are deprived of all rights and turned into breeding machines for men, predicts conflict, hardship and an increasing struggle for survival for women as climate change takes hold. “More extreme weather events such as droughts and floods, rising sea levels that will destroy arable land, and disruption of marine life will all result in less food,” she explained before the event. “Less food will mean that women and children get less, as the remaining food supplies will be unevenly distributed, even more than they are.” The results she predicts bear a strong similarity to some of the futures she imagines in her fiction, including the post-apocalyptic novel Oryx and Crake, in which the treatment of women in conflict-ridden societies is a strong theme. She went on: “[Climate change] will also mean social unrest, which can lead to wars and civil wars and then brutal repressions and totalitarianisms. Women do badly in wars – worse than in peacetime.” Under Her Eye – the title is taken from The Handmaid’s Tale – will bring together prominent figures from the arts, politics and science in a two-day festival devoted to exploring women’s futures under climate change and environmental damage, and proposals for avoiding the worst effects of global warming, some of which are already “locked in” because of our failure to cut greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as scientists have advised. Alice Sharp, director of the arts and science organisation Invisible Dust, which is curating the festival, told the Guardian she hoped the event would be the first of many. “We think this is the first time that the arts, sciences and politics of climate change have been brought together under one roof with a focus on women,” she said. “Women’s voices are too rarely heard in discussions of climate change.” One of the leading women speaking at the conference is Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, who oversaw the signing of the Paris climate agreement in 2015. She said: “Climate change remains one of the greatest threats to achieving sustainable development and its effects fall hardest on women.” But she sounded a note of hope, acknowledging the activism of women on environmental issues. “Countering this reality is the gritty determination, boundless energy and unwavering spirit of women across the world, whose knowledge, skills and leadership are being harnessed in delivering solutions. Climate change is one area in which women have decisively contributed to the progress we are making.” The two-day event will take place on Friday and Saturday at the British Library, as part of the 2018 centenary of women’s suffrage, and will feature screenings, performances, talks and debates. Among the 40 speakers will be Prof Joanna Haigh, co-director of the Grantham Institute, one of the world’s leading centres on climate policy and science; former Nasa science editor Laura Tenenbaum; Kate Raworth, self-styled “renegade economist” and author of Doughnut Economics; and New Zealand artist Ahilapalapa Rands. Women’s lives, particularly in developing countries, are likely to be more affected by climate change than those of men, because they are so reliant on agriculture, and bear the burden of work such as fetching scarce water and firewood, and have fewer options than men, who tend to be more mobile. Women and children are also worst affected by indoor air pollution, caused by smoky cooking fires. Yet the annual meetings on climate change held by the UN have few forums for discussing the particular problems faced by women, and women make up only a minority of the delegates. Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the UK’s Green party, who will also take part, said: “We know that women in the arts give a unique perspective when it comes to climate change, and that they will have an important role to play in the future. There is a rich history of women guarding our environment, which is why they should be front and central to efforts aiming to counteract climate change.”"
"Pollution reduction targets for 2030 proposed by the Coalition and Labor will not see Australia contributing its fair share to cut greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris climate agreement, according to new research. A paper from the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute finds the Turnbull government’s target of a 26-28% reduction on 2005 levels is “inadequate according to any recognised principle-based approach” and the Labor target of a 45% reduction is “the bare minimum necessary for Australia to be considered to be making an equitable contribution to the achievement of the Paris agreement’s two degree target”. The research analyses Australia’s targets using the conventional approaches used to determine abatement levels – population, cost-sharing, “historic responsibility” and hybrid models. It says in the context of the global carbon budget, neither policy would see Australia doing its fair share. It points out that despite the clarity of the climate science, spelling out the urgent need to reduce emissions to keep surface temperature increases to less than two degrees above pre-industrial levels, the international community is continuing to struggle to agree on an equitable division of the global emissions budget. Individual nation states have been reluctant to incur the economic and political costs associated with mitigation.  “Whether you assess the fairness of a country’s emissions reduction target by population, economic cost, or a combination, our analysis shows Australia’s reduction target is unambitious, unfair and irresponsible,” says Richie Merzian, a former federal climate policy bureaucrat who now runs the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program. The next round of international climate negotiations will be held in the Polish city of Katowice in December this year. The looming talks are critical to ensuring the signatories to the Paris deal maintain the momentum of their various emissions reduction pledges. Unlike the United States, Australia remains in the Paris agreement, despite continued rumbling from conservatives about climate policy. However, the Turnbull government is still struggling to land its national energy guarantee which would impose emissions reductions in the electricity sector. Because of internal pushback within the Coalition, and lobbying by some sectors, the government has not yet flagged a roadmap for emissions reductions across the economy, and there is widespread criticism of the lack of ambition in the target proposed for emissions reduction in electricity. The latest official emissions data shows pollution increased by 1.5% in the year to December 2017. Australia’s emissions levels are now higher than they were in 2012 and have climbed by 3.6% since the carbon price was repealed in 2014. Emissions are increasing in most sectors of the economy – in waste, agriculture and transport. Only one sector of the economy has recorded a decrease – the electricity sector – because aging coal-fired power plants have exited the system, and new renewables projects are coming on stream. Merzian says Australia is continuing to “profit from high emissions rather than take up its fair share of reductions. We are unfairly shirking our global responsibilities onto others.” “As we approach the next climate conference, what UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa is calling Paris 2.0, Australia will come under pressure from our friends and neighbours to lift our game and chip in our equitable share.” “It is in Australia’s best interest to have targets that do our fair share. Inadequate targets that need continual revision bring uncertainty to business. The reduction target uncertainty that has plagued the energy sector will spread and be experienced by all sectors unless we get this right.”"
"Australian companies are not doing enough work to model the risks of climate change and how it will affect their profitability, a new report by a thinktank says. Progressive thinktank the Centre for Policy Development says that while most companies have committed to considering what climate change and the Paris climate agreement means for their business strategy, too few have begun using scenario analysis techniques to model what its impacts could be and how to respond to it. Australia’s financial regulator stepped up its warnings last year that climate change posed a risk to the financial system and urged companies to adapt. The Financial Stability Board’s Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures has identified scenario analysis as a critical tool for companies and investors that are serious about responding to climate risks. CPD policy director Sam Hurley said while many companies had said they will commit to modelling the impacts of climate change and potential responses for their business, few had actually started to undertake that work. He said Australia was potentially exposed to large risks due to climate change, but there were also opportunities. “Scenario analysis is going to be a really important driver of better strategies and of better outcomes for businesses that are preparing for these risks and opportunities,” he said. “Some organisations in Australia have made a start doing that kind of analysis and more have committed to it. “But what we’re going to need to see is more consistent, ambitious scenario analysis so that markets and investors have more accurate information when assessing how well companies are placed for transition to a zero-carbon economy.” Hurley said, internationally, more organisations had begun considering how major emissions reductions and changes in policy as a result of climate change could affect their business and its profitability.  He said some of Australia’s biggest companies in the financial and resources sector already had sophisticated models in place for thinking about climate change and more needed to follow suit. Companies that didn’t could expect scrutiny from their shareholders, as well as regulators.  “The period for words on this is over. What we really need to see over the next reporting season is companies walking the walk as well as talking the talk,” he said. “Expectations around proper management of this issue are increasing and for companies that aren’t doing it, it’s going to be harder and harder to get away with it.” "
"Sumburgh Head lies at the southern tip of mainland Shetland. This dramatic 100-metre-high rocky spur, crowned with a lighthouse built by Robert Louis Stevenson’s grandfather, has a reputation for being one of the biggest and most accessible seabird colonies in Britain. Thousands of puffins, guillemots, razorbills, kittiwakes and fulmars gather there every spring to breed, covering almost every square inch of rock or grass with teeming, screeching birds and their young. Or at least they used to – for this year Sumburgh Head is a quiet and largely deserted place. Where seabirds once swooped and cried in their thousands, only a handful of birds wheel round the cliffs. The silence is uncanny – the result of a crash in seabird numbers that has been in progress for several years but which has now reached an unprecedented, catastrophic low. One of the nation’s most important conservation centres has been denuded of its wildlife, a victim – according to scientists – of climate change, which has disrupted food chains in the North Sea and North Atlantic and left many seabirds without a source of sustenance. The result has been an apocalyptic drop in numbers of Arctic terns, kittiwakes and many other birds. “In the past, Sumburgh Head was brimming with birds, and the air was thick with the smell of guano. The place was covered with colonies of puffins, kittiwakes, fulmars, and guillemots,” said Helen Moncrieff, manager of RSPB Scotland’s office in Shetland. “There were thousands and thousands of birds and visitors were guaranteed a sight of puffins. Today they have to be very patient. At the same time, guillemots have halved in numbers. It is utterly tragic.” This grim description is backed by figures that reveal the staggering decreases in seabird numbers in Shetland, the most northerly part of the British Isles. In 2000, there were more than 33,000 puffins on the island in early spring. That figure dropped to 570 last year and there are no signs of any recovery this year, although it is still early in the season. Similarly, Shetland’s kittiwake population plummeted from over 55,000 in 1981 to 5,000 in 2011, and observers believe those numbers have declined even further in the past few years. Only the lack of a properly funded census has prevented ornithologists from putting precise numbers on the devastation that is occurring. “I went to check our sites at Dalsetter and Troswick last week to compare numbers of Arctic terns with those we counted during Seabird 2000, the last national seabird census carried out across Britain and Ireland,” added Moncrieff. “I found there were around 110 Arctic terns there last week compared with around 9,000 that were counted in the same area in 2000. That is the kind of loss we have sustained here.” This point is backed by Euan Dunn, principal policy officer for the RSPB. “These are apocalyptic numbers,” he told the Observer. “We are seeing something very dramatic happening, something that has never occurred in the history of ornithology up there.” The causes of these devastating declines are many, according to scientists – though most agree that the disappearance of food sources is the main reason. Seabirds rely heavily on sand eels for food, and this supply was severely depleted in northern waters by fishing – though this was eventually halted, allowing stocks to recover. However, these have now been disrupted again by global warming, triggered by rising carbon dioxide emissions from factories, cars and power plants that burn fossil fuels. Temperatures in the North Sea and North Atlantic have risen significantly as a result. “This warming seems to be affecting the availability of plankton at the time when sand eels produce their larvae,” said Dunn. “There is less plankton and the larvae grow less well and survive less well.” Not every coastal area of the UK is affected to the same degree, as has been highlighted in a recent project carried out by the RSPB. Groups of puffins, one of the seabirds worst affected by the current crisis, were tagged at two different locations: Shetland and the Shiant Islands, in the Inner Hebrides, where numbers have remained relatively stable in recent years. In the latter, the birds were found to travel on very short journeys of a few kilometres before they returned to their young with plenty of plump fish. However in Shetland, the picture was found to be starkly different. One of its puffins was found to have to fly more than 400km (248 miles) to find food. “That is more than 10 times further than we thought they were flying,” added Dunn. “Journeys like that are hugely energy consuming and leave the birds very weakened. Not only that, they bring back fish that are much less nutritious than the ones they caught in the good old days when Shetland had plenty of puffins.” A similar story is provided by trackers fitted to guillemots and razorbills from nearby Fair Isle, which has also suffered serious seabird population losses. They too are having to travel hundreds of kilometres to find food. “It explains clearly why our colonies have foundered,” said Dunn. In addition to the sand eel crisis that affects coastal areas of Scotland, there is the problem of plastic which builds up on beaches and is ingested by seabirds, with fulmars being particularly badly affected. “We believe there is plastic in the stomachs of every Shetland fulmar,” said Moncrieff. “If you scaled up what you find in a fulmar’s stomach, it is the equivalent of having a lunch box full of plastic inside your own stomach. There would be no room left for proper food.” The catastrophe that has struck Shetland’s seabird population has been revealed just as similar crises are being reported from other islands round Britain. Puffin numbers have dropped dramatically on the Farne Islands, it was reported last month, while on St Kilda, one of the most significant seabird colonies in the North Atlantic, there has been a 99% reduction in kittiwake nests since 1990. Two years ago, in all the island’s monitored sites, only one pair bred –and that single chick died. Yet as these crises have unfolded, the government has declined to fund a new national census, along the lines of those organised in 1970, 1985 and 2000, even though it is supposed to instigate one every 15 years. “Fortunately, it has now agreed to proceed with one, which we hope should be completed by the end of next year,” said Dunn. “Then we should have a better overall picture of what is happening and why these striking declines are happening in particular places.” For Shetland, the catastrophic decline in many of its key seabird populations is an issue of real concern. The islands are famed for their bleak beauty and have become an important eco-tourism destination. The loss of many of its seabird colonies does not help that cause – though it still has many special attractions: its prehistoric houses and iron age towers, called brochs; a large population of otters (more than 10% of Britain’s otters live here); and increasing numbers of visits by killer whales. As Moncrieff said: “There are still good reasons to come here, but equally the crisis that has hit so many of our seabirds is not something that we can continue to ignore.” • Turtle doves used to arrive in large numbers in April to breed in the British Isles but have now disappeared from large areas of the countryside for a variety of reasons: lack of seed from arable plants; the parasite that carries trichomonosis; and hunting during their migration through southern Europe. As a result, the turtle dove has become the UK’s fastest declining bird and is now considered at risk of global extinction. • Wader populations are declining worldwide thanks to the loss and degradation of habitats, increased predation, and a changing climate. In the UK, this has produced dramatic declines in curlew populations over recent decades – the species has been proposed as the UK’s most important bird conservation priority. • Nightingales and pied flycatchers have declined in large numbers since monitoring of these woodland species began in 1994, leading to their appearance on the red list of endangered bird species in the UK. In total, there are now 16 woodland birds on the red list. • One of five upland bird species that were moved on to the red list recently, the dotterel has declined severely in numbers since the 1980s. Causes for the drop include changes in grazing practices and atmospheric pollution, as well as the effect of climate change, to which mountain-dwelling species are especially vulnerable.

"In the south-west corner of NSW’s Liverpool plains, in an area called Bundella, farmer Megan Kuhn runs beef cattle and merino sheep with her husband, Martin. They have 400 breeding cows that will calve in six weeks. Shortly, 89 of those cows will leave the property, sold to an abattoir because the cost of feeding the animals during drought has become too great. “There is nowhere to send them to pasture so they are going to be slaughtered,” Kuhn says. “We’re killing a cow and a calf at this late stage of pregnancy. The drought is so widespread there’s just no options left for stock producers to put them anywhere. That’s why it’s so heartbreaking. “Australia doesn’t realise. The cattle we’ve got are rapidly diminishing because of the drought.” Further north, about 20 km from Mullaley, Margaret Fleck is seeing conditions on her property she has not encountered in the 20 years she has been there. She and her partner Paul run beef cattle, producing grass-fed beef for the domestic and export markets. December was the end of their seventh calendar year of below-average rainfall. In the 12 months to May this year, they have had just over 50% of their annual average rainfall. “It’s terrible on the back of seven below-average rainfall years in a row,” Fleck says. “We can’t get over a string of really hot summers. With the sheer consistency of extreme temperatures, the rate of evaporating is so high. We don’t have any surface water left on our property.” They are relying on two bores and have begun selling their cattle as it becomes harder to sustain the high cashflow that’s necessary to buy in feed. Everywhere is worse than I've ever seen it “We spoke to the owners who had this property from 1954 to 1989. We asked what the creek was like in their 34 years. They said it had never dried up,” Fleck says. During the past 14 months, the Bureau of Meteorology has recorded below-average rainfall across New South Wales, central Queensland, the north-west of Victoria and into South Australia. NSW has been the hardest hit in 2018. With the exception of the north and south coasts, most of the state has recorded the lowest rainfall in a five-month period since 1900. Soil moisture levels are below average across much of Australia and in its latest winter outlook, the bureau is forecasting warmer and drier than average conditions across large parts of the country. Communities in NSW say people are struggling and the rest of the country is not aware of the extent of the troubles in parts of that state.  “I had noted it hadn’t been getting a lot of attention,” says Jane Judd, a retired science teacher from Coonabarabran who sits on the regional advisory committee of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  “I’m on a number of committees and boards and I’ve travelled from Tamworth to Cobar, Moree to Goulburn, and everywhere is worse than I’ve ever seen it.” Judd owned a farm at the southern end of the Pilliga which she sold several years ago to the national parks service. The property sits in fertile valleys that had permanent water and swamps. She took a drive to the site a month ago and said everything had dried up. Coonabarabran itself is on level-six water restrictions. Last week the Timor dam was at 23.6 % of its capacity and in recent weeks the Warrumbungles shire council has been sourcing water from four bores and the Castlereagh river, rather than the dam. “They’re desperately sinking bores around the town to try and augment the storage capacity of the groundwater,” says Peter Brookhouse, a Coonabarabran resident and retired fire management officer with national parks. “We are seeing extraordinary weather conditions everywhere.” Malcolm Turnbull has been touring drought-stricken parts of the country with the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, and the deputy prime minister and Nationals leader, Michael McCormack. Kuhn says while the tour is welcome, any conversation needs to be more open to voices from those affected. In the next three weeks we’re going to lose our winter crop-sowing window “I admire that they’re on the ground talking to people but it’s too bloody quick,” she says. “It’s a quick fix, it gives nothing tangible for people.” She says there are simple things that could be done to assist farmers in trouble: chopping firewood, helping mend fences or offering assistance to eradicate feral animals such as pigs and goats that wander onto properties in search of water – all jobs that get neglected when farmers are in “a vacuum”, consumed with trying to keep their stock alive. “When you read things about farmers having to destroy their own stock, that’s one of the hardest things a farmer would have to do,” she says. “If you can get help with that from the government to do that – that would be something tangible.” Alistair Donaldson runs a mixed cattle and grain property west of Boggabri. He says the government’s emphasis on preparation for a drought is appropriate because farmers have to make sure the right management approaches are in place before drought sets in. But he believes more can be done to help farmers learn from past experiences and make sure there is solid investment in rural infrastructure.  Donaldson is 55 and has worked in farming his whole life. He has experienced droughts before and says rainfall conditions on his property are similar to those he experienced in 2002. “But what’s made it worse is a series of drier summers leading up to this,” he says.  “The last four or five years we’ve had very dry summers and extreme heat and evaporation events. We’re getting very big temperature spikes now where there never used to be.” He has started selling some of his cattle to feedlots and needs rain to plant winter crops such as oats, wheat, canola and legumes. “The big issue for us is in the next three weeks we’re going to lose our winter crop-sowing window,” he says. “Once you lose that window that will mean that we have no winter crop and that will have huge implications for the whole eastern seaboard.”  This week, farmer and former Nationals leader John Anderson cautioned Turnbull against politicising the drought by attributing it to climate change, telling the Financial Review the conditions were the worst he had experienced, but not unprecedented.

"The world is on track to exceed 1.5C of warming unless countries rapidly implement “far-reaching” actions to reduce carbon emissions, according to a draft UN report leaked to Reuters. The final draft report from the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) was due for publication in October. It is the guiding scientific document for what countries must do to combat climate change. Human-induced warming would exceed 1.5C by about 2040 if emissions continued at their present rate, the report found, but countries could keep warming below that level if they made “rapid and far-reaching” changes. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, almost 200 countries signed up to limit global temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. Climate scientist and Climate Analytics director Bill Hare said the draft report showed with greater clarity how much faster countries needed to move towards decarbonisation under various temperature situations and that the impacts of climate change greatly increased between 1.5C and 2C of warming. Necessary actions include making the transition to renewable energy, powering the transport sector with zero carbon electricity, improving agricultural management and stopping deforestation.  “This IPCC report shows anyone drawing from published papers that there are big differences between 1.5 and 2 degrees warming in both natural and human systems,” Hare said. “Two degrees warming and the tropical reefs have basically no chance – 1.5 degrees, they have a small to modest chance of survival. “There’s a range of commentary that comes out of the report that provides a stronger narrative for us to act than ever before.” He said it showed that if emissions continued on their present pathway, there was no chance of limiting global temperature rises even to 3C. Economic modelling in the draft report showed that the dangers for economic growth, particularly in developing countries, were significantly greater at 2C than 1.5C. The Greenpeace International executive director, Jennifer Morgan, said the moment of truth had come for leaders and the feasibility of achieving the Paris goals was a political choice. “This choice must be driven by a moral obligation that binds us together. Through international cooperation, real ambition and working with communities, our leaders still have the time to do what they must,” she said. “That means saying no to fossil fuels and standing up for forest and ocean protection with decisions that prove they understand the urgency. It means cutting down on meat and dairy consumption, and changing the way we produce our food.”"
"The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Opinion page has long had a conservative skew, and unfortunately that has extended to politicizing climate change with biased and factually inaccurate editorials. Over the past several weeks, the WSJ’s attacks on climate science have gone into overdrive. On May 15th, the Opinion page published a self-contradictory editorial from the lifelong contrarian and fossil fuel-funded Fred Singer that so badly rejected basic physics, it prompted one researcher to remark, “If this were an essay in one of my undergraduate classes, he would fail.”  The WSJ did publish a letter to the editor (LTE) from real climate scientists Andrea Dutton and Michael Mann rebutting Singer’s editorial. However, it gave the last word to science deniers in an LTE response rejecting the well-established facts that sea level rise is accelerating and Antarctic is loss is contributing to it. A few days later, the WSJ opinion page was at it again, publishing an editorial by Stephen F. Hayward, who describes himself as having “spent most of my adult life in conservative think tanks in Washington, D.C.,” and it shows. Hayward has a long history as a climate naysayer, spanning over a decade back to his days with the fossil fuel-funded American Enterprise Institute. Hayward’s arguments of course deserve to be judged on their own merits. I devoted my first-ever Tweetstorm to doing just that: Ok, let's do a Whack-a-Mole Twitter thread debunking all the nonsense in @stevenfhayward's @WSJ editorial (1/n) Hayward falls into the category some describe as “Lukewarmers.” This group consists of people who think that – contrary to the body of available evidence – global warming will be slow and we don’t have to worry much about it. I prefer the term “Luckwarmer,” since they’re betting that Earth’s climate sensitivity is at the very low end or lower than the range of values supported by scientific evidence. In that sense, they’re gambling we’ll be very lucky that the climate dice will come up snake eyes. Throughout his career, Hayward has spilled a lot of ink trolling those who are concerned about climate change. In this latest opinion piece, he argues that “climate change has run its course” because nobody is doing anything serious to solve it, and nobody cares about climate change anymore.  Hayward’s evidence to support this thesis is flimsy, to put it charitably. For example, when pressed on the fact that every country save America has agreed to implement policies to curb climate change, Hayward cited Japan as a counter-example that’s building more coal power plants since the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster. Indeed, Japan’s climate policies are highly insufficient to meet the Paris goals. But Japan has nevertheless signed onto the Paris agreement, whose framework allows signatory countries to periodically strengthen their policies and commitments and thus eventually meet the targets. And Japan’s per person carbon pollution is already about 40% lower than America’s. Hayward also cites polling data that shows Americans consider climate change a low priority, but neglects to mention that the vast majority (including Trump voters) support climate policies like taxing and/or regulating carbon pollution. He compares the issue to a car alarm whose blaring noise everybody soon tunes out. However, unlike a triggered car alarm, climate change poses ever-increasing risks. It won’t just go away if we ignore it. It’s much more like a fire alarm sounding off in a building whose occupants have been locked in. Worst of all, Hayward claims that “the left politicized the issue,” which is beyond absurd. Those on the American ‘left’ generally accept the consensus of 97% of climate science experts and have proposed bipartisan solutions to this existential problem that, with a few exceptions, have been almost universally rejected by those on the American right for purely political reasons. The WSJ is of course far from the only media outlet guilty of peddling fossil fuel industry propaganda. Last Friday, The Hill published a very similar editorial by Fred Singer, whose second sentence included two very easily fact-checked falsehoods: “sea level has been rising at a steady rate, between 1 and 2 millimeters per year.” In reality, sea level rise has been accelerating, now up to about 3.3 millimeters per year. Some people are of the opinion that the Earth is flat, but the WSJ and The Hill probably wouldn’t publish Flat Earthers’ editorials. Of course, the Flat Earth Society doesn’t have the financial and political clout of the fossil fuel industry."
"For once, ministers have put their money where their mouth is – into taking another stab at nuclear power. This week the business secretary, Greg Clark, announced plans to pump £5bn into a new nuclear power station at Wylfa in north Wales. It was a reversal of a longstanding Conservative policy not to underwrite nuclear construction. So why the sudden enthusiasm? And what does Clark know that the rest of the world does not? For almost everywhere else, governments and corporations are pulling the plug on nuclear. Even in a world fearful of climate change, in which nations have promised to wean themselves off fossil fuels by the mid-century, almost no one wants to touch nuclear.  Germany will be nuclear-free by 2022. France – once Europe’s great nuclear advocates – is backtracking. President Macron is committed to cutting nuclear’s contribution to grid power from the 75% to 50%. Seven years after the Fukushima accident, all but a handful of Japan’s 54 nuclear power plants remain closed. US utilities are shutting reactors fast too, even those with years of their operating licences yet to run. In America’s deregulated energy markets, nuclear cannot compete. Last week President Trump called for the utilities to suspend closures, citing national energy security. He may resort to the law to get his way, but even Trump is not demanding new reactors. Meanwhile, the state-sponsored nuclear enthusiasm of China, recently the world’s premier builder, has dimmed. Beijing has issued no new construction approvals for over two years. Only Russia keeps up the momentum – which puts Britain in an embarrassing club. Britain hasn’t completed a new nuclear power station for 23 years. The government’s professed reason for its newfound enthusiasm is fighting climate change, and in particular the need to find replacements on the grid for the remaining coal-fired power plants that it has pledged to shut by 2025. But while the cause is correct, the solution is increasingly at odds with the rest of the world. Yes, nuclear is a proven large-scale source of low-carbon electricity. But renewable sources like solar and wind are both now cheaper, and are becoming cheaper still, while nuclear costs only rise. Some who call themselves “eco-modernists” argue that nuclear and renewables would make a great mix: nuclear could fill in when the sun goes down and the winds drop. But there is a problem. Any effective stand-in for fickle renewables needs to be available at the flick of a switch. Hydropower or natural gas can do the job, but not nuclear. Its forte is to deliver constant baseload power. If nuclear ticked enough other boxes, it might still have a role to play in keeping the lights on. But it has always been a bad neighbour and troublesome citizen. Some of our fears about radiation may be exaggerated, but they are real fears nonetheless. And nuclear power’s links to nuclear weapons are not just about shared technology – at least not while Britain remains home to the world’s largest stockpile of plutonium. We are sitting on 130 tonnes of a human-made element that lies at the heart of most nuclear weapons. The stockpile is at a warehouse at Sellafield in Cumbria, in defiance of warnings from scientists at the Royal Society a decade ago that in its present form it poses a major security risk, whether diverted for weapons or breached by terrorists. The plutonium was manufactured over decades from used power-station reactor fuel. Britain wanted to be at the forefront of a new global industry using plutonium to fuel new designs of reactors. But production continues even though there is no sign of a world market for plutonium. And neither the new Hinkley Point reactor under construction in Somerset, nor the proposed plant at Wylfa, will burn the stuff. The government seems determined to pursue a nuclear dream, even though it has palpably failed to come to terms with the toxic legacy of the country’s nuclear past. Next to the site of the planned Wylfa plant sits the shell of an old nuclear power station. It was shut in 2015, but is not scheduled for demolition for almost another century, in 2105. It is one of 11 former plants that sit abandoned around our coastlines, from Dungeness in Kent to Trawsfynydd in Snowdonia, and Sizewell in Suffolk to Hunterston in south-west Scotland. They are currently being put into what the industry terms “care and maintenance” – mothballed while their radioactivity decays, and until the government’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority can find somewhere to put their remains. On present form, that day may never come. Britain is today no nearer agreeing a final resting place for its most dangerous and long-lasting radioactive wastes than it was back in 1976, when the royal commission on environmental pollution said we should build no more nuclear power plants until that problem was resolved. Absurdly, the most recent plan has been to bury the waste in tunnels to be dug beneath the Lake District national park. Nuclear power today is a largely friendless industry: uneconomic without heavy government support, uninsurable, stuck with a military heritage from hell, overtaken by cleaner competitors, beset by waste problems that no one has resolved, and always vulnerable to public panic after the Chernobyl or Fukushima accidents. Some believe it may have a future when the waste problems are resolved and if radical new reactor designs emerge. That may be so. But the truth is that in the 60 years since the bomb-makers first promised us “atoms for peace”, nuclear power has gone from a sunrise to a sunset industry. Only the British government seems not to realise it. • Fred Pearce is the author of Fallout: A Journey Through the Nuclear Age, From the Atom Bomb to Radioactive Waste "
"The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, says the climate is changing and the transition in the energy market – with renewables displacing traditional power generation sources – is “exciting, not only for the environment but for the hip pocket”. In an interview with Guardian Australia, the Queensland National said the climate had been changing “since we first tilled the soil in Australia” and he does not care whether the change is due to human activity or not. While some colleagues in the National party have long queried whether humans are contributing to global warming, and have been openly hostile to the advance of renewable energy, Littleproud said: “I’m not losing any sleep on that, whether you want to prove it is manmade or not – I want to be pragmatic. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “The climate has been changing since we first tilled the soil in Australia and the reality is farmers have been adapting to it,” the agriculture minister said. “Farmers are always at the cutting edge of science and technology, and they’ve been adapting since we first tilled the soil here. “I believe the climate is changing. Whether it is manmade or not, I don’t really care. The reality is we are seeing disruption, particularly with renewables, and we are going to see cleaner air. I try not to live in cities, you do feel the effects ... so it’s a good thing that renewables are coming on. “In fact, in my own electorate [of Maranoa in south-west Queensland] I’ve got all of the above. I’m about to have one of the largest solar farms in the southern hemisphere, one of the biggest wind farms in the southern hemisphere. I’ve got geothermal and I’ve got four coal-fired power stations. Two of those are super critical. “The disruption that’s happening with the technology, moving towards renewable energy, particularly in storage for base load, is exciting. I think it is a good thing.” While some government colleagues have championed prolonging the life of coal-fired power plants, Littleproud said economics rather than a culture war would ultimately determine Australia’s future energy mix. “Economics will win out in the end and if base load power can be stored in particular, that’s an exciting thing for the environment and everyone’s hip pocket.” Littleproud has been on the road for much of the week with the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, visiting drought-affected regions of New South Wales and Queensland. The south-east of Australia this year has experienced record high temperatures during an unseasonably dry and hot autumn, prompting fire bans and warnings from authorities. In its latest winter outlook, the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting warmer and drier-than-average conditions across large parts of the country. It suggests winter rainfall is likely to be below average for NSW, South Australia, northern Victoria and western parts of Western Australia. Turnbull this week said there was “no doubt that our climate is getting warmer”. He said the farming community needed to concentrate on becoming more resilient and focus on adaptation to a climate that was getting warmer and drier. Littleproud said there was a place for both mitigation strategies to try and reduce the most damaging impacts of climate change, and also for adaptation.  “No matter whether you mitigate or adapt, the climate is going to change and we’ve got to move with it,” he said. “You have to use the best science available at the time – you mitigate as best you can ... listen to the scientific evidence, because this should be predicated on science not emotion.  “If there are mitigation efforts to lessen the impact, then we should explore those, but we have to continue to adapt as we have since we first inhabited Australia.” He said he was currently working with state counterparts in the agriculture portfolio to develop “a national strategy around climate change adaptation”, which would include better collaboration across state borders, more research and development, including developing more drought-resistant grains and fibres, and looking at the genetics of livestock, and “understanding the weather better”. Asked whether some Australian farmers were hanging on in areas made unviable for agricultural production because of the impact of climate change, Littleproud said: “I think ultimately the market and economics determine that. “I honestly believe, having been a bank manager that sat around farmers’ kitchen tables, the greatest custodians of the land are farmers because their profit and loss is intrinsically tied to the health of their land. They don’t make a quid unless their environment and their farming is at its best.” He said farmers in drier areas were deploying active strategies, like reducing their stocking densities, and some farmers he had met in regional Queensland this week were also engaged with traditional owners about land management.  “They’ve learned how to manage that land, in some ways learning from how Indigenous Australians manage the land and techniques they’ve used,” he said. Asked whether he accepted that agriculture and transport industries had to reduce their emissions to ensure Australia met its commitments under the Paris agreement, Littleproud said emissions reduction had to be “responsible”. I think we are already reducing emissions The latest official emissions data shows pollution increased by 1.5% in the year to December 2017. Australia’s emissions levels are now higher than they were in 2012 and have climbed by 3.6% since the carbon price was repealed in 2014. Emissions are increasing in most sectors of the economy – in waste, agriculture and transport. Only one sector of the economy has recorded a decrease – the electricity sector – because ageing coal-fired power plants have exited the system, and new renewables projects are coming on stream. “We’ve still got to be able to reduce the bills,” Littleproud said. “We’ve got to make sure the transition is done with people being able to turn their heaters on, and farmers turning their pumps on. “I think we are already reducing emissions. We’ve made a commitment under the Paris agreement and we are moving towards that in a sensible and methodical way. “As disruption happens in the technology space, [emissions reduction] will increase. In my own electorate, people are self-sustaining through solar. The reality is that type of disruption is happening and that is an exciting thing not only for the environment, but for the hip pocket.”"

"Nasa’s output of climate change information aimed at the public has dwindled under the Trump administration, with a former employee claiming “fear and anxiety” within the agency has led to an online retreat from the issue. Laura Tenenbaum, a former science communicator for Nasa, said she was warned off using the term “global warming” on social media and restricted in speaking to the media due to her focus on climate change.  “Nasa’s talking point is that it’s business as usual, but that’s not true,” said Tenenbaum, who departed Nasa in October after a decade at the space agency.  “They have stopped promoting or emphasizing climate science communication, they have minimized it. People inside the agency are concerned Trump will cut climate science funding. There is a fear and anxiety there and the outcome has been chaos.” Tenenbaum said that around a month after Trump’s inauguration last year an “arduous review process” was put in place over every blog post, Facebook post and tweet that she put out from Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. “I was told verbally by media relations it was because with Trump as president, climate change is now a sensitive subject,” she said. “There was confusion about what to do now we have a president who doesn’t believe in climate change. Everyone was scrambling. It was chaos.”  Planned blogposts on coal plants being turned into solar plants, “reasons to be positive about Nasa” and an interview with Gavin Schmidt, a senior Nasa climate scientist, were all either halted or scrapped due to interference from career staff nervous about provoking the new administration, according to Tenenbaum. Figures show there has been a notable decline in Nasa’s output of climate information since the election of the Trump administration. During 2016, Nasa posted frequently on its climate change Facebook page, peaking at 122 posts during August of that year, according to CrowdTangle.  There were 53 Facebook posts in January 2017, the month of Trump’s inauguration, and Nasa hasn’t come close to this total since, posting 21 times this March and 31 times in April. This drop off in posts has resulted in dwindling interactions with the public on Facebook. During January 2017 there were more than 61,700 interactions – defined as likes, comments and shares – on the climate page. This has slumped dramatically since then, totaling just 7,000 in April. In April 2016, under the Obama administration, there were more than 100,000 interactions.  Nasa’s Earth Right Now blog, which Tenenbaum wrote for, has also seen a decrease in activity, with just two originally-produced posts since Tenenbaum’s last entry in August 2017. Tenenbaum said she was warned about speaking to the media and then was offered another job elsewhere in the agency, before taking a leave of absence and then resigning.  Nasa’s climate change website and Facebook page still clearly outline its findings, common with other scientific organizations, that the world is warming and the seas are rising. A Nasa spokesman said there has been “no policy change about how we communicate out science to the American public”. “Nasa Communications has not received any directive to change how we communicate about agency research, which includes climate change,” he added.  “The frequency of blogposts on climate.nasa.gov has always varied depending on personnel availability and other factors including mission activities (launches, expeditions in the field, etc).” There has been some angst within Nasa over Trump’s aversion to climate science – which he has previously called “bullshit” and a “hoax” inspired by China – and his administration’s dismantling of efforts to address global warming. The White House’s proposal to cut funding for Nasa’s Earth science work, which uses satellites to measure the planet’s climate, soils, wildfires and weather events such as hurricanes, is also a point of contention.  One agency scientist, who didn’t wish to be named, said: “Some people are apprehensive, some are defiant and some put their nose to [the] grindstone and get on with it.” Nasa has yet to attract the level of controversy that surrounds the Environmental Protection Agency, whose administrator Scott Pruitt has denied basic facts on climate science, remodeled scientific panels to include more industry representatives and oversaw the removal of climate change information from the EPA website for a “review” that has lasted for more than a year.  Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at Columbia University and the Nasa Goddard Institute of Space Studies who said she was speaking in a personal capacity, said no one has told her to “shut up” about her work. “Physics doesn’t change just because the administration has changed,” she said. “It’s my job to understand how the planet works and I will continue to keep doing that.” Jim Bridenstine, Nasa’s new administrator and former Republican congressman, has previously voiced doubt over the mainstream scientific understanding that the world is warming due to human activity.  But he appeared to have shifted his position during a televised meeting with Nasa workers earlier this month. “I don’t deny the consensus, I believe fully in climate change and that we human beings are contributing to it in a major way,” Bridenstine said, adding that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and “we are putting it into the atmosphere in volumes we haven’t seen before. We are responsible for it.”"
"Butterfly lovers’ emotions tend to boom and bust like butterfly populations. Two weeks of sunshine in my part of the world and my heart’s lifted by plentiful orange tips, small whites and brimstones, while last summer’s peacocks gamely fly on. Alongside a decent abundance of common species there’s the exciting addition of 41 chequered skippers from the continent, now enjoying the warm glades of Rockingham forest, Northamptonshire.  The chequered skippers – males and females collected in Belgium – have been reintroduced as part of the Back from the Brink project, after the species became extinct in England following the hot summer of 1976. (A similar summer would be too dry for this species’ caterpillars, which need moisture to survive.)  One swallowtail doesn’t make a summer but I’ve seen my first on Strumpshaw Fen, Norfolk. There’s some curious phenology this year, with little sign yet of milk parsley, on which the females lay their eggs. And the swallowtail’s favourite nectar, including sweet william in nearby gardens, isn’t in full flower. It could be problematic if butterflies emerge too early for their food plants. A fine May rarely seems to lead to a sunny summer, but for now butterflies are a joyous final adornment to our most beautiful month in all its glory."
"The EU is raising its target for the amount of energy it consumes from renewable sources, in a deal lauded by the bloc’s climate chief as a hard-won victory for the switch to clean energy. Energy ministers agreed a binding renewable energy target of 32% by 2030, up from the previous goal of 27%, but fell short of the hopes of some countries and green groups for a more ambitious share. The EU council deal caps 18 months of negotiations. It was welcomed by the renewables industry and the trade body for European energy utilities called it: “a well-balanced compromise”. The talks saw the UK call for a target of 30%, below the 32% a newly pro-renewables France wanted and the 35% that new governments in Spain and Italy argued for.  Miguel Arias Cañete, EU climate commissioner, said: “This new ambition will help us meet our Paris agreement goals and will translate into more jobs, lower energy bills for consumers and less energy imports.” He added that the binding nature of the goal would provide certainty to investors. Whether the target will apply to the UK after it leaves the EU will depend on the exit deal reached by London and Brussels. The agreement also includes plans for a 2023 review on whether the target should be bumped even higher. Around 17% of EU energy consumption in 2016 was from renewables, with the UK on about 9%.  Green energy advocates argued the existing 2030 target was unambitious because member states were already on track to exceed it. Environmental groups said the increase did not go far enough and were critical of a decision to keep counting biomass as renewable energy. Molly Walsh, renewable energy campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe, said: “EU decision-makers have agreed a paltry 32% target for renewable energy that is inadequate for a climate-safe fossil-free future, and shows a failure to grasp a shifting energy landscape, including rapidly falling renewables costs.” However, the group welcomed the deal’s recognition of rights for consumers to produce and sell their own renewable energy, such as from solar panels on rooftops.  The agreement now needs to be formally approved by the EU parliament and council in coming months. "
"An intense heatwave across south Asia has killed dozens of people with sustained temperatures in excess of 40C (104F) coinciding with power cuts and Ramadan, when many Muslims avoid eating or drinking water. At least 65 people have died in Karachi in recent days according to the charitable organisation that runs the central morgue in the Pakistani port city, as volunteers handed out water to labourers and others working outside in temperatures as high as 44C.  Local media reports claimed the death toll could have exceeded 100 in the sprawling megacity of 15 million, where high temperatures are exacerbated by an absence of green space, estimated to make up just 7% of the urban area. Authorities in Karachi have not confirmed the death toll but urged people to stay indoors and keep drinking water. Parts of the city have also been suffering from power cuts, particularly early in the morning when more people than usual have been waking to eat before sunrise in line with Ramadan fasting rituals. During the annual month-long rite, Muslims refrain from eating or drinking anything including water between sunrise and sunset, though children, older people, the sick and pregnant women usually do not participate. The Edhi Foundation, which runs Karachi’s central morgue, said most of the dead in the city were working-class people from poorer neighbourhoods, including children and elderly people. “They work around heaters and boilers in textile factories and there is eight to nine hours of [scheduled power outages] in these areas,” Faisal Edhi, the head of the foundation, told Reuters. Fazlullah Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, denied that anyone had died, however, telling the Dawn newspaper: “I categorically reject that people have died due to heatstroke in Karachi.” A heatwave in 2015 left morgues and hospitals overwhelmed and killed at least 1,200 mostly elderly, sick, and homeless people. In 2015, the Edhi morgue ran out of freezer space after about 650 bodies were brought in the space of a few days. Ambulances left decaying corpses outside in the sweltering heat. Extreme temperatures were also recorded in neighbouring India, with parts of Maharashtra state reaching 47C on Monday. More than 22,000 people died in heatwaves in India between 1992 and 2005, according to government data released last year. Authorities say that figure has fallen dramatically since as a result of public health campaigns, including training medical staff to diagnose heat-related illnesses and sending colour-coded temperature warnings through the media and WhatsApp. Last year, about 222 Indians died because of the heat, the government says, down from 1,111 in 2016 and 2,040 the year before. Temperatures in Karachi are expected to stay above 40C until 24 May, according to weather forecasters. High temperatures were also predicted to last another 48 hours in India.

"Sea level rise driven by climate change is set to pose an existential crisis to many US coastal communities, with new research finding that as many as 311,000 homes face being flooded every two weeks within the next 30 years. The swelling oceans are forecast repeatedly to soak coastal residences collectively worth $120bn by 2045 if greenhouse gas emissions are not severely curtailed, experts warn. This will potentially inflict a huge financial and emotional toll on the half a million Americans who live in the properties at risk of having their basements, backyards, garages or living rooms inundated every other week.  “The impact could well be staggering,” said Kristina Dahl, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). “This level of flooding would be a tipping point where people in these communities would think it’s unsustainable. “Even homes along the Gulf coast that are elevated would be affected, as they’d have to drive through salt water to get to work or face their kids’ school being cut off. You can imagine people walking away from mortgages, away from their homes.” The UCS used federal data from a high sea level rise scenario projected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and combined it with property data from the online real estate company Zillow to quantify the level of risk across the lower 48 states. Under this scenario, where planet-warming emissions are barely constrained and the seas rise by about 6.5ft globally by the end of the century, 311,000 homes along the US coastline would face flooding on average 26 times a year within the next 30 years – a typical lifespan for a new mortgage. The losses would multiply by the end of the century, with the research warning that as many as 2.4m homes, worth around a trillion dollars, could be put at risk. Low-lying states would be particularly prone, with a million homes in Florida, 250,000 homes in New Jersey and 143,000 homes in New York at risk of chronic flooding by 2100. This persistent flooding is likely to rattle the housing market by lowering property prices and making mortgages untenable in certain areas. Flood insurance premiums could rise sharply, with people faced with the choice of increasing clean-up costs or retreating to higher ground inland. “Unfortunately, in the years ahead many coastal communities will face declining property values as risk perceptions catch up with reality,” said Rachel Cleetus, an economist and climate policy director at UCS. “In contrast with previous housing market crashes, values of properties chronically inundated due to sea level rise are unlikely to recover and will only continue to go further underwater, literally and figuratively.” The report does not factor in future technological advances that could ameliorate the impact of rising seas, although the US would be starting from a relatively low base compared with some countries given that it does not have a national sea level rise plan. And the current Trump administration has moved to erase the looming issue from consideration for federally funded infrastructure. The oceans are rising by about 3mm a year due to the thermal expansion of seawater that’s warming because of the burning of fossil fuels by humans. The melting of massive glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica is also pushing up the seas – Nasa announced last week that the amount of ice lost annually from Antarctica has tripled since 2012 to an enormous 241bn tons a year. This slowly unfolding scenario is set to pose wrenching choices for many in the US. Previous research has suggested that about 13 million Americans may have to move due to sea level rise by the end of the century, with landlocked states such as Arizona and Wyoming set for a population surge. “My flood insurance bill just went up by $100 this year, it went up $100 the year before,” said Philip Stoddard, the mayor of South Miami. “People on the waterfront won’t be able to stay unless they are very wealthy. This isn’t a risk, it’s inevitable. “Miami is a beautiful and interesting place to live – I’m looking at a lizard on my windowsill right now. But people will face a cost to live here that will creep up and up. At some point they will have to make a rational economic decision and they may relocate. Some people will make the trade-off to live here. Some won’t.”"
"I first thought it was fake as I used to watch Fox News with my family. In 2015 I met my partner Stephen who knew that the facts of climate change couldn’t be ignored. He took it upon himself to try to convince me. We started watching documentaries on the subject on Netflix. The first documentary that caught my attention was Cowspiracy directed by Kip Andersen and Keegan Kuhn. This documentary really hit home and I even wrote an essay on it. Then came What the Health by the same directors. After we watched the movie Stephen and I turned to an all plant-based diet. We have our ups and downs on staying true to our new lifestyle change, but we always keep in mind that for every burger we don’t eat that is 660 gallons of water that we are saving for others in need. I was lucky enough that Stephen took the time and saw that if I could see the issues I would see that the facts are true.  As a graduate student in the early 2000s, I did not really have an opinion on the matter but the debate raised my curiosity. So when some of the prominent sceptical websites made claims about some scientific papers, I searched for the papers online and checked for myself. It soon became quite obvious that the sceptic claims made no sense whatsoever. So I became politically active and I’ve now been active in the Finnish Green party for 10 years.  Climate change seemed like a questionable thing to me at first and now it’s not. What made me change my mind is several news articles and blogs that I’ve read up on the internet as well as visits to museums and exhibitions. It was informative and introduced aspects such as rising temperatures, rising seas, extreme weather events and risks that we as a community face. I believe it will help people understand how serious the situation is and I would like to encourage the community to visit museums and learn about climate change. Given everything I have been told, my belief in climate change has gone from weak to very strong even if I still have many questions. After learning about how bad this can really get, it not only changed whether or not I believed in it, but also made me worry more and more. I now understand that I must try to do things that benefit the environment but at the same time I must also understand that I can’t save the world. I was a teenager when President Ronald Reagan reassured us that global warming was all part of a natural, cyclical process - not dangerous and not caused by humans. Being a young, naive Republican, I believed him. When Al Gore’s documentary An inconvenient Truth came out in theatres, I would never have considered going to see it if I hadn’t become angry about Bush’s decision to invade Iraq and cynical about the Republicans’ lip service to Christian values. The movie was an eye-opener to say the least. Now I am a Green Party member, try to live a zero waste life, I’m nearly vegan and read up on climate change issues in the news on a regular basis. I agree 100% with Pope Francis’ encyclical on the environment that fighting climate change is a moral imperative for social justice and that it is a grave sin to be tyrants rather than stewards of the earth.  I believe that the climate is changing, but I now think that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s view on the importance of CO2 is significantly overstated. I assumed that mainstream science was right and agree that burning fossil fuels is generally harmful and should be reduced if possible. However, after researching more about the factors effecting our climate I am of the opinion that other factors are more important than the IPCC stated factors. The sun and solar magnetic flux, plus the ocean currents are much more significant than stated by some scientist and the press. I also see significant data manipulation and misinformation (from both sides) so finding good independent sources of information is hard. I check published ‘hard data’ against obvious proxy data to see if it agrees, and too often it doesn’t. I think climate science has become political (understandable given the consequences) which means normal scientific debate is not happening as it should.  I used to think climate change was a serious problem but now I think it has been overblown. As a research physicist I looked at research first hand and came to the conclusion that the modelling of climate is not particularly good. Catastrophic predictions are silly. Global warming is real but not as serious as portrayed in the press. The probable total effect on the climate due to people is nothing to worry about compared to other, far more urgent ecological or environmental concerns, such as land management, ocean management, invasive species etc. Also, regardless of the actual reality of catastrophic global warming the actual actions taken have been ridiculous, futile, expensive and have had no impact on CO2 production in any meaningful way. If predictions made in the 90s had been true, the only solution was to use the already developed, reliable, cheap nuclear power and to get India, China and African countries using it. Instead people are burning fuel. "
"In a political climate where most adults are inert with despair, a growing number of teenagers are responding with action. After 14 children and three adults were massacred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, it was students – not parents, teachers or political representatives – who organised themselves to campaign for changes to US gun laws. The March for Our Lives demonstration in Washington, DC on 24 March was accompanied by sister marches around the world: millions of young people supporting each other and demanding policy reform. Lead campaigner Emma González, a high-school student who now has more than 1.5m Twitter followers, made a call to arms for her peers to: “Fight for your lives before it’s someone else’s job.” González is one of many teenagers shattering the stereotypes of the lazy, entitled, self-obsessed millennial. More and more teenagers are noisily questioning the world they’re inheriting and demanding things work differently. Here, we meet some of the young activists whose voices are increasingly impossible to dismiss. Last spring, I was watching the news when there was a report on girls in the UK missing school because they couldn’t afford menstrual products. Some were using toilet paper, newspaper or socks. Thinking about girls my age going through this hit me hard. The report gained attention, but I felt the government was sweeping it under the carpet and we needed to pressure them to do something. So I did what felt normal to me and went online and started a petition. It calls for free menstrual products for children on free school meals. I didn’t imagine even getting 100 signatures. But in between revising for AS exams, I emailed as many people, companies and universities as I could. I asked my parents to send it around their work. My dad was a bit reluctant at first, but he did. There’s huge embarrassment about periods, but it’s something half the world’s population will go through for a week every month. That it’s a taboo holds us back in achieving gender equality. Within two weeks, the petition reached 2,000 signatures. Comments were divided between people being shocked that this happens and others saying it affects them or their friends. Hearing that made me want to fight harder. When the general election was announced, I emailed the parties. The Green party and Women’s Equality party both replied and included a pledge in their manifesto. I was so frustrated I couldn’t vote. Then in December we organised a protest outside Theresa May’s bedroom; more than 1,000 people came and shouted. To date, 150,000 people have signed the petition. It’s sad when adults are surprised to hear a young person being politically vocal. Young people are angry about the state of the world and a lot of us use social media to articulate that. I get asked to speak a lot. The other morning, a TV station sent a car to school, I left for an hour, spoke on the issue and came back to a history lesson. My parents are supportive and as surprised as me that this has taken off. My dad went with me to the Women’s March, which was cool. But sometimes my mum can get annoyed if I’m doing lots of campaign stuff with exams coming up. If someone tells me I should be in school right now, I know that they don’t see the bigger picture. Earth’s ability to support human life is falling apart and if things don’t change in the next five to 10 years, nothing’s going to matter. I’ll finish high school, but right now this is the most important thing I can do with my time. Myself and 20 other kids are currently suing the Trump administration for violating our constitutional rights for failure to act on climate change. We originally launched it against the Obama administration a few years ago. The US government has known the fossil fuel industry is having a negative impact on our climate, yet they have been offering them subsidies and opening up land to exploration. We have just heard that we are going to trial in October. I’m also involved in law actions and civil disobedience to stop fracking around my hometown of Boulder. In 2012, my friends and I successfully helped push for a five-year ban. From a young age, I was aware of my part in protecting our planet. I was three or four the first time I went on a protest, and six when I started speaking at them. I was born in Colorado and have spent a lot of time in Mexico. My entire childhood was travelling, hanging out in nature and learning about my family’s indigenous heritage. My dad taught me that we have a responsibility to protect the Earth the way that our ancestors did. I’ve spoken at the UN about my work. I was surprised how disrespectful, disconnected and sterile it was. The delegates were on their phones, not listening. They perked up when they heard I was just 15 years old. The power of me speaking wasn’t for them but for the millions of people my speech has since reached online. The world is seeing how powerful young people are and how things are going to change. Adults on CNN and in the United States specifically, they can argue and cover gossip about Trump and his hair and porn stars. But young people are mobilising on the streets. There’s so much power in what’s happening within our generation. We don’t have the respect we deserve, but I think it’s coming. I’ve been racially abused since about 12, but it was never seen as an important thing to tackle. At secondary school, white children called me disgusting things, but teachers would turn a blind eye. And not just to racism, but sexism, homophobia, transphobia. There’s also internal racism in the Eritrean community. My dad is called names because he has darker skin. It all comes from preconceived ideas that black is less, or the darker you are the lower you are in terms of income, society and politics. Because these problems weren’t taken seriously, I normalised them. But when I moved to a sixth form where the majority of students are black girls, I was surrounded by political and social consciousness. The more educated I got, the angrier I became. Last summer, I joined an organisation called the Advocacy Academy and, with a small group of people my age, we launched a campaign challenging the image and under-representation of black people in the media. We recreated iconic posters, such as Doctor Who, Titanic and Harry Potter, and made all the characters black. The campaign is rooted in personal experiences and I’ve gone from talking about things with my friends in the lunch hall to speaking about them nationally. The Academy has revolutionised the way I think. Back in the day I definitely upheld toxic masculine identities. I’d tell myself that I didn’t cry. Challenging gender norms wasn’t of interest to me because I wanted to fit in with my friends. But I’ve learned to let go of my ego and be vulnerable so I can say what’s on my mind. It’s allowed me to take all the cold anger I have built up over years and turn it into something good. I’ve learned to become an ally to many other issues that don’t affect me directly. After university, I don’t just want to get a really good job, buy a big house and forget about my community. I want to change something and challenge the status quo. Even before the war in Syria, I wanted to change society, but I knew I needed to get educated to do that. Back then, we had a normal life. We went to school every day and saw our friends. The war started when I was 11 or 12. Going to school became difficult. There were people fighting on the ground, there would be bombing, sometimes bullets. Sometimes school was just closed because of budgets. My father is a teacher and he lost his job. We left Syria five years ago, when I was 14. I was so worried about my future and education. We went to a refugee camp in Jordan. I didn’t expect there to be a school, but I was happy to discover a caravan with a tent and some teachers. There was no electricity. We studied computing from a book. In the winter, it got so cold it was hard to focus on the teacher. But school gave me hope. And I started to encourage other girls and boys to go, too. I would walk from tent to tent, caravan to caravan, persuading kids and parents. I met people who thought that because we are refugees, education isn’t important any more, or that they’d continue school when they returned to Syria. I encouraged people to believe in themselves and not give up. I met kids who’d never been to school, and girls who saw marriage as their profession. Some parents told me it had nothing to do with me. I fought hard for everyone to believe that we can’t do anything without knowledge and got involved with international charities who supported me. What’s happening in my country is not of our making and it’s not our fault that we’re losing our rights. One day, we’ll be able to return, and we need to have knowledge. After three years in Jordan, my family came to the UK. Last year I became the youngest and first refugee Unicef Goodwill Ambassador. I’m now on my way to university and am doubling my activism. I came out at 14. When you’re a young LGBTQ+ person and you come out, you’re put in this position where you are suddenly expected to educate your peers. I’d be in a lesson and someone would ask me an incredibly inappropriate question. People feel like they have permission to access all of you when you’re still figuring things out for yourself. At the same time, someone in my class was sending me online anonymous, violent messages, telling me to kill myself. My school didn’t know what to do with it. At one point, they had contacted my parents, pushing me to come out to them, too, and it all became detrimental to my mental health. I don’t come from a political family, but I’ve always had a strong sense of fairness. After coming out, I started making educational YouTube videos on LGBTQ+ issues and people watched them. I also worked with my school to establish support systems and visibility for LGBTQ+ pupils. I got together with teachers to set up a group. We held events and assemblies, and suddenly others wanted to join. I worked with the school to run surveys of the staff and students, so we knew the issues that needed addressing. As part of a Stonewall youth programme, I started a YouTube series called Queeries. I invite anyone to submit questions, however inappropriate or silly, and I sit down with another LGBTQ+ person and we answer them. Part of that is creating space for difficult questions, but also to give others a platform. I am very aware of the fact that I am white, middle-class and able-bodied, and there are a lot of things I feel I can’t speak to. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and autism, but campaigning is always something I’ve felt able to do. I was happy to do the work with my school, and I know that education resources are stretched, but schools shouldn’t rely on pupils to affect change. That puts pressure on young people to challenge things adults should be addressing. Many young people think they aren’t going to amount to anything because of all the headlines we read. But that’s designed to discredit our concerns about how the world’s being run. A lot of people in control are invested in the world as it currently stands; to suggest that things aren’t great the way they are scares them. We are going to be the kids you read about in textbooks. Not because we’re going to be another statistic about mass shooting in America, but because we are going to be the last mass shooting. Just like Tinker v Des Moines, we are going to change the law. And it’s going to be due to the tireless effort of the school board, the faculty members, the family members and most of all the students. The students who are dead, the students still in the hospital, the students now suffering PTSD, the students who had panic attacks during the vigil because the helicopters would not leave us alone, hovering over the school for 24 hours a day. If President Trump wants to tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should never have happened and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it, I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association. It doesn’t matter because I already know: $30m. And divided by the number of gunshot victims in the United States in the first one and a half months of 2018 alone, that comes out to being $5,800 each. Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump? If you don’t do anything to prevent this from continuing to occur, that number of gunshot victims will go up and the number that they are worth will go down. And we will be worthless to you. To every politician who is taking donations from the NRA, shame on you. The people in the government who were voted into power are lying to us. And us kids seem to be the only ones who notice and call BS. Companies trying to make caricatures of the teenagers these days, saying that all we are is self-involved and trend-obsessed and they hush us into submission when our message doesn’t reach the ears of the nation, we are prepared to call BS. Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this, we call BS. They say tougher guns laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS. They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS. They say no laws could have prevented the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS. That us kids don’t know what we’re talking about, that we’re too young to understand how the government works. We call BS. This is an edited transcript from the speech student and activist Emma González gave at the anti-gun rally in Fort Lauderdale on 17 February 2018, three days after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida"
"Malcolm Turnbull, on a tour of drought-stricken areas in New South Wales and Queensland, has declared there is “no doubt that our climate is getting warmer”. Flanked by Nationals on Monday in Trangie, Turnbull acknowledged climate change remained a live political debate but he said: “I don’t know many people in rural New South Wales that I talk to that don’t think the climate is getting drier and rainfall is becoming more volatile.” The minister for agriculture, David Littleproud, said the last agricultural ministerial council had agreed to help transition farmers into a changing environment and a changing climate. The south-east of Australia this year has experienced record high temperatures during an unseasonably dry and hot autumn, prompting fire bans and warnings from authorities. In its latest winter outlook, the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting warmer and drier than average conditions across large parts of the country. It suggests winter rainfall is likely to be below average for NSW, South Australia, northern Victoria and western parts of Western Australia. The bureau says the dry is likely to be particularly intense in areas around the Murray-Darling Basin and in eastern NSW, with a 70-80% chance of below average rainfall. “Elsewhere around the country, the chances of exceeding average rainfall are roughly 50%,” the new forecast said. The overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is climate change is accelerating and human activity is making a contribution. If greenhouse gas emissions aren’t reduced, human populations become more exposed to the negative effects of warming, which include extreme weather events – such as prolonged drought, heatwaves, wildfires and storms. Emissions in Australia fell during the carbon pricing scheme implemented by the Labor government but the Abbott government repealed that scheme and emissions are now trending upwards year-on-year. The latest official emissions data shows pollution increased by 1.5% in the year to December 2017. Australia’s emissions levels are now higher than they were in 2012 and have climbed 3.6% since the carbon price was repealed in 2014. Emissions are increasing in most sectors of the economy – in waste, agriculture and transport. Only one sector of the economy has recorded a decrease – the electricity sector – because ageing coal-fired power plants have exited the system, and new renewables projects are coming on stream. The Turnbull government is trying to implement a policy in electricity that would see emissions come down by 26% on 2005 levels by 2030 – a target many analysts say is too low for Australia to meet its commitments under the Paris agreement – but even that target is being gainsaid by government conservatives who have not ruled out crossing the floor to oppose it. Analysis from Green Energy Markets says the national energy guarantee (Neg) will deliver no meaningful emissions reductions in its own right unless the target is made more ambitious, because the capacity of renewable projects now under construction already exceeds what is required to achieve the 2030 target. While battling internal pressures over the Neg, the government has also been stalling on new vehicle emissions standards for vehicles, bracing for more internal ructions. Australia no longer has a domestic car manufacturing industry but motoring groups have been lobbying against a 105gCO2/km emissions target. It is unclear how Australia will meet its emissions reduction commitments under the Paris agreement without a policy roadmap to get there. Ahead of a meeting of the G7 in Canada, a coalition of institutional investors has meanwhile sounded the alarm that countries are falling short of their Paris commitments. A group of institutional investors with $26 trillion in assets under management – including Australia’s Investor Group on Climate Change – presented a statement of concern to G7 leaders and it was delivered to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The joint statement said: “We are concerned that the implementation of the Paris agreement is currently falling short of the agreed goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels”. Emma Herd, the chief executive officer of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said investors were “stepping up in unprecedented numbers to act on climate change”. “Investors could do even more if governments delivered the policies required to effectively manage climate risk and accelerate investment in low-carbon solutions,” Herd said.

"Some of Africa’s oldest and biggest baobab trees have abruptly died, wholly or in part, in the past decade, according to researchers. The trees, aged between 1,100 and 2,500 years and in some cases as wide as a bus is long, may have fallen victim to climate change, the team speculated.  “We report that nine of the 13 oldest … individuals have died, or at least their oldest parts/stems have collapsed and died, over the past 12 years,” they wrote in the scientific journal Nature Plants, describing “an event of an unprecedented magnitude”. “It is definitely shocking and dramatic to experience during our lifetime the demise of so many trees with millennial ages,” said the study’s co-author Adrian Patrut of the Babeș-Bolyai University in Romania.  Among the nine were four of the largest African baobabs. While the cause of the die-off remains unclear, the researchers “suspect that the demise of monumental baobabs may be associated at least in part with significant modifications of climate conditions that affect southern Africa in particular”. Further research is needed, said the team from Romania, South Africa and the United States, “to support or refute this supposition”. Between 2005 and 2017, the researchers probed and dated “practically all known very large and potentially old” African baobabs – more than 60 individuals in all. Collating data on girth, height, wood volume and age, they noted the “unexpected and intriguing fact” that most of the very oldest and biggest trees died during the study period. All were in southern Africa – Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, and Zambia. The baobab is the biggest and longest-living flowering tree, according to the research team. It is found naturally in Africa’s savannah region and outside the continent in tropical areas to which it was introduced. It is a strange-looking plant, with branches resembling gnarled roots reaching for the sky, giving it an upside-down look. The iconic tree can live to be 3,000 years old, according to the website of the Kruger National Park in South Africa, a natural baobab habitat. The tree serves as a massive store of water, and bears fruit that feeds animals and humans. Its leaves are boiled and eaten as an accompaniment similar to spinach, or used to make traditional medicines, while the bark is pounded and woven into rope, baskets, cloth and waterproof hats. The purpose of the study was to learn how the trees become so enormous. The researchers used radiocarbon dating to analyse samples taken from different parts of each tree’s trunk. They found that the trunk of the baobab grows from not one but multiple core stems. According to the Kruger Park, baobabs are “very difficult to kill”. “They can be burnt, or stripped of their bark, and they will just form new bark and carry on growing,” it states. “When they do die, they simply rot from the inside and suddenly collapse, leaving a heap of fibres.” Of the 10 trees listed by the study authors, four died completely, meaning all their multiple stems toppled and died together, while the others suffered the death of one or several parts. The oldest tree by far, of which all the stems collapsed in 2010/11, was the Panke tree in Zimbabwe, estimated to have existed for 2,500 years. The biggest, dubbed Holboom, was from Namibia. It stood 30.2 metres (99 feet) tall and had a girth of 35.1 m."
"Alongside George Monbiot’s suggestion (Want to save the planet? Drop meat and dairy, 8 June), another way to reduce greenhouse gases is to stop keeping pets. It’s been calculated that an average dog has an ecological footprint twice as large as that of a large car. Like meat-eating, pet ownership is nowadays encouraged by a vast industry; the pet insurance sector alone is said to generate more of Britain’s GDP than fishing does. The production of pet food, provision of veterinary services and breeding the creatures are big businesses, all with an interest in promoting the alleged benefits of owning a furry friend.  There’s something rather astonishing about humans, especially those concerned about the environmental impact of our species on other ones, cheerfully possessing animals that are the results of generations of selective breeding and which exist purely to give their owners pleasure. It all sounds a bit like a ghastly dystopian sci-fi fantasy.Brian Hughes Cheltenham • George Monbiot’s article inspired me to cook vegetable curry for dinner, but surely limiting population growth is as important as changing our diets in order to conserve human and other life forms on this planet?Hazel SutcliffeHolmes Chapel, Cheshire • The headline of George Monbiot’s article curiously echoes one that appeared in the Guardian last year (Best solution to climate change? Fewer children, 12 July 2017). This earlier article, reporting on a study published in Environmental Research Letters, compares the results of different courses of action. By far the greatest impact is having one fewer child, which equates to saving 58 tonnes of CO2 for each year of a parent’s life. This takes into account the child’s total life, and that of his or her descendants, in proportions described in the article. In comparison, eating a plant-based diet would only save 0.82 tonnes. There is a graphic in the article which shows this very dramatically. Therefore, while the measures proposed by George Monbiot are helpful, their effect will be minimal compared with reducing our progeny.Roger PlentyStroud • George Monbiot is correct that the way we currently produce meat is inherently inefficient. But we don’t have to give up meat entirely. Instead, we should make meat from plants and through tissue engineering – no animals required. Plant-based meats are already available in grocery stores. From Moving Mountains’ new “bleeding” burger to Vivera’s groundbreaking steak, there has never been a better time to switch to plant-based meat, which is vastly better for the animals, our health, and the planet. For those who want to eat meat that actually came from animals, meat grown directly from cells, called “clean meat”, is coming soon; like plant-based meat, it will vastly ameliorate the harms spelled out by Mr Monbiot. Bruce FriedrichExecutive director, The Good Food Institute, Washington DC • I have always been intrigued/confused by the concept that vegetarians and/or vegans would want food to look like the very thing they profess to abhor (Sainsbury’s to sell vegan ‘fake meats’ next to real thing in 400-store trial, 11 June). Why would a vegetarian desire a pseudo-sausage or make-believe burger?Dave CollinsKidderminster, Worcestershire • While the discovery of meat traces in vegan and vegetarian ready meals (‘Meat found’ in vegan food, 9 June) will have come as a shock to many – including, I suspect, those producing these foods – the reality is that we live in a world where animals are routinely killed by the billions for their body parts, and worrying about trace amounts of animal-derived foods in vegan products won’t help them. It’s no different from eating a veggie burger at a restaurant that also serves meat or off the grill at a friend’s barbecue – there’s always a chance of cross-contamination. What we have to remember is that the packets of bacon and beef sold by supermarkets are composed 100% of dead body parts – so those are the products we should avoid if we want to help animals. Eating vegan isn’t about “perfection” or a quest for personal purity – it’s about achieving real change for animals suffering in the food industry. Choosing a vegan burger over a meat-based one is a win for them, the Earth and one’s arteries, and Peta offers a free vegan starter kit for anyone wanting to make the shift towards a more compassionate way of living.Jennifer WhitePeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"Plunging prices for renewable energy and rapidly increasing investment in low-carbon technologies could leave fossil fuel companies with trillions in stranded assets and spark a global financial crisis, a new study has found. A sudden drop in demand for fossil fuels before 2035 is likely, according to the study, given the current global investments and economic advantages in a low-carbon transition.  The existence of a “carbon bubble” – assets in fossil fuels that are currently overvalued because, in the medium and long-term, the world will have to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions – has long been proposed by academics, activists and investors. The new study, published on Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, shows that a sharp slump in the value of fossil fuels would cause this bubble to burst, and posits that such a slump is likely before 2035 based on current patterns of energy use. Crucially, the findings suggest that a rapid decline in fossil fuel demand is no longer dependent on stronger policies and actions from governments around the world. Instead, the authors’ detailed simulations found the demand drop would take place even if major nations undertake no new climate policies, or reverse some previous commitments. That is because advances in technologies for energy efficiency and renewable power, and the accompanying drop in their price, have made low-carbon energy much more economically and technically attractive. Dr Jean-François Mercure, the lead author, from Radboud and Cambridge universities, told the Guardian: “This is happening already – we have observed the data and made projections from there. With more policies from governments, this would happen faster. But without strong [climate] policies, it is already happening. To some degree at least you can’t stop it. But if people stop putting funds now in fossil fuels, they may at least limit their losses.” By moving to a lower-carbon footing, companies and investors could take advantage of the transition that is occurring, rather than trying to fight the growing trend. Mercure said fossil fuel companies were likely to fight among each other for the remaining market, rather than have a strong impact on renewable energy businesses. Prof Jorge Viñuales, co-author, said: “Contrary to investor expectations, the stranding of fossil fuel assets may happen even without new climate policies. Individual nations cannot avoid the situation by ignoring the Paris agreement or burying their heads in coal and tar sands.” However, Mercure also warned that the transition was happening too slowly to stave off the worst effects of climate change. Although the trajectory towards a low-carbon economy would continue, to keep within 2C above pre-industrial levels – the limit set under the Paris agreement – would require much stronger government action and new policies. That could also help investors by pointing the way to deflation of the carbon bubble before they make new investments in fossil fuel assets. The paper supports the view of some policy and investment experts that economics and technology are now driving action on climate change, where before impetus was all from policymakers. Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres told the Guardian, a year after Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of the US from the Paris agreement: “There is a big difference between the economics of climate change and the politics of climate change. Is Trump going to stop that advance [by businesses towards low-carbon technologies]? I don’t think so.” Frédéric Samama, of Europe’s biggest asset manager Amundi, also believes investors have reached a “tipping point”, in relation to taking action on greenhouse gases through their portfolio management. He told Bloomberg last month that “until recently, the question” of climate change was “not on their radar screen”. Separately, an analysis in Nature Energy forecast that global energy demand would be about 40% lower than today by 2050, despite rises in population and income, and a growing global economy. The authors found that such a scenario would allow the world to stay within 1.5C of warming, the aspirational goal set under the Paris agreement."

"Three students at the Cambridge University have gone on hunger strike as part of an increasingly bitter campaign to stop the university investing in fossil fuel companies. The move by the three undergraduates is part of an ongoing divestment campaign at the university that has been supported by hundreds of academics and scientists – including Sir David King, until recently the UK’s permanent special representative for climate change, Thomas Blundell, the former president of the UK Science Council and the author Robert Macfarlane.   The university, which campaigners estimate has £377m invested in fossil fuel firms both directly and indirectly, is expected to take a decision on its future investment strategy at the university’s council meeting on Monday.  A spokesperson said: “The council will consider all aspects of divestment, including ethical issues, in its response to the working group on divestment’s final report ... The objective, as the report sets out, is to promote and execute urgent and tangible action to deliver a carbon neutral future. The university is already taking steps that must be further expanded in the areas of its investments, research, education, estate and policy decisions.” But student Sam Warren-Miell, one of the hunger strikers, said the university must fully divest from all fossil fuels. “We have exhausted all democratic channels to full divestment and so we are left with no other option but direct action. “University council have an opportunity on Monday to show real leadership. We hope that by taking this action, we will encourage them to make the right decision on Monday and be on the right side of history.” The divestment campaign has been backed by the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and the Cambridge MP Daniel Zeichner. This week students chalk-sprayed the university administration building as the protests escalated. The university says its investments were reviewed in 2016, when it found it had “no directly held exposure to the most pollutive industries, such as thermal coal and tar sands, and no expectation of having any such exposure in the future.” But Ben Margolis, another of the hunger strikers said: “Unless decisive action is taken quickly, we’re heading for a global temperature increase of over 2C which will be a catastrophe for the whole of humanity in our lifetimes, and we must also acknowledge that climate change is already having a devastating impact on millions of people in the global south today.  “Every day that the university continues to invest in fossil fuels, directly or indirectly, it is complicit in their suffering, and this is why we will not stop the university commits to full divestment.”"
"Brexit could prove to be a mere bump on the road toward “human unification”, according to a new book by bestselling historian Yuval Noah Harari, which warns politicians against becoming distracted by the rise of nationalism in the world. The Israeli academic, whose first book, Sapiens, became a surprise publishing sensation by charting the rise of the human species, turns his attention to current affairs for the first time with a swipe at what he argues is a short-sighted response to global challenges in countries such as the UK, US, Russia and Israel.  “Brexit may well initiate the simultaneous unravelling of both the UK and the EU. But in the long run, history’s direction is clear cut,” he writes. “In recent generations the few remaining civilisations have been blending into a single global civilisation.” The new book, 21 lessons for the 21st Century, is published in August and comes amid a period of unprecedented introspection in British politics over how to leave the European Union. Yet Harari argues the coming challenges of global warming, technological disruption and nuclear proliferation will make us “ever more interdependent” and in need of cooperative projects such as the EU. “In a different century and different situation, I don’t think there is anything necessarily wrong about Brexit,” he added in an interview. “If you want to be a completely independent country and not part of a bigger organisation, then fine. The problem is that given the kind of challenges we face today, the opportunity costs of being very self absorbed are becoming higher and higher all the time.” The thesis may infuriate Brexit supporters who regard it as a way for Britain to look out to the world more, but Harari also has words of criticism for liberals who regard the EU referendum as a catastrophe. “Like a person imagining that a bad headache signifies a terminal brain tumour, many liberals fear that Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump portend the end of human civilisation,” he writes. “The first step is to tone down the prophecies of gloom and switch from panic mode to bewilderment … more humble, and therefore more clear-sighted.” He also claims it is not inevitable that humanity will learn to collaborate more, warning of a possible “unravelling” of the EU in the wake of Brexit – with worrying implications. “If the European project fails … it would indicate that belief in the liberal values of freedom and tolerance is not enough to resolve the cultural conflicts of the world,” writes Harari. “If Greeks and Germans cannot agree on a common destiny, and if 500 million affluent Europeans cannot absorb a few million impoverished refugees, what chances do humans have of overcoming the far deeper conflicts that beset our global civilisation?” “Let’s say the rise of artificial intelligence completely disrupts the global job market, this will create far far bigger social and economic challenges than the immigration of a few million people to the EU or some workers from Poland and Romania to the UK,” he added. Harari, who lectures at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, was also critical of Israeli nationalism in the wake of the killing of Palestinian protesters last week. “If every nation thinks about itself, then who is thinking about the global problems?” he said. “I don’t see Israel making any significant contribution to confronting the main challenges of humankind.” But the book singles out the EU as a model for how national interests can be balanced and what is at stake if it fails. “After centuries of terrible bloodshed, French, Germans, Italians and Britons have finally built a mechanism that ensures continental harmony – only to have the British public throw a spanner into the miracle machine,” writes Harari. “We have a global ecology, a global economy and a global science – but we are still stuck with only national politics,” he adds. “To have effective politics we must either deglobalise the ecology, the economy or the march of science – or we must globalise our politics.”"
"Last week, the House Science, Space and Technology Committee held yet another climate science hearing similar to those from April 2017, February 2017, January 2016, May 2015, June 2014, December 2013, and so on. It seems as though disputing established climate science is House Republicans’ favorite hobby. This time, it was Philip Duffy’s turn to spend two hours playing whack-a-mole with the committee Republicans’ endless supply of long-debunked climate myths. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) claimed that sea level rise is due to the White Cliffs of Dover tumbling into the ocean (yes, really), and his colleagues argued that scientists in the 1970s were predicting global cooling, that Earth is just returning to its “normal temperature,” that Antarctic ice is growing, and sea levels are hardly rising.   Nice rejoinder to yesterday's silliness about rocks (and not melting ice) raising sea-level. You need an 8 mile diameter, 6 quadrillion pound rock (every year) to reproduce the observed sea-level rise. that's a really big rock! https://t.co/MQgTaYpdlq https://t.co/N8kmIgBDLh Those last two claims originated from a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) editorial entered into the Congressional record by Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX), written by Fred Singer. As the group Ozone Action documented, Singer has been a lifetime contrarian on virtually every scientific subject imaginable - acid rain, nuclear winter, nuclear waste, nuclear war, ozone depletion, secondhand smoke, amphibian population loss, and even minimum wage benefits. In recent decades he’s worked for a plethora of fossil fuel-funded think tanks, denying established climate science. Singer’s WSJ editorial is difficult to follow, largely because it contradicts itself several times, saying: there is also good data showing sea levels are in fact rising at an accelerating rate ... to keep the rate of rise constant, as observed... Obviously if sea level rise is accelerating, it’s not increasing at a constant rate. The WSJ later “corrected” that first sentence, thus removing one of the few accurate statements in the editorial - sea level rise is indeed accelerating. The article has been updated from “data showing sea levels are in fact rising at an accelerating rate” to “in fact rising at a constant rate”which doesn’t make it more correct.@WSJopinion @jamestaranto why the quiet update? pic.twitter.com/l9IftFNpSB Singer’s explanation for why the accelerating sea level rise isn’t accelerating likewise contradicts itself: the temperature of sea water has no direct effect on sea-level rise … accumulation of ice on the Antarctic continent has been offsetting the steric effect [sea level rise due to warming temperatures] for at least several centuries. Here, Singer first claims that the basic physics of thermal expansion is wrong, or at least somehow doesn’t apply to ocean water, but then argues it is real and is merely being offset by ice growth on Antarctica. The latter claim is of course also wrong – Antarctica has been losing land ice and a recent study found that it’s responsible for 8% of sea level rise since 1993 (thermal expansion is the biggest contributor, at 42%).  As one sea level researcher at Climate Feedback described Singer’s editorial, “If this were an essay in one of my undergraduate classes, he would fail.” The whole thing is complete nonsense, denying basic physics, and yet was published in the WSJ and entered into the congressional record. This is the material that House Republicans and their conservative media allies who reject climate science and oppose all climate policies find most compelling. That says a lot about the state of climate denial on the American right today. Latest #WallStreetJournal op-ed ""The Sea Is Rising, but Not Because of Climate Change"".Stay tuned for these great followup @WSJ op-eds:""Objects are falling, but Not Because of Gravity""""Continents are moving, but Not Because of Plate Tectonics""..https://t.co/GW7NHaZamT Around the same time, Politico ran a story written by Jonathan Lesser, who’s an energy industry consultant with the Koch-, Mercer-, tobacco industry-, and Exxon-funded Manhattan Institute (which Politico failed to mention). It claims, based on a Manhattan Institute report written by Lesser, that “more electric cars and trucks will mean more pollution.” This conclusion rests upon a number of shaky assumptions. First, it considers not today’s power grid mix, but rather the US Energy Information Administration (EIA)’s projections out to the year 2050. The EIA is notorious for underestimating the growth of clean energy, and projects that coal will continue to supply 22% of US electricity 32 years hence. To put this in perspective, the share of US electricity supplied by coal fell from 51% in 2008 to 31% in 2016. According to an analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists, nearly half of the remaining coal plants will likely retire or convert to natural gas in the near future. In short, the EIA is unrealistically bullish on fossil fuels. Electricity generated by burning coal produces significant air pollution, and so using these assumptions, Lesser concludes that American electric cars will generate more air pollutants that are harmful to human health than gasoline-powered cars. But if the electricity generated to charge electric vehicles is cleaner than in his assumptions – a near-certainty – the conclusions won’t hold. Lesser also admits that even with these conservative assumptions, carbon pollution emissions from electric cars would be at least 70% lower in 2050 than those from gasoline-powered cars. He dismisses this result by claiming “the [carbon pollution] reductions will have no impact on climate” (because it’s a small change relative to the carbon pollution from all American power generation), but this argument could apply to any individual effort to cut carbon pollution (it’s called a ‘Tragedy of the Commons’). In fact, transportation currently accounts for close to 30% of US carbon pollution, so switching to electric cars is a critically important step to tackle America’s large contribution to climate change. The cleanliness of an electric car depends on the source of its electricity, and that varies greatly by region. The Union of Concerned Scientists created an interactive tool to check this based on US zip code. Currently, half of American electric cars are sold in California, where in many areas they achieve an equivalent of 130 miles per gallon. And about one-third of households buying electric cars today also have solar panels to charge them, producing zero-pollution fuel. In short, yes, electric cars are green and global warming is causing sea level rise. It’s not a coincidence that arguments to the contrary are made by individuals whose paychecks and campaign donations are supplied by the fossil fuel industry."
"Last summer, the United states was pummeled with three severe hurricanes in rapid succession. It was a truly awesome display of the power of weather and the country is still reeling from the effects. In the climate community, there has been years of research into the effect that human-caused global warming has on these storms – both their frequency and their power.  The prevailing view is that in a warming world, there will likely be fewer such storms, but the storms that form will be more severe. Some research, however, concludes that there will be both more storms and more severe ones. More generally, because there is more heat, there is more activity, which can be manifested in several ways.  Regardless, there is very little doubt that a warmer planet can create more powerful storms. The reason is that hurricanes feed off of warmer ocean water. In order to form these storms, oceans have to be above about 26°C (about 80°F). With waters that hot, and with strong winds, there is a rapid evaporation of moisture from the ocean. The resulting water vapor enters into the storm, providing the energy to power the storm as the water vapor condenses and falls out of the storm as rain. As a large hurricane passes over warm water, it sucks in heat not only from the top layer of water but also from quite deep in the ocean, at least 160 meters (approximately 525 feet) or more. The main way heat is pulled out of the ocean is through the aforementioned evaporation process. There are also smaller effects from mixing the ocean waters and blocking sunlight to the ocean. Basically, when a hurricane passes over warm waters, the ocean “sweats” and cools off – a process enabled by the strong winds. The image below shows this evaporation and condensation process. A very recent publication in the journal Earth’s Future studied the impact of hurricanes on warm oceans in order to understand how warm waters fuel the storms and also how storms affect the water temperatures. With Hurricane Harvey, a near perfect natural laboratory was available in the Gulf of Mexico. Temperature measurements are plentiful there and the scientists were able to measure the total ocean heat content in the upper 160 meters just before Hurricane Harvey passed and compare the heat measured after the storm.  What they found was very interesting. As seen in the image below, before the storm (top frame), the ocean heat content was very high (red colors). After the hurricane passed (bottom frame), the waters were notably cooler.  The scientists calculated that the waters lost approximately 6 x 1020 Joules of heat because of Harvey. That’s about 10 million times as much energy as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Then the scientists used rainfall data and calculated how much heat fell in the form of rain. The results were a nearly perfect match with the energy taken up by the storm. That is, they were able to balance the energy and water flows into and out of the storm to a very high level of accuracy. With the passage of the hurricane and the “cold wake,” it made the scientists consider how future storms would be impacted. That is, any storms following Harvey would pass over a cooler ocean and should not be as intense as Harvey was.  The researchers discovered that the so-called “cold wake” was still hot enough to fuel future storms. The surface temperatures were reduced by about 2°C (3°F), but remained above the threshold needed to fuel hurricanes. The reason why the waters remained hot was that the temperatures before Harvey were off-the-charts hot because of human warming. Just before Harvey, ocean waters both globally and in the Gulf of Mexico were at record temperatures. So, what does this all mean? First of all, the balancing of energy flow into and out of a hurricane is a tremendous accomplishment and it validates much of what is understood about these storms. Secondly, this study shows that storms can become more violent in a warming world. Not only that, but there is the potential of getting very active seasons, as occurred in 2017. All of this is related to the high water temperatures not only at the ocean surface but also deep beneath the surface."
"Lawyers acting for a group including a French lavender farmer and members of the indigenous Sami community in Sweden have launched legal action against the EU’s institutions for failing to adequately protect them against climate change. A case is being pursued in the Luxembourg-based general court, Europe’s second highest, against the European parliament and the council of the European Union for allowing overly high greenhouse gas emissions to continue until 2030.  The families, including young children, claim their lives have been blighted by the policy decisions in Brussels, and that the EU’s inadequate emissions targets will cause more suffering. The legal complaint asserts that the EU’s existing climate target to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, does not protect their fundamental rights of life, health, occupation and property. The litigants, from Portugal, Germany, France, Italy, Romania, Kenya, Fiji, and the Swedish Sami Youth Association Sáminuorra, say the EU should define a higher reduction target. The claim specifically targets the EU’s emission trading scheme directive, the effort sharing regulation and the land use, land use change and forestry regulation. The plaintiffs, who are not seeking compensation for their loss, are asking the court to declare the three acts null and void, “since they violate the plaintiff’s rights and are not in line with higher ranking law”. According to a legal summary of the complaint, to avoid a vacuum, the court will be asked to keep the acts in force until a stronger version of them has been enacted. Lawyers claim there is a case for this in article 263 of the treaty on the functioning of the EU. In 2015, a court in The Hague ordered the Dutch government to cut its emissions by at least 25% within five years, ruling that its plans to cut emissions by 14-17% compared with 1990 levels by 2020 were unlawful, given the scale of the threat posed by climate change. The government has appealed the decision, which will be heard in The Hague on Monday. Maurice Feschet, 72, a lavender farmer in Grignan, Provence, told the Guardianhe became involved in the action against the EU after losing 44% of his harvest in six years because of climate change. He said: “My family has been farming here since the 1800s. I am taking this action for my 38-year-old son who lives on the farm. We want him to continue to be able to farm, but it is not going to be easy. There must be more done.” Alfredo Sendim, 52, an organic farmer in central Portugal, said the irregularity of the climate in his area raised serious doubts about the long-term sustainability of his business. He said: “Last year we had almost the entire year without a drop of rain. Then we had two weeks and all the rain that we should have had fell.” In Sweden, the traditional Sami way of life herding reindeer is said to be under pressure from rising temperatures that threaten the size of herds. Warmer winters mean less snow and more rain freezing into ice, making it harder for the animals to reach the plants they need to eat.  Sanna Vannar, 22, the chair of Sáminuorra, said: “If we lose the reindeers, the Sami culture will be lost. Many of the Sami youth want to stay with their families and be reindeer herders, but they cannot see a future. This is mostly due to the threat of climate change. This must be urgently addressed for the safety of our generation and the next generations.” Roda Verheyen, the lawyer acting on behalf of the families, said: “Climate change is already an issue for the courts in the European countries and around the world. “The plaintiff families are putting their trust in the EU courts and legal system to protect their fundamental rights of life, health, occupation and property which are under threat of climate change. The EU courts must now listen to these families and ensure that they are protected.” Scientists from the thinktank Climate Analytics are providing expert evidence to the families’ lawyers. The German non-governmental organisation Protect the Planet is bearing all the costs related to the legal case. Climate Action Network (CAN), Europe’s largest NGO working on climate and energy issues, is also supporting the action. Wendel Trio, CAN’s director in Europe, said: “This is part of a strategy to get the EU institutions to increase their targets. In 2015, as part of the Paris agreement, countries agreed to pursue efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5°C. “Yet, it is clear that the existing EU 2030 climate target is not enough to respect the commitments taken in the Paris agreement and should be increased. The EU needs under the agreement to confirm its target by 2020. This legal action initiated by normal families impacted by climate change is underlining the urgency and the necessity to increase it.” "
"I read with interest your editorial (One child, two children or too many? Planning families is not easy, 4 June). The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) strongly agrees that “crude attempts to raise and lower birthrates are unlikely to produce sustainable solutions”. Instead, they are more likely to violate internationally agreed human rights standards and cost women their freedom or lives. UNFPA promotes the view that family planning should always be firmly based on the right of all individuals to control their fertility and therefore determine freely the number of their children, which your sensible recommendations on education and empowerment of women and greater access to family planning support.  This right was proclaimed 50 years ago, in May 1968, at the international conference on human rights. The principle of informed free choice, without any coercion, is essential to the long-term success of family planning. Experience has repeatedly shown that challenging population dynamics (as a result of high or low fertility) are best addressed by respecting women’s rights. Sadly, more than 200 million women lack access to modern contraception, with about $700m needed to meet their demand for something that will save and transform their lives. This requires a collective will and funding to provide women with the means to exercise their right to determine their family size.Arthur ErkenDirector, division of communications and strategic partnerships, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund • Your editorial on the implications of family size and population erroneously bought into the narrow economic narrative that this is simply an issue of productivity, resources and dependency ratios. It is partly about those things – but far more importantly and fundamentally it is about our planetary crisis. In the era of climate change and with the “sixth mass extinction” well under way, we must recognise that each one of the extra 15,000 people added to our global population every hour places more demands on our already stressed planet and its ecosystems. Everyone on Earth deserves a fair, sustainable share of our planet’s resources – but that human right will only be possible if we learn to moderate both our numbers and consumption. Yes, there are challenges associated with lowering birthrate and promoting smaller families. Those are infinitely easier to solve than the environmental devastation exacerbated by the increasing billions of people on our finite planet. This is solvable through ethical, non-coercive means and the available technology of family planning – but only if we grasp the nettle now and take positive action.Robin MaynardDirector, Population Matters • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"

"     They are often tiny, frequently brown and always challenging to identify but an average of one new species of pyralid moth each year is turning up in Britain, according to experts. Almost 30 new species of this large family of “micro-moths” have been recorded over the last 30 years – either flying in themselves or being transported via the horticultural trade. While the abundance of moths is in decline, more than 125 new species of moth have been spotted in Britain this century alone, with 27 species establishing themselves as breeding species. People are being urged to spot and help document these new arrivals as part of this year’s Moth Night, an annual three-night event to record and celebrate moths, organised by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and wildlife publisher Atropos. “Just because something is called a micro-moth, don’t assume it’s tiny and brown and dull and impossible to identify because some of these aren’t,” said Richard Fox of Butterfly Conservation. “Moths in general are a fantastic, interesting group of wildlife that’s still relatively diverse – there are hundreds of species in your back garden. Anyone who is interested in wildlife will find that exciting and inspiring.” Newly arrived micro-moths include Musotima nitidalis, originally from Australia and New Zealand, which reached Britain in 2009 via the horticultural trade. The moth is now found in several locations in southern England, where its caterpillars feed on ferns such as bracken. Many of the recent pyralid colonists have arrived naturally, probably assisted by climate change, including the beautifully coloured Evergestis limbata, which has settled along the south coast of England. According to Fox, most of the new arrivals are entirely benign although one, the box tree moth, will be unpopular with gardeners for its caterpillars’ habit of devouring the leaves of box hedges. Easy to see native pyralids include the day-flying mint moth, which can be found among garden herbs and the small magpie – a surprisingly large black and white moth. Common migrants include the rush veneer and rusty-dot pearl. The caterpillars of another group of pyralid moth, the china-marks, live in an air-filled bubble of spun leaves, sometimes below the surface of ponds or at the edge of streams. As well as apps and online guides, there is a new guidebook on pyralid moths to help spotters. Mark Tunmore of publisher Atropos said: “New species are being added to the British list with regularity and we want to make sure that people are well equipped to identify these. We expect Moth Night 2018 to add to our knowledge of this group of moths.” "
"Climate change is a “current and existential national security risk” to Australia, a Senate inquiry has told parliament, one that could inflame regional conflicts over food, water and land, and even imperil life on Earth. The Senate committee inquiry into the implications of climate change for Australia’s national security recommended an increase in foreign aid to be dedicated to climate change mitigation and adaptation in the region, as well as a government white paper on climate security, Department of Defence emissions targets and a dedicated climate security post within the Department of Home Affairs. The inquiry, which released its report on Thursday afternoon, heard that the security risk of climate change was not a possible future threat but one that endangers Australia and its region now. The Asia-Pacific was the region “most vulnerable” to the security and humanitarian impacts of climate change, the committee heard, and faced an “existential threat”. An existential threat was defined as “one that threatens the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development”. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The committee report said climate change threatened Australians’ health, and the viability of communities, businesses and the economy. Climate change was heightening the severity of natural hazards, increasing the spread of infectious diseases and increasing water insecurity, and threatening agriculture. Sherri Goodman, a former US deputy undersecretary of defence in the Clinton administration and founder of the CNA Military Advisory Board, told the committee climate change was a “threat multiplier”, exacerbating existing conflicts over water and other resources, and that it posed “a direct threat to the national security of Australia”. “The problem also is not a distant one in the future but it’s now. We are experiencing this in regular sunny-day flooding at military bases in the United States and in changes in the Arctic, forcing the first wave of displaced persons from villages in the Arctic.” The Climate Council told the committee climate change was “already contributing to increases in the forced migration of people within and between nations, as well as playing a role in heightening social and political tensions, flowing onto conflict and violence”. The Australian government has recognised the security implications posed by climate change. Its seventh national communication on climate change to the United Nations in December highlighted that Australia was “already experiencing the impacts of a changing climate, particularly changes associated with increases in temperature, the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events, extreme fire weather and drought”. It noted “communities in the Torres Strait are already being impacted by rising sea levels and many of the region’s coral reefs have been severely impacted by increased sea surface temperatures”. And the Department of Defence agreed climate change had the potential to worsen existing conflicts. “When climate impacts are combined with ethnic or other social grievances, they can contribute to increased migration, internal instability or intrastate insurgencies, often over greater competition for natural resources. These developments may foster terrorism or cross-border conflict.” The Senate committee heard that acute climate disruption – in particular long-running and severe droughts – exacerbated conflicts in Mali and Syria, contributing to the destabilisation of fragile states. In Australia’s region, the Australian Council for International Development said: “For Pacific nations such as Tuvalu, Kiribati and Micronesia, climate change is already a genuine existential threat with the capacity to diminish their livelihoods and even erase their states’ territorial footprints.” The Senate committee noted Australia does not have an overarching climate security strategy.  Research Director for Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration David Spratt said there was a disconnect between the evidence presented to the inquiry and the recommendations that emerged from it. “Existential risk management requires brutally honest articulation of the risks, opportunities and the response time frame. At the moment we are knowingly locking in an existential disaster without being prepared to articulate that fact … at least this Senate inquiry report is significant for having broken the ice, but it should be so much more.” Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson said the defence personnel who appeared before the committee “engaged deeply with climate change science and were in no doubt that a warming world is a more dangerous world”. “What this inquiry has brought home to me is that when people choose to engage with the climate science, without any partisan or ideological blinkers, they quickly understand the seriousness of the challenge and decide to act. We have seen that the Australian Defence Force is changing how it does things because it is taking climate change seriously, but we have a government that is doing nothing to reduce emissions to actually reduce the threat of climate change itself.”"
"The Amazon rainforest is often called the earth’s lungs, and generates 20% of the world’s oxygen. Yet in the past half-century nearly a fifth of it has been cut down. The felling and burning of millions of trees is releasing massive amounts of carbon, in turn depleting the Amazon’s capacity to be one of the world’s largest carbon sinks – the natural systems that suck up and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Recently, 25 children brought a lawsuit to end the deforestation and its devastating impacts on the environment and their own wellbeing. The case made its way to Colombia’s supreme court, which issued its decision last month. While deforestation is hardly a new issue in this region, the court’s response to the lawsuit certainly was. Commenting that environmental degradation – not only in the Amazon but worldwide – is so significant that it threatens “human existence”, the court declared the Colombian Amazon a “subject of rights”. In 1972 the law professor Christopher Stone published a seminal article, Should Trees Have Standing?, that explored the possibility of recognising the legal rights of nature. He described how women and slaves had long been treated as rightless in law, and suggested that just as they had eventually attained rights, so trees and other nonhuman living things should also do so. Today, environmental laws regulate the human use and destruction of nature. They legalise fracking, drilling, and even dynamiting the tops off mountains to mine coal. The consequences are proving catastrophic: the die-off crisis of the world’s coral reefs, accelerating species extinction, climate change. Finally, though, this is changing. In 2006 the first law recognising the legal rights of nature was enacted in the borough of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, in the United States. The community sought to prevent dredging sludge laden with PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl) being dumped in an abandoned coalmine. The organisation I work for, the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, helped the council draft the law, transforming nature from being rightless to possessing rights to exist and flourish. It was the first such law in the world. Communities across more than 10 US states have now followed suit, including New Hampshire, Colorado and Pittsburgh. After the decision to grant legal rights to nature in Pennsylvania, representatives of my organisation met Ecuador’s constituent assembly in 2008, which was elected to draft a new constitution. We discussed the rights of nature, and why communities all over the world find themselves unable to protect nature under laws that authorise its exploitation. The assembly’s president, Alberto Acosta, told us: “Nature is a slave.” However, that year Ecuador enshrined the rights of nature – or Pachamama (Mother Earth) – in its constitution, the first country to do so. Since then Bolivia has put in place a Law of Mother Earth. Courts in India and Colombia have similarly ruled that ecosystems possess rights. In Mexico, Pakistan, Australia and other countries, rights-of-nature frameworks are being proposed and enacted. Colombia’s supreme court was asked to consider the climate-change impacts of Amazon deforestation in the lawsuit that led to its groundbreaking ruling. Similarly, in Nepal the Center for Economic and Social Development is working to advance rights to protect against climate change. The Himalayas – known as the world’s third pole – are experiencing warming faster than any other mountain range on earth. With the melting of ice and snow, a Sherpa told us, “the mountains are turning black”. But now a constitutional amendment has been developed that would, if adopted, recognise the rights of the Himalayas to a climate system free from global-warming pollution. It would for the first time provide a platform for Nepal to hold major climate polluters accountable for violating the rights of the mountains. Law today divides the world into two categories: persons, capable of having rights; and property, unable to possess rights. While there is no universally agreed upon definition of “legal person”, it is generally understood to mean an entity capable of bearing rights and duties. The problem that the rights-of-nature movement is now encountering is that this definition is predictably problematic when it comes to rivers, forests or nature more broadly. In 2017, for example, the state high court in Uttarakhand, India, ruled that in order to protect the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, they should be considered legal persons with “all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a living person”. In a subsequent appeal to India’s supreme court, the state government asked whether, if the rivers flood, leading to the death of a human being, a lawsuit could be filed for damages. Could the Uttarakhand chief secretary of state, named by the court as one of several officials in loco parentis, be held liable on the river’s behalf? In this case, the supreme court decided not. Can we hold a river accountable for flooding, or a forest for burning? Of course not. Yet existing legal systems force us to think of nature in terms of human concerns rather than what concerns nature. With the past three years the warmest in recorded history, and as we face what has been called the sixth great extinction, lawmakers and judges appear increasingly to agree that it is time to secure the highest form of legal protection for nature, through the recognition of rights. To make progress in this area, we must break away from legal strictures that were never intended to apply to nature, such as legal personhood, and establish a new structure that addresses what nature needs. Perhaps we can call this framework legal naturehood. A recent symposium at Tulane Law School, in New Orleans, brought together academics, lawyers and activists to develop a set of guidelines for recognising and enforcing legal rights of nature, known as the rights-of-nature principles. These define the basic rights that nature needs, including rights to existence, regeneration and restoration. Further, they call for monetary damages derived from violations of these rights to be used solely to protect and restore nature to its pre-damaged state. In addition, they outline a means for nature to defend its own rights – like children unable to speak for themselves in court – by being the named “real party in interest” in administrative and court proceedings. The principles build on laws and judicial decisions that have begun to accumulate in this new area of law, laying the groundwork for what legal naturehood could look like. As daily headlines tell us how we are tearing holes in the very fabric of life on earth, it is time to make a fundamental shift in how we govern ourselves towards nature – before, as Colombia’s constitutional court wrote, it’s too late. • Mari Margil is associate director of the US-based Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund"
"One fundamental point has been overlooked by Kevin Rushby in his article about the plight of the countryside due to agriculture (The killing fields, G2, 31 May). There has been no intensification of agriculture in the UK for 25 years. Government statistics show pesticide and fertiliser use has been significantly reduced. There are fewer crops grown and the numbers of pigs, sheep and cattle have fallen. So to point the finger at farming as the cause of environmental degradation through intensification makes no sense, especially when you consider the other changes that have taken place in that time – increased housebuilding, more roads, and more cars on those roads – and the impact they have had on the country’s landscape.  As British farmers we are up for the challenge of improving the way we farm in harmony with wildlife while not decreasing food production. But this will not be achieved through some sort of kneejerk blame game that focuses purely on agriculture rather than the bigger picture about how we are all leading our lives and using Britain’s land. We should remember here that if British farmers produce less then we as a nation become more dependent on imports for our food needs. These will most likely come from countries where environmental protection gets lower priority. The British countryside is not a degraded, sterile landscape. It is a rich and beautiful one managed by farmers and much appreciated by most people. I’d urge your reporters to drive through the agricultural heartlands of the US midwest, South America or eastern Europe and report back how they compare with our green and pleasant land.Guy SmithDeputy president, National Farmers’ Union • Industrialised agriculture is often harmful (Industrial-scale beef production is a sign of crisis in our farming, 31 May) but is often claimed to be necessary for food security. Levels of food wastage suggest otherwise. The IMechE’s Waste Not, Want Not report estimates that at least 30% of global production never reaches shops or markets, while massive waste occurs in shops, restaurants, canteens, homes, outside fast-food stores and on airlines. Wasteful uses of human food include livestock feed, biofuels, alcoholic drinks, cosmetics and even packaging. Add in overeating, excessive cash-crop production and the stampede to cover good land in development, and clearly there is massive scope for both increasing and improving food supplies just by reducing waste, although there are other options. Methane-reducing feed additives for ruminant livestock have existed for decades but not been adopted, even though they often boost growth.Iain ClimieWhitchurch, Hampshire • Your report on the study led by Joseph Poore (Avoid meat and dairy to reduce your impact on planet, say scientists, 1 June) is right about everything concerning our production of meat and dairy foods except that by far the single most effective thing you can do to reduce your environmental footprint is to not reproduce. The most recent of many studies showing this, published in 2017 by researchers at Sweden’s Lund University and Canada’s University of British Columbia (Best solution to climate change? Fewer children, 12 July 2017), found that having one fewer child was about 60 times more effective than eating a plant-based diet, 30 times better than avoiding airplane travel and 20 times better than living car-free. Since the study led by Poore did not rigorously compare the environmental impact of our diet with such other factors, he cannot base his claim that diet is “the single biggest way” for us to lower our footprints on that study. It is not in the interest of either sustainability or quality of life for the Guardian to continue to almost always regard population size as a negligible impact factor. All environmental and animal-welfare problems are much easier to solve at the present human population level – or of course lower – than after the highly likely addition of 2 or 3 billion more people in the next few decades.Dr Blake AlcottIstanbul, Turkey • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"When we think of global warming and climate change, most of us ignore the impacts that animals have on the environment. Climate affects animals, but is the reverse true? Can animals affect the climate? I don’t know how to answer that question definitively, but I was fortunate enough to read a very recent paper from a top fluid dynamics research team from Stanford. The team, led by Dr. John Dabiri, is well known for their work on bio-inspired flow. Part of what they study is the influence of living organisms on fluid flow, especially flow of water in the oceans.  This team’s recent work deals with something called aggregate motion of swimmers and it was published in Nature this year. The researchers wanted to know what happens when thousands (or millions) of small creatures swim in a single direction. Can the wakes they create add up to a larger scale motion and can these motions affect the ocean waters that they swim through? The team fabricated large tanks and filled them with water and Artemis salina (a species of brine shrimp). Using LED lights they were able to get the shrimp to swim upwards and downwards in the tank, replicating their daily vertical migrations. In the oceans, the vertical motion is hundreds of meters, but in the experiment, the shrimp swam upwards and downwards just a few meters.  Before the shrimp began their motion, the researchers measured the water stratification. That is, less dense water tends to rise to the top while heavier, more dense water sinks. In the oceans, as well as in experiments, the water density is dictated by its saltiness and the temperature.  The authors discovered something amazing. After tricking the shrimp to swim upwards and downwards in the tank, the water stratification changed greatly. The shrimp brought heavier water upwards and lighter water downwards. While one or even a few hundred shrimp may not change the water structure, thousands of shrimp moving together can. A video of upward aggregate shrimp motion is shown here. Fluid motion from a single shrimp is shown here. What the researchers also discovered was that shrimp, because they are dense, find it more difficult to swim upwards than downwards. Consequently, they have to create a strong propulsion jet when they swim upwards and virtually no propulsion jet when traveling downwards. Since these small propulsion jets are additive, shrimp cause much more mixing as they rise through the ocean waters compared to their descent. At the end of the day, the effect aggregate motion and turbulent mixing increased the normal mixing capacity of the water by a thousandfold. I asked Dr. Dabiri about the importance of this project and he told me:  Ocean dynamics are directly connected to global climate through interactions with the atmosphere. The fact that swimming animals could play a significant role in ocean mixing – an idea that has been almost heretical in oceanography – could therefore have consequences far beyond the immediate waters where the animals reside. What would be really interesting to know is how this vertical mixing may affect the heating of the planet. By stirring up ocean waters, do the shrimp help bring cool water to the surface and carry hotter waters under the surfaces? And, if this is occurring, how large is the impact on a global scale?"
"New targets will set Scotland on course to become one of the first countries in the world to achieve a 100% reduction in carbon emissions, the Scottish government has claimed, although it has stopped short of committing to becoming carbon-neutral by 2050. The draft climate change bill, published on Thursday morning, sets a target of a 90% reduction by 2050 – which the UK Committee on Climate Change states is currently “at the limit of feasibility” – with the aim of achieving 100% reduction, or “net-zero”, as soon as possible.  Announcing the targets, Holyrood’s climate change secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, said: “Our 90% target will be tougher even than the 100% goal set by a handful of other countries, because our legislation will set more demanding, legally binding, annual targets covering every sector of our economy. By 2030, we will cut emissions by two-thirds and, unlike other nations, we will not use carbon offsetting, where other countries are paid to cut emissions for us, to achieve our goal.” But Tom Ballantine, chair of Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, described the targets as hugely disappointing. “By failing to ally with the global momentum towards zero emissions, led by countries like France, Sweden and New Zealand, Scotland is missing a huge opportunity to end its contribution to climate change in a generation, attract clean investment and retain its position as a leader on the global stage,” he said. Ballantine called on MSPs from all parties to push for net-zero by 2050 at the latest, to keep Scotland in line with the 2016 Paris agreement. Earlier this month, transport minister Humza Yousaf admitted that the Scottish government did not have to the powers to ban the sale of diesel cars, despite pledging to phase them out across the country by 2032, eight years ahead of the UK government’s target.  On Tuesday, following a two-hour debate at their annual general assembly, the Church of Scotland voted by a narrow margin against divestment from oil and gas companies."
"The renewed upward march of global carbon emissions is worrying and a big step backwards in the fight against climate change, according to BP. Emissions rose 1.6% in 2017 after flatlining for the previous three years, which the British oil firm said was a reminder the world was not on track to hit the goals of the Paris climate deal. Renewable power generation grew by 17% last year, led by wind and followed by what BP called “stunning” growth in solar.  But strong economic growth led to above-average energy demand, coal use bounced back in China and efficiency gains slowed down, causing emissions to jump, the company’s annual statistical review of world energy found. Spencer Dale, the group’s chief economist, said: “At first blush, from an energy transition perspective, these numbers potentially look a bit disappointing.” The emissions rise was “slightly worrying” and a “pretty big backward step”, he said. “It suggests to me we are not on a path to the Paris climate goals.” However, the economist said there was an inevitability to the backsliding, because 2014-16 had seen an exceptionally fast shift to greener power sources, led by short-term targets in China. “I am more worried by the lack of progress in the power sector over the past 20 years, than by the pickup in carbon emissions last year,” he said.  Dale said the power sector, in which BP has a limited presence, should do most of the heavy-lifting when it comes to future emissions cuts. “It’s frustrating that so much energy is devoted to other bits of the [energy] sector where you get relatively little bang for your buck,” he said, in reference to emissions savings from switching from oil-burning cars to electric ones. BP said the world’s appetite for oil remained strong, as it grew 1.8% last year.  Production cuts by Opec and Russia had achieved their aim of bringing oil supply and demand back into balance, Dale said. But he cautioned that oil prices – which recently hit $80 (£60) per barrel but have since fallen back to about $76 – were now so high they were beginning to curb oil demand. “If we saw oil prices maintain at these levels, that would eat into oil demand,” he said.  BP reported profits up 71% for the first three months of the year, off the back of the resurgent oil price."
