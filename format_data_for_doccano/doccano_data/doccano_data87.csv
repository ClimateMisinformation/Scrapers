"World leaders should give international efforts to fight global warming a new push by ratifying the historic Paris climate deal in person, according to France’s foreign minister. Laurent Fabius, who steered December’s UN talks, wants heads of state to ratify the accord at a meeting in April in New York, so that it can be enshrined in international law. Nations accounting for more than 55% of global emissions must formally sign up before the Paris agreement can be made official.   He told the Guardian he had discussed the plans with UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon a few days ago, gaining his support, and was “pretty confident” that heads of government would attend what would be the third leaders’ climate summit in a little over six months.  “We should have the leaders there, to give a new impulse [to the implementation of the accord],” he said of the New York meeting, which he will preside over. “At the first day of Paris [which leaders attended] there was a tremendous push. It’s time for a new push in April.”  Fabius is acutely aware that, despite the success of the Paris negotiations, much more needs to be done before the future of the accord is secure. “There are many things which can go wrong,” he told the Guardian. “We have to avoid being lazy. We have to be calm, and to be hopeful. We have to talk to developing countries.” He pointed to the need to tackle emissions from aviation and maritime transport, which were omitted from the UN talks, and which he said are urgent.  More work is needed on setting out clear rules on how to monitor emissions in a “transparent” fashion, he said. African countries must be assured that they are receiving the support that was promised to them at Paris. Businesses must also receive cooperation from governments to develop new clean technologies that will be “decisive” in bringing down emissions.  Fabius also called for a renewed focus on the possibility of putting a price on carbon, pointing to a Chinese plan to institute a national system of carbon trading from next year. This would be a major step forward, he said. At Paris, 196 countries agreed to limit greenhouse gases in line with scientific advice, to avoid temperature rises of more than 2C, and to review their commitments and progress on meeting them every five years. This framework is legally binding, and most countries - including all the biggest emitters - also set out national targets for emissions, to 2025 or 2030.  Fabius addressed the European parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday, asking MEPs for their continued support for plans for the EU to meet its obligations on greenhouse gas emissions. He set out “four Ps” which he said are needed to implement the Paris agreement: the process of ratification of the accord, including the April meeting; clarifying the principles underlying the agreement, such as a precise definition of climate change financing, rules on the conduct of the five-year reviews and the transparency of monitoring emissions; the pre-2020 period, during which countries must make progress on their existing emissions goals; and preparing for this November’s UN climate conference, ‘COP22’. The success of the Paris conference was a rare bright moment in a dark end to 2015 for France, scarred by the terrorist attacks in November that left 130 people dead and scores more wounded. Fabius hailed the agreement as a triumph for international cooperation. “This is about security and peace,” he said. “There are massive risks to global warming, which could lead to widespread conflict. We have to stop that risk from becoming reality. That means this agreement was actually about peace for future generations, and current generations. This is a chaotic world, and a dangerous one. The Paris agreement is making the world safer.” Relaxed in a fashionably high-collared brown leather jacket as he travelled by French government plane to a snow-covered Strasbourg, Fabius reflected that the signing of the Paris accord had been just a beginning, though a very important one.  “We need to look for concrete measures now,” he said. “I think that will arrive. The shift [to tackling climate change] has been made now, and there will be no turning back.”  For the year ahead, Fabius has a punishing schedule of climate meetings as part of his role as president of the COP, which under UN convention continues until COP22 in November. After the summit in April there will be a meeting in Germany in May to discuss some of the details of the accord, then a further conference in Washington DC in May or June hosted by the US, followed by a meeting of local authorities from around the world in Nantes, France, in September, as well as meetings held with the IMF and World Bank, and the UN general assembly in September. During that time, it is widely expected that Fabius will leave his post as foreign minister, perhaps to be succeeded by his long-time rival Ségolène Royal. He has been tipped in France as a potential future candidate for UN secretary-general, with his steering of the Paris conference having burnished his credentials.  Though he declined to speculate on his future, Fabius noted that he could remain COP president without being French foreign minister."
"A look back at 2015 reveals some shocking corporate scandals, notably in September, when two of the world’s most powerful companies were spectacularly caught with their pants down. On 16 September, Inside Climate News revealed that ExxonMobil, the world’s fourth largest oil company, was aware of the environmental effects of burning fossil fuels as far back as the early 1980s. Instead of acting, however, it had chosen to spearhead climate denial. Just a few days later, car giant Volkswagen admitted to installing emissions test cheating software in up to 11m of its diesel cars. A study by scientists at West Virginia University had shown that Volkswagen’s diesel cars’ on-road NOx emissions were several times the legal limit.  While these two revelations may be unrelated, they reveal common threads that have created a business environment conducive to such repeated wrongdoings. Brought together, these threads – I would argue – can be viewed as four behavioural traits that have come to define today’s corporation:   The search for scale was typified over a century ago by Ford Motor Company. The term Fordism was coined to describe a strategy of growth to achieve economies of scale.  A century later, Volkswagen’s declared goal was to be the world’s number one car company by 2018. Volkswagen bet on its “fuel efficient” diesel-powered cars to achieve this and made an unethical choice to fit these cars with defeat devices, while pursuing a misleading advertising campaign around “clean diesel”.  For its part, ExxonMobil clearly saw the consequences of pursuing fossil fuels, but still chose to lead the denial lobby as that best served its financial interests in oil and gas. It spent more than $30m (£20.3m) between 1998 and 2014 funding climate scepticism, according to Greenpeace.  No doubt it recovered those costs many times over as it grew to become one of the largest corporations in the world, but it did so at immense public cost – the advancing upheavals of climate change.   Exxon’s brand of “scientific” lobbying obfuscated reality, reduced the urgency of climate change responses and was downright unethical.  Despite agreeing to stop funding climate denial in 2007, the company was since found to have donated $2.3m (£1.5m) to members of Congress and climate denying lobby group the American Legislative Exchange Council. The company also donated millions annually towards election campaigns. 85.5% of their US political donations in 2014 were directed towards the Republican Party, of whose remaining 2016 Presidential Candidates, none accepts climate science.  The VW scandal has thrown a spotlight on the relationship between car makers and regulators. The responsible investment charity ShareAction mobilised a coalition of 19 investors with £625m assets under management to write to car companies including VW to ask for clarity on their lobbying position around emissions legislation.  Even today, lobbying is seen in the corporate world as a fundamental right, and shamelessly so. Corporate lobbyist Grover Norquist famously said,  “I’m not in favour of abolishing the government. I just want to shrink it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub”. A corporation does have a right to be heard, but at what cost? The kind of lobbying that furthers private profits by frustrating regulation that protects public wealth is morally questionable. It is also economically questionable when it destroys more public wealth than it creates private profits.  This brings us to the penchant for internalising profits while externalising costs. When VW decided to install emissions test defeating devices, it appears not to have considered the negative environmental consequences of emitting around 1m tonnes of pollution every year, or the financial loss to US taxpayers, who were billed $51m for VW’s green car subsidies. And what might the cost be for what Bill McKibben called the “wasted decades”, when Exxon – one of the world’s biggest, most powerful companies – knew about the dangers of climate change and chose to look the other way?  Corporate externalities are the biggest free lunch in human history and, like all free lunches, cannot go on forever. Consumers need clear information if they are to choose which products to buy based on transparent, quality-assured information on the true costs of different products, not just the shelf price.  Unfortunately, such information is rarely provided. In our media-dominated world companies routinely misinform their customers through unethical and unaccountable advertising.  Almost a hundred years ago, Listerine was credited for the “invention” of chronic halitosis as a health condition to promote its production of mouth washes. Its ad campaign from the 1920s – “Can I be happy with him in spite of that” – helped raise their revenues from $115,000 to $8m in just seven years.  The underlying purpose of advertising is to influence consumers’ decision-making, so it cannot avoid being manipulative. It preys on human insecurities, converting them into wants and wants into needs from which arises demand, which feeds production, volume and profits.  Gradually, a realisation is dawning that our dominant model for business is fatally flawed.  But all is not lost. Corporations can and sometimes do define social purpose. They can and sometimes do create positive externalities, such as the training of hundreds of thousands of aspiring young Indians by Infosys, or Tesla’s declaration of intent to make public its battery technology patents.  These are not instances of mere philanthropy, but examples of doing business in a way that creates smart strategic advantage while at the same time delivering public value. They show that a new world is possible: that of  a corporation which delivers shareholder profits but not at the cost of stakeholders. "
"David Cameron has defended his government’s record on the environment and climate change, saying suggestions of backsliding are “total and utter nonsense”. The prime minister also told the liaison committee, made up of MPs who chair select committees, that the government needs to do “more of everything” to deal with the flooding that has repeatedly hit the UK in recent years. Cameron, who pledged in 2010 to lead the “greenest government ever”, has faced concerted criticism over a series of reversals to green policies, including cuts to renewable energy subsidies and energy efficiency programmes. In November, the government cancelled its £1bn competition for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, despite the project being in the Conservative party’s election manifesto.  Cameron said that spending on low-carbon energy was set to double to £11bn in this parliament and that there had been an “absolute revolution in renewable energy” during his premiership, with 98% of solar energy installed since 2010. Subsidies for solar power will be slashed this week, but Cameron said: “You do have to think as prime minister that every penny you put in is a penny on energy bills.” The SNP’s Angus MacNeil, chair of the energy and climate committee, challenged this, saying onshore wind was the cheapest clean energy, but was being drastically restricted by the government.  Cameron told the liaison committee in December 2014 that CCS, which traps CO2 from coal and gas power plants and buries it, was “absolutely crucial if we are going to decarbonise effectively”. But he defended the scrapping of the £1bn policy, which was designed to help develop commercial-scale CCS, saying, “The economics are not working at the moment.” This was contradicted by US energy secretary Ernest Moniz, on 7 January, who tweeted: “Carbon capture is critical for solving climate change. And it’s working.” The prime minister highlighted the UK’s pioneering Climate Change Act and the carbon budgets it sets for the nation, and said: “We are more than meeting the targets.” However, a leaked letter in November revealed that the UK was not on track to meet an EU target for green energy in 2020. Furthermore, experts have argued, the government’s renewed dash for gas, including fracking, without CCS will make meeting future carbon targets extremely difficult. Tidal power has been promoted by chancellor George Osborne, who signalled support for a project in Swansea Bay. But Cameron poured cold water on the technology, saying that the current proposals were too expensive: “We have not seen any proposals coming forward that would would beat the [subsidy] strike price.” Friends of the Earth chief executive Craig Bennett said: “If dismantling a dozen green policies and putting 19,000 solar workers on notice isn’t ‘backsliding on green commitments’, I don’t know what is.” Cameron was challenged on flooding by Huw Irranca-Davies, chair of the environment audit committee, who quoted one expert stating that the UK’s “current approach to flooding was not only inadequate, but has no likelihood of ever being adequate”. Cameron cut flood defence spending in 2010, only raising it after floods hit later, and has been repeatedly warned of the UK’s rising risk of floods. “On flooding, there is no doubt we need to do more,” Cameron said. “We’ve seen what are called one-in-100-year events, or one-in-200-year events, and they happened in 2007, 2013, 2015, and the country wants us to do more, and we will do more.” The controversial issue of river dredging was raised by Neil Parish, chair of the environment, food and rural affairs committee, who praised Cameron for restarting dredging on the Somerset Levels.  The government is going to allow farmers to dredge ditches without securing permission from the Environment Agency, but experts have warned of the risk of faster-flowing rivers rising more quickly and increasing the risk of flood to towns and villages downstream. Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Angling Trust, said recently: “It is scandalous that the government has hidden from public view the advice of its own experts on the dangers of unregulated dredging and ignored the findings of the study into the pilot dredging projects. The evidence shows that the best way to reduce the risk of flooding is to manage land upstream to reduce the flow of water and soil off fields.” Cameron said a suggestion from Parish that farmers were given more incentive to store water on their land during periods of high rainfall made “very good sense”. The prime minister recounted an anecdote from the village of Kelmscott in his constituency when he visited a site where farmers were being sued by the EA for dredging without permission. Cameron said the EA was worried that some of the habitat of the water vole might have been destroyed. “At that moment, two water voles appeared on the river bank, almost in conversation, and in my mind, at that moment, the argument was settled,” he said."
"Europe is calling for a considerably less ambitious carbon emissions standard for airplanes than the US in a new global push to reduce aviation’s contribution to climate change, the Guardian has learned. The standard would mark a turning point for efforts to regulate fast-growing emissions from airplanes, which are not covered by December’s much-hailed Paris climate agreement.  The milestone would apply to new models and existing aircraft put into production after 2020, but the EU’s preferred version would be less stringent than alternative US proposals, which the Guardian has also seen. Both blueprints have been filed with the UN’s civil aviation agency, Icao, ahead of talks in Montreal next month. “The US proposal is definitely more ambitious,” said Joris Melkert, a former flight test engineer and senior aerospace lecturer at Delft University in the Netherlands. “It would save more emissions, and the difference is quite considerable.” The gap between the two proposals is greater than the annual emissions of most medium-sized European countries, and privately confirmed by EU officials.  Aviation is responsible for around 5% of the world’s global warming at present and the industry is growing so fast that, on current trends, it could make up 22% of global emissions by 2050, according to a recent European Parliament study. The Icao talks are pursuing a twin track approach of making airlines pay a cost for their CO2 output under a market-based scheme, and greening aircraft with a new fuel efficiency standard.  The debate on the standard began in 2007 and proposals agreed in Montreal will be sent on to an Icao council for approval next year. “After many years, decision time has finally come,” one EU official said. “I believe that we are going to have an ambitious standard and I hope we can secure it next month.” Airplanes emit CO2 in the process of burning engine fuel to provide a lift force that can overcome the aerodynamic drag created by wind resistance. For this reason, the Icao proposals focus on measures to improve planes’ aerodynamics, lightness and engines. Under the technical proposals, a stringency option of ‘9’ suggested by the US would reduce overall aircraft emissions by 37.5%, while the ‘7’ setting favoured by the EU would imply a 33% cut. The 4.5% gap is equal to 350m tonnes of CO2, or slightly more than Spain emits every year. EU officials privately concede that their proposal is “the second most ambitious of the positions put on the table”. But they insist that it is still “quite close to the US one” and that the agreement’s small print on cargo aircraft and categorisations should not be overlooked.  Environmentalists argue that the involvement of the Environmental Protection Agency and an unshackled president Obama in the US has contributed to the relative weakness of the EU’s position. But insiders in Brussels say that the sheer variety of complex issues still to be agreed – and the amount of aircraft manufacturing countries involved, from Brazil and Ukraine to India and China – make like-for-like comparisons unwise, and stringency factors of ‘10’ impossible. “There are so many parameters to be decided that it creates a lot of pieces you can move around on a chessboard,” one EU source told the Guardian. Europe has proposed a 60 tonne threshold for classifying aircraft, as this could cover 90% of emissions and apply to aircraft of the size of a Boeing 737 or Airbus 320 and above. But the classification would be further sub-divided between new model types and those in production; jets ferrying 19 people or less, and planes carrying freight instead of passengers. Alternate starting dates of 2020 and 2023 for the benchmark are other options under discussion. An EU source said: “We need a standard that reflects the state of art of the technology, that is as close as possible to what engineers are capable of doing, without going so high that a number of 60-tonne aircraft types would be put out of the market as that would be environmentally unhelpful, economically detrimental and also quite unfair, as lead-in times for aircraft take about 10 years.”"
"Susanlyn Singroy thinks the candidates for US president should be debating science. The eighth-grader argues that the candidates are talking about money, religion and immigration, but rarely mentioning the science challenges impacting her future. Singroy says, If they talk about the big science issues, maybe they’ll actually do something about them.  Her point is well taken. The Republican and Democratic candidates for president both held debates just days after the Paris climate summit, yet the debate moderators didn’t ask a single question about climate science—remarkable considering that climate change has emerged as a major global science, economic, environmental, tech, civil infrastructure, and foreign policy challenge. US journalists have similarly avoided asking the candidates about other major science, health, tech, and environmental issues. So Susan, who wants to be a scientist, decided to volunteer with other kids to create what may be the most memorable political ad you’ll see all year: I’m chair of sciencedebate.org, the volunteer-run nonprofit that produced the ad. We’re working with Susanlyn and other kids elevate these issues in the US political dialogue, because they disproportionately affect the next generation.  Candidates for president attend debates dedicated to economics and foreign policy, but science issues now have an equal or greater impact. Voters—and their kids—deserve a nationally televised discussion dedicated to science, health, tech and the environment. The public seems to agree. ScienceDebate.org and Research!America, a nonprofit that advocates for medical research, recently commissioned a national poll. We found that 87% of likely voters think the candidates for president ought to be well versed on science issues. 91% of Democrats, 88% of Republicans and 78% of Independents also said the presidential candidates should participate in a debate to discuss key science-based challenges facing the US.  What would such a debate look like? The possibilities for questions are fascinating, and could fill hours of discussion. Here’s a small sample: Americans deserve answers to these questions, and thinking about them now will make the candidates better qualified for the job they seek in November. Shawn Otto is a science writer and chair of ScienceDebate.org"

"  Countries can deliver on the promises of the historic Paris climate change agreement by rapid scaling up wind and solar power to 36% of the global energy mix by 2030, an international energy gathering will be told on Saturday.  The International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) meeting in Abu Dhabi – the first major global gathering since Paris – is seen as an important test of countries’ readiness to put those plans into action. Nearly 200 countries agreed to keep warming below 2C, and work towards a 1.5C limit, during the Paris climate negotiations last month. Some 187 put forward plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Now comes the hard part, government officials admit: making good on those promises by translating emissions cutting targets into policies, and expanding access to clean energy technologies. Irena said those goals were within reach – if countries move fast. Scaling up renewable energy to 36% of the global energy mix by 2030 would provide about half of the emissions reductions needed to hold warming to 2C. Energy efficiency could make up the rest.  “The Paris agreement set a long-term vision for the deep reduction of global emissions and the need to decarbonise the energy sector,” Adnan Amin, Irena’s director general said in a prepared statement. “The Irena assembly must now take the next steps and establish a blueprint for action to meet our climate goals and set the world on a path to a sustainable energy future.” In an effort to spur countries to action, an Irena report released on Saturday found doubling the share of renewables by 2030 would increase global GDP by up to 1.1% or about $1.3tn, and provide jobs for more than 24 million in the renewable sector. The United Nations climate chief, Christiana Figueres, has said repeatedly she was looking to the Paris agreement to send a clear signal to the business community of a shift away from a fossil-fuel driven economy. Some of those changes are already underway. Global clean energy investment attracted a record $329bn last year, according to a report released on Thursday by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The report noted the rise in clean energy investment came despite the drop in oil prices. Irena officials said they hoped that the Paris climate accord would add momentum to the shift. “We are not seeing climate change action as a cost, but starting to see it in terms of opportunities,” said Angela Kallhauge, Irena’s climate change officer.

"December was the wettest month ever recorded in the UK, with almost double the rain falling than average, according to data released by the Met Office on Tuesday.  Last month saw widespread flooding which continued into the new year, with 21 flood alerts in England and Wales and four in Scotland in force on Tuesday morning.  The record for the warmest December in the UK was also smashed last month, with an average temperature of 7.9C, 4.1C higher than the long-term average.  Latest stats show that December 2015 was the wettest calendar month ever in our records dating back to 1910 pic.twitter.com/rcAk9lLGj8 Climate change has fundamentally changed the UK weather, said Prof Myles Allen, at the University of Oxford: “Normal weather, unchanged over generations, is a thing of the past. You are not meant to beat records by those margins and if you do so, just like in athletics, it is a sign something has changed.” The Met Office records stretch back to 1910 and, while December saw a record downpour particularly affecting the north of England, Scotland and Wales, 2015 overall was only the sixth wettest year on record. The high temperatures in December would normally be expected in April or May and there was an almost complete lack of air frost across much of England. The average from 1981-2010 was for 11 days of air frost in December, but last month there were just three days. Across 2015, the average UK temperature was lower than in 2014, though globally 2015 was the hottest year on record. Allen said it has been predicted as far back as 1990 that global warming would mean warmer, wetter winters for the UK, with more intense rainstorms. The flooding caused by Storm Desmond, centred on Cumbria, is estimated to have been made 40% more likely by climate change. “If an athlete starts popping pills, it does not guarantee they win every race, but it does change their chances,” he told the BBC. “The physics [of climate change] is relatively simple: as we warm the atmosphere, the weather systems that move in from the Atlantic contain more moisture, so they dump more rain.” “We have known for a very long time that these signs were likely to be one of the earliest symptoms of climate change and now we are seeing them, it’s not very surprising,” Allen said. “Temperature and rainfall records will inevitably tumble as climate change intensifies,” said Prof David Reay, at the University of Edinburgh. “It is the increasingly extreme rainfall events, storm surges, heatwaves and droughts that will truly test our resilience to climate change. On the evidence of the past month we are far from prepared.” The government’s own scientists warned that increased flooding was the greatest risk for the UK from climate change, but annual flood defence budgets were cut in 2011-12 and only recovered to previous levels with emergency funding in 2014-15. Clare Dinnis, flood risk manager at the Environment Agency, said: “Our work continues into the new year as we offer ongoing support to communities that have been affected by these terrible floods. With more wet weather due this week we are monitoring the situation across the country closely.” On Tuesday morning there were 21 flood alerts - meaning flooding is expected - across England and Wales, including eight in north-east England. There were also 138 flood warnings, meaning flooding is possible. In Scotland, there were four flood alerts and 32 flood warnings."

"2015 smashed the record for the hottest year since reporting began in 1850, according to the first full-year figures from the world’s three principal temperature estimates. Data released on Wednesday by the UK Met Office shows the average global temperature in 2015 was 0.75C higher than the long-term average between 1961 and 1990, much higher than the 0.57C in 2014, which itself was a record. The Met Office also expects 2016 to set a new record, meaning the global temperature records will have been broken for three years running. Temperature data released in the US on Wednesday by Nasa and by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) also showed 2015 shattered previous records. Experts warned that the record-breaking heat shows global warming is driving the world’s climate into “uncharted territory” and that it showed the urgency of implementing the carbon-cutting pledges made by the world’s governments in Paris in December. Heatwaves have scorched China, Russia, Australia, the Middle East and parts of South America in the last two years, while climate change made the UK’s record December rainfall, which caused devastating floods, 50-75% more likely. The Paris agreement commits the world’s nations to limit warming to below 2C compared to pre-industrial times, or 1.5C if possible, to avoid widespread and dangerous impacts. But the Met Office data, when compared to global temperatures before fossil fuel burning took off, shows that 2015 was already 1C higher. A strong El Niño event is peaking at the moment, putting the “icing on the cake” of high global temperatures. El Niño is a natural cycle of warming in the Pacific Ocean which has a global impact on weather. But scientists are clear that the vast majority of the warming seen in 2015 was due to the emissions from human activity. “Even without an El Niño, this would have been the warmest year on record,” said Prof Gavin Schmidt, director at Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He said he expected the long trend of rising global temperatures to continue because its principal cause – fossil fuel burning – was also continuing. “It is clear that human influence is driving our climate into uncharted territory,” said Prof Phil Jones, from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit, which produces the temperature record – called HadCRUT4 – with the Met Office. Peter Stott, at the Met Office’s Hadley Centre, said 2015 was the first year global average temperature was more than 1C above pre-industrial levels. Noaa’s global temperature records stretch back to 1880 and it also found 2015 was the hottest year yet, beating the previous high by a record margin. The agency also found December was warmer than any other month in the record, when compared to long-term averages. Ten of the 12 months in 2015 had record high temperatures for their respective months, according to Noaa. Nasa’s new data for 2015 also shattered its previous record and showed 15 of the 16 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001. “Climate change is the challenge of our generation,” said Nasa head Charles Bolden. “Today’s announcement is a key data point that should make policymakers stand up and take notice - now is the time to act.”  The Nasa, Noaa and HadCRUT4 temperature records all use independent methods to calculate the global average. They use many thousands of temperature measurements taken across the globe, on land and at sea, each day. There are uncertainties in the measurements, partly due to fewer measurements in the polar regions, and these are included in the calculations. Stott said: “Remaining uncertainties are clearly much smaller than the overall warming seen since pre-industrial times.” Another independent temperature record, from the Japan Meteorological Agency, indicates 2015 was by far the hottest year on record. Bob Ward, at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said: “This [record heat] should put pressure on governments to urgently implement their commitments to act against climate change, and to increase their planned cuts of greenhouse gases. The warming is already affecting the climate around the world, including dangerous shifts in extreme weather events. Those who claim that climate change is either not happening, or is not dangerous, have been conclusively proven wrong by the meteorological evidence around the world.” Despite constantly rising greenhouse gas emissions trapping ever more heat on Earth, the last decade has seen relatively slow warming of air temperatures, dubbed a “pause” in climate change by some. In fact, global warming had not paused at all. Instead, natural climate cycles led to more of the trapped heat being stored in the oceans (which already absorbed most the heat), some of which El Niño is now releasing. Scientists usually assess changes in climate over decades, rather than years, and the each of the last four decades has been warmer than any decade on record before.  “It’s the long term warming trend we need to worry about rather than one hot year,” said Prof Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds in the UK. “So we shouldn’t get too excited - but it is certainly a sign of things to come.”"
"Is organised climate science denial finished? After global heat records were continually broken over the last decade, and as sea levels rose and scientists reported the accelerated melting of polar ice sheets, you might be forgiven for thinking the debate over climate change had shifted.  No more arguing over the science? It’s more about the policy now, right? Well, wrong. At least according to a new study that has looked at 15 years worth of output from 19 conservative “thinktanks” in the United States. “We find little support for the claim that ‘the era of science denial is over’ - instead, discussion of climate science has generally increased over the sample period,” the study concludes. The conservative thinktanks under the microscope are the main cog in the machinery of climate science denial across the globe, pushing a constant stream of material into the public domain. The study, published in the journal Global Environmental Change, analysed more than 16,000 documents published online between 1998 and 2013 by mainly US groups like the Heartland Institute, the Cato Institute and the American Enterprise Institute. Contrary to some commentators, the study found attacks on science had increased in later years. At the same time, the thinktanks were focusing less on policy issues. To come to that conclusion authors Dr Travis Coan, of the University of Exeter, and Dr Constantine Boussalis, of Trinity College Dublin, analysed 8300 articles, 3000 reports, 100 interview transcripts, 680 open letters and press releases and 3400 “scientific” reviews. So did the result surprise them? Coan told me: One the one hand, we were aware that many in both the media and academia believed that science denial was on the decline. However, this didn’t fit with our casual reading of the skeptical literature and thus a major impetus of the paper was to put this idea to the test.  Though, with that said, we were a bit surprised by the ‘rise’: my prior expectation was that the denial of science and policy, at least on average, has remained relatively constant. This does not appear to be the case. Not only had the attacks on science increased but thinktanks had also ramped up their climate change output in recent years, the study found. But was it possible the study’s clear declaration that “the era of climate science denial is not over” might no longer stand, given that the study period ended in August 2013? After all, since then we have seen the record for the hottest year on record broken twice and, for the first time, more than 190 nations agreeing in Paris to keep global warming to “well below 2C”. Coan agreed this was “certainly possible”, but “there are also reasons to speculate that the trend has continued.” He said: We are currently working on a study with John Cook that looks at science and policy related themes (amongst other items) in the top 50 climate skeptic blogs through 2015. The topic structure (i.e. discourse) is very similar, and sometimes identical, to the conservative thinktanks and there is reason to think that these two time series move together. For the blogs, we find that the increase in science-related skepticism continues right through 2015. Again, these results are preliminary, but suggest that the ‘end of science denial’ - at least among these actors - might be wishful thinking. The study explained these thinktanks “provide a multitude of services to the cause of climate change scepticism”. These included: Many of the 19 thinktanks analysed in the study have in the past accepted funding from fossil fuel interests, such as oil giant Exxon and the billionaire Koch brothers. In October 2015 a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) found thinktanks that had taken corporate funding from the likes of Exxon and the Kochs were more likely to produce material designed to polarise the climate change issue. Exxon is currently facing an investigation from the New York attorney general into whether it lied to the public and investors about the risks of human-caused climate change. Dr Justin Farrell, the author of the PNAS study, told me he was pleased to see more research into conservative thinktanks. “We are still years away from fully understanding the extent of contrarian influence on climate change politics during the last 20 years,” he said. The latest study seems to show that thinktanks began to concentrate more on attacking the science in around 2003 but it took until about 2010 for science attacks to overtake policy discussions. But why did this happen? One possible reason, speculates Coan, is the effect of the 2009 illegal hacking of climate scientist’s emails from a server at the University of East Anglia. While subsequent investigations found no wrongdoing, conservative thinktanks and commentators ran hard with the “scandal” – and some still do – claiming scientists were part of a grand conspiracy to deceive the world. Dr Aaron McCright, of Michigan State University, who studies climate science denial, said the rising attacks on science appeared to have coincided with the election of Democrat Barack Obama as US president in late 2008. He said: The Right no longer controlled the Executive Branch or Congress... at least for the first few years of the Obama Administration.. and thus no longer had as much power inside the government to block climate change policy as they did under George W. Bush. So, they - and a considerable part of industry - ramped up denial activism after 2008 to the high levels we have seen since. McCright said the “denial machine” had since expanded from think tanks to include bloggers and fake grassroots campaigns and was now “more diverse and seemingly ubiquitous.” He said conservative think tanks had influenced the public’s understanding of climate change and the way policymakers had reacted to it, in two ways.  First, he said in recent decades US Republicans had used thinktank materials in committee meetings and hearings “to justify inaction on climate change”. Second, thinktank materials had been taken up as the standard talking points for conservatives. “Indeed, I would argue that anti-environmentalism - and climate change denial more specifically - has become a central tenet of the current conservative and Republican identity.” Dr Riley Dunlap, of the Oklahoma State University, and who has partnered with McCright on several influential studies, told me: While conservative thinktanks were involved in denial from the outset - 1989 at least - we have argued they really moved to the forefront in the late 90s when BP and then other companies pulled out of the industry-led Global Climate Coalition that had arguably been the most powerful force in denial. In fact, the conservative thinktanks were upset that oil companies were ‘caving in’ to the IPCC, and decided to take the lead. This also really shifted the basis of denial from economic self-interest to ideological opposition – the commitment to neoliberalism’s distaste for all government regulations. McCright added that “knowing what is going on is one thing” but knowing what to do about it was more challenging. I’ll leave you with his thoughts. Opposing policy is one thing. Undermining, denying, obfuscating, etc. science is another. I wish I had a powerful, simple solution to counter the climate change denial movement, but I don’t. Nevertheless, at the very least, we can continue to drag them from the shadows and into the bright light of day, vigilantly document their activities, and regularly call them out over what they are doing.

"Overturned fishing skiffs lie abandoned on the shores of what was Bolivia’s second-largest lake. Beetles dine on bird carcasses and gulls fight for scraps under a glaring sun in what marshes remain. Lake Poopó was officially declared evaporated in December. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people have lost their livelihoods and gone. High on Bolivia’s semi-arid Andean plains at 3,700 metres (more than 12,000 feet) and long subject to climatic whims, the shallow saline lake has essentially dried up before only to rebound to twice the area of Los Angeles. But recovery may no longer be possible, scientists say. “This is a picture of the future of climate change,” says Dirk Hoffman, a German glaciologist who studies how rising temperatures from the burning of fossil fuels has accelerated glacial melting in Bolivia. As Andean glaciers disappear, so do the sources of Poopó’s water. But other factors are in play in the demise of Bolivia’s second-largest body of water behind Lake Titicaca. Drought caused by the recurrent El Niño meteorological phenomenon is considered the main driver. Authorities say another factor is the diversion of water from Poopó’s tributaries, mostly for mining but also for agriculture. More than 100 families have sold their sheep, llamas and alpaca, set aside their fishing nets and quit the former lakeside village of Untavi over the past three years, draining it of well over half its population. Only the elderly remain. “There’s no future here,” says 29-year-old Juvenal Gutierrez, who moved to a nearby town where he has taken a job as a motorcycle taxi driver. Record-keeping on the lake’s history goes back only a century, and there is no good tally of the people displaced by its disappearance. At least 3,250 people have received humanitarian aid, the governor’s office says. Poopó is now down to 2% of its former water level, regional governor Victor Hugo Vasquez calculates. Its maximum depth once reached five metres (16ft). Field biologists say 75 species of birds are gone from the lake. While Poopó has suffered El Niño-fuelled droughts for millennia, its fragile ecosystem has experienced unprecedented stress in the past three decades. Temperatures have risen by about 1 degree Celsius while mining activity has pinched the flow of tributaries, increasing sediment. Florida Institute of Technology biologist Mark B. Bush says the long-term trend of warming and drying threatens the entire Andean highlands. A 2010 study he co-wrote for the journal Global Change Biology said Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, could face catastrophic drought this century. It predicted “inhospitable arid climates” would lessen available food and water this century for the more than 3 million inhabitants of Bolivia’s highlands. A study by the German consortium Gitec-Cobodes determined that Poopó received 161bn fewer litres of water in 2013 than required to maintain equilibrium. “Irreversible changes in ecosystems could occur, causing massive emigration and greater conflicts,” said the study commissioned by Bolivia’s government. The head of a local citizens’ group that tried to save Poopó, Angel Flores, says authorities ignored warnings. “Something could have been done to prevent the disaster. Mining companies have been diverting water since 1982,” he says. President Evo Morales has sought to deflect criticism he bears some responsibility, suggesting Poopó could come back. “My father told me about crossing the lake on a bicycle once when it dried up,” he said in December after returning from the UN-sponsored climate conference in Paris. Environmentalists and local activists say the government mismanaged fragile water resources and ignored rampant pollution from mining, Bolivia’s second export earner after natural gas. More than 100 mines are upstream and Huanuni, Bolivia’s biggest state-owned tin mine, was among those dumping untreated tailings into Poopó’s tributaries. After thousands of fish died in late 2014, the Universidad Tecnica in the nearby state capital of Oruro found Poopó had unsafe levels of heavy metals, including cadmium and lead. The president of Bolivia’s National Chamber of Mining, Saturnino Ramos, said any blame by the industry was “insignificant compared to climate change.” He said most of the sediment shallowing Poopo’s tributaries was natural, not from mining. In hopes of bringing it back, Morales’ government has asked the European Union for $140m for water treatment plants for the Poopó watershed and to dredge tributaries led by the Desaguadero, which flows from Lake Titicaca. But critics say it may be too late. “I don’t think we’ll be seeing the azure mirror of Poopó again,” said Milton Perez, a Universidad Tecnica researcher. “I think we’ve lost it.”"

"The agreement signed at the United Nations climate summit in Paris has been hailed as historic, ground-breaking, and unprecedented.  At the same time, the targets are so ambitious that many climate analysts are rolling their eyes. The agreement aims to limit warming to “well below” 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and recognizes that avoiding 1.5°C of warming “would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.”   The emissions reduction commitments made by the participating countries are not close to sufficient to achieve these targets. Carbon budget analyses show it will be next to impossible to avoid the 1.5°C limit without “negative emissions” – sucking carbon dioxide out of the air, using technologies that are unproven or not yet in existence.  It is therefore understandable that Oliver Geden of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs would argue in his article, “Paris climate deal: the trouble with targetism,” that the temperature targets in the agreement are the height of hypocrisy.  Yet Mr. Gedden and other critics of the Paris Agreement are missing the point of the climate negotiations. The issue facing international negotiators is not the statistical odds of staying within stated temperature limits. The issue is what happens if we do not.  After all, this is a global climate agreement. And to many countries, passing those temperature limits could be a disaster. The temperature targets were included in the agreement out of respect for developing countries and small island states like the Republic of Kiribati, where I have conducted climate research over the past decade. In particular, the lower 1.5°C target is a signal to these countries that the world recognizes the existential threat that comes with more warming.  There is no scientifically definable “safe” amount of climate change. Science can provide us with a guide to the impacts of different levels of warming. The amount of warming we deem as “safe,” however, depends on our values and our perception of risk. The 2°C target was informed by science, but it was chosen by developed countries – the same countries that are historically most responsible for climate change.  If you live in a small island nation in the tropics, more than 1.5°C of global warming certainly seems dangerous. With more than 1 meter of sea-level rise, around 90% of countries like Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and Kiribati could become so prone to flooding as to be uninhabitable. While there’s large uncertainty about the rate of future sea-level rise, evidence from the distant past suggests that every 1°C of warming will eventually cause 2.3 meters of sea-level rise. There’s even greater concern among larger countries like Fiji about coral reefs, a key source of food, income, and coastal protection in tropical countries. The world’s coral reefs are already in trouble due to warming and acidifying ocean waters. Research led by my colleague Dr. Katja Frieler shows that if warming can be kept to less than 1.5°C, two-thirds of the world’s coral reefs could be spared from serious degradation this century. With 2°C or more of warming, reefs covered with living corals could become an artifact of history. The critics are correct in arguing that the world is unlikely to avoid 1.5°C of warming, or even 2°C of warming. Yet to dismiss the targets entirely is to dismiss the needs of countries that are full members of the international climate negotiations. By agreeing on the temperature limits, we are officially recognizing the scientific evidence that harm will come with more warming. This helps ensure that countries like Kiribati which are most at risk will receive the needed international assistance, a key tenet of international climate policy since the creation of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992. Though they have not received much attention in the international media, the adaptation, capacity-building, and finance sections are as central to the Paris climate agreement as the sections on emissions and temperature targets. In addition, enshrining temperature limits in the agreement is important in case it does become feasible to affordably extract carbon dioxide out of the air. Without the temperature limits, those with access to the technology may not be compelled to deploy that technology at sufficient scale to avoid harm to the developing world.  The Paris climate agreement is not perfect. But like democracy, it may be better than all of the alternatives. Recognition of a 1.5°C limit as a “safer defense line” makes the agreement truly global, rather than something dictated by the developed world. Simon Donner is an Associate Professor of Climatology at the University of British Columbia. For the past decade, he has researched climate change impacts and the adaptation challenges facing the Pacific island countries."
"El Niño is one of the most predictable climate events on the planet, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but it also has a way of keeping climate scientists guessing. In March the oceanographers predicted the current event could be the weakest on record, but in August the same agency warned it could be the strongest.  Right now it still looks strong, says Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. Using satellite data, meteorologists keep a steady watch on El Niño because it can play out demurely, or it can bring catastrophe. It has been linked to drought and harvest failures on the African continent, devastating fires in the normally moist rainforests of the Indonesian archipelago, both drought and flood in Australia, damaging floods in the Americas, and unusually mild winters in Europe.  This month, tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes in the border areas of Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina due to severe flooding in the wake of heavy summer rains brought on by El Niño. Paraguay’s national emergencies office has said the flooding is “directly influenced by the El Niño phenomenon, which has intensified the frequency and intensity of rains”. El Niño is a blister of sea surface heat that every few years floats eastwards across the tropical Pacific Ocean. It was given its name by the fishermen of Peru, who called it “the Child” because they became aware of it around the Christmas season, as the fish catches failed. The shift of warm seas leaves the western Pacific cooler, and both temperature shifts seem to play out in disruption of global weather patterns. The last great El Niño, in 1997-98, helped make 1998 the then warmest year on record – that too was accompanied by a series of devastating events around the world, among them ice storms in North America, floods on the west coasts of the Americas and forest fires in Borneo. It also delayed the monsoon rains in India, warmed tropical waters so severely that coral reefs started to “bleach” and die, and signalled a record-breaking season of typhoons and tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific. Although researchers are fairly sure that climate change as a consequence of the combustion of fossil fuels, and the release of greenhouse gases, could make El Niño more frequent, or more devastating, or both, it remains a natural, cyclic event. Climate historians have linked it, with sometimes faltering levels of confidence, to historic events, among them the epidemic of Spanish influenza that claimed millions of lives in 1918 and even the Biblical plagues of Egypt linked to the story of Moses. Sometimes oceanographers watch an El Niño develop, and then fade gently. And sometimes it develops powerfully, with consequences for the rest of the globe. Oxfam has already warned that this time millions could face famine as a consequence. However, as the rains fail in Africa, Californians – still in the grip of a prolonged and damaging drought – may see a silver lining. In 1997 and1998 storms slammed into the US west coast, crossed the mountains, drenched Texas and even hit Florida. This time, El Niño may be seen as bringing relief. “The water story for much of the American west over most of the past decade has been dominated by punishing drought,” said JPL climatologist Bill Patzert. “Reservoir levels have fallen to record or near-record lows, while groundwater tables have dropped dangerously in many areas. Now we’re preparing to see the flip side of nature’s water cycle – the arrival of steady, heavy rains and snowfall.” What a heat bubble on the eastern Pacific – where the much warmer water means that a great stretch of ocean is actually up to 25cm higher than the cooler waters north and south of it – means for the UK is much less certain. “There are a number of factors that affect winter conditions in Britain,” the Met Office said earlier this year. “The increase in risk of a colder winter this year from the developing El Niño is currently considered small.”"
"Taking too many diesel cars off the road because they have been blamed for Europe’s air pollution problems would risk the industry missing its climate change targets, the boss of Volkswagen UK has warned.  Last year it emerged that Volkswagen had cheated on tests for emissions of nitrogen oxides (chemical name NOx), the name for the toxic gases nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (chemical name NO2), both of which are found in diesel fumes. Paul Willis, managing director of VW UK, told MPs on Wednesday that tackling NO2 emissions could come at the expense of cutting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from cars – the greenhouse gas seen as a major contributor to climate change. NO2 is responsible for nearly 6,000 annual premature deaths in London, parts of which breached annual limits last week. “I would say that unless we have a significant diesel mix in Europe, within our fleet, we will miss that target, not VW, the industry will miss that [CO2] target,” said Willis, referring to the EU target of an average new car emitting 95g CO2 per kilometre by 2021, compared to an average of 123.4g CO2 per km in 2014. Transport is responsible for around a quarter of European Union greenhouse gas emissions, so moves to cut them are seen as vital to climate change efforts. During an often heated exchange with environment, food and rural affairs committee MPs, Willis defended VW’s environmental record but conceded the company had to win back consumer trust after the revelations last year that 12m of its cars were equipped with “defeat devices” to cheat NOx emissions tests. “For almost everyone in our company to learn what we learned in September [when the scandal emerged] was very difficult for us to swallow and very difficult for us to understand. I think you heard the apologies I made at that time and I’m still really sorry for that.” He said the company would redouble efforts to win back trust. But owners of the 1.2m VW cars in the UK affected by the diesel emissions testing scandal should not receive any compensation because they have not suffered any loss, he argued. “To pay compensation, there has to be a loss. At this stage I see no reason for there to be a loss. The adjustment of the software, our engineers are telling us, there will be no difference in in fuel consumption as a result of this fix.  “The other area is on the question of residual values, I have seen no clear evidence there has been any adverse impact on residual values.” A survey last year found that nine out of 10 VW drivers in Britain affected by the scandal believed they should receive compensation, in addition to the software fix that VW is rolling out to customers. Asked whether consumers would begin to factor health into their purchasing decisions, Willis said that pollution emissions were not a priority for most car-buyers. “I’m sorry to tell you but look at the data and look at what customers’ priorities are when they’re buying vehicles, they don’t talk about NOx,” he said. He said the scandal had had some effect on its sales in November and December but noted that retail orders in December 2015 were actually higher than orders in December 2014. “I think people know there was an error in the testing regime, and they understand in the real world there was no difference at all,” he said. Asked how much more NO2 had been emitted as a result of his company cheating on the tests, Willis repeated previous assertions that it was impossible to say because there is no agreed standard for “real world” emissions. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, sitting next to Willis, said the technology for testing real world emissions had only been available for two to three years. Separately on Wednesday, VW’s chief executive Matthias Müller is meeting regulators in Washington to attempt to reach agreement with US authorities on a solution for the affected cars. On Sunday he appeared to downplay the idea the company had cheated tests, telling NPR it was simply a “technical problem” not an “ethical problem”."

"A catastrophe caused by climate change is seen as the biggest potential threat to the global economy in 2016, according to a survey of 750 experts conducted by the World Economic Forum. The annual assessment of risks conducted by the WEF before its annual meeting in Davos on 20-23 January showed that global warming had catapulted its way to the top of the list of concerns.  A failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation was seen as likely to have a bigger impact than the spread of weapons of mass destruction, water crises, mass involuntary migration and a severe energy price shock – the first time in the 11 years of the Global Risks report that the environment has been in first place.  The report, prepared by the WEF in collaboration with risk specialists Marsh & McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group, comes a month after the deal signed in Paris to reduce carbon emissions. The WEF said evidence was mounting that inter-connections between risks were becoming stronger. It cited links between climate change and involuntary migration or international security, noting that these often had “major and unpredictable impacts”. Espen Barth Eide, the WEF’s head of geopolitical affairs, said there was a risk of Europe fragmenting as a result of “people on the move”. Speaking at a press conference in London to launch the report, Eide said: “I am concerned about the continued support in national politics for keeping Europe together.” Eide added that if enough countries decided to pursue a non-integrated approach to coping with migration it would have “profound effects on Europe’s politics and its economy”, and would have a knock-on impact on the rest of the world. “If things unravel at the core, what does it mean in other parts of the world?” Cecilia Reyes, Zurich’s chief risk officer, said: “Climate change is exacerbating more risks than ever before in terms of water crises, food shortages, constrained economic growth, weaker societal cohesion and increased security risks.  “Meanwhile, geopolitical instability is exposing businesses to cancelled projects, revoked licences, interrupted production, damaged assets and restricted movement of funds across borders. These political conflicts are in turn making the challenge of climate change all the more insurmountable – reducing the potential for political cooperation, as well as diverting resource, innovation and time away from climate change resilience and prevention.”  The WEF said the broad range of risks – from environmental to geopolitical and economic – was unprecedented.  It added that risks appeared to be rising, with global average surface temperatures increasing by more than 1C over pre-industrial levels for the first time, and the number of forcibly displaced people at 59.5 million – almost 50% more than in 1940, when the second world war was being fought. “Data from the report appears to support the increased likelihood of risks across the board, with all 24 of the risks continuously measured since 2014 having increased their likelihood scores in the past three years,” the WEF said. When asked which risk was most likely to materialise in 2016, respondents chose large-scale involuntary migration. This follows last year’s refugee crisis, in which hundreds of thousands of people arrived in Europe fleeing conflicts in the Middle East and north Africa. This was followed by extreme weather events, climate change, interstate conflict with regional consequences, and major natural catastrophes. “Events such as Europe’s refugee crisis and terrorist attacks have raised global political instability to its highest level since the cold war,” said John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk and Specialties.  “This is widening the backdrop of uncertainty against which international firms will increasingly be forced to make their strategic decisions. The need for business leaders to consider the implications of these risks on their firm’s footprint, reputation and supply chain has never been more pressing.” Drzik said at the press conference: “Most risks are rising. It’s a riskier world right now.”"
"There was already dramatic evidence that our planet is undeniably warming before 30 December 2015, when the world heard that the ice at the North Pole was melting. (The temperature on 30 December 2015 was, by some reports, 33ºF [0.7ºC], 50ºF above average).  And yet one immediate, effective way to fight climate change and save polar ice caps is half a world away, in the tropics. Tropical forest conservation and restoration could constitute half of the global warming solution, according to a recent peer reviewed commentary in Nature Climate Change.   Reducing carbon emissions, as the nations of the world promised to do in Paris last month, is essential, but simultaneously pulling carbon out of the atmosphere (which is what rainforests do) would immediately and significantly reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) at a surprisingly low cost, providing a crucial bridge to a post-fossil fuel era.  The potential of rainforest conservation to address global warming should be enough to galvanize massive worldwide rainforest conservation efforts. The natural regrowth and subsequent protection of hundreds of millions of acres of degraded rainforest would result in massive absorption of carbon as the trees grow. While it is crucial that we transition away from the use of fossil fuels, the reality is that rainforest protection can happen much more quickly. But that is only part of the story. Rainforest conservation is also incredibly economical. One acre of Amazon rainforest in Peru, which stores up to 180 metric tonnes of CO2, can be protected for just a few dollars; the same is true elsewhere in Latin America and Africa. The implications here are astounding and should give us pause: for the cost of a meal – or even a coffee – each of us could save an area of forest about the size of four football pitches and safely store about 725 metric tonnes of CO2. To put this in perspective, the annual emissions of a typical passenger vehicle in the United States is less than 4.5 metric tonnes of CO2.  Carbon storage, however, is only one benefit of rainforest conservation. Not only do rainforests protect animals such as elephants, tigers and orangutans, they provide a refuge for hundreds and thousands of other lesser-known species. Among other benefits, the medicinal properties of undiscovered and unstudied plants may hold the key to successfully treating cancer and other deadly diseases.  And rainforests provide the world with a disproportionately high percentage of its oxygen and fresh water – the Amazon River alone contains 20% of the world’s freshwater– and act as natural engines that keep the planet’s tropical ecosystems running smoothly.  Although wholesale clear-cutting and selective logging have destroyed massive areas of rainforest, vast areas remain intact. And degraded rainforest, if allowed to regenerate, is amazingly resilient. In 10 years, seedlings can grow into 50-foot [15-meter] trees. Diverse wildlife can return and rebound within two to three years.  Both the remaining pristine rainforest and degraded forest require the world’s attention: a vigorous, concerted effort is needed if we are going to react appropriately to the staggering demands being placed on our planet’s rainforest.  Deforestation in the name of economic development has occurred routinely over many decades without regard to its devastating consequences. It is completely unsustainable for governments to continue to provide concessions, subsidies and tax breaks to business when logging, oil extraction, mining for minerals, fires, palm oil plantations, large scale commercial agriculture, cattle ranching and road construction continue to diminish the earth’s finite, invaluable rainforests.  The case for rainforest preservation – already overwhelmingly strong – can no longer be cast as a niche effort of conservationists and scientists; it needs to be everyone’s concern. For those wishing to tackle our planet’s greatest environmental challenge, there is no better place to begin than saving our tropical rainforests. "
"It’s not every poet who manages to work a demanding day job as a Met Office climate scientist. But when Rachel McCarthy isn’t walking the corridors of Whitehall, on secondment to the Department of Energy and Climate Change, she is to be found polishing her poems. Despite achieving a double first in physics and chemistry, McCarthy always wanted to write. As the founder of Excite Poetry, the Devon wing of the Poetry Society, and the director of the sell-out Exeter poetry festival, her verse-writing skills are matched only by her ability to draw crowds to big events.   Strolling through Exeter’s arty West Quarter, blinded by a low winter sun, McCarthy ducks into her favourite junk shop, Otto Retro. “I used to run this open-mic night here,” she says, eyeing up the curiosities that include an Austrian zoological chart and some Czech apothecary jars. “It was such a warm environment. We’d have poetry readings – and people could shop during the break.” In 2015, the British poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy named McCarthy one of the country’s most exciting new voices, describing her work as bold and mesmerising. Last year also saw the publication of Element, under the Laureate’s Choice imprint, curated by Duffy. Each of the 19 poems in the volume was inspired by elements from the periodic table, which McCarthy is adamant shouldn’t be dismissed as “a thing stuck on the wall in your GCSE class that you had to memorise”. Everything is made of elements, she says. “You and I. This table. It’s an alphabet of our existence.”  The collection spans history and tackles subjects from bees (chromium) and butterflies (iridium) to love (yttrium), disaster (osmium) and art history (zinc), via unsung aircraft fitters such as her own father (titanium). Short notes at the end of the booklet explain the significance of each poem’s element. Copper in octopus blood, for example, carries oxygen more efficiently than iron in haemoglobin, helping the octopus survive deep under water. The poet Alice Oswald says of McCarthy’s writing: “strong interesting poems, full of tension and symmetry. They are alive.”  As you might expect of a scientist, McCarthy did a great deal of research, not only reading “hardcore” chemistry books, but also biographies of Dmitri Mendeleev, who first published the periodic table in 1869, and histories of Russia from the same period. “I became fascinated,not with melting points and boiling points, but with the lives behind the elements. Why they were named as they were – after brothers, wives, stuff in the night sky – and what did they do?” There have even been fraudulent discoveries of fabricated elements. This week, McCarthy will share this knowledge in Alphabet of Our Universe, part social history lecture, part poetry reading, at Oxford University’s Museum of the History of Science. She says her dual career is often met with surprise, but the two jobs have much in common. “They’re both searching for insight into laws and ideas through particulars. They’re focused on the minutiae.”  In poetry, those particulars are “words, emotions, ideas and metaphors”, but the best poetry is universal, McCarthy says. “Artistic expression is a search for a truth that looks different on the outside. It’s more concerned with human emotions or experience, but they’re still searching.” Unlike poetry, however, science should be morally neutral, since “that sort of protects science from us as human beings”. At school in Leyland, near Preston in Lancashire, McCarthy took six A-levels, including all the sciences, maths and English literature. “I had a fantastic English teacher and there was a point when I wondered, ‘Which road do I go down?’ Because that’s the choice you’re presented with now. We’ve lost the renaissance person.” In the end, she decided she could write in her own time, whereas moonlighting as a scientist was less realistic.  McCarthy feels strongly that art, when tackling scientific subjects, should respect the facts. “If you are influencing the public about a scientific issue, there has to be some responsibility taken by the artist.” Equally, science has a responsibility to artists to properly communicate its findings. Scientific knowledge, McCarthy insists, needn’t dampen one’s wonder at the universe. If anything, it enhances it. As an example, she riffs on a quote by the American scientist Richard P Feynman printed in the opening pages of Element: “Jupiter, as a mythological figure, to my mind is equally as important as Jupiter the planet. We must engage with both of them.” • Alphabet of Our Universe is at the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford, on 12 January. Element is published by Smith Doorstop, £7.50.  "
"Climate scientists are regularly infuriated by the things politicians say. But it’s not often they publish a scientific paper tearing a politician’s comments to shreds.   Sophie Lewis, from the Australian Research Council’s centre for excellence in climate science, has done exactly that, dissecting statements about climate records made by the former prime minister Tony Abbott in 2013. Last week, temperature figures showed 2015 was officially the hottest year on record. Before that, 2014 was the hottest year on record. And scientists are expecting 2016 to once again win the dubious honour. Heat records are being broken with wild abandon. Last year, 10 months broke temperature records. Climate scientists say a rise in the average temperature caused by greenhouse gas emissions makes extreme heat records more likely. In 2013, the UN’s top climate official, Christiana Figueres, linked bushfires in Australia to climate change. Abbott called such claims “complete hogwash” and said drawing links between broken records and climate change was a sign of desperation. He went on: “The thing is that at some point in the future, every record will be broken, but that doesn’t prove anything about climate change. It just proves that the longer the period of time, the more possibility of extreme events.” Superficially it seems to make sense: if you wait long enough, you’re bound to see records fall. Lewis suspected many people shared Abbott’s interpretation, and set out to show it was wrong. Lewis says she was frustrated by the gap she saw between what the science showed and what some politicians said was happening. In a peer-reviewed paper published in the journal Weather and Climate Extremes, Lewis pulls Abbot’s comments apart, shred by shred.  The first way to understand Abbott’s claim is that in any system, the longer you wait, the more often you will see records fall. But Lewis points out that the exact opposite is true. In a system without any sort of trend, such as a random string of temperatures, the first one will be a record-breaker, by default. The second one will have a 50% chance of being a record-breaker. The third has a one in three chance of being a record breaker … and so on. In a very long temperature series, you should see very few records being broken, and they will break less often over time. Unless, of course, there is a warming or cooling trend. Alternatively, Abbott might simply have meant there was no connection between extreme heat records and climate change. Instead, natural variability might be to blame: natural variability includes things such as the El Niño phenomenon, which push temperature around year-to-year. To test if that might be the case, Lewis ran a series of climate models in which the greenhouse effect was removed – so all that was left was natural variability. Unsurprisingly, in those models, high temperature records were less common than they are in reality. In other words, the record-breaking that we have seen cannot be explained by natural variation. “It drives me mental that these sorts of statements go unaddressed,” Lewis says. She says scientific literature generally tries to simply explain what is happening, ignoring misunderstandings in the public sphere.  “This was an attempt to bridge that gap.”"

"Traditionally the Sahel – a semi-arid strip of land, south of the Sahara Desert – is one of Africa’s most productive crop regions. But during the 1980s this region, which stretches from the Atlantic to the Red Sea, became better known for drought and famine. Thankfully the region has become wetter again, and now new research indicates that the return of the rains is most likely a beneficial side-effect of global warming. Rainfall statistics show that between the 1950s and 1980s summer rainfall fell by around 40% across the Sahel, bringing the region to its knees. At the time scientists speculated that the drought was linked to poor land management, and a rapidly growing population. But newer data indicates that it may have been sulphate aerosols, produced by fossil fuel burning in Europe and North America, which slowed evaporation from the North Atlantic and cut off the Sahel’s moisture source. Since then we’ve cleaned up our skies, but in the meantime sea surface temperatures have risen and greenhouse gas concentrations have climbed. By modelling these changes, and studying the impact of each change individually, Buwen Dong and Rowan Sutton, from the University of Reading, have found strong evidence that the rise in greenhouse gases was the dominant driver of the recovery of Sahel rainfall. But wWhether these increases will continue into the future isn’t clear, and the scientists also caution that increased rainfall isn’t always beneficial. “If more of the rain falls in short intense events then it may cause flooding and could run-off very quickly rather than penetrate the soil,” says Sutton."
"While El Niño is being blamed for an outbreak of floods, storms and unseasonable temperatures across the planet, a much slower-moving cycle of the Pacific Ocean has also been playing a role in record-breaking warmth. The recent effects of both ocean cycles are being amplified by climate change. A 2014 flip was detected in the sluggish and elusive ocean cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, or PDO, which also goes by other names, including the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. Despite uncertainty about the fundamental nature of the PDO, leading scientists link its 2014 phase change to a rapid rise in global surface temperatures.  The effects of the PDO on global warming can be likened to a staircase, with warming leveling off for periods, typically of more than a decade, and then bursting upward. “It seems to me quite likely that we have taken the next step up to a new level,” said Kevin Trenberth, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The 2014 flip from the cool PDO phase to the warm phase, which vaguely resembles a long and drawn out El Niño event, contributed to record-breaking surface temperatures across the planet in 2014. The record warmth set in 2014 was surpassed again in 2015, when global temperatures surged to 1°C (1.8°F) above pre-industrial averages, worsening flooding, heatwaves and storms. Trenberth is among an informal squadron of scientists that in recent years has toiled to understand the slowdown in surface warming rates that began in the late 1990s, which some nicknamed a global warming “pause” or “hiatus.” A flurry of recent research papers has indicated that the slowdown was less pronounced than previously thought, leading some scientists to renew claims that those nicknames are inaccurate and should be abandoned. “The slowdown was not statistically significant, I suppose, if you properly take into account natural variability, which includes the PDO,” Trenberth said. “That’s sort of the argument that people have been making; that even if it was a little bit of a slowdown, or pause, or call it what you will, it’s not out of bounds, and as a result we shouldn’t really put a label on it.” The approximately 15-year warming slowdown was linked to the negative phase of the PDO, which is also called its cool phase. That phase whips up strong trade winds that bury more heat beneath sea surfaces, contributing to extraordinary levels of warming recorded in the oceans. A similar phase led to a slight cooling of the planet from the 1940s to the 1970s. “Last time we went from a negative to a positive was in the mid-‘70s,” said Gerald Meehl, a National Center for Atmospheric Research scientist. “Then we had larger rates of global warming from the ‘70s to the late ‘90s, compared to the previous 30 years.” “It’s not just an upward sloping line,” Meehl said. “Sometimes it’s steeper, sometimes it’s slower.” The effects of the warm phase of the PDO and the current El Niño may be cumulative in terms of warming the planet. It also seems likely that changes in the ocean cycles are linked, with changes between El Niño and La Niña driving changes in the PDO cycle. Or, perhaps the PDO doesn’t exist at all, other than as a tidy pile of data points, and it’s simply a manifestation of changes in the shorter-running cycle between El Niño and La Niña. “There’s some debate about whether there is a low frequency oscillation — is there a distinct interdecadal oscillation?” said Penn State meteorology professor Michael Mann. “Or is what we call a low frequency oscillation just a change over time in the frequency and magnitude of individual El Niño and La Niña events?” Regardless, “it seems pretty clear that we’ve transitioned from a time period where there was a prevalence for La Niña conditions,” Mann said. “Over the past several years we’ve been in the multi-year El Niño state, and it has culminated with an extremely large El Niño event.” The future of PDO phases will not slow down or speed up the overall long-term rate of global warming. That will continue to rise with pollution levels. But scientists are expecting more intense heat during the months ahead, which should bring with it more wild weather. “There are a lot of things in place that have locked us on course to have a really warm start to 2016,” said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist Nate Mantua. “I have a hard time seeing how we’re not going to be looking at either record level or near-record level global mean surface temperatures for at least the first half of 2016.”"
"In December, the US Buzzfeed editor, Ben Smith, sent a memo to staff about the appropriate way to refer to Donald Trump in stories or on social media. He said that because Trump was operating so “far outside” the political campaigns to which the company’s guidelines usually applied, and because he was saying things so obviously false, or overtly anti-Muslim, it was quite factual for reporters to call him, for example, a “mendacious racist” even though they wouldn’t normally use those kinds of terms about a candidate.  Using the same logic, it seems quite reasonable to say Clive Palmer – our own allegedly mega-rich and megalomaniac anti-politician – has taken the entire political system for a ride. The latest example of how we are all being played for fools is the fact that his Palmer United Party sucked $21m in political donations from his 100% owned Queensland Yabulu nickel refinery before going into administration. The federal government has offered $500,000 to help 237 workers have been sacked but if the company cannot trade out of its problems and goes into liquidation then the rest of the workforce would almost certainly be able to access the federal government’s fair entitlements guarantee program and cost the government millions more. Oh, and he didn’t have to provide a bond for rehabilitating the polluted tailing dams and that could cost the Queensland government many more millions. This equation really doesn’t work out so well for us taxpayers. Which shouldn’t be surprisingly really since the whole Palmer juggernaut has always been about Clive. He effectively bought the balance of power in the Senate, spending $28.9m on the 2013 election and the Western Australian Senate rerun, most of which went on saturation advertising which in some cases promised things he would never have had the power to deliver, like getting WA voters more revenue from the GST. And despite poor polling though the campaign, those ads, in the final weeks, made the difference. He won his lower house seat and three spots in the Senate.  As well as promising things he couldn’t do, he didn’t do some of the few things he had coherently promised. His election platform, for example, said he opposed offshore processing of asylum seekers. But he (and the two senators he had at a time) provided the deciding votes to pass a bill that dramatically increased the powers of the government to implement its offshore processing policy while avoiding the reach of the UN convention on refugees. He was the anti-politician who would protect the “little guy”. Which is hard to reconcile with his party’s support for things like axing the government contribution of $500 a year to the superannuation accounts of the lowest income earners, from 2017. And his position and rationale on other things changed according to political convenience.  His senators provided the necessary votes for the abolition of the carbon and mining taxes, an obvious conflict of interest for a would-be miner and owner of a high-emitting nickel refinery that for a long time had an outstanding $8m carbon tax debt. He also provided the votes to pass the Coalition’s alternative Direct Action scheme, which as it stands is demonstrably inadequate to meet Australia’s greenhouse gas reduction promises while imposing no restrictions or costs on polluting industries, like, say, his Yabulu nickel refinery. At the time, he also claimed he was some kind of born-again climate crusader – memorably appearing beside Al Gore – by “forcing” the government to ask the Climate Change Authority (a body it wanted to abolish) to prepare a report on alternative emissions reductions schemes, which it will deliver this year. To be fair, he did make tangible contributions, from an environmental point of view, by refusing to abolish the CCA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which did at least preserve some institutional common sense. But for the most part, in those days before his Senate voting bloc fell apart and all but one of the senators he had bankrolled went their own way, he engaged in last minute, high drama, chaotic negotiations, which maximised his publicity but mostly delivered “concessions” that were bad public policy or contradictory to the message he had given voters. I called it the Palmer pattern. And as for representing the voters of his Queensland seat of Fairfax, for his own part in the lower house he hardly voted at all. He cast a vote in just 6.8% of divisions according to the OpenAustralia Foundation. His whole tactic was to play the media, and the system, in a similar but slightly less spectacular way to Trump – luring journalists with all manner of publicity seeking stunts and then attacking them as part of the biased Canberra elite when they tried to hold him to account or point out the many things about his campaign that made no sense. And then, holding the Senate votes that could make or break legislation, the government and the opposition were also forced to pay due deference to the will of the electorate, as expressed through Palmer’s semi-coherent positions. And – as well as many reports of his publicity seeking antics – there were also many attempts to hold him to account. Hedley Thomas in the Australian, in particular wrote numerous articles about his business interests and other questionable claims. Many journalists, myself included, called out his conflicts of interest, his inconsistent behaviour and his confused policy pronouncements, after he entered politics. And while he never quite stooped to Trump’s treatment of the media, Palmer used the same tactics of attacking critics in order to ignore them. In the case of the Australian, he alleged a campaign motivated by things he had said about Rupert Murdoch’s former wife Wendy Deng. In the case of other interviewers he famously stormed out when the questioning got too hard, including from a 7.30 interview with Sarah Ferguson and another with Lateline’s Emma Alberici. In my own case he became belligerent and declared that I was a “naive girl” when I pressed him on a policy. Palmer is by no means Australia’s first populist politician. And he didn’t go nearly as far as Trump in mocking the idea of accountability and truthfulness and threatening and abusing critics, which is forcing media and politicians in the US into the kind of assessments in the Buzzfeed memo. US academic Jay Rosen, in this thought provoking blog on the topic, argues part of the answer is for political journalism to reconsider its sense of purpose and focus, which could reduce the coverage of the entertainingly outrageous that kickstarts the populist politician. David Roberts in Vox argues that Trump is causing such consternation because he has broken the “accepted rules of lying” which have for a while condoned, or reported as a he said/she said story the really big policy lies, while calling out smaller, personal or trivial untruths. That would fit with the Australian experience of the Coalition’s anti-carbon tax campaign or its reasoning that its 2014 budget broke no election promises – both arguments replete with obvious falsehoods.  Australia now has a prime minister who says he wants to respect the electorate’s intelligence and Palmer’s influence is on the wane, so maybe our election year won’t be like the US primary season. But if we don’t give some thought to the consequences of allowing political discourse to drift away even from the expectation that it is grounded in fact, and the reasons that might be happening, we really are mugs."

"When Jeremy Corbyn won the leadership of the Labour party in September he celebrated in a pub up the road from the Houses of Parliament with a thank you to supporters and a rousing rendition of the Red Flag. On the edge of the impromptu stage that day, beside Len McCluskey of Unite and John McDonnell the future shadow chancellor, was a singular figure singing with particular pride: Piers Corbyn, the new leader’s elder brother, who has, you could say, led a parallel career of stubborn principle to his younger sibling. I was in the euphoric crowd that day, and since then I’ve wondered a bit about the relationship between the brothers, what they have learned from each other. With some of this in mind I called Piers recently and asked if he might like to talk about some of that. He agreed, but typically on the basis that he would happily talk about any subject under the sun – apart from his relationship with Jeremy and the vexed question of how his leadership is going. He shares much of his brother’s mistrust of the press; recently, he suggests, the Independent published an account of an exchange that had taken place over a family Christmas dinner. That wasn’t on. What he will talk about, though, is the thing he has talked about for just about as long as he can remember: the weather. On this very British basis we met last week in a cafe over the road from his office on Borough High Street in south London. You don’t have to speak to Piers for very long to realise that at least a couple of Corbyn family traits are indelible: the first is that intransigent rasp of a voice with faint traces of west country burr; the second is the sense that life, like politics, is best played as a long game.  Piers Corbyn has a faith, even at 68, that if he states his beliefs often enough – though it might seem no one is listening – his day will surely come. He takes comfort in this not only from the recent elevation of his brother, but also from the example of Galileo, and of John Harrison and his measurement of longitude. “It is unfortunately not the case that the truth always prevails in the short term,” he tells me, with some conspiratorial conviction, “there are often vested interests to prevent it.” The particular “truth” that Corbyn has in mind is perhaps the least fashionable proposal currently available in enlightened debate: it is the belief that changes in the Earth’s climate and its weather are dictated primarily by cyclical activity on the surface of the sun (and not, pointedly, by the effects of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere). It is a cause even more thankless than the return of 1980s socialism to British parliamentary politics seemed (until very recently). Corbyns have little fear of pariah status, though. What of the “settled opinion” of climate scientists and governments around the world, sealed in the recent Paris accord? “For one thing science doesn’t do settled opinions,” Corbyn says. “And for another they are all wrong.” This contrarian spirit began in Piers Corbyn at the age of five when his father, an electrical engineer, encouraged him to investigate the efficacy of a Victorian dew pond (he found it to be limited); it continued with his construction of all manner of meteorological equipment in the family garden in Shropshire; then through the study of tiny anomalies in the true orbit of the Earth (based, aged 17, on weekly measurements of the elevation of the sun, with findings published in the journal of the Royal Geographical Society) and into academic degrees in solid state physics and astrophysics at Imperial College London. The culmination of this obsession was a personal epiphany: “I was thinking of using the weather to discover what the sun had been doing in the past,” Corbyn says. “But then I thought, that’s just stupid: why not use the sun to predict what the weather will do in the future?” In his mind, the only thing that has got in the way of him making his fortune from that ambition, is politics. To begin with, he says, his solar-based forecasts and calculations were way off, and he had as good as given up, but in 1984 a singular event changed the course of his working life. At the time, Corbyn says, of the year after his brother had first been elected a Labour MP, his own political loyalties were in a certain state of flux. He had been a radical student union president in London and sometime revolutionary socialist (a past that he believes would have prevented him working at the Met Office, still part of the Ministry of Defence, even had he wanted to). In the early 1980s he had been affiliated to the International Marxist Group, after a brief flirtation with the “quasi-Trotsky anarchist group, The Big Flame, for the 11 days it existed”. At the beginning of 1984, knowing his meteorological background, the IMG asked him to forecast what the winter was going to be like at the end of that year. The miners were planning a strike and “they wanted to know whether it was going to be cold enough for the strike to be effective, to bring Britain to its knees,” Corbyn recalls. He said no, but under pressure from his comrades he went back to the data, “looked at a lot of new relationships and correlations” and came to the conclusion that, yes, it was going to be a very cold winter. He presented his evidence to the Miners’ Educational Support Committee (“I think it was called that. We had a lot of committees…”) And it was passed on up to the NUM. As the strike unfolded Corbyn’s prediction proved correct, the winter of 1984-85 was unusually cold. Was the NUM grateful? “Very,” he says. He had phone calls from head office, “not [Arthur] Scargill personally but one of his senior assistants”, asking how long the cold weather would last. He told him he thought it could possibly last long enough to bring down the Thatcher government, but by March the strike had collapsed and he never got the chance to be proved right. All the while Corbyn was assessing the proximity of revolution by monitoring the electricity output at Goldsmith’s college where he was a lecturer in the physics department. “The voltages were below the legal minimum all that winter,” he says. “It is supposed to be 240v, it was below 210v and for safety they are legally bound to turn it off. The government were desperately doing everything they could to conserve power. I called to say I had measured the voltages at the University of London and they were below that minimum. They said, ‘Well, Mr Corbyn you must have faulty equipment,’ and put down the phone.” It was in those weeks and months, Corbyn suggests, that Margaret Thatcher came up with her most devious plan to deindustrialise Britain and defeat the miners once and for all: she would popularise and endorse the science of man-made climate change, as a way of converting Britain from coal to nuclear power. The Hadley Centre, the world’s first dedicated research institution became her pet project. Thatcher, who later recanted her doom-mongering, “probably knew climate change was nonsense,” Corbyn suggests, “she was a scientist. But she was also a politician. The rest is history.” Corbyn sees that moment as the one in which politicians first saw the political capital to be made from prophesying the coming apocalypse. Worse though, in his mind, the most vehement expression of that prophesy was not on the right but on the left. Climate change became a progressive cause. For Corbyn, it answered the crisis on the left created by the fall of the Berlin Wall. “The left needed a new totem pole. Something for the young to dance around and feel good about,” he says, somewhat bitterly. “Revolutions had failed. Russia had failed. Socialism wasn’t dead but it needed a cause. The Red-Green alliance became that cause. It needed massive state spending, which they equated with socialism. In my view the left stopped thinking in 1989. It is only my brother who has started to change the agenda of privatisation and so on.” It is hard to imagine that Piers has not bent his brother’s ear with elements of this analysis at family gatherings for about 25 years. Does he show signs of wavering? “I don’t speak for my brother on any of this,” he says. “I don’t give advice to him where it is not appropriate.” Did Jeremy share his obsession with the weather as a kid? “Not really,” he says. “We were all different. Our eldest brother was into cars. He became a flight test engineer for Concorde. The next brother is a mining engineer, went to Imperial college. Then there is me, scientist. Then Jeremy, who was always politics. I think we all took after different aspects of our dad; while my mother encouraged us to make things all the time. The house was rundown and we boys had to do repairs. Jeremy and I learned how to repoint brickwork and so on. We became pretty good builders.” Piers has had perhaps less convincing success with the construction project that has occupied most of his adult life. After the relative triumph of his forecast for the miners he worked pretty much full-time on his long-range models. By 1989, the first year he heard of the idea of man-made climate change, he was ready to sell his formula to the world. Ignoring the traditional model of publication and peer review, ostensibly to prevent others stealing his ideas, he engaged the bookmaker William Hill to construct some weather bets for him with the help of the Met Office. “That went on for 12 years,” he says. “I had 30 bets at £20 each on long-range aspects of the weather each month; betting the average temperature would be below normal, that kind of thing. We made a lot of money that way.” How much is a lot of money? “I made about 40% profits on stake, overall,” he claims. “I would bet £600; I would get an extra £200 back. It would pay the rent basically.” He and his girlfriend at the time no doubt spent a lot of time looking anxiously at the sky. After this marginal success, a little better than putting a wet finger in the wind, some commercial clients came calling. For a while, Corbyn exclusively told the clothes store Etam the optimum time to sell its T-shirts or its hats and scarves. Some farmers were seduced by his predictions of storm and drought. And then the scientific consensus around carbon dioxide as principal climate-changer hardened, and Corbyn’s company, WeatherAction, which floated on the stock exchange in 1997, went back into private ownership after two years. Adversity has only stiffened Corbyn’s resolve, however. Despite his marginal status he is fighting global opinion on all fronts. These days he does the odd presentation for Texan oil companies, or Russian climate sceptics. And he has not given up on a shift of opinion closer to home. “Whatever you think of it all, the net result of these beliefs has been a deindustrialising of the west and the shift of carbon dioxide production from Britain to India and China,” he says. “Labour under Jeremy are now saying we have got to make a special case for steel and various industries that have to pay all these significant taxations on energy costs, which is the reason a lot of them are closing down.” Piers is whispering in the ear of any MP who will listen: “Graham Stringer, of Labour, is sympathetic,” he says, “Sammy Wilson DUP, a number of Tories, Boris is very sympathetic [Johnson tends to use Corbyn, in an unlikely alliance, as his climate guru]. Now I think we have George Galloway which is significant, because he can be very persuasive…” Inevitably, Corbyn has arrived for coffee armed with graphs and charts; so before I go I try to get him to explain how his calculations work. He talks 10 to the dozen about solar magnetic fields and lunar modulation and stratospheric winds. He outlines his database of 200-year-old German weather maps and solar observation from American satellites. “The principle is that all weather that happens has happened before, all storm systems, the question is finding the closest match…” If the results are as good as he claims, I suggest, why haven’t other people picked up on his system? “We haven’t told them how it’s done!” he says. “We had the Solar Weather Technique, ‘SWT zero’. We now have now got the Solar Lunar Action Technique, ‘SLAT’, and we are on version 12CS – s is for special. We have gone through 20 improvements and understandings on this…” As he talks I have the impression of an army of researchers tracking and calculating, poring over maps in order to compete with the Met Office’s supercomputer. When you say “we…” I ask. “I mean me,” he says. “OK” I say. “And what does the system suggest we can look forward to? “It will get much, much colder,” Corbyn asserts (he has lately suggested that in the longer term we are on the verge of a great cooling cycle, which will vindicate him once and for all). “Next month we have a displaced polar vortex situation. Plenty of snow coming.” We both glance out at the spring-like day on Borough High Street. “It’s got a chance, I guess,” I say. Corbyn grins. As he knows only too well, stranger things have happened."
"The strange sight of dead seabirds black against the white snows of winter far from their natural habitat has become an all too common occurrence these days along a wilderness snowmobile trail that runs for hundreds of miles into the wild north of Alaska’s largest city. Worse than the dead birds, though, are the birds seen swimming in the rare pockets of open water along the fast-flowing Susitna and Yentna rivers. These are starving animals still struggling to live, and yet doomed to die prematurely.  Wildlife scientists say the dead and dying birds – 18in tall common murres – are only a few among what might be as many as 100,000 or more of their species losing the battle to survive in the storm-pounded North Pacific Ocean. Since late summer, thousands of murres have washed up dead on beaches along the Gulf of Alaska after apparently dying at sea. Others were strong enough to get airborne in fall or winter only to be swept inland as seasonal storms roiled the offshore waters. An estimated 8,000 dead murres showed up on the beaches near Whittier, an isolated community of only about 220 people 60 miles south-east of here. Thousands more were found dead near Homer, a popular summer tourist destination 125 miles to the south that is home to about 5,000 year-round residents. As yet, no has any clue as to exactly how many carcasses litter the remote and little visited beaches along the hundreds of miles of undeveloped coast that rims the Alaska gulf, according to John Piatt at the Alaska Science Center of the US Geological Survey. The full death count might never be known. Piatt has spent almost 30 years studying Alaska murres and other seabirds. He has seen big die-offs before. He and other researchers estimated 120,000 murres died of starvation in the winter of 1993. About 185,000 were calculated to have perished after being smeared with a mousse-like emulsion of water and oil that spewed out of Prince William Sound and rampaged north across the gulf after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spilled 11m gallons of crude oil in1989. What has been different this time is the number of dying murres pushed inland by an oscillating jet stream that has played havoc with Alaska weather for the past two winters. Some blame climate change, but climate experts say it is hard determine whether Alaska is witnessing a long-term shift or only a strange, short-term anomaly in a region where the weather is notoriously unpredictable. Whichever the case, winds that normally blow west to east across the Pacific have been eddying into a south to north pattern as the atmosphere swirls like a whirlpool in a river. Starving murres still strong enough to get airborne have found themselves caught in warm, moist winds of up to 100mph roaring north out of the gulf into the heart of the 49th state. Thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of the birds rode these winds until they faded only to find themselves stranded and awaiting death far from their natural habitat. Some birds were pushed over the towering Alaska Range mountains into the bitterly cold Alaska interior hundreds of miles from the sea. Most, however, came to earth near this city or just to the north in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. Urban Alaskans rallied to save those found on or adjacent to the state’s few roadways.  The Bird Treatment and Learning Center here has taken in 411 murres since October, said director Guy Runco. In a normal year, the center handles 600 to 700 birds of all species. One or two of them might be murres. “It’s really strange,’’ Runco said. Rehabilitating malnourished murres has taxed the center’s finance and its staff of volunteers, and there’s no telling if saving the murres has had any environmental value. Released back into the wild fat and well fed, they could just end up starving again. Murres need to eat about a fiftieth of their body weight in small fish per day to survive. Piatt and other scientists said the birds are obviously having problems finding enough food. The causes could be a decline in forage fish or simply a shift in where the forage fish feed. Some have pondered climate change there, too. The forage fish thrive in cold water, and the water in the gulf has been unusually warm this year. It could be the fish declined because of this – or that they moved away from the normal feeding grounds of the murre as they sought cooler waters. The murre die-off, though dramatic, is not thought to be any threat to the species as a whole given that there are an estimated 2.8 million breeding murres in 230 nesting colonies in Alaska. There are also animals that have benefited from the tragedy of the murres. “The eagles are eating well,’’ Runco said. Alaska’s bald eagles are notoriously efficient scavengers. So, too, the state’s ravens, magpies, coyotes, foxes, mink, weasels and other animals. Jean Gabryszak, whose family runs the remote Yentna Station Roadhouse, said: “The ravens are all fat and happy.’’"
"Demand for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles is soaring, according to new figures released today by the UK’s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The data shows the number of new cars eligible for the government Plug-in Car Grant scheme rose from 14,532 in to 28,188 last year, an increase of 94 per cent. Zero and low emission vehicles still make up only a fraction of an overall market, with total new vehicle registrations reaching a record 2.6 million. However, demand for alternative fuelled and low emission vehicles is outperforming the wider market across all categories. The auto market as a whole grew 6.3 per cent, but demand for pure electric vehicles rose 48 per cent to nearly 10,000 vehicles and demand for plug-in hybrids soared 133 per cent year-on-year to over 18,000 vehicles. Since the Plug-in Car Grant scheme was launched with its promise of up to £5,000 off the cost of electric vehicles, 47,690 eligible cars have been registered. Conventional hybrids enjoyed a similar strong performance last year with annual demand for petrol hybrids growing 18 per cent to 40,707 registrations and demand for diesel hybrids climbing 36 per cent to over 3,800. Overall, the market for alternative fuelled vehicles rose 40 per cent to 72,775 units, increasing the sector’s market share from 2.1 per cent in 2014 to 2.8 per cent last year. In contrast, demand for diesel vehicles rose just three per cent, as the fall-out from the VW scandal no doubt contributed to the technology’s market share slipping to 48.5 per cent."
"California governor Jerry Brown declared an emergency on Wednesday in a Los Angeles neighborhood where a blown-out natural gas well has been spewing record amounts of global warming pollution. Ten weeks after the 23 October breach was detected, Brown ordered state agencies to make sure Southern California Gas Company, which owns the stricken natural gas storage facility, plugs the leak. “All necessary and viable actions will be taken to ensure Southern California Gas Company: maximizes daily withdrawals of natural gas from the Aliso Canyon Storage Facility for use or storage elsewhere; captures leaking gas and odorants while relief wells are being completed; and identifies how it will stop the gas leak if relief wells fail to seal the leaking well, or if the existing leak worsens,” the order said. The breach had released “major amounts of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas” and caused widespread disruption to local people in the Porter Ranch area, the statement from Brown noted. Experts said the break at the natural gas storage reservoir is the largest known occurrence of its kind.  Methane is dozens of times more warming than carbon dioxide, and the storage facility, which draws on about 100 other wells, is one of the largest in the state. Campaign groups say the broken well has been pumping out the equivalent in carbon dioxide emissions of 7m cars a day. Thousands of people, including schoolchildren, have been evacuated from Porter Ranch to escape the rotten egg smell of the chemicals added to the gas. The declaration follows Brown’s visit to Porter Ranch earlier this week, during which he met residents who have suffered nose bleeds, headaches and nausea from the smells. Such chemicals are commonly used to aid in leak detection. Brown directed his administration to take “all necessary and viable actions” to make sure SoCalGas captures leaking natural gas and odorants. He also asked the company to spell out how it planned to plug the well if its current effort failed. The order bans SoCalGas from injecting more natural gas into the storage site, and it calls for independent monitoring of air quality. Brown also ordered daily inspections and regular testing of natural gas storage wells in the state for leaks. Brown has come under intense criticism from campaign groups for his slow response to the leak. On Wednesday, some of those groups now expressed relief.  “This is a hard-fought win for the residents of Porter Ranch and beyond affected by this noxious blowout,” Alexandra Nagy, an organiser for Food and Water Watch, said in an emailed statement. She called on Brown to shutter the storage facility for good."
"A “modest” uniform carbon tax of £20 a tonne would have a negligible impact on consumer prices, according to a new study that attempts to make the case for wider adoption of carbon pricing policies. The study from the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at London School of Economics and Political Science argues that applying the tax to all fuels would increase UK consumer prices by up to just 0.9 per cent, assuming all costs were passed along supply chains fully.  However, the report, which was authored by David Grover, Ganga Shreedhar and Dimitri Zenghelis, argues that the true cost impact on consumers is likely to be even lower, given the manner in which the carbon tax would incentivise green behaviour change, drive business innovation, and provide the Treasury with revenues that it could recycle back into the economy. “In reality [the] impact would likely be still smaller than these estimates suggest because our analysis has not allowed for any of the input substitution, innovation, production method change, or new investment behaviour that industries would exhibit to avoid the cost of carbon pricing,” the paper stated. Opponents of carbon taxes argue they would impose costs on consumers and undermine the competitiveness of carbon intensive industries. Last year the government moved to ease these concerns, exempting a raft of energy intensive industries such as steel and concrete manufacturing from existing carbon taxes and ‘green levies’. However, the new paper argues only a handful of industries that together account for around two per cent of UK GDP would face production cost increases that could result in their international competitive position being compromised. “Carbon policies will provide incentives to increase energy efficiency and resource productivity which could afford UK producers a competitive advantage in the long term, in a world where fossil fuel prices could rise and carbon reduction policies are likely to become more widespread and ambitious,” the paper said. It added that industries that are disproportionately impacted by carbon taxes should be provided with policy support to help them adapt to carbon pricing measures. “The correct policy response is not to resist this change but to identify vulnerable sectors and buffer labour market participants against its sharpest effects,” the paper said. “Countries and firms that resist enduring change and innovation may not be acting in their long-term interests.”"

"The US experienced its second-warmest year on record in 2015, which was also one of the costliest years for climate and weather-related disasters, federal scientists announced on Thursday.  The average national temperature in 2015 was 54.4F (12.4C) – 2.4F (4.3C) above the 20th-century average – making it the second-warmest year since record-keeping began in 1895, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said. Jake Crouch, a climate scientist with Noaa’s National Centers for Environmental Information, said that the temperature average across the contiguous US was more than six degrees above the previous century’s average. “No state was actually cooler than average during 2015,” Crouch said in a press conference. “Every state had an above-average temperature during the year.” Last year was the 19th consecutive year where the annual average US temperature exceeded its 20th-century average – only 2012 was warmer, with an average temperature of 55.3F. Although 2.4F doesn’t sound like much, Noaa cautioned that it was an indicator of a global climate imbalance. “Although on a day-to-day basis it may not be that big a deal, over time it is large, because part of the events that build that 2.4-degree difference are the kinds of things that we saw in the eastern United States this December,” said Deke Arndt, chief of the climate monitoring branch at Noaa’s National Centers for Environmental Information. Noaa’s data also noted the extreme nature of weather-related natural disasters in 2015. “In 2015, there were 10 weather and climate disaster events in the US, each with losses exceeding $1bn,” said Adam Smith, an applied climatologist at Noaa. “Overall, these resulted in the deaths of 155 people and had significant economic effects.” Smith noted in particular a spree of tornadoes in Texas, record-setting rainfall and flooding in South Carolina, and a western wildfire season which burned more than 10m acres – “the largest area burned since record-keeping began in 1960”. Released on the heels of a landmark global climate deal that aims to hold nearly 200 nations accountable for greenhouse gas emissions, as well as only weeks after anunseasonably warm holiday season, Noaa scientists cautioned against making any direct links between the record-nearing average temperature and global warming related to climate change. “Climate is an outcome of many ingredients and many factors to give us the outcome that they do,” said Arndt, who also noted that the particularly strong El Niño weather phenomenon likely contributed to distinct weather events. El Nino’s presence also contributed to one of the rainiest years in history. “The contiguous US also experienced its third-wettest year on record,” primarily related to the strong presence of El Niño, said Crouch. Not all states benefitted from the rain, however, with California suffering “an exceptional drought throughout all of the year, according to Crouch, making 2015 California’s 13th-driest in 121 years of record-keeping. Noaa scientists also said that the organization’s September prediction that 2015 would likely shape up to be the world’s hottest on record was still expected to bear fruit. Those data are due for release 20 January."
"As revelers around the world ring in the new year with glasses of champagne tonight, they’re probably not toasting to the sustainable agricultural methods that went into some of the bottles. But for some vineyards in France – where earlier this month nearly 200 nations signed a landmark deal to limit climate change – employing green practices in their winemaking is as important as protecting the use of the term “champagne”, which applies only to the bubbly produced in a region of France that bears the same name.  Climate change is prompting some farmers in this celebrated region to switch to more eco-friendly techniques which, they hope, will also enable their champagne to command higher prices from consumers who care about whether what they are drinking is sustainably produced.  In 2014, champagne production was valued at €4.5bn ($4.8bn) per year. Nearly 16,000 winegrowers produced grapes for 300 champagne houses, which sold 307m bottles that year. In 2003, the champagne industry emitted 200,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Figuring out how to keep his vineyards productive for decades to come has driven Jean-Pierre Vazart, a third-generation farmer, to adopt more eco-friendly practices. His vineyard, Vazart-Coquart & Fils, overlooks the Blancs de Blancs region of Champagne in northeast France. “We must think about all these little things to have sustainable thinking,” Vazart says. “For us, it’s very important in our carbon calculation.”  Standing in a newly constructed building in Chouilly, Champagne, Vazart gives a tour of his grape pressing facility. The second floor of the building makes use of natural light to brighten up the space during the day, and efficient insulation keeps the building warm. The floor below houses a new, more energy efficient grape press. Vazart is pouring his profits into making his champagne business more sustainable. “In harvest, this place is filled with grapes, waiting for the pressing,” he says. Next year, he plans to rebuild the winery itself. “I want to change a lot.” While other grape-growing regions already see the impact of climate change – too many warm days for grapes that love cool climate in California, for example – champagne growers so far haven’t felt the effect. In fact, they have found that warmer weather has been helpful. It has reduced fatal frost damage to the grapes. The grapes are ripening with a higher alcohol level and lower acidity, making it easier for winemakers to meet regulations.  But Vazart and his compatriots are not kicking back with glasses of their own bubbly to celebrate. They know that in the long term, with forecasts of extreme drought and storms, sustainable practices will be critical to keep their centuries-old tradition alive. Champagne is already a regulated business from an environmental perspective. Some 330m tons of grape clusters are plucked every year in Champagne; these clusters are shorn from the vines by hand and carried carefully to the press, where they are squeezed without being separated from the branch. All producers are required by French law to recycle 100% of discarded material from their grape-crushing endeavors, including the water used to wash down the press. As much as 90% of plastics and glass from champagne production is recycled. Vazart and others want to do more. Earlier this year, the French Ministry of Agriculture approved a sustainable vinegrowing certification program, named Viticulture Durable en Champagne, advocated by champagne makers like Vazart. The award supplements an earlier certification approved by the French government in 2012, the High Environmental Value (HVE) certificate, which can be used by farmers in all agricultural industries – not just wine. Such sustainable practices go beyond recycling waste, and Vazart has already adopted many of them. For instance, he increases biodiversity in his fields by planting grasses and hedges for insects to nest and feed on grape pests. He also spreads the pheromones of female butterflies around his vines to induce what he calls “sexual confusion” – caterpillars are too frenzied by the scent to burrow into grapes and lay eggs in them. “No egg, no caterpillar, no problem,” Vazart says. After introducing these eco-friendly practices in the early 2000s, Jean-Pierre’s village saw a dramatic 90% drop in the use of pesticides, while the whole Champagne region saw a 50% drop. Even though they have been using those practices for years, they will not get government certification for their effort.  Other less sexy but no less critical changes covered by the sustainability initiative include preventing soil erosion, managing water supplies and runoff, constructing more efficient buildings, like Vazart’s new facility, and reducing transportation emissions. Champagne growers have managed to reduce the carbon footprint of each bottle by 15% since 2003, even as production has increased – thanks in part to new bottles that weigh 7% less. Eco-friendly practices don’t just reduce environmental damage caused by farming, Vazart argues; they add value to the land by increasing biodiversity. And all of the grape clusters discarded after pressing fuel other industries – for instance, city buses in Paris run, in part, on ethanol made with wastes from press grapes.  According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the conservation of agricultural biodiversity is a “key option for the adaptation to climate change”. The practices employed by Vazart and his fellow farmers both combat the effects of climate change, which include more erratic weather patterns and stronger storms, and help adapt to a changing world.  The grass and hedges Vazart planted, for instance, aren’t just a haven for helpful insects; they also prevent soil erosion during times of heavy rain. Curbing emissions from shipping bottles around the globe – which accounts for much of Champagne’s carbon footprint – will reduce the emissions created by the wine industry.  When he was younger, Vazart wanted to work in a completely different field – perhaps with computers. But when he began working alongside his father, he came to love it. “It’s not a job. It’s a life. Now, it’s the only thing I could do,” he says. Creating sustainably made wine isn’t just about dealing with climate change. Some farmers, including Vazart, believe it will also enable them to fetch higher prices for their labor.  According to a Food Policy study, sustainability labels don’t significantly change consumer behavior; such certifications only have an impact on people who are already concerned about the environment. Meanwhile, according to a market analysis report by the Canadian government, 61% of French people think it’s important to buy socially responsible products and 45% say they have altered their behavior to buy more of those products. “We’re not trying to produce more bottles. We’re trying to produce better bottles that consumers will pay more for,” says Thibaut Le Mailloux, communications director of the Champagne Committee, the trade association that helped create the rigorous sustainability certification approved by France’s Ministry of Agriculture earlier this year. “Consumers are more and more demanding greener products,” Le Mailloux says. “We want to prove the efforts we have done because it gives an even better image of Champagne.” But switching to eco-friendly practices costs money, an expense that can be too great for some farmers. Agricultural producers with slimmer margins point out that refitting their operations would involve significant costs. Improving wastewater treatment alone in Champagne cost €80m ($86m), and researching and testing environmental initiatives, like new bottles, can cost one house anywhere between €500,000 to €1m ($540,000–$1.1m). Many agricultural producers – from dairy and meat producers to wheat and fruit farmers – are already feeling the burn of climate change with more extreme weather patterns and less predictable seasons ruining crops and affecting prices. Taking on huge costs to change their operations is just not a feasible option. Le Mailloux acknowledges that champagne makers tend to have deeper pockets than other agricultural producers, so they can afford to take risks on innovative practices.  However, despite the difficulties facing France’s agricultural industry, Le Mailloux hopes that more farmers will eventually incorporate sustainable growing methods in order to stay in business. “We hope there will always be a reason to celebrate and drink champagne,” he says. • This article is part of a special report by The GroundTruth Project.

"The UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has convened an emergency panel of heads of state to prompt a political response to the world’s increasing scarcity of water.  The high level panel on water will find ways to coordinate the often piecemeal political decisions made by the plethora of regulators, governments, companies and individuals who draw from dwindling water reserves. It will also raise a widely-neglected problem to the highest level of political discourse. “Water is a precious resource, crucial to realising the sustainable development goals, which at their heart aim to eradicate poverty,” said Ban, who announced the formation of the panel alongside the president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, at a special session of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos this morning.  “The new panel can help motivate the action we need to turn ideas into reality,” he said, adding that countries needed to take the lead on tackling the problem. The panel will meet regularly between now and 2018 and will be chaired by the presidents of Mexico and Mauritius, Enrique Peña Nieto and Ameenah Gurib-Fakim. The two presidents were chosen for their countries’ diverse and representative water challenges. Mexico faces large scale water shortages associated with its booming developing economy, and as a small island state, Mauritius is especially vulnerable to climate change and the many water issues that come with a warming world and rising sea levels. A further eight heads of state from the developed and developing world will be invited by Ban to join the panel. It is intended they will develop an agenda focused on tangible changes. One example given was the sway the heads of state will have over the operations of the World Bank. As shareholders and clients, heads of state are in a unique position to advise the bank on problems with the way water projects are funded. “Achieving the water global goal would have multiple benefits, including laying the foundations for food and energy security, sustainable urbanisation, and ultimately climate security,” said Kim. “My hope is that this panel accelerates action in many countries so that we can make water more accessible to all.” The politics of water can be divisive, and competition for the resource has become a serious threat to stability in water-scarce regions in parts of Africa, the Middle East and south Asia.  “We are already seeing elements of water scarcity coming through - not just because of climate change, but [because of] over-abstraction. We are seeing stress points - social tensions or conflicts over a lack of access to water,” said Dominic Waughray, head of public-private partnerships at the World Economic Forum. According to the UN, 90% of all disasters are water related and by 2050 the world will have just 60% of the water it needs. At last year’s announcement of the SDGs, the UN set its sights on delivering “water and sanitation for all” by 2030, but the issue is rarely discussed by those with the power to address it, said Waughray. “There has never been a coordinated political momentum. Even when it gets to water ministers, they are sometimes not the most influential ministers in a cabinet. The water community might have done a very good job of analysing the problem and coming up with solutions, but it has never broken through politically at the highest level, at scale, in developed and developing countries,” he said. The session in Davos was chaired by the former prime minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd. Rudd told the Guardian that water had not reached the top level of political discourse because there were “too many other pressing challenges”. “But time is now right,” he said. “Climate change has now focused on the unfolding water crisis. As well as its impact on national security arising from water scarcity. We are now seeking to translate the sustainable development goals on water into reality.” Rudd said the heads of state could build partnerships with the private sector and ensure investment in infrastructure could be found. Attending the session, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman of Nestlé and chair of the 2030 Water Resources Group, said: “The mark of success for the panel will be practical action and tangible impact. Let this be an opportunity to break down silos at the highest level and collaborate with private sector and others.”  Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

"A hurricane has formed far out in the Atlantic Ocean, the first time such an event has happened in January since 1938, US officials said. Hurricane Alex’s maximum sustained winds were near 85mph (140kmh) and residents of Portugal’s mid-Atlantic Azores islands were warned to expect waves up to 60ft (18 metres) high and wind gusts up to 100mph.  The islands’ Civil Protection Service issued a weather red alert, the highest of four warnings that indicates extreme risk, for five of the archipelago’s nine islands.  The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami said in a Facebook post there hadn’t been a hurricane present during the month of January since 1955, when Alice formed in late December 1954 and continued into the next month. The hurricane was centred about 350 miles south of Faial Island in the central Azores and was moving north-north-east at about 22mph. Alex was expected to move near or over parts of the Azores on Friday, the NHC said. The Azores government on Thursday advised kindergartens to stay closed and told residents to ensure drainage systems were not blocked. The archipelago, which has a population of about 250,000, has been threatened by hurricanes before, but they usually lose their strength as they move into colder northern water. Alex formed only days after a rare event in the Pacific. An El Niño-related tropical storm formed south-west of Hawaii last week. Tropical Storm Pali, only the third such system to develop in January in more than 40 years, had weakened to a depression by Thursday and was expected to dissipate in the next day or so. It never made landfall. Alex’s formation, however, had nothing to do with El Niño, said Mike Halpert, the deputy director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center in the US.  The NOAA researcher Jim Kossin said the water in which Alex formed was about 1.7C to 2.2C (3F to 4F) warmer than normal, but still barely warm enough for a storm to form."
"It came over our hedge and performed a slow swerve around me, a flying creature the size of a snowdrop’s bloom, but rotund and black except for pale detail at the abdomen tip. I was so shocked I looked round for someone to receive the instantaneous and extraordinary tidings: a bumblebee at New Year! What on Earth can such a sighting mean? I’ll add detail to justify any unease in that question. It was probably one of two common species, buff-tailed or early bumblebee. Based on its small size I might have suggested the latter, but I keep records of spring firsts and my earliest-ever early bumblebee is late March. My earliest-ever bumblebee of any species is 28 January 2012: a whole month later than this one.  In fact I wondered if it were not so much premature as a veteran of last autumn. Whichever is true, it was a bumblebee in a seasonal no-man’s-land, and my strangest record of this insect family in half a century. I wonder what causal chain I have to invoke to account for such a maladapted vision? Must the moment draw in its wake, if only by implication, all the ecological fallout from 5bn tonnes of carbon, which our species propels, car journey by car journey, flicked switch by flicked switch, into the troposphere every year? Or is it something else? Is my weird record connected to the weather anomalies generated by exceptional warm-water currents in the western Pacific? To think that there could be a link between that ocean’s habits and my garden’s wildlife is extraordinary enough, but at least a bumblebee because of El Niño is natural and, thus, admissible. For much of recorded history, “unnatural” events at the point of the year’s renewal were often taken as ominous portents. I suspect little has changed. In our own ecologically informed age, when we understand how everything is linked to everything else, we may no longer resort to supernatural powers or the will of God to explain these freaks. Yet still, we sense instinctively that a midwinter bumblebee can neither be random nor without meaning."
"A coalition of UK conservation groups is calling for a new national charter for trees, woods and people. Led by the Woodland Trust, 48 conservation and cultural groups have launched a campaign for a new charter in 2017, the 800-year anniversary of the signing of the original Charter of the Forest by Henry III. This protected and restored the right of people to access and use the royal forests - crucial at the time for grazing livestock, collecting firewood and foraging for food.  The coalition says it is time for a new charter, as woods come under “unprecedented threat” from development, pests and disease and climate change and trees risk being “neglected, undervalued and forgotten”.  Community groups, clubs, councils and committees are being encouraged to feed into the building of the charter. To kickstart the campaign, people across the UK are being urged to share their “tree stories” of treasured or significant moments that would not have been possible without trees. A new, broader charter would recognise the importance of trees in 21st-century British society, celebrate their enormous contribution to public life, and ensure future generations could benefit from them by ensuring access to nature and protection of ancient woodland and other habitats, its backers argue. It would also cover forestry, the value of trees and woods in terms of finance and other benefits to people, the importance of new planting and making sure landscapes are resilient to the threats they face, they say.  Beccy Speight, chief executive of the Woodland Trust, said: “Our collective ambition is for a charter that puts trees back at the heart of our lives, communities and decision-making - where they belong. The charter will provide guidance and inspiration to allow us all to appreciate, preserve and celebrate our trees and woods for what they do for us in so many different ways.  “Inspired by something that happened 800 years ago, there is no better time than now to shine the spotlight again on the benefits that trees and woods bring to us all today and to future generations.” Research for the Woodland Trust by Europe Economics in March last year found the total value of woodland to the UK’s economy is around £270bn. Living near of having access to trees also provides invaluable health and wellbeing benefits, research shows.  But the trust warns that valuable habitats are under threat, the area of new woodland created each year continues to fall and far too few trees are being planted to connect up the landscape. The impact of tree disease such as ash dieback and oak processionary moth will impact this further.  Reductions in the number of people enrolling in forestry, land management and environmental courses compounds the problem as it means there are not enough skilled and informed people in the sector, the trust warns."
"Australia’s chief scientist through the bitter “climate wars” has some advice for scientists denigrated and disparaged by those who do not like their evidence-based advice: “don’t flinch”. And as he prepares to leave the job on Friday, Ian Chubb has some unflinching parting advice – Australia will inevitably have to adopt tougher greenhouse gas reduction targets.  Chubb is also on the board of the independent Climate Change Authority, which the Abbott government unsuccessfully sought to abolish, and he is convinced Australia will eventually have to adopt targets similar to those advocated by the CCA.  The CCA found Australia should be cutting emissions by between 40 and 60% by 2030, measured against 2000 levels. Measured the same way the target announced by Tony Abbott and then adopted by Malcolm Turnbull equates to a cut of between 19 and 22%. “That was solid work and I stand by those recommended targets,” Chubb said in an interview with Guardian Australia. He said the continuing process set up under the Paris international climate agreement, struck late last year, and Australia’s particular susceptibility to the effects of global warming, meant “we will have to reconsider our target, I cannot see how we could possibly not”. The Turnbull government has not ruled out increasing its targets as a result of the five-yearly reviews required under the Paris deal but has said it has no plans to do so. Chubb recalls that he had “a lot of pushback” during the first few months of the Abbott government, “the emails from the usual suspects, people like Maurice Newman [who headed Abbott’s business advisory committee] who continue to believe [climate change] is all some vast conspiracy involving thousands of scientists around the world”. In 2014 Chubb suggested Newman should “stick to economics rather than “trawl the internet” for papers questioning the overwhelming scientific opinion on global warming. But Chubb said his conversations with the former prime minister himself had always been “rational and reasonable.” “I was surprised at some of Tony Abbott’s public comments about climate change and some of his government’s initial responses and policies ... because [Abbott] and I talked about climate change quite rationally and reasonably,” Chubb said. “He didn’t necessarily agree with me, we tried to persuade one another, but his questions were primarily about the modelling and the sensitivity of the climate to CO2 and how to build policy around the range of the projections.” He also referred to a controversy over claims of threats against climate scientists at the Australian National University, where he had been chancellor. “I was also questioned in the early stages because there was a suggestion that some scientists at the ANU had received death threats,” Chubb said.  “I never said there had [been] death threats but their offices were open to the street and I thought it sensible to move them to offices accessed with a swipe card. The Australian newspaper spent a long time running FOIs [freedom of information requests] on that. I think they wanted to prove that I’d somehow timed the release of the information for a particular purpose, which was of course ludicrous.” But Chubb says the antagonism towards climate science was easing. “The debate here and overseas is much more sensible now, the sheer weight of scientific evidence is having a bearing,” he said. He said he had also been deeply disappointed by the science funding cuts announced in Abbott’s first budget but was happy that the last budget and the recent innovation statement had seen some “selective reinvestment”. Chubb will be succeeded by Dr Alan Finkel, an engineer and former neuroscience research fellow who has served as the chancellor of Monash University since 2008. Chubb has been chief scientist since 2011. Catriona Jackson, the chief executive officer of Science and Technology Australia, thanked Chubb for his advocacy. “There have been some difficult times for science and scientists in the past decade from virulent well-organised climate scepticism to a lack of interest in science,” she said. “The fact that that has turned around in Australia is very significantly attributable to Ian Chubb and his relentless energy.”  The industry minister, Christopher Pyne, congratulated him on his “excellent term”. Farewell to Prof Chubb, retiring as Chief Scientist. Congratulations on excellent term & thanks for your help w NISA https://t.co/RfFpN9avo4"
"For the first time the world has agreed both a vision and a pathway for clean sustainable development.  Through the contributions of 188 countries, as well as thousands of additional commitments from states and cities, companies, foundations and international organisations, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change has given the world an ambitious goal for climate action.  The UN climate talks in Paris created important political momentum to get something meaningful done on climate change – momentum that is vital to spur aggressive emissions reduction and to cement a “clean” development dimension to the new sustainable development goals (SDGs) agreed in September. The agenda for delivering this development now rightly intertwines inclusive economic growth, ambitious improvements in our social infrastructure for education, gender parity and improved health, as well as lower emissions. The question now arises: how do we actually deliver this? The challenge is enormous. The Paris Agreement recognises that the sum of countries’ Intended Nationally Determined Commitments (INDCs) for climate action, as it stands, will not be enough to keep within the agreed goal of staying below a 2°C rise. The extra climate commitments made at Paris by countries and “non-state actors” – businesses, investors, cities, provinces and various action alliances – can provide a strong additional contribution to the INDCs, but these actors face daunting challenges because many of these commitments are interdependent. Industry often benefits from and needs policy reform to help transform to zero-emissions systems, governments usually need private and public finance these days, and financiers need well-structured projects, championed by the public and the private sector, to invest in. In many cases success will be possible only through bold collaborations with diverse actors – public and private, incumbent and innovator, domestic and international. Think about the scale of new policies, projects and finance that will be required to move the world’s major cities towards becoming clean, sustainable urban systems by 2030. That’s the scale of the challenge the sustainable development goals and Paris Agreement have set us. This ambitious new landscape requires innovative and to some extent unprecedented collaboration. Even those within the United Nations and other global organisations such as the World Bank recognise it will take more than the efforts of, for example, UNEP, the UNDP, and the UNFCCC to meet the new combined environment, development and climate goals.  Likewise, the CEOs of even the largest companies committed to climate action acknowledge the important role of governments (at city, state, national and international levels) to help them accelerate action. The Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition is a good example of this new environment. Through interaction between international organisations, governments and companies, about 40 countries and 23 regions, states and cities now have mechanisms to put a price on carbon, representing about 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This alliance would have been unthinkable even five years ago. Talk about the potential of such public-private partnerships and alliances abounds. To mobilise the resources, innovation and actors required to start delivering a clean, sustainable development agenda as soon as possible it is generally accepted that we require a new kind of operating system for development. Indeed, goal 17 promotes a new global partnership agenda for action to meet all the other goals.  We will need a community of action to create new public-private networks and platforms in order to identify and deliver specific, large-scale partnerships across a number of key global economic sectors and geographies, particularly in emerging economies. There is no longer a “long-term” development agenda. Rather, the international community has constructed a “time-to-goal” global initiative – a decade-long delivery imperative for the public and private sectors to carry out together to meet both climate and development goals. At the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos this week, numerous meetings will bring together public, private and civil society leaders to forge and advance these new alliances. These are not abstract activities. The platforms for public-private cooperation provided by the World Economic Forum Global Challenge Initiatives have achieved many things over the past year, such as the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), the Tropical Forest Alliance, and Grow Africa and Grow Asia addressing food security.  All these initiatives will meet in Davos this week to help activate a new global delivery agenda. The overarching theme – Mastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution – will explore the sweeping changes created by digitisation and new technologies, including for delivery of the SDGs. Davos will be a meeting where the desire among global business leaders and investors to accelerate these new models into new markets, intersects with the desires of governments and the international community to start work on the new climate and sustainable development goals.  The common ground is new models for delivery. Will history look back on Davos 2016 as the dawn of a new delivery decade? Let’s hope so.

"Record dry weather in the usually wet farming regions of south-west Victoria has forced farmers to queue for water from a community bore, and led to calls for infrastructure that will future-proof the region in relation to climate change.  Two winters with little rain, followed by completely dry springs and summers have left livestock producers in the west Wimmera and southern Grampians with record low levels of water storage, Tim Leeming, a farmer and regional chair of the Southern Australia Meat Research Council told Guardian Australia. The region has the highest concentration of red meat production in the country, and produces 40% of Australia’s lamb, Leeming said.  “If there is a mild winter and another failed spring this year, there will be hell to pay. It will be mega serious,” he said. “Producers will be forced into another agricultural enterprise like cropping – and that’s out of their skill set and not really supported by the landscape. “You hesitate to mention climate change but we all know that in the last decade we’ve experienced the latest-breaking season in 40 years, we’ve experienced the wettest season in 65 years and two failed springs in a row – that has never occurred before.” Leeming is calling for councils and the state government to build a pipeline to the nearby Rocklands reservoir, currently used to provide water for regions further north. Jonathan Pollock, a climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, confirmed that the region had broken several records for dry weather and said it was most likely a result of climate change.  “Rainfall in Victoria’s south-west was average to below average in December, but it also happened to be the warmest on record for most or all of that area, too,” he said. Record dry weather was also seen there in winter and spring of 2015, Pollock said. “Looking further back, parts of south-west Victoria are the driest on record at 18-month and 39-month time spans.” The Bureau of Meteorology said in its most recent drought statement the dry weather was unlikely to be a result of natural changes and is probably due to climate change.  “This suggests the tendency for recurrent dry conditions is less related to variations such as El Niño, and more due to other changes in the climate system,” it said. “Research suggests that long-term drying trends over southern Australia cannot be explained by natural variability alone.”"
"In our society today, science serves numerous vital roles, and scientists are making our lives better. From natural hazards to natural resources, and from climate change to planetary science, Earth and space scientists serve especially crucial roles. Providing them with the tools they need to effectively communicate the facts of their research so that policymakers, business leaders, and the public can make informed decisions is crucial.  Despite the important role science plays, we scientists are often stereotyped as uninterested or incapable of translating our work into something the public can understand. To the contrary, many of us who would otherwise be interested in communicating our science to broad audiences often find ourselves lacking the necessary training.   The absence of formal training opportunities is perplexing problem, as scientists have much to offer society as a whole. Where departments and institutions fall short in providing training, for Earth and space scientists at least, the American Geophysical Union’s (AGU) Sharing Science Program fills that gap.  AGU is a society with nearly 60,000 members worldwide, devoted to promoting discovery in Earth and space science for the benefit of society. It hosts the world’s largest Earth science meeting, held each December in the USA. In addition to its core mission, AGU is dedicated to the promotion of science to a larger audience. To fill that role, AGU created the Sharing Science program.  The Sharing Science network is composed of scientists from around the world who are passionate about sharing their science with broad audiences. Members range from undergraduates who are looking for advice on how fit science communication into their career path, to researchers who want to express the value of their work to lawmakers and legislators, to tenured professors who never received formal training in science communication but are now realizing the value of translating their work into plain English.  The program encompasses all of the resources and opportunities needed to help scientists effectively communicate with broader audiences — including journalists, educators and students, policymakers, and the public — about Earth and space science and its importance. It includes interactive workshops, webinars, toolkits and more to help scientists understand their audience’s needs and to improve their communications skills.  AGU also creates and facilitates opportunities for scientists to share their knowledge with a variety of audiences through social media, op-eds, connections with local community groups or legislators, public talks, and media interviews. And scientists are offered the opportunity to network with other science communicators, volunteer to serve as experts and resources to reporters, and have their voices heard through our blogging and social media platforms. I asked Dr. Shane M. Hanlon with the Sharing Science Program at AGU how they help scientists become better communicators. He told me,  AGU wants to help scientists convey the value of their work to diverse audiences by empowering them to be visible, authoritative, and accessible voices in their community and the world.  Sharing Science seeks to break down barriers, whether it’s a barrier of not knowing how to find opportunities to engage their audiences, or a barrier imposed by the formalness of scientific training. One small example of such a barrier is the use of jargon. Because it acts as a barrier when communicating science, the program aims to teach scientists how to avoid jargon when speaking with diverse audiences. Non-scientist audience members shut down at the first mention of “geomorphology” or “hydrostatic equilibrium,” but when scientists talk about the origins of landscapes and fluids at rest, the picture is clearer. While jargon is a necessary part of science, reducing its usage is a core part of being a successful science communicator.  It’s important for scientists to be clear, but also concise. Explaining research in plain English is one thing; not boring the audience to death in the process is another. That’s why AGU provides scientists with the tools to explain years of work in 30 seconds or less. If a scientist can sum up their work in 30 seconds, then giving a 5-minute radio interview, 10-minute talk at a conference, or 1-hour presentation to community group becomes less intimidating. These are just a few examples of how the program works to eliminate those barriers to successful communication. Scientists don’t have to “dumb down” their research or lesson the intellectual merit or seriousness of their work, they just have to speak in ways that engage their audience’s attention and values. So, what’s next for this endeavor? Illustrating the importance of science communication is getting easier but there is still a lot of work to do. “It feels like things are different now – that we’re past the point of having to convince people that there’s a need for better science communication, so now we can just get right to helping scientists hone their skills,” said Aaron Huertas, multi-year leader of a “Communicating Climate Science” workshop at the AGU annual meeting and Senior Washington Director with Cater Communications, a bipartisan strategic communications firm.  The Sharing Science program is only in its third year, but AGU has seen an increase, not only in membership, but also in interest about the program and science communication as a whole. Every year at its annual meeting, AGU runs numerous workshops on science communication, and Sharing Science staff members travel all over the country to train eager scientists in communication techniques. AGU is also partnering with other organizations and societies to provide scientists with communication tools. What scientists are also learning is that the value of communicating is now becoming acknowledged by their peers. And it isn’t just AGU that’s involved. Other organizations like the Union of Concerned Scientists, The American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Meteorological Society either acknowledge excellence in communication or support communication efforts of their members.  There are also groups whose sole focus is on climate communication (Climate Communication and Climate Nexus are perhaps the best). Five years ago, my colleagues and I even set up a website whose goal is to connect reporters and elected officials with scientists to talk about current climate events (the Climate Science Rapid Response Team).  Perhaps the most prestigious communication honor is the annual Climate Communication Prize. The past five winners are really the who’s-who among our community. I asked the most recent winner, Dr. Richard Somerville, about the importance of communication, particularly for young scientists. He told me,  I encourage all scientists, including young scientists, to explore the opportunities for communicating their science and to seek help from professionals. Nobody is born a great communicator, but it involves skills that can be learned. Many universities and research institutions have helpful experts on staff whose job is to translate the science into everyday English for the media and other outlets. I have benefited by working for more than 20 years with a superb communications professional, Susan Joy Hassol. On the website climatecommunication.org, she and I and our colleagues have assembled many valuable resources for communicating climate science. Young scientists also need to be mentored skillfully in the art of combining communications work with the other aspects of their job, such as research and teaching and service. A word of caution: Different employers will have different expectations, and it may be prudent for a young scientist to establish a strong record in research, for example, before spending much time on communication. I advise young scientists to learn from the senior colleagues who will assess them for promotions and tenure. Keep in mind that these people may judge quality by looking in a mirror. At the end of the day, the goal is get science out there, from scientists to any audience. "
"Surprisingly, your article on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) fails to mention the environment (“A deal for freer trade or corporate greed? Here’s the truth about TTIP”, Business).  The independent UK Committee on Climate Change supports fracking in the UK, but its chair, Lord Deben, has also stated that his committee would not hesitate to ban fracking if the UK was unable to meet its climate change commitments.  So imagine a scenario in 2030, whereby several US or European-based companies are extracting shale gas and/or shale oil in the UK and Lord Deben’s committee announced that further extraction was incompatible with the Climate Change Act, which requires an 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. I have no doubt that those companies would sue the government under the terms of TTIP, and the result would either be massive compensation or repeal of the Climate Change Act. It needs to be remembered that the World Trade Organisation has the power to impose punitive fines on governments as well as other public institutions. In contrast, all the climate change agreements reached post-Paris are voluntary and there is no equivalent body to enforce environmental standards. Disputes will be held in secret without any environmental representation, so the planet will lose out every time.  Dr Robin Russell-JonesStoke PogesBucks  Contrary to your article, there is little prospect that European trade unions will support the proposed deal. The GMB’s motion to oppose the TTIP was unanimously approved at the 2014 TUC Congress and the majority of national trade union federations in ETUC, the European-wide body, are also against it. The reason for our implacable opposition to the TTIP and other similar trade agreements is that they are not really about trade at all, but, rather, a transfer of power and sovereignty from EU member states to unaccountable transnational corporations in whose interests these deals are made. The figures quoted by your correspondent and used by the European Commission to justify the introduction of the TTIP have long since been discredited as little more than wishful thinking. The commission has since admitted that, in all probability, there would be thousands of job losses as a result of corporate restructuring. It is simply not true that trade negotiators have “excluded provisions that would have allowed firms to sue governments for the loss of health and public service contracts”. Responding to public pressure, the commission ran a consultation exercise on the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement and received more than 150,000 replies, the vast majority opposing it, but, like its American counterparts, is still refusing to rule it out, thus also guaranteeing the opposition of unions grouped in the American TUC equivalent, the AFL-CIO.Bert SchouwenburgInternational officerGMBLondon NW1  In their recent book, called TTIP, Ferdi De Ville and Gabriel Siles-Brugge supply further possible answers to the question: why TTIP? Their research shows that the exaggerated claims about growth and jobs are based on economic models that are no more than “an exercise in managing fictional expectations” and are politically motivated. The motivation is primarily driven by US and EU fear of losing the dominant position in global power, in the face of competition from China and the other emerging economies. You might say it is the failing neoliberal experiment’s last desperate throw. There is one further fact that sheds some light on the corporate role in the negotiations. Of all the meetings held with the EU trade commissioners, 92% were with corporate lobbyists, leaving just 8% for small businesses, trade unions, NGOs and citizens. John Airs Liverpool"
"Barack Obama will look back on 2015 as a banner year for climate change in his final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening. But 2016 will see the president back in the trenches, fending off law suits and Republican attacks that could undo his climate plan, and scrambling to get to key items on his to-do list before exiting the White House. In a sign of the battles yet to come, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said he had invited as his guest a Kentucky coalminer who lost his job when his mine shut down, a gesture intended as a rebuke to Obama. Administration officials and campaign groups said Obama is unlikely to let up in his final year in the White House: pursuing new rules to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas industry and pressing Congress to increase funding to communities hit hard by flooding, drought and other extreme weather events fuelled by climate change. 2015 was Obama’s biggest year for climate change with the finalisation of the clean power plant rules, rejection of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, ban on Arctic drilling and, in December, the forging of an historic global agreement in Paris to limit warming below 2C – all of which are expected to get a mention in Obama’s speech. “Under President Obama’s leadership, the United States has done more to combat climate change than ever before,” the White House said in a fact sheet prepared for the address.  Administration officials said Obama planned to keep up the pace in the remaining months of his term. “2016 is not going to be a year we slow down. It’s a year we build on the momentum of the historic year that passed,” Gina McCarthy, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, told the Council on Foreign Relations last week.  Officials said Obama will take centre stage in a signing ceremony for the Paris global warming agreement at the United Nations in April.  “You can be sure that the United States will be doing what ever we can to get a lot of momentum into early entry into force of this agreement,” Paul Bodnar, senior energy and climate director at the National Security Council, said. But the president will be racing to the finish line to roll out the remaining items on his climate agenda – which are critical to delivering on the emissions goals he promised in Paris. In the weeks ahead, Obama is expected to roll out long-awaited rules to cut methane emissions from oil and gas wells and landfills, a rising source of climate pollution. The White House has spent the last six months on a final review of proposed new rules cutting methane, more than 80 times as warming as carbon dioxide in the 20-year timeframe. The administration is also expected to tighten curbs on heavy vehicle emissions. Analysts said that Obama will need to double down to meet the target of cutting emissions 17% on 2005 levels by 2020 set at the start of his presidency in 2009, and even more ambitious goal of 26%-28% cut in emissions by 2025 pledged under the Paris climate agreement. Some of those targets were based on assumptions that have not materialised - such as rapid growth of hybrid and electric vehicles. In 2011, Obama set a goal of 1m electric cars by 2015, but record low oil prices have sent consumers back to pick-up trucks and SUVs. The administration said it can find other areas to cut. White House officials told a seminar at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies last week that they hoped to amend the Montreal protocol ozone treaty this year to ban hydrofluorocarbons, which are used in air conditioning and are 10,000 more warming than carbon dioxide. The EPA estimates a ban could shave off 0.5C of warming. Obama was also counting on an international aviation agreement to help pare emissions.  But Obama’s main focus will be ensuring that the rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants – the biggest single US climate pledge - survive a legal and political onslaught. McCarthy told an event at the council on Foreign Relations last week the administration wanted to do all it could to ensure the power plant rules remain “cast in stone”. She said the administration would spend its remaining months implementing the clean power plant rules, and defending the regulations from legal challenges. The speech promises Obama one of the last big moments to elevate the climate cause. In his 2015 state of the union address, the president said: “No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.” Obama is unlikely to ease up on climate now.  "
"Home to more than half of the planet’s 7 billion people and a large portion of its 1.2bn cars, cities face a huge challenge as the world strives to meet the Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Cutting emissions in cities is critical: they make up only 2% of the world’s total land area, but produce up to 70% of its climate emissions from human activity, according to a 2011 United Nations report. As they work to reduce emissions, governments and public agencies – which often lack the resources to tackle the weighty global warming problem alone – are increasingly looking to the private sector for help, says Robert Puentes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program thinktank.   “Tackling climate change – particularly from a transportation perspective – will require these kinds of partnerships largely because traditional governments and public agencies are underperforming,” Puentes said. “The public sector often does not have the capacity or expertise to design, finance, execute and sustain policies that work, so these partnerships are helping fill the vacuum with a new kind of problem solving.” In one of the most recent examples, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, a consortium of the world’s largest cities, has enlisted an unusual partner to help reduce tailpipe emissions: MasterCard. It’s one of the largest public-private partnerships aimed at fighting climate change so far. The consortium – which includes more than 80 cities around the world, including London, Bangkok, Cape Town, New York and San Francisco – says its members collectively emit over 300m tons of carbon dioxide per year from transportation alone, or close to Poland’s total emissions from fossil fuels. The partnership, announced last month, will set up what’s called a mobility management network, which will connect city staff members to each other and to experts to come up with ideas to nudge people to use public transportation more often.  “These types of measures are all relatively low-cost, compared to investing in a new transport infrastructure, and are therefore of interest to a number of cities,” says Gunjan Parik, director of C40’s Transportation Initiative. “They also allow money to flow back into city coffers to deliver further improvements to public transit.” Through face-to-face workshops and other events, as well as virtually through webinars, phone calls and a private online forum, cities and transportation experts will have ample opportunities to share their knowledge and brainstorm for answers on topics including parking, ticketing, congestion and integrating different modes of transportation. MasterCard is working with cities to enable commuters to pay for bus and subway fares more easily, instead of needing to buy tickets in a separate step or having to carry cash or exact change. In London, for example, the company has helped create a system in which riders can use contactless bank cards or mobile phones to pay for fares.  “Around 85% of the world’s transactions are still done in cash, which not only weighs as an inconvenience and a cost on our economies, but also facilitates crime,” says Hany Fam, president of MasterCard Enterprise Partnerships. A study by Tuft University found that using cash costs American society about $200bn per year, from fees paid for using ATMs to lost tax revenues from unreported transactions.  C40 officials said their approach to solving transportation problems has achieved success in other initiatives. San Francisco created SFpark programme, which adjusts meter and garage pricing according to demand, helps drivers find available parking spaces quickly and reduces air pollution and congestion in the process. Milan’s Area C programme, which requires each vehicle that enters the city center on weekdays to pay a roughly €5 ($5.46) congestion charge, reduced the number of cars entering the restricted area by nearly one third this year compared to 2011, before the program was launched. According to Fam, the success of the initiative with MasterCard will be measured over the next three years by looking at the number of lessons shared and adopted between cities and assessing how much these sustainable transportation projects contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions in cities.  “The biggest thing we can do to truly make a difference in terms of emissions is to get people out of single occupancy vehicles and using whatever combination of bike sharing, walking, shuttles and so on,” said Sharon Feigon, executive director of the Shared Use Mobility Center, a national, public interest organization which advocates for car- and bike-sharing. “All of these modes together are enormously more efficient than the private automobile.” While new payment systems can greatly improve the public transportation system, they alone aren’t enough to nudge people to forego driving or owning cars. Finding the right strategies to encourage people to take buses and trains is a big challenge. It remains to be seen whether simpler payments and better communication will make a significant difference. “Information and technology transfer is very important in the adoption of shared mobility concepts,” said Susan Shaheen, adjunct professor and co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley.  “It’s going to take many different strategies to accomplish these goals, and we need a vast set of transportation options.”"
"2015 has been a big year for climate change. The year has witnessed dizzying highs and stunning lows, from the hottest January on record, to March, when global carbon dioxide levels hit a million-year high, to December, when nearly 200 nations signed an agreement to minimize global warming. Here are seven stories that give a good snapshot of the political, economic and scientific milestones that changed the way we view – and the way we deal with – global warming.  The United Nations Environment Programme has said that carbon emissions must be zero by 2070 to avert climate disasters. In December, after two decades of fraught climate talks, representatives from nearly 200 nations reached a historic milestone on the way to that goal.  The Paris agreement, which signals a shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, will hold governments accountable for hitting their greenhouse gas emissions targets. It has been lauded for its long term goal to achieve net-zero emissions in the second half of the century, and political leaders hailed the deal as a “major leap for mankind”. Pope Francis delivered a bracing speech on climate change during a White House speech in September, calling it “a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation”.  The speech followed Praise Be to You, a 184-page encyclical that the Pope released in June, in which he urged rich nations to take the lead in fighting climate change. It describes climate change as a “global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods”. The Pope’s words appear to have already swayed some of the millions of Americans who are still skeptical about the impact of climate change. A recent study found that, in the past six months, a growing number of Americans – especially American Catholics – have come to believe that climate change is happening and are worried about its effects.  Barack Obama rejected the Keystone XL oil pipeline after a seven-year review, saying its construction would have undermined America’s position as a global leader in fighting against climate change. The 1,1179–mile pipeline would have carried crude oil from tar sands in Canada to the Gulf Coast. Obama is the first world leader to reject an infrastructure project because of climate change.  “America is now a global leader when it comes to taking serious action to fight climate change,” Obama said. “And, frankly, approving this project would have undercut that global leadership.” Each month of 2015 has so far been the hottest on record, putting this year on track to be the warmest since records first started being gathered, 130 years ago. Scientists have pointed out that the three warmest years – 2015, 2014 and 2010 – in recorded history have all occurred in this century. This, they say, demonstrates that global warming is getting worse and that actions need to be taken. In the first ruling of its kind, the Hague has ordered the Dutch government to cut its carbon emissions by 25% within the next five years. The landmark decision came after 886 Dutch citizens sued the government for not taking enough action to reduce emissions.  Lawyers say that the ruling could have ripple effects around the world. Citizens in Belgium are already preparing a similar case, and another suit may follow in Norway. James Thornton, chief executive of environmental law organization ClientEarth, told the Guardian that: “A major sophisticated European court has broken through a political and psychological threshold. For the first time a court has ordered the government to protect its citizens from climate change.” Concentrations of carbon dioxide hit a new global average record in March, reaching levels unseen for over 1m years. UN experts said the Earth’s climate would enter a “new permanent reality” next year as a result, and that its denizens will likely experience hotter temperatures, extreme weather events like droughts and floods, and rising sea levels and acidity in the oceans. The finding underscored the urgent need for leaders at the Paris climate talks to reach a global agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  In this Guardian interactive feature, reporter John Vidal traveled down Southeast Asia’s Mekong river, meeting the people who depend on the 2,500-mile river for their livelihoods and struggle to deal with the effects of climate change. The piece puts a face to alarming statistics and demonstrates that climate change isn’t something that will emerge in the future – it’s already happening. "
"The government has failed to meet its own targets for cutting the environmental impact of the state’s operations, according to a Defra report quietly published last month. The “greening government commitments”, which began when David Cameron declared he would lead the “greenest government ever” in 2010, were intended to deliver big cuts in carbon emissions, domestic flights, waste and water usage.   Efforts fell short on all counts, though the reductions that were achieved still saved taxpayers £185m in the last year. Ministers have been heavily criticised for cuts to a swath of green policies, including renewable energy and energy efficiency, and a leaked letter in November revealed the government is not on track the meet the nation’s EU obligation for green energy in 2020. “Ministers’ failure to hit almost all of these targets means a bigger bill for taxpayers and more damage to the environment,” said Lisa Nandy, Labour’s shadow energy and climate secretary. “If the government can’t even cut its own pollution footprint, how can anyone have confidence they will cut Britain’s?” “The government has still managed to save £185m in energy, waste and water costs, showing that environmental protection makes economic sense too,” said Craig Bennett, head of Friends of the Earth. “The government must end its relentless attacks on green issues and make the reduction of the nation’s environmental footprint a top priority.” Ministers had targeted a 25% cut in carbon emissions from government buildings and travel in 2014-15, compared to 2009-10, but achieved 22%. The failure was largely due to the Ministry of Defence, which accounts for half of all government emissions and cut its emissions by 19%. Emission cuts came largely from improved energy efficiency and accounted for 90% of the money saved. But the government recently cut plans to improve energy efficiency in people’s homes by 80%. George Osborne’s Treasury, often blamed for the government’s anti-green moves, cut its own emissions by 56%, one of the largest savings. More than 169,000 domestic flights were taken by government officials in 2014-15, unchanged from the year before. This represents an 18% cut compared to 2009-10, but falls short of the 20% target. Just eight of 22 departments met the target, while domestic flights by environment department staff actually increased and those from the culture department more than doubled. Health department flights plummeted, however, by 62%. Waste reductions also failed to improve last year, with the overall cut at 22% compared to the 25% target. The Department of Energy and Climate Change’s waste went up by 18%, while that at the Department for Education fell by 62%. On water use, just six departments managed to meet the good practice benchmark set as a target and 12 of the 22 departments met a target on transparency on the steps they were taking to be greener. But the government slashed its paper use by 38% overall, far above the 10% target. “While the headline achievements may fall slightly short of the targets set for 2014-15, the picture at department level shows that many departments are meeting and exceeding targets, while others are recording valiant reductions in face of significant operational challenges,” said ministers Oliver Letwin and Rory Stewart in a foreword to the report. A spokesman for the environment department said: “Following this success we are developing a new set of greening government commitments to see how we can go further, making the UK even greener.” But Bennett criticised the government for missing its targets. “This says everything about the incompetence of this government when it comes to protecting the environment,” he said. “For months ministers have been systematically undermining national efforts to tackle climate change, and now we learn that they’ve failed to meet a whole range of green targets for their own performance too.”"
"It’s not been the ending to Christmas most would have wished for. As northern England recovers from the devastating effects of Storm Eva (perhaps mopping sodden houses for the second or third time in a month) the weather seems the only topic of conversation. But it is not just the UK experiencing remarkable weather. From unseasonably warm temperatures across Europe and the eastern US, to highly unusual tornadoes ripping across the central US, wildfires and fierce summer heat in Australia and extreme flooding in South America, the world’s weather is very much out of kilter. Many are pointing the finger at the strong El Niño conditions in the Pacific Ocean, but that weather system can’t explain it all.  Here in the UK our unusual weather may be more directly linked to the “north Atlantic cool blob” – an abnormally cold patch that started to develop in 2013 and is thought to have been caused by melting of the Greenland ice sheet. This, along with warmer air temperatures in the Arctic, has altered the jet stream, making it more “wavy” in autumn and winter, and more prone to getting stuck in one position. This time the north of England was in the crosshairs, with storm after storm being fired along the same jet stream track. Unfortunately this is something we will have to get used to. “Ocean temperature anomalies tend to persist for months to years, so it would not surprise me to see the UK dealing with generally stormy conditions for a few years,” says Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at Rutgers University, in the US."

"Protesters standing in floodwaters hold a sign that reads: “Can we talk about climate change now?” Scant media coverage of the link between increasing weather extremes and a warming world suggests it’s a conversation still seriously waiting to begin.  Several voices were quick however to exploit underspending on flood defences to attack overseas aid commitments. Ironically, estimates of £5-£6bn flood damage costs are more than covered by UK subsidies to fossil fuels – providing a more obvious candidate to switch resources.  Problematically, many clung to the idea that extreme events would trigger a change of mind on climate change. Yet policy seems untouched. Unrelenting, bleak and disconnected is no way to start a new year. But what if there was a seasonal subject that could tell the climate story, explain how we might change and adapt and, at least if you live in the UK, provide a little pleasure too?  Don’t put your glasses raised to new year down yet, the day of the champagne environmentalist may have arrived, in a good way. The world of wine, and especially the sparkling kind, can seem frivolous. But shifting patterns of global production are becoming a bellwether for climate change. Rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns pose particular problems to an industry which is so sensitive to weather that even mild seasonal variations can be tasted in every glass of the final product. Some grapes, like pinot noir, prosper only in a temperature range of 14C-16C. Increasing extreme weather events like the damaging European heatwave of 2003, revealed an acute vulnerability, for example, of traditional champagne-growing areas. Winemaking literally dried up. Last summer saw fears of a repeat. Wine reveals how a warming world challenges us to find new, more benign production methods and also to rethink our consumption habits. The UK’s changing climate, with warmer summers and milder winters, has presided over a boom in the production of high-quality sparkling wines and a flourishing of small-scale producers, especially in the southwest, a part of the country hit badly by floods in 2014. Breaky Bottom vineyard is one example, operating since 1974 at the end of a rough farm track near the town of Lewes and charming wine critics. That counts as well-established compared to its near neighbour the Bluebell vineyard which only began production in 2007 and started winning awards by 2011.  Though still modest internationally, they are part of a surge of production which has seen the area under production in England double in seven years. A good year in 2014 saw the equivalent of 6.3m bottles produced, nearly 50% more than the previous year, and exports to 14 countries. The high-quality, but small scale, non-industrial operation typical of wine making in the UK provides a lesson in sustainability according to Julia Stafford, founder of the Wine Pantry, a business set up to sell exclusively English wine. With a background in shipping, she saw the problems of industrial-scale production which is obsessed with cheapness, and the potential for a different approach in the emerging English market. “People laughed at first. But long summers are good for us. We don’t have the problem of extreme heat. It’s a young industry in the UK, with small areas and experimental,” explains Stafford. At Sharpham in Devon, award-winning wines are grown by the River Dart near Totnes. A study on whether the town could feed itself found that even with its current small-scale, high-quality production, the Sharpham vineyard produced enough to provide a bottle of wine each month to every one of the area’s 22,000 inhabitants.  Internationally, says Stafford, “You have all this wine mass produced, an energy intensive industry. But here we tend to do hand picking, and use sheep and cows to graze instead of using herbicides. It’s a lighter footprint.” To get a more sustainable wine industry, she says: “Have one good bottle (that might be more expensive), not two (cheap) bad bottles.” The UK has, for the moment, won the climate lottery for producing some wines. But success could be short-lived. As temperatures continue to rise, one projection suggests that by 2080 the south-west will only be good for growing raisins. In the US, the wine industry already faces major challenges. California, for example has been hit by both protracted drought and extremes of rainfall. After a period of denial, growers there say climate change is becoming too obvious to ignore. “I think that as human beings, until we experience something like real pain, we can generally find a way to rationalise things and pretty much defer tough decisions,” says Randall Grahm of the Bonny Doon Vineyard, a wine maker near Santa Cruz, celebrated for championing terroir and biodynamic growing techniques. “But, wells are running dry. The 2015 vintage is possibly the earliest harvest on record in California, and wild-fire flames are licking at the edge of Napa Valley.” Rising temperatures are changing the characteristics of the grapes and the wine they produce, he says, and not in a good way. Alcohol content is going up and natural acidities are declining, eroding the wines’ finesse and elegance. In response, makers are trying to find new grape varieties or rootstocks, avoid local regulatory obstacles to planting new vineyards, and respond creatively to climate change. “We are trying to plant a new vineyard in San Juan Bautista in such a way that will allow, at least for the red grapes, the possibility of dry-farming,” says Grahm, “We’re using more drought-tolerant rootstocks, wider plant spacing, smaller, head-trained vines, and most significantly, using biochar as a means of enhancing the water-holding capacity of the soil.” Their ploughing technique is designed to avoid rain draining away. As well as adapting to climate change, Grahm is pioneering techniques to reduce the industry’s impact by reducing its more energy intensive infrastructure. He opts for a lower-impact plantation, progressively eschewing wires, end-posts, stakes, irrigation, in favour of a mixed plantation, ecological balance that might make spraying unnecessary and the use of biochar mixed with compost as a way to sequestering carbon in the soil.  If you want to explain something, they say you should talk to people about what they care about.  As public spending cuts were voted through in the last UK Coalition government, annual spending on champagne rose in the bars of Westminster to £35,000. Wine could be the ultimately safe subject to communicate climate change where even great deluges fail.  As some in the industry point to ways in which we can both adapt to and minimise warming, in the UK at least you can become a “champagne environmentalist” without it necessarily being an insult, as long as you don’t drink too much."
"Overstated profits, secretive lobbying, the dirty side of industries laid bare – 2015 saw yet another clutch of corporate scandals. Sustainability and corporate responsibility may have become watchwords for global companies, but this doesn’t seem to have stemmed the bad behaviour of some businesses.  Here we round up some of the most significant corporate scandals of the year.  Volkswagen may well have won the prize for corporate villain of the year in 2015 following revelations that the German car manufacturer had installed software designed to cheat nitrous oxide (NOx) emissions tests in up to 11m of its diesel cars. The scandal widened in November when it emerged the company may also have been reporting its CO2 emissions incorrectly. As is so often the case with corporate scandals, establishing responsibility proves a slippery task. Then-CEO Martin Winterkorn took five days to resign, accepting responsibility only with the caveat “I am not aware of any wrongdoing on my part”. Under the new leadership of Matthias Müller, VW says it has made progress in its search to understand what went on. A “chain of errors” is the unsatisfying conclusion so far, with blame pinned on weak processes, “misconduct and shortcomings”, and some overly-tolerant “mindsets”.  VW’s dodgy emissions tests speak to a broader problem of people’s trust in businesses. When businesses abuse their position and indulge in dangerous greenwashing they undermine any company’s attempts to advocate for climate change action and responsible business. Consistently pitching itself as a champion of corporate responsibility, VW topped the Dow Jones Sustainability Index as the most sustainable car maker just before the scandal broke, with Winterkorn saying “the Volkswagen Group is well on the way to establishing itself long term as the world’s most sustainable automaker”. It now faces multiple investigations, including from the European parliament, and potentially tens of billions of euros in fines. If VW was villain of the year, some are suggesting that oil and gas behemoth ExxonMobil is the villain of our lifetime. An Inside Climate News investigation in September into internal Exxon documents revealed that the company’s own research had warned of the dangers of man-made climate change as early as 1981. Rather than start a debate about how to transition to a low carbon economy, the company chose instead to plough more than $30m (£20.3m) into climate denial, according to Greenpeace figures. For a long time it ran a campaign of misinformation, insisting that climate science remained uncertain, and even now it dismisses the possibility of a low-carbon future any time soon. The scandal is so significant because it is now clear that the richest company in America’s history had a choice. It could have engaged with its own research, opened up a public debate about the implications of climate change and looked at how to adapt its business model to meet the oncoming crisis. Or, as it chose to do, it could bury its head in the sand, invest in denial, minimise the potential of renewables and claim the future lies in oil and gas.  According to Bill McKibben: “Businesses misbehave all the time, but VW is the flea to Exxon’s elephant. No corporation has ever done anything this big and this bad.” In a year that saw the Paris climate talks and negotiations on two global trade agreements – the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TTP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) – it’s perhaps not surprising that climate lobbying was such a big feature of 2015. According to data from the environmental non-profit CDP, 77% of the largest 500 companies in the world say they use trade associations to lobby on climate policy.  A Policy Studies Institute (PSI) investigation in March found that multinational companies eager to tout their sustainability credentials were also members of influential trade associations lobbying against EU climate policy. PSI looked at groups such as BusinessEurope, which has argued climate policies will undermine competitiveness, and the European Chemical Council, which argued that strengthening the EU Emissions Trading System would lead to businesses moving overseas for lower energy costs. Armed with this research, NGO ShareAction launched its “clean words, dirty lobby” campaign aiming to force companies to stand up to their rhetoric on climate change and stop funding trade associations working to weaken climate policy. In September, ShareAction organised a group of 25 investors with more than €61bn (£45bn) in assets to write to multinationals including BP, Glencore and Proctor & Gamble asking them to justify their membership of big EU trade associations. There is movement from companies. Shell announced in August that it was cutting ties with the rightwing American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) because of its denial of climate change and last year Unilever split from BusinessEurope, reportedly for similar reasons.  Multinational companies have enormous power and influence and will have a key role in shaping climate policy. While many made bold pledges in 2015 in the run up to the Paris talks (Ikea, for example, promised €1bn to fight climate change), the continued existence of cosy, secretive lobbying threatens to undermine action we need to avoid catastrophic climate change. Brazil’s government called it the “worst environmental disaster in Brazil’s history”. In November, a tailings dam in the Brazilian mining state of Minas Gerais burst causing a huge and devastating mudflow. The 60m cubic meters of mine waste (equivalent to 25,000 Olympic swimming pools) killed at least 13 people and left hundreds homeless as it swept through villages and polluted the 800km River Doce, depriving local people of their water source and killing thousands of fish. The dam belonged to Samarco, a joint venture between mining giants Vale and BHP Billiton. All three companies, along with the Brazilian government, have been slammed by the UN for their “insufficient” response to the crisis. Vale, the world’s biggest iron ore specialist, has tried to wriggle out of liability by arguing Samarco is an independent company and wholly responsible for the tragedy. A federal judge has disagreed, freezing the assets of BHP Billiton and Vale after finding that Samarco would not have the funds to pay for the scale of the damage caused by the dam. The ruling found that both companies could be held responsible for the dam collapse, for which the government is demanding at least 20bn reals (£3.5bn). Both companies can appeal. As the country begins to collect itself after the tragedy, the spotlight has fallen on the Brazilian authorities, with allegations of lax safety regulations for the mining industry. The state of Minas Gerais has suffered five dam breaks in the last ten years, yet the pace of change is slow; a new mining code has been working it way through Congress for years.  Japanese computers-to-nuclear company Toshiba came undone in July 2015 after it was revealed to have inflated net profits by £780m over several years.  A report filed to the Tokyo Stock Exchange by the company spoke of a broken corporate culture: “Within Toshiba, there was a corporate culture in which one could not go against the wishes of superiors”. According to regulators, the company set unrealistic targets and employees were discouraged from questioning the actions of their bosses. Independent investigators found that both the president and chief executive of the 140-year old company were aware of the overstatement.  Financial regulators have recommended fines of £40m for Toshiba. The company’s share price has slumped by 40% since the beginning of 2015 and it’s laying off nearly 7,000 consumer electronics jobs as part of a post-scandal restructuring process.  For many the Toshiba scandal is reminiscent of the fall from grace of another of Japan’s huge corporations, Olympus. In 2011 the company was revealed to have hidden $1.7bn of losses over 13 years. The Japanese government is under fire for not doing more to prevent corporate wrongdoing. Japan’s prime minister Shinzo Abe has championed corporate responsibility as part of his growth strategy and the Toshiba scandal hit just weeks after the unveiling of a new corporate governance code in Japan, intended to instil a new culture of openness between shareholders and companies. There is clearly much more work to be done to achieve corporate transparency. Toshiba was a company lauded for its corporate governance structures yet these could not stand up to a culture of secrecy, a failure to properly monitor and a relentless quest for profits."
"Leonardo DiCaprio has launched a ferocious attack on the greed of the world’s energy industry at the World Economic Forum in Davos. DiCaprio used an awards ceremony to demand more action on climate change, decrying those who deny it is a problem. And he insisted fossil fuels must be kept in the ground – backing a campaign launched by the Guardian last year. After picking up a crystal award for his work on environmentalism, the actor explained he had seen the devastation caused by climate change firsthand, from melting glaciers in the Arctic to farmers whose crops had been washed away. DiCaprio is tipped for Oscar success this year for his role in the bleak and gritty drama The Revenant. And he gave energy bosses a similar savaging. In front of world leaders, business chiefs and campaigners, DiCaprio said: We simply cannot afford to allow the corporate greed of the coal, oil and gas industries to determine the future of humanity. Those entities with a financial interest in preserving this destructive system have denied, and even covered up the evidence of our changing climate. Enough is enough. You know better. The world knows better. History will place the blame for this devastation squarely at their feet.” The solution to limiting global warming, he added, is to leave oil, gas and coal reserves alone: Our planet cannot be saved unless we leave fossil fuels in the ground where they belong. Twenty years ago, we described this problem as an addiction. Today, we possess the means to end this reliance.” DiCaprio also announced that his foundation was making $15m of fresh grants to support environmental protection. That includes funding to protect 6.5 million acres of rainforest on Sumatra from the “invasive and destructive practices” of the palm oil industry. DiCaprio was one of four winners of a Crystal award at WEF this year. The fund also recognised Chinese actor Yao Chen for her work raising public awareness of the refugee, artist Olafur Eliasson, and musician will.i.am for his i.am angel Foundation, which tries to keep young underprivileged young people in education, and out of trouble. Accepting his award, will.i.am joked he had grown up near gangs, but had kept out of them as he was more scared of his mother than the gang leaders. His dream is that a child in one of America’s poorest regions could become the next tech pioneer."
"Satellites don’t measure the Earth’s temperature. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and his fellow climate contrarians love the satellite data, but as Carl Mears of the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) satellite dataset and Ben Santer recently wrote,  they are not thermometers in space. The satellite [temperature] data ... were obtained from so-called Microwave Sounding Units (MSUs), which measure the microwave emissions of oxygen molecules from broad atmospheric layers. Converting this information to estimates of temperature trends has substantial uncertainties.  Scientists process the raw microwave data, applying a model to make numerous adjustments in order to come up with a synthetic estimate of the atmospheric temperature. Climate scientists have identified many errors in the model, and so it’s undergone several major revisions. It’s a complicated process for many reasons discussed in greater detail in this new Skeptical Science myth rebuttal, and by Mears and Santer.  For example, satellites have a limited lifetime and are replaced (so far there have been 10 different satellites with MSUs); the MSU instruments change - they now use advanced MSUs (AMSUs); their orbits drift and decay due to friction; clouds get in the way; they have to isolate the data from the different layers of the atmosphere, etc. In a recent Senate hearing, Ted Cruz and one of his witnesses, Judith Curry, claimed “the satellite data are the best data we have.” Most experts disagree. At first blush the claim sounds plausible. After all, satellites are high tech! But how do we decide which data are “the best”? That’s a subjective question, but we can apply some objective criteria to answer it. For example, as humans, we might consider the temperature where we live (at the Earth’s surface) the most important. Satellites estimate the temperature of the atmosphere, most of which is above us. In fact, as John Christy, who runs the University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH) satellite dataset recently said,  the main product we use now for greenhouse model validation is the temperature of the Mid-Troposphere The mid-troposphere is the atmospheric layer from about 25,000–50,000 feet, or about 8–15km in altitude. For perspective, the highest point on the Earth’s surface is on Mount Everest at 29,000 feet (8.8km), and the highest elevation city in the world is La Rinconada, Peru at 16,700 feet (5.1km). So, by this criterion, surface temperature data would be “the best;” better than satellite data because they’re more relevant to people. Maybe we value the data with the least uncertainty. Because of all the processing, adjustments, and modeling involved in creating the synthetic temperature data, satellite trends have far greater uncertainty than the surface temperature datasets. By this criterion, surface temperature data would again be “the best;” about five times better than satellite data. Or perhaps we think it’s important that different groups processing the same raw data in different ways arrive at consistent final temperature estimates. This is true for surface temperature data, which are analyzed by NASA, NOAA, the Met Office, Berkeley Earth, Cowtan & Way, the Japan Meteorological Agency, and others. These groups all arrive at consistent end results. On the other hand, different groups processing the same raw satellite data arrive at very different estimates of the warming trend in the atmosphere. By this criterion, again, surface temperatures beat satellites. As Carl Mears has said, I consider [surface temperature datasets] to be more reliable than satellite datasets (they certainly agree with each other better than the various satellite datasets do!).  Maybe we consider it important to measure how much humans are warming the entire planet. Only about 2% of the heat trapped by increased greenhouse effect goes into warming the atmosphere; over 90% goes into warming the oceans. By that criterion, ocean heat content data would be “the best;” far better than satellite data. One benefit noted by proponents of the satellite data is that it’s validated by weather balloons directly measuring the temperature of the atmosphere. The problem is, the weather balloons indicate that the lower atmosphere has continued to warm in recent years, diverging from the satellite synthetic temperature estimates. That’s not much of an argument in favor of the satellite data.  In fact, the weather balloon data debunks the “no significant warming since 1998” myth that motivates contrarians like Cruz to cherry pick the satellite data in the first place. It’s also worth noting this myth is based on über cherry picking. So, the surface temperature data are “best” if you value the least uncertain temperature measurements, of the part of the planet where people live, with consistent results among different groups. The ocean heat data content are “best” if you want the most comprehensive measurement of the warming of the Earth. The satellite data are best … if you want the data that show the least warming. As Carl Mears notes starting at the 7:35 mark in the above video,  Look at all the different datasets. You don’t want to trust only the satellite temperatures, you want to look at the surface temperatures and that sort of thing. Every other data source paints a consistent picture of global warming – surface thermometers, weather balloons, ocean buoys, and even natural thermometers like rising sea levels, melting land and sea ice, and shifting seasons and species habitats. Even the satellites show a long-term warming trend in the atmosphere. There is a great irony here. Climate contrarians decry necessary adjustments to raw surface temperature data (even though the adjustments reduce the warming trend), and have even launched inquiries, accusing scientists of conspiring to manipulate the surface temperature data. Yet they have no qualms with the more numerous and complex adjustments made the satellite data. Contrarians claim that models are worthless, and yet unwaveringly trust the models used to turn microwave detections into synthetic temperature estimates.  There’s excessive “skepticism” applied to the surface temperature data and a serious lack of skepticism of the satellite data. There’s a term that describes this behavior: ‘confirmation bias.’ The data that conflict with contrarian worldviews are rejected, while those that conform to their preconceived biases are accepted.  In the end, Ted Cruz’s claim is rated false by every objective measure."
"There’s more to Ikea than its flatpack furnishings, something customers were reminded of not once but twice this year when the famous purveyor of the Billy bookcase announced it was adding veggie balls and certified seafood to its menus.  The Swedish retailer is considered a leader when it comes to sustainable business practices, and some are hailing these moves to its £1bn food business as game changing. The need to reduce people’s meat consumption (and help the public forget about the horsemeat scandal) is acute. The global livestock industry produces more greenhouse gas emissions than all cars, planes, trains and ships put together, yet a recent report from the Carbon Trust found that awareness of the environmental impacts of livestock production remains “surprisingly low”.  Environmental non-profit CDP points out that one of the key barriers to behaviour change is limited meat-free options from food manufacturers, retailers and restaurants. Ikea’s veggie balls could be a step in the right direction. For those keen to get a bit more adventurous, Brazil’s top chefs are embracing ants as a way to create protein-rich dishes that acknowledge Brazil’s native food culture. Yum. The eco-condom crowd was joined this year by Einhorn, a German company whose products are hard to miss, coming as they do in crisp packet-style bags stamped with a unicorn logo. The condoms are made from natural rubber produced in Malaysia and workers are paid a living wage. The company’s founders have also set up the Entrepreneur’s Pledge scheme, which encourages entrepreneurs and “kick ass CEOs” to fund at least one social business and give 50% of the profits to a good cause, as Einhorn does.  Their philosophy chimes with that of William MacAskill, an academic who made a name for himself in 2015 with the release of his book Doing Good Better: How Effective Altruism Can Help You Make a Difference. Like Waldemar Zeiler, Einhorn co-founder who believes that a social business can have more impact than charity giving, MacAskill made the case for “earning to give”, where at least some people should seek high earning jobs then commit to giving a significant portion of their earnings away. In 2014 we poured buckets of icy water over our heads in the name of charity, this year we’ve been naming and shaming celebs such as Kim and Kanye for wasting water. Go figure. Drought shaming isn’t new, but in 2015 took on a classist vibe as social media users sought out their next targets. Organisations and people under scrutiny included wealthy, pool-owning Beverly Hills residents and a Ritz hotel that was “water misting” its patrons. Opinions are divided about whether naming and shaming is an effective solution to California’s four year drought, with Jon Christensen, an environmental historian at the University of California, making the point that “when we are in crisis, everyone blames everyone else”. By November, however, Los Angeles city council seemed to be embracing the idea of more official drought shaming. There may still be stigma surrounding loneliness and mental health, but it is slowly being eroded, perhaps helped by the emergence of a host of positive, more solutions-driven stories. One that hit the headlines in 2015 is that of Ellie, the virtual interviewer that can detect depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. GP Ann Robinson describes how she works: “When you smile at Ellie, she compares your smile with a database of controls made up of civilians and military veterans. She measures your pauses ... People with depression tend not to pronounce their vowel sounds clearly because they don’t move their muscles of speech as much as those who aren’t depressed.” Elsewhere companies including Toyota and Honda are investing in robot carers for older people. A care home in Florence is pioneering the use of Robot-Era, a robot which helps with everything from daily cognitive stimulation activities and companionship to providing walking support for the home’s 20 elderly residents. Research published in April by Citizens UK found that some UK companies are paying workers so little that, in effect, taxpayers are topping up wages by £11bn a year in tax credits and extra benefits payments.  James Meadway, a senior economist at the New Economics Foundation, put this figure into context by pointing out that the total cost of benefit fraud in 2014 was £1bn. Taxpayers are therefore subsidising the likes of Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons (the four big supermarkets were costing £1bn in tax credits and extra benefits payments according to the Citizens UK study) enabling them to continue propping up a system of in-work poverty while reducing the amount of money available for public services. It’s not just the supermarkets. A Guardian investigation into sportswear chain Sports Direct came up with evidence that thousands of workers were effectively being paid below the national minimum wage. The company boss, Mike Ashley, has now committed to spending £10m on bringing up pay to above the minimum wage, although many say this won’t go far enough. Some now recognise the importance of paying a living wage, with Scottish firm Voca Telemarketing paying its 66 employees £8.25 an hour from 1 January 2016, up from £6.70. The “national living wage” is due to take effect from 1 April 2016 and will see the minimum hourly rate for workers aged 25 or older increase from £6.70 to £7.20, rising to £9 by 2020. "
"Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has been barred from giving evidence in the trial of 13 climate change protesters accused of blockading a Heathrow runway.  The group of Plane Stupid supporters are accused of cutting a hole in a fence and chaining themselves to railings on the north runway in July 2015.   Labour MP McDonnell was due to be called as a defence witness in the case but his evidence was deemed irrelevant by the judge. McDonnell, whose Hayes and Harlington constituency includes the UK’s largest airport, is strongly opposed to the proposed third runway at Heathrow.  District judge Deborah Wright said: “It (his witness statement) gives an opinion about the debate around the expansion of Heathrow and talks about the benefits of direct action, which he says may cause short term inconvenience.  “In order to allow his evidence to be given I have to be able to say that it is relevant. I am therefore not going to allow Mr McDonnell to give live evidence.”  The activists are on trial at Willesden Magistrates Court charged with aggravated trespass and entering a security restricted area of an aerodrome.  They admit being on the runway but claim their actions were necessary to stop people dying from the effects of pollution and climate change.  One of the campaigners, Kara Moses, an environmental journalist, said they were wearing nappies in case they needed to go to the toilet during the protest. She said the group planned to block the runway all day and stop “hundreds” of planes from taking off.  Wright asked: “If you thought you were going to be there all day, how were you going to address basic needs such as going to the toilet?”  There was laughter from some of the defendants in the dock as Moses replied: “We were wearing nappies, madam.”  The demonstration at around 3.30am on July 13 2015 caused delays for passengers around the world and 25 flights were cancelled. It came after a long-awaited report recommended a new runway should be built at Heathrow rather than Gatwick.  Another protester Edward Thacker, a community worker and teaching assistant, said it was a “social justice” issue and he felt “compelled” to blockade the runway. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, who joined protesters outside court on the first day of the trial, was a character witness for one of the defendants, Melanie Strickland. In a statement read to the court she said Strickland was a “passionate, committed and knowledgeable” advocate of human rights issues and has written to her a number of times about climate change.  Green party London mayoral candidate Sian Berry was also due to be a defence witness but her evidence was also ruled inadmissible.  It is alleged that on 13 July 2015 the defendants entered the northern runway at London Heathrow Airport, having trespassed on the land, and in relation to a lawful activity, namely the operations of landing and departing of aircraft which persons were engaged in on that land, did an act, namely erected a temporary structure and locked themselves to it, or within it, with the intent of disrupting that activity.  The second charge alleges that they entered a security restricted area of an aerodrome without permission.  The trial will resume at 10am on Monday when Wright is due to return verdicts in the case."

"David Cameron is to be questioned about his broken pledge to spend £1bn developing carbon capture technology when he appears before a Commons committee. Before his appearance before the liaison committee at 4pm on Tuesday, the prime minister was accused of double standards for abandoning a commitment to hold a competition to encourage the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS), which could lead to decarbonisation of coal and gas, at the same time as professing to be serious about tackling climate change. Just a year ago, Cameron had told the same group of MPs, made up of select committee chairs, that CCS was “absolutely crucial” for the UK, before funding for a £1bn trial was later scrapped. Angus MacNeil, the chair of the energy and climate change committee, and Huw Irranca-Davies, the chair of the environmental audit committee, plan to challenge Cameron about the government’s decision, arguing it undermines the commitment to tackling climate change. “The prime minister said that carbon capture and storage was crucial to meet our climate change targets,” MacNeil said. “Yet the government’s long-promised carbon capture competition has become the latest low-carbon policy to be chucked on the scrapheap. “The prime minister must acknowledge that building a new generation of gas plants means that we either have to fit power stations with carbon capture technology in the coming decade or potentially bust our carbon budgets.” The government has said the CCS development competition was always subject to affordability. Cameron is also likely to be questioned on issues such as the Syria crisis and flood protection."
"Climate change made the UK’s record December rainfall, which caused the devastating floods, 50-75% more likely, a preliminary scientific investigation has found. “Greenhouse gas emissions are loading the weather dice towards these warmer, wetter winters,” said Friederike Otto, scientific coordinator of the climateprediction.net project, which harnessed the collective power of roughly 70,000 home computers to run thousands of climate models extremely quickly.   The results, which were analysed at the University of Oxford and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, showed natural variation was equally influential in stocking the storms with rain and hurling them at northern Britain. “Chance still played a large role in December’s weather,” said Otto, pointing to an abnormally large difference in water temperature in the east and west Atlantic. She said the possible contribution of the massive Pacific El Niño was still uncertain. Throughout the last month of 2015, a succession of brutal storms - Desmond, Eva and Frank - struck the UK. Farmland and towns in Cumbria, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Scotland were submerged in deadly and heartbreaking floods. It was the wettest December since records began 105 years before. At the same time, the UK average temperature was 8C, 4.1C above normal. The previous warmest December was in 1934 and was 6C on average. Some of the rainfall can be explained by what is known as the thermodynamic effect. Warm air can carry more water, which means precipitation events become larger and more frequent in a warmed climate. But this had only increased the risk of such a wet December by around 7%. The study, which was released publicly before being submitted to a scientific journal, simulated a world in which the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had not occurred and found that in the real world Britain was 50-70% more likely to receive the catastrophic rainfall levels of last month.  Otto postulated that disturbances of atmospheric pressure systems, caused by warming, was responsible for much of the increased risk. But this analysis had not yet been conducted. The Met Office’s Peter Stott, who was not involved in the study, said it added further credence to the long-held prediction that climate change would bring wetter conditions to some parts of the globe and could be seen as broadly indicative of the role of climate change in the December floods. “That is robust,” he said. He said the use of home computers to simultaneously run thousands of experiments dramatically increased the turn around of research, but he cautioned they were not powerful enough to run the most up to date global climate models. “I think the uncertainty is potentially larger than the 50-75% [indicated in the study],” he said. “We are looking at very extreme parts of the calculations and it’s hard to be precise when we are talking about rare events like this.” Nick Reynard, lead natural hazard scientist at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said the picture was further complicated trying to link increased rainfall to flooding. He said rainfall was known to be generally increasing in the UK, but at the same time “there is little compelling evidence for any upward trend in long records of flood magnitude or frequency”. This counter-intuitive finding was due to the differing ways particular catchments respond to heavy rain; some are known to be highly resistant to large events. The links between extreme weather and climate change are now widely reported in academic papers. So perhaps more remarkable than the findings themselves, is the speed at which scientists are able to draw links between events. In the past, this work has taken months, even years. Thursday’s preliminary study has been released before the waters have even receded and is one of the fastest such analyses ever conducted. Scientists told the Age newspaper in Australia last year that they were trying to adapt their responses to events in order to fit with the media cycle. Stott said the inclination to release preliminary results was understandable.  “The media, and people generally, are asking these questions as the flooding is happening or in the immediate aftermath. But we shouldn’t forget that as we seek to have the right policies and advise government about how best to protect ourselves from flooding, for that we need a carefully considered scientific analysis. You’ve got to be careful of over-interpreting very rapid studies,” he said. Richard Black, the director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank said the emergence of attribution science - our ability to find the fingerprints of climate change in individual weather events - was “one of the most exciting developments in the climate change field”. “Only a few years ago scientists had to make do with saying things like ’this or that weather event is consistent with what we’d expect’ - but now, increasingly, it’s possible to determine whether climate change is increasing the risks of particular weather events, and by how much,” he said. “That in turn gives policymakers the economic rationale they need to justify emission reduction programmes, as well as increasing the chances of legal action in future if decision-makers don’t act on the science.”"
"The UK government’s decision to scrap support for carbon capture and storage jeopardises its entire climate policy. What is more, it thwarts Brussels’ strategy to develop the clean technology in Europe.  That was the message from industry experts to lawmakers at a parliamentary committee hearing in London on Wednesday. “There is a strategic risk for the UK in not developing capability in this area,” warned Luke Warren, head of the CCS Association. Reeling from the unexpected cancellation of a £1bn (US$1.4bn) competition in November’s spending review, he pleaded for coherent policy. That money had been destined to develop up to two projects at commercial scale. In the running were a coal-fired and a gas-fired plant, known as White Rose and Peterhead respectively. White Rose had also won €300m (US$330m) from the European commission’s NER300 programme, which has repeatedly tried to back CCS without success. That money will be returned to the pot now UK funding has collapsed, according to finance director Richard Simon-Lewis. While the demonstration projects were undeniably expensive, it was argued they were essential to bring costs down and meet climate goals in the long run. The UK has a legally binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions at least 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. Prime minister David Cameron previously described the technology as “absolutely crucial” to meet that target. Earlier this month, he defended the U-turn, saying: “The economics at the moment really aren’t working.” In a tight budget, CCS was judged to represent poor value compared to other infrastructure plans. “There seems to be a view in government that we can afford to wait and buy CCS from other countries,” said Chris Littlecott of thinktank E3G. “It misses the point completely, of CCS as strategic infrastructure.” The UK could buy in technology to capture CO2, he said, but the pipeline network to pump it under the North Sea required national planning. On top of the £1bn upfront cash, the axed projects were in line for power generation subsidies. Known as “contracts for difference”, these were set up to support a range of low carbon technologies, including nuclear and renewables. As a significant market intervention, it needed “state aid” approval from Brussels. This was duly awarded in 2014, on the basis that different technologies would be competing for cash, minimising market distortions. Since then, however, the Conservative government has barred onshore windfarms and solar power from the mix, on the grounds of consumer cost. Now CCS is also out of the picture, Littlecott told Climate Home “there are big questions” over the validity of that state aid clearance. Controversially, Hinkley Point new nuclear plant is still in line for 35 years of subsidy. French state-owned company EDF is expected to make a final investment decision next week, Reuters reports. Along with offshore wind, nuclear has enjoyed the most consistent support from Conservative ministers of any power source. Even so, the flagship atomic venture has been repeatedly delayed and is not certain to go ahead. Accused of double standards in parliament earlier this week, energy minister Andrea Leadsom pinned the blame for high consumer bills squarely on renewables. She said: “I find it extraordinary that Labour members seem to equate the deployment of renewables with decarbonisation. That is simply not the case. “They fail to recognise that fuel poverty and endless renewables subsidies go hand in hand.” The argument met with weary frustration from the renewables sector, which is facing job losses under the hostile policy shift. Maf Smith, deputy chief executive of industry group RenewableUK, said: “Onshore wind is now one of the cheapest of all sources of power, which means that not supporting wind means higher bills for consumers. “The government’s own advisors, the committee on climate change, says onshore wind is cost competitive with new gas and subsidy-free, and that offshore wind will become cheaper than gas during the next decade.”"
"2016 is promising to be a happy new year. The remarkable achievement of 196 nations signing up to the successor of the Kyoto protocol means the first ever year with a global agreement to end the old ways of pumping heat-trapping carbon pollution into our atmosphere and oceans. Now the hard and exciting work begins.  Transitioning the economy to ensure a pollution-free future throws up enormous opportunities. Commercialising new technologies, improving our productivity by wasting less energy, building mass-transit networks and providing farmers with new income streams from carbon markets are just a taste. Entrepreneurs can see these opportunities and are already working hard to make these prospects a reality. It became clear to me during the Paris climate talks that business, local governments and civil society are leading the transition and politicians are playing catch up. This century will belong to those nations whose political leaders display the courage and vision to transition to zero carbon economies. They will do this because they can see that far from simply posing a cost to their economy, it is a pathway to future prosperity. Political leaders will either deploy the policy settings that unleash these opportunities in the new economy, or they will do nothing for fear of upsetting the dominant industries of today. Doing nothing is always the easiest political option, but it means saying farewell to many of the brightest ideas, jobs and investment that will leave our shores to more supportive commercial environments. My home state of Victoria is a prime example of how if we choose to do nothing, we miss out on jobs and investment despite being perfectly placed to lead Australia’s transition to a clean economy. Right now, 85% of Victoria’s homes and businesses are powered by brown coal, the dirtiest form of energy on earth. These power stations are old (their average age is 42 years), inefficient and operating well past their expected life. They are the old polluting Datsun Sunny on a highway of 21st century electric cars. Victoria’s power stations are not just a drag on our environment, they are holding back jobs in the clean economy. For years governments have been told by the independent energy market experts that there is too much electricity in the system. Despite the assurances made when the Liberals and Labor joined together to slash the renewable energy target, clean energy construction is stagnant because the market is oversupplied with dirty power. Without a price on carbon pollution, brown coal will be the last to exit the market. Through a staged timeline for Hazelwood’s closure we could remove a massive 13% of the state’s total pollution in one hit. This effect would be to open up space for new clean energy construction while injecting the skills and training that the new economy brings to Victoria’s workforce. If we set down a pipeline of clean tech projects and a detailed transition plan for workers in the coal industry, then much of the hard work is done. The higher we set our clean energy and climate targets, the more investment and entrepreneurs we attract to help us reach them. It’s just another example of how the environment and the economy are moving in the same direction. The old false dichotomy of “jobs versus the environment” is well and truly redundant. Attending the climate negotiations in Paris allowed me the opportunity to witness first-hand how this economic shift is unstoppable. The number of people, institutions and investors is huge and growing so the only question left is whether Australia wants to ride this wave or whether we’ll watch from the carpark. There is a dawning realisation among Australians that responding to catastrophic global warming is no longer a brake on our economy. With the world acknowledging that there is no long-term future for coal and other fossil fuels a carefully planned transition that quarantines risk and protects workers will give us an unshakeable platform to build the jobs-rich clean economy that will define the 21st century. But we need to start now. As the nation ponders the new year, our political leaders are faced with a momentous choice. If we choose to keep the settings on auto pilot, as we did with last month’s mid-year budget, then Australia will find itself with a 19th century economy bumbling along in a 21st century world. Alternatively we can embrace the change and set Australia up for greater prosperity and wellbeing than ever before. "
"Are on-demand ride services like Uber and Lyft good or bad for the environment? It’s an increasingly urgent question as the services proliferate, but the answer is currently unclear . The companies have held their data close and are only now beginning to share, making it hard to assess critical questions like how people would have gotten to their destinations if Uber and Lyft did not exist.  A few researchers are making headway. A team at the University of California, Berkeley, is looking into the climate impacts of Uber and Lyft, with results due out in the fall. Unusually, the researchers will get access to data from both companies and, just as importantly, from their members (AKA riders). Susan Shaheen, a Berkeley adjunct professor whose team is working on the project in partnership with the Natural Resources Defense Council, says: “With the companies, one of the most important things is to gain access to those members.” Key questions for the Berkeley study include how long the trips are (as well as the time driving to pick up a passenger); whether the rider would otherwise have driven alone, taken public transportation or not have taken the trip at all; and the fuel efficiency of the vehicles involved. The researchers will not look at congestion or at conventional air pollutants (such as nitrogen oxides or fine particles) generated by the vehicles. “There’s a lot of different angles that we could be studying here,” Shaheen says. Everyone has an opinion on Uber and Lyft, but research results can be surprising. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration feared that Uber was worsening traffic congestion in New York. But a report released by the city this month found that on-demand ride services like Uber and Lyft “did not drive the recent increase in congestion” in parts of Manhattan. The displacement of taxis was an important effect of the services. In terms of the environment, early research suggests that companies like Lyft and Uber may have a positive impact, according to Juan Matute, a transportation expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. That’s partly because people may take public transit more often if they are certain they can later use a ride service. For example, someone might take a commuter train to work rather than drive because they know they can get home even if they miss the last train. Some people also use Uber and Lyft to get to or from public transportation. “In some cases 25% of trips in a region (or more) start or end near transit, including such places as New York City, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Philadelphia,” an Uber spokesperson said in an emailed comment. However, some people take trips with Uber or Lyft when they might have stayed home, which is bad for the environment. In 2014, Shaheen and other Berkeley researchers found that 8% of 380 passengers surveyed in San Francisco used on-demand ride services to take trips they would not have taken otherwise. On the other hand, half of all ride-service trips in the survey carried more than one passenger – that’s a far higher rate than for taxis. (However, the 2014 Berkeley survey was carried out before carpooling services like UberPool and Lyft Line launched in San Francisco. Those services, which bring together strangers in a shared ride, may be the services’ most effective tool for cutting emissions.) The environmental calculus could change in the future, according to Matute. Currently, he said, it’s more expensive to use Uber or Lyft than to drive one’s own car. If the ride services became dramatically cheaper – which could happen if the vehicles contained advertising or eventually became self-driving – trips with the ride companies would become even more popular than they otherwise would have been. Right now, “it’s still very expensive for somebody to exclusively rely on these services in any market”, Matute said. Another factor is the type of car used by Uber and Lyft drivers. Some people hypothesize that since Lyft and Uber require cars to be relatively new – with the oldest models being from 2004 or 2005 – they may be less polluting than the vehicles owned by the general population, since cars in the United States are more than 11 years old on average. (The owners of Uber and Lyft cars also have an incentive for fuel-efficiency, since they must pay for gas.)  The car companies, unsurprisingly, are bullish on their environmental impact. “By using Lyft to share rides, passengers are helping to reduce the carbon footprint left by our country’s dominant mode of transportation – driving alone,” said Tommy Hayes, the transportation policy manager at Lyft, in an emailed statement. Lyft will also help accelerate the uptake of green technologies like electrification and vehicle automation, he said. Uber emphasizes that it is helping to reduce the need for personal car ownership. “Uber helps use today’s existing infrastructure more efficiently at no extra cost by getting more butts into the backseats of fewer cars,” a company spokesperson says. What is clear is that the on-demand ride market is evolving so rapidly that studies will become outdated almost as soon as they are produced. When Uber or Lyft first comes to a city, riders use those services differently from how they use them in the second or third year, says Shaheen of Berkeley. With the advent of UberPool and Lyft Line, as well as the eventual potential of self-driving cars, the future is anyone’s guess. "

"Cities around the world have only one generation to meet the twin challenges of climate change and a rapidly growing urban population, the head of a global engineering firm has warned. Gregory Hodkinson, chairman of the Arup group, said that with more than half the world’s population already living in cities, and the proportion set to rise to 70% by 2050, city leaders need to take urgent action.  “The big challenge – apart from the obvious humanitarian one of trying to build these [cities] fast enough to provide the real basics of shelter and essential utilities – is doing all those things and doing them in a low-carbon way,” he said. “If we don’t, in my view, we’re screwed: my children and my grandchildren and everybody else’s children. We need to find a way to do this rapid urbanisation in a way that’s not going to kill us – and to do it once.” Cities, said Hodkinson, tend to rebuild themselves slowly, meaning there is huge pressure on planners to ensure that the urban areas of the coming decades are as clean and sustainable as possible. “Once they’re there, they’re there for a long time,” he said. “And we’ve got one generation, so whatever we’re doing now, we’d better be doing it with that in mind.” Hodkinson, a former trustee of WaterAid who also works with the World Economic Forum on developing sustainable and resilient cities, said that although most of the urban population growth will take place in Africa and Asia, all cities share similar concerns: housing, crime and infrastructure.  “Putting aside the question of funding, probably every mayor or city leader in the world would have those things at the top of the list,” he said.  “It could be a question of emergency housing for conflict-driven migration or we could be talking about how can you have teachers and nurses and policemen in London when nobody can afford to live here? It’s a question of degree, but the same issues are there in every city.” Despite the scale of the challenge, Hodkinson said he has been heartened by the progress made in some rapidly evolving Chinese cities – and by what he saw at the recent climate change conference in Paris.  He said the mood in Paris was noticeably different to that at the Copenhagen summit six years earlier, adding that the representations made by about 400 mayors – who, between them, speak for perhaps 20% of the world’s population – show just how strong the clamour for action has become.  “The mayor of Paris was there and [the mayor of London] Boris Johnson was there and the range of mayors was enormous,” he said. “But they all said in one voice: ‘We need to do something on reducing emissions, changing our energy sources and investing in climate resilience’. It was really great to hear and you’ve got to be optimistic because the other option is not very attractive. I came away optimistic that there would be a renewed effort to put our city development on to a more sustainable path. It can be done. Will it be done? We’ll see.”"
"The aptly titled report, Too important to fail from the High Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing was launched in Dubai yesterday. Does it offer viable solutions to the widening gap between humanitarian needs and available resources? Is the “grand bargain” it offers enough to transform a struggling aid system? All eyes are on humanitarian financing in 2016. The World Humanitarian Summit in May is fast approaching and the launch of the report comes against a backdrop of the displacement of millions of people in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan, Iraq and other disaster and conflict-affected countries. Their suffering reminds us of the need to get this right fast.  The report contains many good ideas; the strongest and most exciting are those that speak to audiences beyond the usual humanitarian crowd. For example, giving middle-income countries access to grants and low-income loans to finance large-scale refugee hosting, working with the insurance industry to adapt its risk-financing strategies to humanitarian situations, and tapping into the billions of dollars generated each year through Islamic social finance. Few of the initiatives suggested are new – nor does the panel claim they are. Many have been discussed at length by other groups, and already piloted and reviewed in some cases. But seen together for the first time, and presented as compellingly as they are in the report, they have the potential to expand the responsibility to act beyond the narrow confines of the humanitarian community. The recommendations use finance as a driving force to enrich the aid ecosystem and push for institutional changes to bridge the humanitarian and development divide. This challenge is more pertinent than ever today given the increasingly protracted nature of crises around the world.  The “grand bargain” comes at the end of the report and may leave many readers asking whether the deal is radical enough. It proposes that the major donors and largest humanitarian organisations commit to make their spending more flexible, efficient, transparent and effective. The bargain is aimed in particular at the five largest government donors of humanitarian assistance, those that supplied over 60% of the international humanitarian resources in 2014; and the six UN agencies that spent nearly half of it. The logic is that if the giants can get it right, other donors and aid organisations will follow. But starting here does risk establishing the terms of the bargain in favour of these powerful few and thereby entrenching the concentration of funds even further, rather than encouraging a more diverse and equitable distribution of resources as recommended elsewhere in the report.  There is also the question of those without a seat at the bargaining table. The Gulf states and other emerging donors are clearly a central part of the financing solution. The choice of Dubai for the report launch yesterday reminds us of how important they are. The report is unclear however whether Gulf states are invited to negotiate the terms of the bargain, or to be bound by it. The same goes for international, national and local NGOs – vital links in the chain between UN agencies and crisis-affected populations – who are already asking what their role is in the bargaining process. The specific components of the bargain also appear to fall short of the panel’s ambition to ensure that resources are found to meet the needs of those most likely to be left behind. We don’t just need more joint assessments between a few big humanitarian agencies, we need a radical rethink of what we know about what makes people vulnerable to crisis in the first place and how to match their needs with the right resources. On transparency, the grand bargain may do something to improve reporting of international humanitarian assistance by a few, but we should aim for more. A bigger vision is required, in which all resources, beyond just international humanitarian resources can be counted.  Turning the grand bargain into a big deal will clearly be a challenge. Vested interests, competition for scarce resources, and the humanitarian-development divide are as old as aid itself. What’s different now, perhaps, is the window of opportunity that the World Humanitarian Summit has created. Responsibility for taking the panel’s recommendations forward now passes from the hands of technical experts to those of the political and financial decision-makers who will be represented en masse in Istanbul in May. This combined with the scale of the problem, and the reputation and clout of the panel members themselves as they go out and canvass support, may be the tipping point that we’ve all been waiting for.  The grand bargain will be a central topic of numerous global-level humanitarian meetings in the coming months. Even more interesting will be to see whether the panel’s recommendations get picked up outside of the humanitarian calendar. Will other actors agree that this is too important to ignore, and that they too have a stake in addressing the humanitarian financing gap? If the answer is yes, then the grand bargain may turn out to be a big deal after all.  Charlotte Lattimer is senior policy and engagement adviser at Development Initiatives.

"Giant melting icebergs may be a symbol of climate change but new research has revealed that the plumes of nutrient-rich waters they leave in their wake lead to millions of tonnes of carbon being trapped each year. Researchers examined 175 satellite photos of giant icebergs in the Southern Ocean which surrounds Antarctica and discovered green plumes stretching up to 1,000km behind them. The greener colour of the plumes is due to blooms of phytoplankton, which thrive on the iron and other nutrients shed by the icebergs.  When these tiny algae - or the many creatures that eat them - die, they fall to the bottom of the ocean. This takes the carbon dioxide they have absorbed from the ocean surface and buries it deep below, thereby curbing the CO2 in the atmosphere and the global warming it causes. “If giant iceberg calving increases this century as expected, this negative feedback on the carbon cycle may become more important than we previously thought,” said Professor Grant Bigg at the University of Sheffield, who led the study published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Giant icebergs, defined as greater than 18km in length, make up half the ice floating in the Southern Ocean, with dozens present at any one time. The researchers calculated that the fertilisation effect of the icebergs in the normally iron-poor waters contributes up to 20% of all the carbon buried in the Southern Ocean, which itself contributes about 10% of the global total. “We detected substantially enhanced chlorophyll levels, typically over a radius of at least four to 10 times the iceberg’s length,” said Bigg. The chlorophyll levels remained 10 times higher than in the surrounding ocean for at least a month and up to 200km behind the iceberg. Some increase in phytoplankton was seen as much as 1,000km behind the iceberg in a few cases. The discovery was a surprise as previous studies of small icebergs, or using ship-based measurements, has suggested a much smaller fertilisation effect. The largest iceberg analysed in the new study was more than 50km long.  The impact of global warming on melting ice in Antarctica, much of which is far below 0C, has been widely studied. Biggs and his colleagues note that satellite gravity data show a 5% increase in ice discharge from the continent over the past two decades. In 2014, two separate teams of scientists found that the collapse of the Western Antarctic ice sheet is already under way and is unstoppable. The loss of this entire ice sheet would cause up to 4m of sea-level rise in coming centuries. In 2015, researchers found the melting of floating ice shelves around Antarctica was faster than thought, potentially unlocking extra sea level rise from larger ice sheets jammed behind them. Professor Andrew Shepherd, director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds, said in 2015 that the rates of ice shelf loss were unsustainable and could cause a major collapse. This is already occurring at the massive Pine Island glacier, where ice loss has doubled in speed over the last 20 years as its blocking ice shelf has melted."
"The word “biodiversity” is employed once in the Paris agreement’s 32 pages. “Forests” appears a few times, but “oceans”, like biodiversity, scores just a single appearance. There is no mention of extinction. Wildlife, coral reefs, birds, frogs, orchids, polar bears and pikas never show up anywhere in the document. This is hardly surprising: the landmark agreement in Paris – the boldest yet to tackle climate change (which is saying something, but not nearly enough) – was contrived by one species for the benefit of one species. It was never meant to directly address the undeniable impacts of global warming on the world’s eight million or so other species – most of them still unnamed. But many experts say this doesn’t mean biodiversity won’t benefit from the agreement – especially if the 196 participants actually follow through on their plegdes and up their ambition quickly.  “[The agreement] is critical for people and it is critical for biodiversity,” said Edward Perry, Birdlife’s climate change policy coordinator, who dubbed the passage of the Paris agreement in December “monumental.” Most biodiversity experts concurred that the Paris agreement was an important step forward, but none thought it would be enough to counter the vast risks posed to biodiversity by global warming. Indeed a recent study in Science found that more than 5% of the world’s species will likely go extinct even if we manage to keep temperatures from rising more than 2C, the uppermost target outlined in Paris.  “[The Paris agreement] doesn’t go far enough, but that really misses the point,” said Nancy Knowlton, a coral reef expert with the Smithsonian Institution. “It moves us in the right direction, finally, and future efforts can be even more ambitious. To paraphrase Voltaire, we can’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” Scientists have identified thousands of species that have already been hit by global warming or will likely be in the near-future. For example, Edward Perry pointed to a recent scientific review by his organisation that found a quarter of the world’s most-researched birds have already been negatively impacted by climate impacts. “According to climate projections, there will be more than twice as many losers than winners under climate change [for birds],” said Perry, who noted that, to date, scientist have pointed to 2,300 birds with traits that makes them “highly vulnerable” to global warming. Already, climate change has disrupted some bird’s food sources, messed with the timing of fledgling and migrations, and shrunk the range of cold-loving species. Birds are a good example of how climate change is already impacting wildlife because they are the best studied group on the planet. Yet, they aren’t the only ones feeling the heat. Climate change is also likely playing a role in the current amphibian crisis, which has seen around 200 amphibians vanish for good in recent decades. “Pathogens are always smaller than their hosts, with faster metabolisms, and should therefore be able to acclimate more quickly to temperature shifts,” explained Moore. “This is a phenomenon that will not just affect amphibians!” Currently, habitat destruction remains the biggest threat to amphibians, making species more vulnerable to even slight climatic changes, according to Moore.  “Amphibians have survived four mass extinctions associated with major climate disturbances. What is pushing them over the edge now, I believe, is a perfect storm of lethal conditions that we have created.” Still, no one knows for certain how climate change will impact the majority of the world’s individual species, just as we don’t even know how many species share our planet (pegged at anywhere from 3 to 100 million, though a study in 2011 came up with an estimate of 8.7 million). But we can broaden our view. Just as there are some human communities living on the front lines of climate change – such as low-lying island states or drought-prone countries – there are also particular environments that scientists view as super vulnerable to climate change. Coral reefs are considered one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, and the most species-rich in the oceans. Their counterpart on land may well be cloud forests, which are high-altitude forests often blanketed in clouds – and also ridiculously rich in biodiversity. Similarly, coral reefs and cloud forests occupy very small slices of the planet: cloud forests make up only around 1% of the world’s forests and coral reefs less than 1% of the ocean’s floor. And both are feeling the heat. Coral reef expert, Joshua Cinner with James Cook University, said that climate change is delivering three separate punches to coral reefs: hotter oceans lead to higher incidences of coral bleaching, ocean acidification (which, like global warming, is caused by carbon dioxide emissions) makes it more difficult for corals to build and maintain their skeletons, while more powerful storms fueled by climate change can wreck reefs. For reefs, Cinner said, the climate crisis “isn’t something off in the far-flung future. It has already happened, and will continue to happen.” This year, record high temperatures driven by climate change – and exacerbated by El Niño – has led the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to declare only the third global coral reef bleaching event on record. The key here is global: usually bleaching events are regional or localised. When it comes to coral reefs, Cinner called the Paris agreement “a step in the right direction,” but also pointed out that even keeping temperatures below rising 1.5C – an aspirational goal in the Paris agreement – would not be enough to avoid further damage to the world’s reefs. “It is important to understand that it is not like 2C, or even 1.5C, is a threshold whereby everything will be OK...The point is that even with a 1.5 degree rise, we are looking at very serious problems for many coral reefs.” Amphibian-expert Moore agreed that there was significant uncertainty about biodiversity even with the 1.5 degrees goal in the Paris Agreement. “It’s impossible to know what a world with temperatures 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will look like...but just talking about it ad nauseam is like debating who should call the fire department whilst watching your house burn down.” Instead, he said, it’s time for action. Cloud forests, like coral reefs, have evolved to survive within certain temperature gradients. Already, scientists have documented cloud forests literally migrating upslope to escape warming. But, according to David Lutz, a forest ecologist with Dartmouth, cloud forest species “do not appear to be migrating as fast as they need to be to keep up” with steadily rising temperatures. “As the world grows warmer – or as periodic heat waves become more fierce – these species literally have nowhere to go but heaven,” said William Laurance, a noted rainforest scientist with James Cook University. “I think we’ll lose more biodiversity from tropical mountains than anywhere else in the world.” The situation becomes even more complicated by the fact that many of these forests won’t even be able to migrate as far as possible. Instead, as tree seedlings sprout upslope they will run into high-elevation cattle ranching, at least in the Andes. “As trees attempt to migrate up into this grassland, they will be either eaten by cows, or burned when the pastures are intentionally burned to encourage grass growth,” said Lutz. If strategies to allow cloud forest to migrate as far as possible aren’t developed many of them are likely to vanish, taking innumerable species found no-where else with them. The Paris agreement noted “the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans, and the protection of biodiversity,” but went into few details about how individual countries should, or even could, go about safeguarding imperiled species in the face of rising temperatures. What the agreement did do, however, was acknowledge the importance of conservation in protecting carbon sinks, often referring specifically to forests. Moore, who called this inclusion “particularly significant,” said “we cannot talk about addressing climate change without stemming the rampant loss of the world’s forests.” Experts said they hoped the agreement would boost initiatives like REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation), a UN programme that proposes to use funding from rich nations to pay developing countries to keep forests standing. Under negotiation for the better part of a decade, REDD+ projects are just beginning to launch – and the initiative made a number of important appearances at the Paris talks. Prior to the meeting, the UK, Germany and Norway put down $5bn to reduce deforestation in the tropics, while African nations pledged to restore 100 million hectares of forest across the continent over the next 15 years. If done correctly – and with involvement by locals and indigenous groups – such programmes could go a long way toward preserving biodiversity on land. But, some experts have become concerned not just about direct impacts on biodiversity from climate change, but how a warmer future could increasingly pit humans against wildlife. “We have anecdotal evidence that poaching increases when droughts or floods affect food production,” explained Nikhil Advani, WWF’s senior program officer of climate change adaptation, who also noted that when hydroelectric power plants fail during droughts people often turn to forests for fuel. He added that many of the big mammals that WWF focuses on “will be more affected by these indirect impacts from people than any direct impact of climate change.” The international group is launching a crowdsource data campaign, WWF Climate Crowd, in order to better understand such threats. Climate change poses a unique difficulty to biologists as they have to cut through several layers of uncertainty to understand how biodiversity might respond in 10, 20 or even 100 years. But given the rising observable impacts on species – from Arctic ice melt to worsening forest fires to record droughts in the Amazon – the risks are impossible to ignore. “I just can’t get past the nagging feeling that we’re putting off a lot of tough decisions,” said Laurance, who attended the talks in Paris and pointed to plans by India and China to keep building new coal-fired power plants despite the countries’ climate commitments. “[We’re] essentially relying on our children and grandchildren to make even bigger sacrifices and bear heavier costs because we weren’t really willing to grapple with these issues ourselves.” But Knowlton with the Smithsonian Institution is more optimistic. “When social change happens it can happen very quickly – this is what gives me hope...Will climate change in ten years look like marriage equality today? I think so.” The existence of thousands of species may well depend on it. "
"Thousands of power plants around the world may face severe reductions in their ability to generate electricity by mid-century due to water shortages, according to new research. Hydro- and thermo-electric (nuclear, fossil-fuelled, biomass-fuelled) power plants are vulnerable to dwindling rivers and reservoirs as the planet warms, a study published in Nature on Monday said.  These technologies, which provide 98% of global electricity supply, depend on abundant water to cool generators and pump power at dams. Lower river levels and warmer water temperatures could reduce generating capacity by as much as 86% in thermo-electric- and 74% in hydro plants, according to researchers at Wageningen University and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. It comes as water demand for power generation is set to double within the next 40 years, the report said. Drought-stricken hydro producers have reverted to dirtier energy sources in the past to shore up tottering grids. Global warming is set to boost river levels in Canada, India and central Africa as global weather patterns shift. Yet most hydroplants are in regions forecast to see shortages, like South America, which generates almost two-thirds of its electricity from hydro. If those plants became 10% more efficient in producing electricity that could offset the constraints, the study said. Converting to seawater and dry air cooling would achieve the same result for thermo-electric plants, but likely raise energy bills. Switching from coal to gas-fired power plants, whose cooling towers need less water, was preferable. Non-hydro renewable sources are growing, but are unlikely to be the dominant sources of power generation over the course of the century, the study said. Planners were urged to take heed of future constraints as they build new plants, which remain in operation for several decades. “Considering the increase in impacts of water constraints on power generation and the long design lifetime of power plant infrastructure (∼30–60 years for thermoelectric power and 80 years for hydro power), adaptation options should be included in today’s planning to fulfil the growing electricity demands in the next decades.”"
"British Airways says that it has been forced to shelve a groundbreaking £340m scheme to create 16m gallons of jet fuel from London’s rubbish every year, partly due to a lack of government support. The shadow transport minister, Richard Burden, pledged to table parliamentary questions about the affair, saying that government backing for the project had been derisory.   The Green Sky project was due to open in 2017 at an ex-oil refinery in Thurrock, Essex, where it would have turned into gas 575,000 tonnes of household waste otherwise destined for landfill sites or incinerators. Enough green fuel would have been produced to power all BA’s yearly flights from London City airport twice over, with carbon savings equivalent to taking 150,000 cars off the road. But BA told the Guardian that the project had now been mothballed because of low crude oil prices, jitters among investors, and a lack of policy engagement from 10 Downing Street.  “The government needs to support innovative aviation biofuels projects such as this if they are to progress,” said Cathy West, a BA spokeswoman. “Aviation fuels are not eligible for incentives that road transport fuels receive, making it difficult to build a business case to invest in UK aviation fuels projects. This affects investor confidence.” “British Airways’ decision to scrap their green fuels project is immensely disappointing,” Burden said. “The government has questions to answer on why it is not looking to support the industry’s innovative attempts to recycle waste to use as fuel.  “At a time when the government has delayed a decision on Heathrow and Gatwick partly for environmental reasons, it is ludicrous that the government is not backing the industry’s attempts to deliver cleaner fuels.”  BA wants jet biofuels brought under the government’s Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation, a move it believes could help trigger the building of a dozen green fuel plants by 2030.  Without such guarantees, airlines may feel obliged to sign alternative fuel deals at market rates that become less attractive when oil prices suddenly drop. “The UK is currently losing out to countries that have prioritised and incentivised developments in the sustainable aviation fuels market,” West said. Some 150 workers were expected to staff the Solena Fuels plant, which BA had committed to pay £35m each year for a decade, in a bid to lower its carbon footprint. But Solena, a US company, filed for bankruptcy three months ago and BA has now switched its attention to other waste-to-fuels firms where joint projects are thought to be at the due diligence stage. Chris Malins, the fuels programme manager of the International Council for Clean Transportation, said that commercialising these projects was a challenging process, beset by a lack of EU policy certainty after 2020 and a “valley of death” between R&D tests and market-scale production.  “Things could have been done on the policy side here to help these plants get built which were not done,” he said. “Investments won’t go to alternative aviation fuels without policy certainty and access to the same incentives as road diesel. “It is a shame as this project looked like a great opportunity to do something genuinely sustainable on a ground-breaking scale.” Aviation is the fastest-growing source of carbon dioxide emissions, currently thought to be responsible for around 5% of global warming by scientists at the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. New market mechanisms to green the industry will be debated at an International Civil Aviation Organisation conference later this year. Use of second-generation biofuels to power jets is widely seen as one of the most promising technologies. A recent study found that BA and Lufthansa were emitting 51% more carbon dioxide than the least polluting airlines. "
"The north pole could be hotter than Chicago, Vienna or Istanbul on Wednesday due to the low pressure system that has brought tornados to Dallas and high winds and heavy rainfall to the UK. The Arctic could reach temperatures about 35C (63F) warmer than average for this time of year, meteorologists have warned.  Computer model projections earlier this week suggested that the air temperature at the pole, which is currently shrouded in 24-hour darkness, could reach 5C, rather than the usual -30 to -35C, according to Mashable. This would make it milder than much of Canada and the US. Temperature fluctuations are fairly common in the Arctic, where shifts in sea ice cover can significantly affect local air temperatures, but such a strong variation is extreme. “That’s absolutely terrifying and incredibly rare,” meteorologist Eric Holthaus told Slate.  “By any yardstick, these are extremely warm and likely record readings for the north pole,” noted climate blogger Robert Scribbler. The strange weather coincides with an unusually warm winter in Europe and the eastern US and torrential flooding in parts of south America. The warm weather could affect the buildup of Arctic sea ice during the winter. Ice cover has already been vastly reduced by global warming. The conditions have been caused by one of the biggest storms ever to hit the northern Atlantic, reaching speeds of up to 230mph. Storm Frank lashed the north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland with downpours and gale force winds on Wednesday. Temperatures have reached or exceeded freezing point at the north pole during December on only three occasions since 1948, according to meteorologist Bob Henson of WeatherUnderground."
"Too many people in the corporate sector are still in denial about climate change, according to Katherine Garrett-Cox, the CEO of investment firm Alliance Trust.   Speaking at a Guardian Sustainable Business debate on the role of business in tackling climate change, Garrett-Cox, herself an outspoken advocate on the issue, said: “Within the last 12 months, I’ve had conversations with CEOs of major corporates in Europe and they just say, ‘It’s not real, it’s not something I should be bothered about’.” It is “scary” how little discussion there is at boardroom level about whether climate change is a risk at all, she added. One month on from a landmark climate change deal at UN talks in Paris, Garrett-Cox hopes this will be the tipping point for businesses waking up to climate change. Ikea’s sustainability chief Steve Howard agreed, saying 2016 presents the corporate world with “an unprecedented opportunity” to reinvent its business models in line with the challenge. However, speaking at the event, the UK’s only Green party MP Caroline Lucas said the government was making this transition more difficult: “This is a government that doesn’t like scrutiny ... and that’s part of the whole way it’s going about its green policies.”  The UK government has been widely criticised since its election in May for making a series of changes to environmental policy such as scrapping subsidies for onshore wind, ending the green deal scheme that helps homeowners insulate their homes and cutting support for the solar industry, which has since seen a number of firms going into liquidation. “What this government is doing in the name of being business friendly is constantly moving the goalposts so that no one knows where it’s going to be safe to invest,” she said. “The green economy is actually one of the best places to invest for jobs, to enable us to get out of the economic crisis we face as well as to keep emissions down.” And moving to a green economy means rethinking consumption patterns, especially in the west, according to Howard . “If we look on a global basis, in the west we have probably hit peak stuff. We talk about peak oil. I’d say we’ve hit peak red meat, peak sugar, peak stuff … peak home furnishings. If you look on a global basis, most people are still poor and most people actually haven’t got to sufficiency yet. There is a global growth opportunity ... but it’s a distribution issue.” Ikea has hit the headlines for introducing a raft of environmental policies in the last year. It has pledged to invest €1bn (£755m) in renewable energy and measures to help poorer communities deal with the impacts of climate change; announced that 100% of the energy used to power its shops and factories will come from clean sources by 2020; and phased out all non-LED lightbulbs from its stores. Leading climate change scientist Kevin Anderson, from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research, was more sceptical and said the idea that the green economy would enable people in the west to consume more was irreconcilable with international climate change commitments. “At a global level – if you want to see any level of equity around the globe – the idea that people like us can consume and see improvements in material wellbeing is to me not compatible with what the science is telling us about climate change … there are real problems if we try to tell people that, actually, if we’re really clever in the wealthy parts of the world that we can have our cake and eat it. That misunderstands the severity of the challenge we’re facing.” Anderson said that in the future it could be necessary to introduce a shorter working week, he added. “Under the current model you need growth because there is a pursuit of productivity, which people always say is a good thing. If we have an increase in productivity that means you have fewer people producing the same number of goods. If you want to then maintain employment you have to maintain growth to have the same number of people employed,” he said. “So you have to start unpicking all these pieces and saying, ‘Well what would that mean for our society?’ There are different reasons why we might be looking at a world where we have to work fewer hours. We consume fewer goods but we have a higher quality of life in that time that we have available.” The panel featured:"
"The International Monetary Fund is calling for a carbon tax on aviation and shipping to help deliver global climate goals. A charge of $30 a tonne on carbon dioxide embedded in international transport fuels could have raised $25 billion in 2014, the influential Washington DC-based body estimates.  In a report released after 195 countries struck a UN climate pact in Paris, it said carbon pricing should be “front and centre” in efforts to curb global warming. Levies on so-called bunker fuels were “promising”, it said, and a possible source of climate finance – support for developing countries to go green and adapt to shifting weather patterns. Emissions from planes and ships, around 4% of the global total and rising, were not directly addressed in the Paris agreement. It is up to the UN-backed authorities, the International Civil Aviation Organization and International Maritime Organization respectively, to regulate the international sectors. The IMF noted there were “challenges” to imposing a levy, including the need for international coordination and legal issues, “but the practicalities should be manageable”."

"Climate sensitivity – the amount of global surface warming we’ll see as a result of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels – has become contrarians’ favorite basis to argue against cutting carbon pollution. If the Earth’s climate is relatively insensitive to rising carbon levels, then it’s somewhat less urgent that we stop burning massive quantities of fossil fuels. However, a new NASA study indicates that’s not the case. There are a few different ways that climate scientists estimate the Earth’s sensitivity to rising carbon. When they look at climate changes in the distant past (paleoclimate), and at simulations from complex climate models, they get about the same result: if the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles, temperatures will rise between 2°C and 4.5°C, most likely 3°C.  However, a few studies in recent years using a third method have yielded somewhat lower results. This method uses recent measurements of temperature and heat changes, combined with estimates of how “forcings” like the increased greenhouse effect have caused the Earth’s energy balance to change, all input into somewhat simpler climate models.  These results caused the latest IPCC report to drop its lower estimate of the likely climate sensitivity to double carbon dioxide from 2°C to 1.5°C. Climate scientists were faced with the question, why did this third approach (known as the “energy budget approach”) yield somewhat lower results than others, and which estimate is right? A new study by Kate Marvel, Gavin Schmidt, Ron Miller, and Larissa Nazarenko at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies appears to have found the answer. They drew upon previous research by Drew Shindell and Kummer & Dessler, who identified a flaw in studies taking the energy budget approach. Those studies had assumed that the Earth’s climate is equally sensitive to all forcings.  In reality, as world-renowned climate scientist James Hansen noted in a 1997 paper, some forcings are more efficient at causing the Earth’s surface temperature to change than others. Those in which the effects are focused in the northern hemisphere tend to be more efficient, for example. Andrew Dessler explains in the video below. Drew Shindell first identified this deficiency with these low sensitivity studies in a 2014 paper. Shortly thereafter, Kummer & Dessler published a paper noting that this issue could potentially bring the climate sensitivity estimates from the energy budget method in line with estimates from climate models and paleoclimate studies. This new NASA paper builds upon those previous studies by better quantifying the efficiencies of different forcings over the historical period and the effect this has on energy budget approach climate sensitivity estimates. The NASA scientists ran climate models using just one forcing at a time – changes in greenhouse gases, aerosol pollution, land use changes, etc. – to see how efficient each is at changing the global surface temperature. As it turns out, forcings that have tended to cause cooling, like increased aerosol pollution, are particularly efficient. The scientists then repeated the energy budget study approaches incorporating what they learned about the various forcing efficiencies, and found that the previous climate sensitivity estimates were indeed biased low. As the NASA study authors wrote, Climate sensitivities estimated from recent observations will therefore be biased low in comparison with CO2-only simulations owing to an accident of history The “accident of history” is that the more efficient forcings happen to be those that have had a cooling effect on temperatures in recent decades, while the less efficient forcings happen to be those that have caused warming. By assuming they were all equally efficient, the previous energy budget studies, for example by Nic Lewis and Judith Curry, biased their climate sensitivity estimates low. The new best estimate puts climate sensitivity right around 3°C warming in response to doubled carbon dioxide levels, in line with estimates from climate models and paleoclimate studies.  Gavin Schmidt provides more detail at RealClimate. He also notes that conservative media outlets like the Daily Express and Daily Mail, and science denial blogs badly misrepresented their study results, as happens all too often. It’s also important to note that relying solely on the previous energy budget model results is a clear-cut case of cherry picking. That method was the outlier, yielding lower climate sensitivity estimates than other approaches. In fact, there have been a number of recent studies using observed changes in cloud cover, finding that the climate models with the higher sensitivities are those that reproduce the cloud changes most accurately. Moreover, it’s worth pointing out that even ‘low’ estimates are not that low. As climate scientist Chris Forest noted, if they were correct, “It might buy us five or ten years” to solve the problem. We’re so far behind the carbon pollution cuts needed to avoid dangerous climate change, that extra decade wouldn’t even be enough. Even if the contrarians were right, we would still need to cut carbon pollution rapidly. However, the NASA study shows that the previous estimates were indeed biased low, and correcting for that bias brings them into agreement with estimates using other approaches. This result makes it all the more urgent that we ratchet down carbon pollution emissions as quickly as possible to curb the risks associated with rapid climate change."
"Around $27bn (£18bn) was paid out by insurers for natural disaster claims last year, with weather causing 94% of incidents, according to data from reinsurer Munich Re.  While the climate phenomenon known as El Niño reduced the development of hurricanes in the north Atlantic, storms and floods still caused billions of dollars worth of damage in Europe and North America, the world’s largest reinsurer said in an annual review.   Munich Re said floods in the UK and Scandinavia caused by Storm Desmond last month may cause about €700m (£515m) in claims. It added that flooding from Storm Eva may cause overall damage of more than €1bn. Climate change may have played a role in the floods, according to the insurer.  Two tornadoes and flooding also hit the US last month but Munich Re said damage estimates were not yet available.  The insurance industry lobbied governments to take action to curb climate change in the run-up to the UN climate summit in Paris last year. It cited rising payouts in heavily insured rich country markets and a lack of affordable insurance in developing countries, where it is most needed.  “The proportion of insured losses for catastrophes in developing and emerging countries remains very low,” said Torsten Jeworrek, a Munich Re board member.  “The insurance industry is exploring new avenues to close this gap in cover and thus to help people better cope with material losses after a catastrophe,” Jeworrek added.    Insurers and reinsurers may get a push from an  international effort unveiled by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, to develop company disclosures so that investors can assess companies’ physical, liability and other risks from climate change.   The $27bn in insured damage last year was lower than the $31bn registered in 2014 and also below the 10-year average of $56bn, Munich Re said.  Overall damage, including that not covered by insurance, was $90bn last year, the lowest level since 2009.  In total, 23,000 people were killed in 2015, including many in the Nepal earthquake in April, compared with 7,700 the previous year, but was well below the 10-year average of 68,000.  Lower claims payouts boost insurance industry profit but the downside for reinsurers is that their insurance company clients often then demand lower prices for reinsurers’ backing.    Munich Re is due to report its own results on 4 February. "
"Heavy rain and high winds have battered central and north-east Scotland with homes again threatened by flood waters and some villages in Aberdeenshire remaining cut off after Storm Frank caused damage to transport routes last week. Local MSPs praised the “huge community spirit” as residents of a sheltered housing complex in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, were evacuated to the village scout hut on Monday afternoon, while the local Asda supermarket supplied food to the makeshift emergency centre.  With a relentless downpour throughout the day adding to already swollen rivers, many threatened to burst their banks again, with the Met Office amber “be prepared” warnings for heavy rain in the Grampian, Central, Tayside and Fife areas extended to midnight on Monday. Earlier in the day, police named the kayaker who died after getting into difficulties on the river Findhorn, near Inverness, last Wednesday, when Storm Frank first hit, as 54-year-old Laurence Henderson from Aberdeenshire. The dead man is believed to have been with a group of experienced kayakers who raised the alarm after he fell into the river and his clothing became snagged on branches. A coastguard search had to be called off as weather conditions worsened and Henderson’s body was recovered from the river at 9am the following day. Rail bosses confirmed on Monday that the west coast mainline between Carlisle and Glasgow would be closed until at least February while repairs to the Lamington viaduct, near Lockerbie, were carried out. Alternative routes will involve a replacement bus or diverted train via Dumfries. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) had 35 flood warnings still in place on Monday evening, covering Tayside, Angus, Dundee, Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. It has also issued four flood alerts, including one for the Scottish Borders. Police warned that riverside homes in Aberdeen would be at risk on Monday night, when the Dee reaches high tide at about 9pm. West of the city, in the village of Ballater, which suffered some of the worst devastation last week, council workers and volunteers have built a huge sandbag barrier. Braemar, still further west into the Cairngorms, is partially cut off while the council liaises with the army to repair the badly damaged Invercauld Bridge. Abergeldie castle, near Ballater and close to the Queen’s residence at Balmoral, has been left on the brink of collapse after intense flooding. The owner was forced to evacuate the 16th-century Grade A-listed tower house in Aberdeenshire on Sunday after the river Dee swept away about 60ft (18 metres) of land behind the property, leaving it only a few feet from the water. As police urged drivers to follow warnings, a 47-year-old woman was charged with careless driving after emergency services were called to free her from her half-submerged vehicle when she allegedly attempted to drive through 4ft deep flood water in Stobo, near Peebles. While the rain across Scotland is expected to ease through Tuesday, the Met Office forecast another weather front bringing rain from Thursday. Meanwhile, David Cameron, ministers and the Environment Agency face questioning by MPs and communities in the coming days over their response to flooding across northern England during one of the wettest Decembers on record. Campaigners said the political fallout of the floods would play out this week and next, as the Met Office warned of possible further flooding with more rainfall likely in many areas in the next 48 hours. Next Tuesday, the prime minister is due to be questioned on Syria and climate change by the liaison committee, with flooding likely to be on the agenda along with the recent Paris climate agreement. Officials rank flooding as the UK’s number one threat from climate change and Cameron has been accused of ignoring flood warnings from his climate advisers. The Environment Agency’s chief executive, James Bevan, and its chairman, Philip Dilley, will be questioned by the same committee this Wednesday. Dilley is likely to be asked about criticism that he was holidaying in Barbados while some of the worst flooding was occurring and the agency’s initial refusal to comment on his whereabouts. A spokeswoman for Kerry McCarthy, the shadow environment secretary, said the government’s response so far had not been commensurate with the scale of the threat from climate change and flooding. She said: “It appears to be very piecemeal and reactive, rather than looking at the problem as a whole.” Oliver Letwin is chairing a new flood resilience review, which is due to report in the summer, although the MP came under fire over the weekend for sitting on a previous report following the extraordinary floods of early 2014. “This week will be a crucial test of whether Westminster really understands the flooding that’s devastated the country,” said Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “The prime minister has serious questions to answer about previous warnings that climate change will push up flood risk. He must realise that cuts to flood defence spending are a false economy.” The Environment Agency has 30 flood warnings in place and 168 flood alerts across large swaths of England and Wales. The Met Office issued yellow “be aware” warnings on Monday for south-west and south-east England and warned people to be alert to the risk of surface flooding in those areas. A spokesman said that on the western sides of Dartmoor and Exmoor, and possibly Bodmin moor, rainfall could be up to 40mm compared with an average of about 20mm across the south-west. He said the main problem in the south-west was that the ground was already saturated after prolonged rainfall, making the risk of surface flooding more likely. On Thursday, campaigners at the National Flood Forum will meet with Rory Stewart, under secretary of state for environment and rural affairs, to discuss insurance along with other issues facing flood-hit communities."
"You could be forgiven for thinking that electric cars are a magic bullet for transforming the streets of the UK. London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith has claimed they will soon make buses in the capital redundant, and the city has launched a £100m project to encourage more people to use electric cars. There is, presumably, a clear case for saying London would be transformed for the better by electric vehicles.  Alas, we struggled to find this case written down anywhere. So we sat down with a blank spreadsheet and tried to work it out from first principles. We began by listing the problems that motor vehicles currently bring to cities. Then, we asked what electricity could do to address each of these. Perhaps the most obvious reason people get excited about electric vehicles is pollution. Conventional vehicles spew some very noxious stuff into our streets, killing many thousands each year (pdf), including several thousand in London alone. Electric vehicles offer a real advantage in reducing the dangerous nitrogen oxide and particulate matter in urban areas. But as well as being cleaner, are electric vehicles also greener? That’s a different question – one to which the answer is entirely dependent on how the nation generates its electricity. In 2014, 19.1% of the UK’s electricity (pdf) was generated from renewables compared with 30% for gas and 30% for coal. This heavy use of fossil fuels means the electric car is not as eco-friendly as it might initially appear. Electric vehicles basically move the fossil-fuel combustion from inside the car to another part of the country (safely outside the purview of any elected mayors). They don’t do much about how we’ll stop our nation emitting greenhouse gases. The problems of today’s vehicles, however, go far beyond emissions. The hypermobility (pdf) they provide permits suburban sprawl (and thus extra greenhouse gas emissions) as it becomes possible for people to live, work and shop at places distant from one another. And there is another big space problem: a car used for 50 minutes a day is unused 96.5% of the time. Frequently cars are stored on roads and pavements, to the detriment of traffic flow, aesthetics, councils’ finances and the needs of vulnerable road users. Simply swapping one engine for another does nothing to solve a raft of other problems. The UK has a billion-pound health crisis (pdf) arising from physical inactivity. Shifting shorter journeys – for example, those under two miles – from cars to active travel modes such as walking or cycling is one of the best things (pdf) any developed nation can do to tackle its health problems. Electric vehicles, at best, leave this problem untouched. Perhaps what electric vehicle champions are really thinking of – especially when they suggest they will replace buses – is self-driving electric cars. Taking the driver out of the picture overcomes some issues, most obviously the problem of collisions – there is a high global and UK death toll from people crashing their vehicles.  A switch to driverless vehicles gives us an opportunity to rethink our relationship with cars. We could move away from the old idea that everybody should own their own car and have a much smaller number of automated cars, each in frequent use and summoned when people need them. Self-driving cars might overcome some genuine problems, such as the number of cars on the road and where we store all the unused cars. But this future requires car makers to sell few cars rather than many. This makes it unlikely any real change will happen – especially given the cosy relationship car manufacturers have enjoyed with governments. There is a lack of ambition and vision from the motoring industry which, for all its innovation, avoids addressing underlying issues.  And even if we did shift to fewer shared vehicles, we are still left with the issues of urban sprawl, and questions about health and wellbeing. Even driverless cars do not address these fundamental problems. We need to stop building towns and cities on the self-fulfilling assumption people will travel by car. There is no future in which humans can sit down all day without paying an enormous health price. If driverless cars appear in streets anything like today’s, we risk falling into the most pathetic of robot uprisings, where they transport us helpfully from place to place while we remain inactive, growing fat and increasing our risk of cancer and diabetes.  Electric vehicles should not be considered a panacea for sustainable transport but rather a possible part of the puzzle. We need to rethink the journeys we make. Many of our urban journeys are short and we should plan cities with that in mind. Perhaps in the future we will continue to drive to the city, but we won’t drive through the city. Let’s turn cities back into a place for human beings to make their short journeys in a physically active way."
"A parliamentary petition backed by 500,000 people has so far failed to bar Donald Trump from the UK, but the controversial US presidential candidate and climate change sceptic now faces a new deterrent: a fine for the carbon pollution from one of his enormous private jets.  The Bahrain Royal family, 21st Century Fox America, the company chaired by Rupert Murdoch, and British construction vehicle manufacturers JCB have also been asked to pay up for flights to and from the UK.  The Environment Agency, which is responsible for enforcing the European Union’s emissions trading scheme (ETS) in the UK, has issued over £750,000 in fines to a total of 25 operators for “failure to surrender sufficient allowances to cover annual reportable emissions”. The ETS requires polluters to surrender a carbon permit for every tonne of carbon pollution emitted, or pay a €100 (£75) per tonne fine. Permits are given to many air operators for free but can be bought if needed for about €8 currently. Donald Trump faces a £1,610 penalty for a flight to the UK in a plane owned by DJT Operations I LLC, possibly the $100m Boeing 757 he uses as a private jet, complete with master bedroom and gold taps. The 757 is 54m long and usually carries 200-300 passengers. Trump opened his golf course in Aberdeenshire in 2012, the period covered by the fines published on 5 January. The ETS is intended to limit carbon emissions and reduce climate change. This is unlikely to impress Trump, who has called climate change “bullshit” and a concept “created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. Hope Hicks, Trump’s campaign communications manager, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   The Bahrain royal family have been hit with a heftier fine, £60,698, while 21st Century Fox America was fined £17,463. The 25 operators fined include a series of private jet operators, insurance giant AIG, Air India and a “MIG Russian Aircraft”, which was not a military plane. JCB Ltd were hit with the biggest fine of £157,596. “The EU Emissions Trading System is an important means of regulating emissions from aviation operators,” said Liz Parkes, Environment Agency deputy director of climate change and business services. “The Environment Agency’s enforcement activity is part of coordinated action across Europe.” Confidentiality rules mean the EA is unable to disclose whether fines have been paid or not. • Additional reporting by Scott Bixby in New York."
"One of the priorities for the next mayor of London should be to appoint a chief scientific adviser. The current mayor has a range of advisers, but has clearly lacked expert guidance on the scientific aspects of key issues such as local air pollution and climate change. The time has come to seek specialist advice to help deal with the wide variety of risks and opportunities facing those living and working in the capital. Boris Johnson has, for instance, struggled to come to terms with the findings of researchers at King’s College London, who have estimated that more than 9,000 people die in London each year from dust and nitrogen dioxide in the air.    In 2014, Mr Johnson used Twitter to denounce as “B*ll*cks: ludicrous urban myth” a conference presentation by a scientist at King’s College who suggested that average annual levels of nitrogen dioxide measured in Oxford Street may be the highest in the world. The mayor was later forced to defend his comments in a letter to a Parliamentary committee, admitting that he was “not disputing King’s College data”, but did not accept the scientists’ warnings. It is true that Johnson does have an environment adviser, Matthew Pencharz, but he is a former journalist, not a technical expert. Throughout his terms as mayor, Mr Johnson has also demonstrated that he is in thrall to friends and associates who reject the evidence that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from human activities are driving climate change. As part of the celebrations for the Olympics in 2012, Mr Johnson invited Matt Ridley, the former chairman of Northern Rock bank, rather than an expert, to deliver a lecture on the environment. Ridley dismissed the risks to lives and livelihoods from climate change that have been highlighted by scientists. And in one of his columns for the Daily Telegraph last month, Johnson claimed that the mild weather in December had nothing to do with global warming, based, it seems, on a phone conversation with a friend, Piers Corbyn, a climate change sceptic who runs a tiny weather forecasting company. Johnson has written about global warming in his Telegraph column four times over the past few years, and on each occasion has referred solely to Piers Corbyn’s views as his source of authority. In fact, Met Office data show unarguably that London, along with the rest of the UK and world, is warming. Seven of the ten warmest years in south-east England since records began in 1910 have occurred since 2000, and only one winter, in 1985, from the last 30 years ranks among the ten coldest on record. And the capital is facing higher risks of extreme weather events, including heatwaves and heavy downpours. Although the mayor does not have complete control over all of the laws and policies for managing the risks to Londoners posed by local air pollution and climate change, it is troubling that he apparently ignores inputs about these issues from scientists, including world-class researchers based in the capital. And while Mr Johnson energetically promotes the abundance of talent in London and its importance as an economic and cultural centre, he rarely mentions the city’s outstanding array of scientific minds and its unique place in the history of science. The mayor is not alone in neglecting our capital city’s hugely important scientific heritage. It is difficult, for instance, to find statues or other commemorations of the achievements of Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin or any of the other scientific giants who have connections with the city. Nevertheless, London now hosts some of the world’s most scientifically accomplished universities, including Imperial College and University College, as well as internationally renowned research centres, such as the new Francis Crick Institute. It seems logical to propose that whoever is elected in May should appoint a chief scientific adviser to devise a strategy for London to retain its leadership as a global centre for science, at a time when many other cities around the world are already aiming to overtake it. Most importantly, the holder of such a role should help ensure that decisions across a range of key economic, social and cultural issues affecting London are informed by the best knowledge and understanding, including from the city’s own wealth of bright minds. Of course, an adviser could not guarantee that the new mayor would always take full account of the evidence, but it would undoubtedly be more difficult to ignore. It’s why the national government and each of its departments have chief scientific advisers. It is surely an anomaly that the mayor of London, who is responsible for a wide range of issues affecting lives and livelihoods in the capital and who oversees an annual budget exceeding that of every national department apart from health, education and defence, does not directly receive expert, independent advice on scientific issues. Whoever emerges victorious in May must show that the role of London’s mayor is important enough to require expert scientific advice. Bob Ward is policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and sits on the London Climate Change Partnership."
"Billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer pressed Barack Obama on Monday to go out with a bang and make global warming central to the message of his last State of the Union address. In a conference call with reporters, Steyer said the speech on Tuesday offered one of the last high-visibility moments for Obama to make his case to the American public for a transformation of the US energy and climate system.  The last year was a banner year for climate change – with the Paris climate agreement, the rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline, an effective ban on Arctic drilling, and the finalisation of rules cutting carbon pollution from power plants, Steyer told the call. “This is a great opportunity to make that case and make sure that the moves we made are decisive and irrevocable,” Steyer said. “He is obviously not going to get specific climate legislation through by the end of his administration … This is a chance for him to really address Americans and explain to them what he has been doing, why it still needs to be done, and why it is so important.” On Monday, Steyer’s NextGen Climate teamed up with fellow activists Van Jones, founder of Green for All and briefly green jobs adviser for Obama; Mona Mangat, board chair of Doctors for America; and Michael Breen, chief executive of the Truman national security project, for the release of a new report casting climate change as a threat to national security and public welfare. “To truly address poverty, we must address climate change once and for all. The economic burden of climate change will not be shouldered by all families equally,” the report Threat Multiplier: Climate Change and the State of Our Union, said. The report extends the idea first embraced by the Pentagon nearly a decade ago that global warming deepened existing risks to the international order. (By 2014, the Pentagon had elevated climate change as an “immediate risk” to national security and its infrastructure). It points out the public health risks posed by air pollution, water shortages and drought – all of which will be exacerbated by climate change, and notes the Pentagon’s concerns about national security. “It is in America’s best national security interest to take action on climate change,” the report said, noting that the Syrian conflict and refugee crisis were fueled in part by drought and climate change. Steyer has spent millions from his own fortune backing candidates with strong environmental records in an attempt to elevate the issue of climate change in elections – with mixed results. The billionaire’s NextGen Climate group is pressing candidates to back his call for powering the country with more than 50% clean energy by 2030 – a far more ambitious target than Obama’s – and 100% clean energy by 2050. Among potential presidential candidates in 2016, only the struggling Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, matches Steyer’s level of ambition."
"They have been reviled as vandals, hooligans and lunatics. But to me, these people are heroes. The 13 women and men on trial this week for cutting through the perimeter fence around Heathrow airport and chaining themselves together on a runway were excoriated by police, passengers and politicians. (One of the defendants in the case is a member of the cooperative society that rents my house.) If convicted, they all face a possible prison sentence. But there are two trials here: the legal proceedings in a local magistrates court, and a test of something much bigger. Aviation enjoys some astonishing exemptions from the civilising rules that constrain other sectors. Other industries must limit the noise they make; but aircraft, thanks to an obscure clause in the 1949 Civil Aviation Act, are exempt. Other industries pay duty on the fuel they use; but even when air passenger duty is subtracted, aviation’s various tax holidays amount to a subsidy of some £7bn a year, forgone by the Treasury. Some industries must limit the air pollution they produce; but while in principle airports are subject to pollution laws, in practice they have been allowed to breach them routinely for years. (In this case the legal immunity also seems to extend to motor traffic.)  Most importantly, international flights are free from all climate constraints. They are covered by neither domestic legislation nor international agreements. There are no targets, no timetables, no limits. Airlines operate in a legislative vacuum, a transnational, extralegal limbo, accountable nowhere and to no one. As a result they threaten everything that was agreed at December’s climate talks in Paris. Aviation accounts for roughly 6% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, and 2% of the carbon dioxide produced by people globally. But as this industry expands while emissions from other sectors are cut, a study commissioned by the European parliament expects it to produce 22% of the world’s CO2 emissions by 2050, unless there is a sharp change in policy. That’s enough to push us past the thresholds our governments promised to avoid. At one point the draft Paris agreement contained a paragraph about aviation and shipping (another unregulated industry). By December this paragraph had disappeared, without public explanation or debate. The final agreement simply fails to mention either industry. Governments left the issue instead to the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation, a body whose apparent purpose is not to make progress but to impede it. Dominated by the industry it is supposed to regulate, its work is an exercise in finely calibrated uselessness: it makes just enough noise to create the impression of something being done, without actually changing anything. It has three main policies. The first is to offset the greenhouse gases planes release by encouraging other sectors to make bigger cuts, in lieu of those that aviation refuses to accept. It’s not just that this policy is likely to be unachievable, as the targets agreed for other sectors in Paris will be tough enough to reach. It is also unjust. Why should this sector, used mostly by the world’s richer people, be allowed to dump its responsibilities on the rest of the economy? The second is replacing mineral jet fuel with biofuel. Already road fuels made from plants have helped to destroy the forests of Indonesia and west Africa, strip soil off the land, evict local farmers and spread starvation, as plantations of palm oil, maize, sugar cane and other crops grown to feed cars have replaced those grown to feed people. Already, governments envisage covering great tracts of the planet’s surface with energy crops to burn in power stations: a plan that’s as fanciful as it is destructive. Now they want to power planes this way as well? Will any corners of the planet be reserved for food production and wildlife? The organisation’s third policy is promoting speculative and often unfeasible aviation technologies, that are highly unlikely to materialise. Perhaps we could call them mumbo-jumbo jets. Because of the physical and technological constraints, the only way in which we can realistically reduce aviation’s greenhouse gases is to fly less. You might not have imagined, in the 21st century, that we would still need to hoist 180lb of human flesh 30,000 feet into the air every time we want a conversation. I’ve been limiting my own flights to one return ticket every three years. Yes, it has sometimes cost me opportunities and income, but this restraint has made me no less happy or fulfilled. If we can only challenge our sense of entitlement, I believe we inflict no damage on our lives by taking to the air less often. But rather than seeking to manage demand, our government, like most others, aims only to meet its own inflated forecasts. It claims that the 219m passenger journeys through the UK’s airports in 2011 will rise to 445m by 2050, and it hopes to build enough capacity to accommodate them. In doing so, it vitiates every promise it has made about preventing climate breakdown. Last month the government delayed its decision on a third runway at Heathrow, ostensibly because of concerns about local pollution (though the real reason was to avoid sabotaging the Conservative candidate’s campaign to become London mayor). But this represents no change in policy: Cameron intends to build the new capacity somewhere, even if it’s not in west London. Each of aviation’s exemptions is a democratic deficit: a failure to hold the industry responsible for the harms it causes. So what are citizens to do, where the writ of government does not run? Sit back and watch? By doing so, we commit a disservice to democracy. A breach of the contract between state and citizens becomes normalised and ratified by our inaction. Two verdicts will emerge from this trial. One will concern the legal status of what the protesters did, and there is no way of knowing what it will be. The other will concern the moral status. I suspect that if they are locked up then history will pass the same verdict upon them as it has passed upon suffragettes, Chartists, the pioneers of trade unionism, and civil and gay rights activists. Vilified, prosecuted, but – in the court of public opinion – ultimately vindicated: this is what happens to the heroes of democracy."
"The Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University (NYU) School of Law recently published a report summarizing a survey of economists with climate expertise. The report was a follow-up and expansion of a similar survey conducted in 2009 by the same institute. The key finding: there’s a strong consensus among climate economics experts that we should put a price on carbon pollution to curb the expensive costs of climate change. The survey participants included economists who have published papers related to climate change “in a highly ranked, peer-reviewed economics or environmental economics journal since 1994.” Overall, 365 participants completed the survey, which established the consensus of expert climate economists on a number of important questions.  In the 2009 version of the survey, the respondents were asked under what conditions the United States should commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 57% answered that the US should cut its emissions no matter what actions other countries take, while another 38% said that American emissions cuts would be warranted if many or all other countries commit to reducing theirs (as just happened in the Paris international negotiations).  In the 2015 survey, the number of expert economists saying that the US should cut its emissions no matter what rose to 77%. A further 18% said that if other countries agree to cut their emissions, the US should follow suit. In other words, there is a 95% consensus among expert climate economists that the US should follow through with its pledges to cut carbon pollution in the wake of the Paris international climate negotiations, and more than three out of four agreed that the US should take action to curb global warming no matter what. This expert consensus is in stark contrast to conservative political opposition to the Paris accord. For example, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio said of the agreement, This kind of unilateral disarmament in our economy is reckless, and it is hurting the American Dream Quite obviously an international agreement made by 195 nations around the world is the antithesis of unilateral action. However, 77% of expert economists agree that unilateral action would be appropriate in any case, directly contradicting Rubio’s comments. Additionally, 82% of the experts agreed that by implementing climate policies, the US could strategically induce other countries to cut their carbon pollution. When asked at what date climate change will have a net negative impact on the global economy, the median survey response was 2025. In the recent past, climate change likely had a net positive impact on the global economy, due primarily to the effect of carbon fertilization on crops and other plant life. However, even contrarian economists agree, when accounting for the vulnerability of poorer countries to climate impacts, global warming has been hurting the global economy since about 1980.  The NYU survey asked when the economic benefits we experienced up to 1980 would be completely wiped out; 41% of respondents said that’s already happened. Another 25% answered that it would happen within a decade, and 26% said we’d see net negative economic impacts by 2050. If we continue with business-as-usual pollution and warming, on average the experts predicted a GDP loss of about 10% by the end of the century, and that there would be a 20% chance of a “catastrophic” loss of one-quarter of global GDP. Of course, ideally we would have stopped warming the planet in 1980 to preserve the economic benefits of global warming to that date. At this point it’s a question of just how much damage climate change will do to the global economy, and the economic experts are worried that the results could be catastrophic. 78% of the survey participants said that it’s likely (36%) or extremely likely (42%) that climate change will have a long-term negative impact on the growth rate of the global economy. That’s an important point, because most current integrated economic-climate assessment models assume that economic growth will continue regardless of climate change impacts. There’s been a growing body of research indicating that as you might expect, that won’t be the case.  The results of this survey question show that most expert economists agree, climate change will hurt global economic growth. That also suggests that past model-based studies likely significantly underestimated the costs of climate change. Along the same lines, 51% of the experts answered that the US government’s estimate for the “social cost of carbon” ($37 per metric ton), which is largely based on estimates from these models, is too low. 18% of the experts said that value is about right, and just 8% said it’s too high. The survey also asked the experts about the most economically efficient method of reducing carbon pollution. 81% said a market-based system (carbon tax or cap and trade system) would be most efficient, while 13% answered that coordinated performance standards and programs that prioritize cleaner fuels and energy efficiency would be most efficient. In the US, President Obama’s Clean Power Plan is closer to the latter system of performance standards, although the president has said he would prefer the type of market-based system favored by 81% of economic experts. Implementing a carbon tax or cap and trade system would require bipartisan congressional action, but over the past several years, Republican Party leaders have shown scant interest in crafting the efficient climate policies favored by economic experts and by their own voters. The NYU survey reveals a clear economic consensus on global warming. The experts agree: climate change is hurting the global economy, we should mitigate those costs by cutting carbon pollution, and the most efficient way to do that is with a market-based system like a carbon tax or cap and trade system. This expert consensus clearly contradicts the arguments made by Republican Party leaders and other opponents of climate policies – that taking these actions will cripple the economy. In reality, economists are worried that if we fail to cut carbon pollution and instead continue with business-as-usual, it will badly stunt economic growth and may potentially lead to catastrophic economic consequences.  However, we can still solve the problem while creating jobs and growing the economy, if our political leaders will listen to the economic experts and their voters. So far, convincing Republican Party leaders to listen to an expert climate consensus has been a fruitless task, but there are signs that the party is starting to move in the right direction."
"China’s heavy pollution has been well documented. Last year, Beijing issued two “red alerts” for pollution, the highest level warning which calls for emergency measures such as closing schools and restricting car use. Poor air quality is also having a significant knock-on effect on the country’s tourist trade.   Some businesses are taking advantage of the air pollution – food delivery services that meet the needs of those staying indoors; bars which push their air purifiers as a marketing tool to get customers in; and beer that gets cheaper as the air quality decreases. But these are not long-term solutions. According to Ma Jun, one of China’s most prominent environmental voices, China has reached its environmental tipping point. “I think its time to change and balance the environment and growth. If we don’t do that we’re going to suffer a hard landing one day very soon,” says Ma. From top-down, engineering solutions providing wind turbines and solar panels, to NGOs and citizens forcing local government and industry to act, China’s next steps are going to be closely scrutinised.  The comments on an article we published last September about Ellie, the machine that can detect depression, ranged widely, from “So CLEVER. My God. Amazing” to “creepy” to “Oh bloody hell, I’m not even fully qualified as a counsellor and already there’s a robot taking my job”. Ellie is a virtual interviewer, a machine that has been developed to help diagnose depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Like apps for combatting low mood and online cognitive behavioural therapy, she’s an example of the ways that technology can be put to good use by helping improve people’s mental wellbeing. “We hear a lot about how the rise of technology use, such as smartphones, is harming our mental health, but I believe the same technology can be a real safety net too,” says Sarah Bateup, clinical lead of Ieso Digital Health. With at least 350 million people worldwide living with depression, the development and adoption of such technology is set to continue. Industrial farming methods are increasingly coming under scrutiny, especially when it comes to the routine use of antibiotics.  Although our growing resistance to them can in part be put down to poor prescribing and use, Dr David Wallinga points out that more than 70% of medically important antibiotics sold in the US are used for livestock to promote growth or for routine disease prevention in the “less-than-healthy conditions found on industrial farms”. This is exacerbating antibiotic resistance.  As a recent Guardian editorial points out, “Antibiotic resistance may not seem as urgent as terrorism or the NHS funding shortfall. But it is actually a threat that could kill many more people and degrade the quality of civilised life much more”. The Guardian’s investigation into the poultry industry, a key user of antibiotics, has uncovered a catalogue of other disturbing practices. From alleged hygiene failings leading to contaminated chicken to serious concerns about working conditions, the revelations show the heavy price some pay for cheap chicken. Then there’s pesticide use. Numerous studies have suggested its links with a range of health impacts, including cancers and Parkinson’s disease. The French wine industry, where only 8.4% of vineyards are organic is one sector particularly enamoured with pesticides. However, experts predict that dozens of legal proceedings could be in the pipeline across France related to their health impacts. Few things are as ridiculous as transporting water around the world in disposable plastic bottles.  Globally, we now drink as much packaged water as we do milk. Over one fifth of the water in the UK is sourced from overseas, despite the country having abundant sources of water. There have also been trends for water from remote areas, such as Fiji Water, which is sourced from the Fiji Islands, 1,600 miles from the nearest continent. In the context of a world that is struggling with acute water scarcity in some areas, there are serious questions to be answered about our role as stewards of the Earth.  Climate change is funded in numerous, often opaque ways, from the issuing of bonds that support the relentless expansion of palm oil plantations to the lobby groups seeking to undermine government action on climate change.  Some argue that climate change leaders should join forces with fossil fuel companies to put a price on carbon. According to Hunter Lovins and Felix Kramer, for example: “Fossil fuel companies receive $5.3tn [£3.6tn) in worldwide subsidies every year – that’s $10m a minute – exceeding global spending on health. Pricing carbon fuels to reflect their true social and environmental impacts will help to speed up the transition to renewable energy and more energy efficient living standards.” Other ways to tackle climate change that have risen to prominence over the past year include scaling up the divestment movement and driving more investment into renewables.  The divestment campaign has had some significant recent successes, including the Church of England divesting from tar sands oil and coal last April and Californian lawmakers passing a bill in September requiring the state’s two largest pension funds to divest from coal. Last summer, Bill Gates announced that he would invest $2bn in renewable technologies, and in November it was announced that entrepreneurs including Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Richard Branson were to form the Breakthrough Energy Coalition to support early-stage clean energy companies.

"“Thank You to Our Sponsors: ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell...” This was the first message to greet us upon arrival at the 2015 American Geophysical Union (AGU) fall meeting - the world’s largest gathering of Earth and space scientists.  As aspiring and early career environmental scientists, this was a dismaying welcome, for we are immensely disturbed and angered by the well-documented complicity of these companies in climate denial and disinformation. For example, recent investigative journalism has shed light on the fact that ExxonMobil, informed by their in-house scientists, has known about the devastating global warming effects of fossil fuel burning since the late 1970s, but spent the next decades funding disinformation campaigns to confuse the public, slander scientists, and sabotage science - the very science conducted by thousands of AGU members. Even today, ExxonMobil and Chevron continue to fund the American Legislative Exchange Council, a lobbying group that routinely misrepresents climate science to US state legislators and attempts to block pro-renewable energy policies.  The impacts of Exxon’s tactics have been devastating. Thanks in part to Exxon, the American public remains confused and polarized about climate change. Thanks in part to Exxon, climate science-denying Republicans in Congress and lobby groups operating at the state level remain a major obstacle to U.S. efforts to mitigate climate change.  And thanks in no small part to Exxon, climate action has been delayed at the global level; as the international community began to consider curbing greenhouse gas emissions with the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, Exxon orchestrated and funded anti-Kyoto campaigns, including participation in the Global Climate Coalition. The latter was so successful at shifting debate that the George W. Bush administration credited it with playing a key role in its rejection of the Kyoto Protocol. Yet throughout the week-long conference of Earth scientists, Exxon was promoted as an excellent career option. The geoscience professionals showcase - an “opportunity to talk with featured employers” - proudly included Exxon. In a series of career advice workshops on transitioning beyond academia, our speaker more than once named Exxon as a potential employer in her hypothetical case studies, whereas cigarette company Benson & Hedges was derisively put forward as an example recruiter we’d never dream of accepting. As the week drew to an end, we were left to wonder why it is that at the largest convergence of Earth and climate scientists, the hosting organization would seemingly engage in a serious conflict of interest by enthusiastically accepting support from companies that actively undermine the work of many of its members. Or why, if it’s now taboo to work for tobacco companies because they deceived the public about the dangers of smoking, the next generation of Earth science scholars still finds encouragement in pursuing careers in the fossil fuel industry, which continues to twist truths about climate change.  Some may argue that Exxon atones for its wrongdoings in other ways, but its actions are invariably in bad faith. For example, the company has never put its weight behind a carbon tax despite claims of support for the concept. It is the very disingenuousness of Exxon’s ways that makes their greenwashing efforts - like sponsoring AGU - so crucial to their survival.  AGU states that its mission and core values are to “promote discovery in Earth science for the benefit of humanity” and for “a sustainable future.” But by allowing Exxon to appropriate AGU’s institutional social license to help legitimize the company’s climate disinformation, and by granting it the privilege to recruit from AGU’s own cohort of emerging scholars, AGU is undermining the work of its own members. The issue of career paths also raises a deeper question that we as a community must address - however uncomfortable - as to why we are still promoting the training and recruitment of the next generation of scientists to develop future technologies and methods for discovering more oil and gas reserves, when science has told us that no more than one third of existing reserves can be burned to avoid dangerous climate change. When it comes to Earth sciences, AGU has established a long history of scientific excellence with its peer-reviewed publications and conferences, and we’re proud to be included among its members. It is for this very reason we hope that, instead of thanking Exxon, AGU will now say, “No, thank you, Exxon.” This issue has been an elephant in the room for too long. It’s high time AGU protects the integrity of climate science and the message it sends to the public by cutting ties with a climate-denying corporation and by denouncing Exxon for its disinforming ways.

"The single biggest contributor to climate change in California is a blown-out natural gas well more than 8,700ft underground, state authorities and campaign groups said Monday. The broken well at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage site has released more than 77,000 metric tons of the powerful climate pollutant methane since the rupture was first detected on 23 October, according to a counter created by the Environmental Defense Fund.   Methane is a fast-acting climate pollutant – more than 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame. Experts believe the breach, which has forced the evacuation of hundreds of residents from the town of Porter Ranch, is the largest ever in the US. Locals have complained of headaches, sore throats, nosebleeds and nausea, caused by the rotten-egg smell of the odorant added to the gas to aid leak detection by SoCalGas, the utility that operates the natural gas storage site. About 1,000 people are suing the company. There are also concerns about the leak’s effect on smog and ozone. The company said it was monitoring air quality. The leak is unlikely to be brought under control before late February – and even that timetable depends on work crews’ success in locating and plugging a 7-inch pipe deep underground. Campaign groups said the release undercuts Barack Obama’s efforts to slow the rate of global warming to avoid a tipping point and live up to US commitments to a historic climate accord agreed in Paris last month.  Obama is expected to tout his climate agenda during his State of the Union address on 12 January – one of his last big moments remaining to promote a key presidential priority. Carbon dioxide is still the biggest driver of climate change. But because methane emissions are on the rise and exercise such a powerful effect in the short-term, they are a growing source of concern as governments try to avoid a climate tipping point. A byproduct of the oil and gas industry and agriculture, methane accounts for about a quarter of the world’s warming. The release of methane from the ruptured well has now slowed considerably since its peak in late November, according to Carb. Back then, the climate impact was equivalent to the daily emissions from 7 million cars – or the equivalent of six coal-fired power plants, or three-quarters of the emissions from the state’s entire oil refining industry, according to EDF.  But David Clegern, a spokesman for the agency, said the well remained a major source of climate pollution. “It is in California at this point the single largest source point of global warming,” Clegern said. He also said it was to his knowledge the biggest such natural gas leak ever. “We haven’t been able to see anything anywhere near this size.” The Aliso Canyon well failure was widely seen as the climate equivalent of the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The April 2010 blow-out of BP’s well killed 11 and caused vast damage to fisheries and the environment in the three months it took to get under control. The Aliso Canyon leak is much less visible than BP’s oil disaster, but Mark Brownstein, who heads the climate and energy program at EDF, said it is a serious threat. “For the planet it is a big deal because methane is a such a powerful greenhouse gas, and the huge amount of gas that is escaping,” he said.  The rupture at the Aliso Canyon facility has refocused attention on America’s ageing and accident-prone oil and gas infrastructure. Many such leaks go undetected. The Environmental Protection Agency is due to issue much-anticipated rules to control methane emissions from the oil and gas industry later this year. Gina McCarthy, who heads the EPA, said on Monday that the rules could avoid up to 400,000 metric tons of methane by 2025. The Aliso Canyon storage site is one of the biggest such facilities in the country, and was originally built for the oil industry about 60 years ago. When the oil fields were exhausted, the well was repurposed as a storage site.  R Rex Parris, who is suing the gas company on behalf of Porter Ranch residents, said the site should have been shut down long ago. He faulted the company for removing a blow-out preventer at the bottom of the well in 1979. “They deliberately took the brakes off the car and continued to drive it. That’s the best metaphor I can come up with, he said. “They are saying it’s an accident that they ran into somebody. I’m saying: ‘no, it was inevitable’.” A company spokeswoman said the well was in compliance with state regulations."
