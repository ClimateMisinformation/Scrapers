"The former archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, has backed pupils who have been taking part in school strikes to protest over climate change and who are planning to join a “climate rebellion” next month, warning that the ecological crisis means “the future of the human race is now at stake”. Williams, whose stark comments come amid a growing wave of protests over the scale of the ecological crisis, said non-violent civil disobedience should have “wide and deep” support from the public.  “The nature of changes in climate and environment that we are living with threaten not only the wellbeing but also the being of our species on this planet in the long term – and in the middle term they threaten some of the most vulnerable populations on Earth,” he said. More than 100,000 pupils are planning to walk out of lessons in 60 countries on Friday as part of the schools strike movement. And in April thousands of “concerned citizens” are expected to descend on London for a campaign of mass civil disobedience designed to bring widespread disruption to the capital. In a video message in support of the April event, organised by Extinction Rebellion, known as XR, Williams said: “It is not surprising people in this urgent situation feel they have to take non-violent direct action – they have got to find a way of putting the case for the human race before those in power. That is what Extinction Rebellion [is] doing, that is what the Friday [school] strikes are doing.” XR, which has the support of hundreds of academics and scientists, is demanding the UK government tells the truth about the ecological crisis and enacts legally binding policies to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025. It also wants a citizens’ assembly to oversee the transformation to a sustainable economy. The group closed London bridges in November, and this time it intends to bring widespread disruption to London until its demands are met. There is growing evidence of the scale of the climate emergency. Last year a UN report said there were only 12 years left to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown from floods and heatwaves to food shortages and huge numbers of climate refugees. Williams added: “I believe a wide and deep support from the public is needed to bring this matter fully to the attention of our political leaders. To show we can actually achieve democratic change for the good of everybody.”"
"The coal baron and Liberal National party donor Trevor St Baker has blasted the Reserve Bank deputy governor, Guy Debelle, for sounding the alarm on climate change, branding a significant speech on Tuesday warning of risks to Australia’s financial stability “totally inappropriate”. The politically connected founder of the business electricity retailer ERM Power, who has approached the Morrison government to underwrite new coal developments in Victoria and New South Wales, including a high-efficiency plant on the site of the AGL-owned Liddell power station, told the ABC on Wednesday Debelle’s intervention was out of order.  The RBA deputy governor on Tuesday noted businesses and policymakers needed to consider climate change as a trend and not a cyclical event, and said climate change-induced shocks to the economy would be “close to permanent” if droughts were more frequent and cyclones happened more often. St Baker responded by suggesting Debelle lacked technical understanding of how the electricity market worked. He said Australia was a world leader in the uptake of wind and solar, and declared “wind and solar cannot support an electricity supply system’s voltage and frequency”. “The Reserve Bank governor, the speeches they are making, are totally inappropriate,” he said. “The fact is in an island community, you must have at least 50% at any time of the electricity demand being supported by what we call synchronous generation, that is 24/7 power: nuclear, gas, coal-fired, or baseload hydro. “We don’t have any of those except coal as an economical source that we build a business on, and for the Reserve Bank governor to be entering the debate now, at a time when we have university students supporting, schoolchildren supporting, a strike to go 100% renewable in Australia by 2030 – it’s just part of the problem – especially at election time”. In a separate interview on the ABC, the resources minister Matt Canavan – who has been a forceful advocate inside the government for new coal developments – also defied recent comments from Scott Morrison, declaring there was a “clear need for additional power in north Queensland”. Morrison said earlier in the week the government was not contemplating coal plants in Queensland – which is what a number of Queensland Nationals, including Canavan, want – because a new plant would never be approved by the state government. Canavan told the ABC: “There is a clear need for additional power in north Queensland, multiple studies have shown that, and those studies come back always saying that a Hele [high efficiency plant] or a new coal-fired power station would make a lot of sense in north Queensland”. St Baker’s company signalled it was interested in buying the ageing Liddell plant in 2017 when the then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull publicly castigated AGL, the plant’s owner, for wanting to close the facility in 2022 and replace it with a combination of renewables and gas. But despite the sustained political pressure, AGL has shown no interest in selling the asset. After growing frustration with energy companies, the government last year produced the so-called “big stick” package which created a power to break up energy companies if they engaged in price gouging, which some energy experts have long suspected was a mechanism to remove Liddell from AGL’s ownership. The government was forced to pull the package because it would have to cop a Greens/Labor amendment in the House that would prohibit taxpayer support for new coal-fired power. But rebel Queensland Nationals want it back on the agenda before parliament rises. While Liberals in city seats remain concerned that the government risks losing the coming election, at least in part, because of its record on climate change, Nationals are keeping up the pressure for new coal developments. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, has confirmed the Morrison government is continuing to assess new coal-generation projects despite pushback from moderate Liberals, but he says taxpayers will only support projects that are “viable”. St Baker told the ABC on Wednesday he had brought three potential projects to the government for taxpayer underwriting – a pumped storage project in South Australia, coal projects in Victoria, and a replacement power station on the Liddell site in New South Wales. St Baker said he believed replacing Liddell with a new high-efficiency plant “using all that infrastructure” was the “best solution” if Liddell had to close. He said the projects would be 70% debt financed and 30% equity. He said the government had indicated if projects could secure commercial and industrial customers on five-year contracts it would provide a taxpayer-backed guarantee for the project. Taylor told Guardian Australia on Wednesday the government would only back projects that were “viable”. Nationals have demanded the government support projects whether they have a compelling business case or not."
"Dearbhail McDonald (We need to talk about the children we’re not having, 8 March) makes some interesting points but seems to miss the essential nature of the problem, which is over, not under, population. Our species took some 200,000 years to reach its first billion individuals in the mid-1900s, then doubled that number in 70 years. By the 1960s, by which time the figure had risen to over 3 billion, a number of wise voices were raised but effectively ignored. Now we are approaching 8 billion and overall the numbers are still rising even though just about every existential threat our planet faces is either directly caused or exacerbated by our ever-swelling numbers.  Countries where a decline has set in should be adapting and celebrating what, if managed sensibly, could be the best environmental news in a century. Yes, there will be demographic problems initially. But these can be tackled with a move to a new economic paradigm that our planet needs to survive. Growth economics must be consigned to the dustbin of history and new technology, together with new status and rewards for carers, employed to ameliorate the problems of old age. To do this there needs to be a massive redistribution of wealth and selfish vainglorious politicians must stop trying to coax and con people into having more children. Will this work? Well, it should have started at least half a century ago. But it is the only hope now for our planet and therefore for all of us, because we don’t have a spare one available.Steve EdwardsWivelsfield Green, East Sussex • Yet another article fretting that a falling birth rate “is one of the biggest humanitarian crises of our time”. Sure, in the UK, our pension system, housing and immigration policy need to be overhauled. But please will people face the major problems of the future. There are now more people alive than ever before. Already climate change, species extinction, pollution of seas and air, soil degradation, antibiotic resistance and sea level rise are all having an impact. These factors are global problems that can lead to famine, disease, resource wars and mass migration of climate refugees – a real humanitarian crisis. Recycling and reducing individual consumption will have little effect if there are many more of us, all hoping to live to a reasonable standard.

"For once, Philip Hammond’s spring statement acknowledged the climate crisis and the collapse of wildlife and insect populations around the world. But has the chancellor been swept up by the rising tide of climate activism? Has he been inspired by the courage and passion of the young people joining school strikes to defend their futures? Sadly not. In fact, his announcement of a “global review of the economic benefits of biodiversity” subverts what those activists stand for. Apparently incapable of comprehending the green stuff outside his office window, Spreadsheet Phil is embarking on a project to reduce the wonder of the natural world to a shopping list. While measuring the clarity of our streams, the vibrance of our meadows and the health of our wildlife in financial terms can help to persuade the Hammonds of the world of their value, the government must not succumb to the idea that the living systems we depend on are replaceable. Industries generating profits from destruction will never be more valuable than the skies, the rivers and the landscapes they pollute. His “global review” was just one of a string of consultations, calls for evidence and studies announced in this procrastinating spring statement – when what we need is immediate action. It’s no coincidence that school children are striking on this government’s watch, or that activists are organising as never before. It’s no accident that more than 25 local councils have declared climate emergencies in just the past few months. While the world’s top scientists warn that we have little more than a decade to prevent runaway climate change, and wildlife populations are in freefall around the world, our government is facilitating further attacks on nature. In the UK right now, almost 60% of species are in long-term decline, and one in five mammals are at risk of disappearing altogether. Globally, over the past 40 years, wildlife populations have declined by 60% on average. If ministers were serious about reversing this death spiral, Hammond would have announced urgent funding to restore peatland, forests and soils, and expand protected places where people can engage with nature. Instead, ministers have spent the past decade systematically gutting Natural England – the agency responsible for looking after our most precious habitats. They’ve slashed its budget by more than half, cut around 1,000 staff and crippled its ability to monitor protected areas. Environment secretary Michael Gove might talk a good game on threats like ocean plastics – but he, too, is in the habit of endlessly consulting on plans to consider doing something in a few years’ time. He also says all the right things on pesticides, but in practice has done nothing to stop farmers “drenching” their fields with insect-killing chemicals. On the global scale, as world leaders prepare to set new targets for protecting nature next year, the UK government missed the deadline to submit a key report to the UN on the state of our wildlife and ecosystems. Finally published this week, it admits that ministers will fail to meet all but five of the existing targets for protecting nature – setting us up to fail on the more ambitious goals we urgently need. Meanwhile, as climate chaos takes hold and threatens the wildlife and the landscapes we know and love, our government only adds fuel to the fire. Since 2010, ministers have effectively banned onshore wind energy and undermined solar power – while building a brand new fossil-fuel industry and exporting their enthusiasm for fracking around the world. They scrapped zero carbon homes targets in 2015 – yet the chancellor boasted of announcing “new” energy efficiency standards yesterday. He also said he wants travel providers to offer carbon offsets to passengers – but remains committed to building new runways. Delay, dither and contradiction – that is the government’s approach to the biggest crisis we face. Climate breakdown is happening. Toxic air is killing thousands. Animals are facing extinction. The causes and solutions to these crises are not in doubt: they are the direct result of the chancellor’s single-use, fossil-fuelled, profit-driven economy. Now is not the time for more global reviews and obfuscation – now is the time to transform our economy so it restores the natural world, instead of commodifying and consuming it. But yesterday’s announcements are a sign that ears are pricking up in Downing Street. Ministers can hear the rising voices outside – and they know they cannot be ignored. The school strikers and climate activists have attracted enough attention to warrant a fobbing-off. If they persist, they might just win the real action they’re demanding. • Caroline Lucas is the MP for Brighton Pavilion"

"Gas boilers will be replaced by low-carbon heating systems in all new homes built after 2025 in an attempt to tackle the escalating climate crisis, Philip Hammond has said. In his spring statement, the chancellor said new properties would use alternative systems, such as heat pumps, to help the UK reduce its carbon emissions.  However, Hammond appeared to row back on implementing the full recommendations from the government’s advisory committee on climate change last month, which called for new homes to have no gas for cooking or heating from 2025. The move away from gas heating in new homes was given a cautious welcome by environmental groups, although they said the chancellor had to be more ambitious, systemic and radical if the government was to get to grips with the climate emergency. Housebuilders said they supported moves to more environmentally sustainable systems, but alternative heating was often more expensive and less effective. A spokesperson for the Home Builders Federation said the ongoing “costs and comfort of homeowners was an absolute priority” for its members, pointing out that heat pumps required bigger radiators and did not work as well in cold snaps. “New technologies are increasingly being incorporated that drive down emissions and we are committed to continuing to work with government on this … [however] it must be ensured that alternative heat sources are suitably attractive, available and efficient before withdrawing existing options,” he said. The report from the committee on climate change said it would cost £4,800 to install low-carbon heating in a new home, but £26,300 in an existing house. Around 14% of UK greenhouse gas emissions come from homes and last year emissions from housing increased – mainly from gas boilers. The committee said that to meet the UK’s existing climate targets, considered too weak by many, all homes would have to virtually eliminate emissions in the future. However, a spokesman for the Treasury said no funding had been allocated to support the move to sustainable heating systems, adding that the plan would go out to consultation later this year. Hammond’s announcement on gas boilers was one of a series of environmental measures unveiled in his statement, alongside the protection of the waters around Ascension Island in the Atlantic, a new carbon offset scheme for aviation and a comprehensive global review of the link between biodiversity and economic growth, led by Prof Partha Dasgupta. But environmental groups said the measures did not go far enough. Mel Evans, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said although the plan to end fossil fuels in new homes was vital – and she welcomed the measures to protect wildlife – tackling the climate crisis required bigger thinking. “Issues like the shoddy state of our existing housing stock and rapid adoption of electric vehicles require serious money behind serious policies,” such as banning new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030, she said. Dave Timms, from Friends of the Earth, said: “The chancellor should have announced a massive programme of investment in home insulation and public transport, instead of pushing the false solution of carbon offsetting for aviation.” Prof Sam Fankhauser, from the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said the move was a “welcome step towards reducing carbon emissions” that had the potential to “significantly reduce emissions, especially if these are accompanied by measures to make homes more energy efficient. “To be fully effective, stringent standards for new homes need to be complemented by more funding for energy efficiency upgrades in existing homes, such as for insulation and better boilers.”"
"The New South Wales opposition leader, Michael Daley, has backed the state’s schoolchildren striking and attending rallies on climate change, saying it was a democratic right to protest and “an important way to realise their own personal power”. Speaking at a National Press Club event in Sydney, Daley said he supported the rallies on Friday, even though he might soon be the premier and responsible for ensuring children attend school. “Education is also bigger than the classroom. It is based on life experience. That is, in part, the importance of being confident and passionate enough to form beliefs and being prepared to stand up for them,” he said. “They don’t have a microphone or money like the big end of town. But they do have their democratic right to assembly. I support that right to protest especially when it comes to climate change and our fragile environment. “And more importantly in this inert digital age, of acting on that belief. Of standing up and taking action for what you believe in – it is called leadership.” Labor has sought to distinguish itself from the Coalition by promising more rapid action on climate change, including installing seven gigawatts of regional solar farms and establishing a rebate scheme to encourage households to install a further two gigawatts of rooftop solar. Daley has also promised to review the state’s water-sharing laws that are being blamed in part for fish deaths at Menindee Lake, and to repeal the Coalition’s more liberal native vegetation laws that have allowed an increase in clearing. He foreshadowed more announcements on the environment before the 23 March election. Daley’s solo appearance at the press club was initially planned as a debate, but the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, was unable to attend as she was campaigning in northern NSW. Daley backed the call from his shadow treasurer, Ryan Park, for higher wages growth for the state’s 400,000 public servants, amid concerns from the Reserve Bank about sluggish wages growth nationally and community concerns about the cost of living. Park said he would like wages growth “with a three in front of it”. In 2011 the Coalition government introduced a 2.5% cap on annual public sector wage increases, with higher increments possible only if offset by productivity savings. Daley said he would introduce an independent umpire, so that workers such as paramedics would be able to argue they had increased their skills and deserved a higher pay rise. But he refused to say how much a pay rise of 3% or more would cost the state budget. Although he has been campaigning on overdevelopment in several Sydney electorates, Daley said he would not be taking a significantly different path from the government, and would keep the Greater Sydney Commission, which sets targets for levels of new housing in each area. However, he has promised to abolish “spot rezonings” – where developers can ask for particular sites to be rezoned – and promised to return more power to councils to ensure “fairness and certainty” in the planning system. He said there had been political interference in the housing targets set by the Greater Sydney Commission which meant Woollahra, in Liberal heartland, has a target of only 300 new dwellings, while western Sydney has borne the brunt of accommodating new housing."
"Strikes at schools around the world on 15 March are the latest in a snowballing global youth movement calling for action on climate change that began in Sweden in 2018 and now crosses continents. Activity across 51 nations, including the first such nationwide strike in the US, where almost 500 events are listed under the banner FridaysForFuture, comes four months since Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, told students taking part there to go home and “be less activist”. Thousands of pupils from Japan, Germany, Belgium and the UK among others have already walked out of lessons in recent months. In 2018 a landmark UN report said there were 12 years left to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown from floods and heatwaves to food shortages and huge numbers of climate refugees. Now, the students striking from schools around the world have issued an uncompromising letter stating: “We are going to change the fate of humanity, whether you like it or not.” We’d like to hear from young people around the world who are taking part in events on Friday, as well as parents and teachers, and find out more about the day from your perspective.

"Tens of thousands of Australian school students are expected to walk out of class on Friday to demand governments take action on climate change. The Australian strikes are part of a global campaign by students for greater urgency from politicians in tackling what they see as the greatest threat to their future. Here’s a guide to what’s happening. Friday’s strikes are part of a global day of protest in 100 countries. More than 1,500 strike events are planned around the world. As of Thursday afternoon, strikes were planned at 60 locations in Australia, most of them regional areas. There will be strikes in every state and territory and every capital city. Sydney: 12 noon at Town Hall Canberra: 12 noon at Garema Place Melbourne: 12 noon at the Old Treasury Building Hobart: 12 noon at Parliament House Brisbane: 1pm at Queen’s Gardens Adelaide: 11am at Parliament House Perth: 11am at St George’s Cathedral Darwin: 12 noon at Parliament House The full list of strike locations is here. School students, their parents and friends. Faith and human rights groups will attend, along with representatives for the health sector. More than 20 unions have endorsed the strike, including the Australian Education Union, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union and United Voice. Eight hundred academics have expressed solidarity for the students. The 2019 Australian of the Year, Craig Challen, wrote this week that he felt it was his duty to support the students. He will attend the strike in Sydney. The students have been inspired by Swedish school student Greta Thunberg, who has been striking every Friday outside the Swedish parliament since last August. Her determination has sparked a global movement. In November, thousands of Australian school students went on strike. This time there are more locations and organisers are expecting the number of students attending to be at least double what it was in November. Because they are tired of waiting for adults to make the massive changes necessary to avoid catastrophic climate change. They see climate change as an existential threat and fear for their futures.  They have lived through Australia’s recent record-breaking extreme weather and know climate change is already happening and time is running out to do something about it. They are speaking up because for years Australia’s political leaders have failed them. They have written a list of demands here . Manjot Kaur, 17, is one of the organisers of the Sydney strike. “The action of striking is so important,” she said. “Students are so afraid, so upset, so worried about their future that they’re literally sacrificing their education to show how serious this problem is. “Because right now we aren’t treating it as a crisis. The act of striking is us saying this needs to be treated as an emergency.”"
"Australia’s annual carbon emissions have reached a new high and drops in emissions from the electricity sector have been wiped out by increases from other industries, according to new data. Ndevr Environmental, an emissions-tracking organisation that releases quarterly greenhouse gas emissions data, said on Thursday that annual emissions for the year up to December 2018 increased to 558.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. It was the highest level on record when excluding unreliable land use data. Ndevr’s data showed Australia was still not on track to meet its Paris target of a 26-28% reduction in emissions on 2005 levels and that carbon pollution was increasing across most sectors of the economy. The Morrison government has repeatedly claimed Australia will meet its targets “in a canter” and was criticised earlier this month for falsely claiming emissions were decreasing. The Ndevr report said emissions in the December quarter decreased by 1.4m tonnes on the September quarter. But it also highlighted that emissions increased by 0.9m tonnes on the same quarter a year ago. Emissions fluctuate seasonally, with the September quarter typically recording the highest emissions levels within each year. “This quarter rounds out the calendar year for 2018 and what it shows is that emissions have increased again to a record high,” Matt Drum, Ndevr’s managing director, said. The report shows emissions from the electricity sector continue to decline due to large-scale renewable energy projects. But those gains were cancelled out by increases in emissions from all forms of transport, stationary energy (fuels burnt in equipment or plants not involved in electricity generation) and fugitive emissions (leaks from other activities such as methane from a coalmine). “Over 2018 electricity emissions decreased by about 7m tonnes but those three sources together increased by more than 12.5m tonnes,” Drum said. Climate scientists have warned policymakers that emissions outside of the power sector account for the majority of Australia’s carbon pollution. Australia is lagging behind other countries in setting new national vehicle emissions standards and transitioning to electric cars. “It’s something we’ve been screaming from the rooftops for a long time now,” Drum said. “The electricity sector is not the problem. The problem is all other sectors that aren’t subject to any real binding carbon emissions reduction target or policy.”"
"Extractive industries are responsible for half of the world’s carbon emissions and more than 80% of biodiversity loss, according to the most comprehensive environmental tally undertaken of mining and farming. While this is crucial for food, fuel and minerals, the study by UN Environment warns the increasing material weight of the world’s economies is putting a more dangerous level of stress on the climate and natural life-support systems than previously thought.  Resources are being extracted from the planet three times faster than in 1970, even though the population has only doubled in that time, according to the Global Resources Outlook, which was released in Nairobi on Tuesday. Each year, the world consumes more than 92b tonnes of materials – biomass (mostly food), metals, fossil fuels and minerals – and this figure is growing at the rate of 3.2% per year. Since 1970, extraction of of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) has increased from 6bn tonnes to 15bn tonnes, metals have risen by 2.7% a year, other minerals (particularly sand and gravel for concrete) have surged nearly fivefold from 9bn to 44bn tonnes, and biomass harvests have gone up from 9bn to 24bn tonnes. Up until 2000, this was a huge boost to the global economy, but since then there has been a diminishing rate of return as resources become more expensive to extract and the environmental costs become harder to ignore. “The global economy has focused on improvements in labour productivity at the cost of material and energy productivity. This was justifiable in a world where labour was the limiting factor of production. We have moved into a world where natural resources and environmental impacts have become the limiting factor of production and shifts are required to focus on resource productivity,” says the study. The economic benefits and environmental costs are broken down by sector. Land use change – mostly for agriculture – accounts for over 80% of biodiversity loss and 85% of water stress as forests and swamps are cleared for cropland that needs irrigation. Extraction and primary processing of metals and other minerals is responsible for 20% of health impacts from air pollution and 26% of global carbon emissions. The biggest surprise to the authors was the huge climate impact of pulling materials out of the ground and preparing them for use. All the sectors combined together accounted for 53% of the world’s carbon emissions – even before accounting for any fuel that is burned. “I would never have expected that half of climate impacts can be attributed to resource extraction and processing,” said Stefanie Hellweg, one of the authors of the paper. “It showed how resources are hiding behind products. By focusing on them, their tremendous impact became apparent.” The paper highlights growing inequalities. In rich countries, people consume an average of 9.8 tonnes of resources a year, the weight of two elephants. This is 13 times higher than low incomes groups. Much of this is unseen because huge amounts of materials are often needed for a small end product, such as a mobile phone. Izabella Teixeira, former environment minister of Brazil, said the report highlighted how rich consumer nations have exported environmental stress to poor producing countries. With this model now hitting climate and biodiversity boundaries that affect everyone on the planet, she said it was time for change. “Currently decisions are being based on the past but we need to base them on the future. That means leadership.” Where leadership could come from is difficult to see in the current political environment. The US and Brazil are slashing existing environmental regulations. China has moved ahead on renewables and pollution, but its growth is even more material-intensive than developed nations. According to the report, Asia is driving the fastest demand for minerals among upper-middle income countries, which now – because of their big populations – have a greater combined material weight than wealthy nations. The authors said it was essential to decouple economic growth from material consumption. Without change, they said resource demand would more than double to 190bn tonnes a year, greenhouse gases would rise by 40% and demand for land would increase by 20%. However, they said this dire scenario could be avoided if there is a faster transition towards renewables, smarter urban planning to reduce the demand for concrete, dietary changes to lower the need for grazing pastures and cut levels of waste (currently a third of all food), and a greater focus on creating a cyclical economy that re-uses more materials. They also called for a switch of taxation policies away from income and towards carbon and resource extraction. “It is possible to grow in a different way with fewer side-effects. This report is clear proof that it is possible and with higher growth,” said Janez Potočnik, co-chair of International Resource Panel and former environment commissioner for the European Union. “It’s not an easy job to do, but believe me the alternative is much worse.”"
"Greta Thunberg cut a frail and lonely figure when she started a school strike for the climate outside the Swedish parliament building last August. Her parents tried to dissuade her. Classmates declined to join. Passersby expressed pity and bemusement at the sight of the then unknown 15-year-old sitting on the cobblestones with a hand-painted banner. Eight months on, the picture could not be more different. The pigtailed teenager is feted across the world as a model of determination, inspiration and positive action. National presidents and corporate executives line up to be criticised by her, face to face. Her skolstrejk för klimatet (school strike for climate) banner has been translated into dozens of languages. And, most striking of all, the loner is now anything but alone. On 15 March, when she returns to the cobblestones (as she has done almost every Friday in rain, sun, ice and snow), it will be as a figurehead for a vast and growing movement. The global climate strike this Friday is gearing up to be one of the biggest environmental protests the world has ever seen. As it approaches, Thunberg is clearly excited. “It’s amazing,” she says. “It’s more than 71 countries and more than 700 places, and counting. It’s increasing very much now, and that’s very, very fun.” A year ago, this was unimaginable. Back then, Thunberg was a painfully introverted, slightly built nobody, waking at 6am to prepare for school and heading back home at 3pm. “Nothing really was happening in my life,” she recalls. “I have always been that girl in the back who doesn’t say anything. I thought I couldn’t make a difference because I was too small.” She was never quite like the other kids. Her mother, Malena Ernman, is one of Sweden’s most celebrated opera singers. Her father, Svante Thunberg, is an actor and author (named after Svante Arrhenius, the Nobel prize-winning scientist who in 1896 first calculated how carbon dioxide emissions could lead to the greenhouse effect). Greta was exceptionally bright. Four years ago, she was diagnosed with Asperger’s. “I overthink. Some people can just let things go, but I can’t, especially if there’s something that worries me or makes me sad. I remember when I was younger, and in school, our teachers showed us films of plastic in the ocean, starving polar bears and so on. I cried through all the movies. My classmates were concerned when they watched the film, but when it stopped, they started thinking about other things. I couldn’t do that. Those pictures were stuck in my head.” She has come to accept this as part of who she is – and made it a motivating force instead of a source of paralysing depression, which it once was. At about the age of eight, when she first learned about climate change, she was shocked that adults did not appear to be taking the issue seriously. It was not the only reason she became depressed a few years later, but it was a significant factor. “I kept thinking about it and I just wondered if I am going to have a future. And I kept that to myself because I’m not very much of a talker, and that wasn’t healthy. I became very depressed and stopped going to school. When I was home, my parents took care of me, and we started talking because we had nothing else to do. And then I told them about my worries and concerns about the climate crisis and the environment. And it felt good to just get that off my chest. “They just told me everything will be all right. That didn’t help, of course, but it was good to talk. And then I kept on going, talking about this all the time and showing my parents pictures, graphs and films, articles and reports. And, after a while, they started listening to what I actually said. That’s when I kind of realised I could make a difference. And how I got out of that depression was that I thought: it is just a waste of time feeling this way because I can do so much good with my life. I am trying to do that still now.” Her parents were the guinea pigs. She discovered she had remarkable powers of persuasion, and her mother gave up flying, which had a severe impact on her career. Her father became a vegetarian. As well as feeling relieved by the transformation of their formerly quiet and morose daughter, they say they were persuaded by her reasoning. “Over the years, I ran out of arguments,” says her father. “She kept showing us documentaries, and we read books together. Before that, I really didn’t have a clue. I thought we had the climate issue sorted,” he says. “She changed us and now she is changing a great many other people. There was no hint of this in her childhood. It’s unbelievable. If this can happen, anything can happen.” The climate strike was inspired by students from the Parkland school in Florida, who walked out of classes in protest against the US gun laws that enabled the massacre on their campus. Greta was part of a group that wanted to do something similar to raise awareness about climate change, but they couldn’t agree what. Last summer, after a record heatwave in northern Europe and forest fires that ravaged swathes of Swedish land up to the Arctic, Thunberg decided to go it alone. Day one was 20 August 2018. “I painted the sign on a piece of wood and, for the flyers, wrote down some facts I thought everyone should know. And then I took my bike to the parliament and just sat there,” she recalls. “The first day, I sat alone from about 8.30am to 3pm – the regular schoolday. And then on the second day, people started joining me. After that, there were people there all the time.” She kept her promise to strike every day until the Swedish national elections. Afterwards, she agreed to make a speech in front of thousands of people at a People’s Climate March rally. Her parents were reluctant. Knowing Thunberg had been so reticent that she had previously been diagnosed with selective mutism, they tried to talk her out of it. But the teenager was determined. “In some cases where I am really passionate, I will not change my mind,” she says. Despite her family’s concerns, she delivered the address in nearly flawless English, and invited the crowd to film her on their mobile phones and spread the message through social media. “I cried,” says her proud dad. People with selective mutism have a tendency to worry more than others. Thunberg has since weaponised this in meetings with political leaders, and with billionaire entrepreneurs in Davos. “I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act,” she told them. Such tongue-lashings have gone down well. Many politicians laud her candidness. In return, she listens to their claims that stronger climate policies are unrealistic unless the public make the issue more of a priority. She is unconvinced. “They are still not doing anything. So I don’t know really why they are supporting us because we are criticising them. It’s kind of weird.” She has also been withering about leaders in the US, UK and Australia who either ignore the strikers or admonish them for skipping classes. “They are desperately trying to change the subject whenever the school strikes come up. They know they can’t win this fight because they haven’t done anything.” Such blunt talk has found a broad audience among people jaded by empty promises and eager to find a climate leader willing to ramp up ambition. Thunberg’s rise coincides with growing scientific concern. A slew of recent reports has warned oceans are heating and the poles melting faster than expected. Last year’s UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spelled out the dangers of surpassing 1.5C of global warming. To have any chance of avoiding that outcome, it said, emissions must fall rapidly by 2030. That will require far more pressure on politicians – and nobody has proved more effective at that over the past eight months than Thunberg. The girl who once slipped into despair is now a beacon of hope. One after another, veteran campaigners and grizzled scientists have described her as the best news for the climate movement in decades. She has been lauded at the UN, met the French president, Emmanuel Macron, shared a podium with the European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and has been endorsed by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. No, I am not more hopeful than when I started. The emissions are increasing You may think this would put the weight of the world on the 16-year-old’s shoulders, but she claims to feel no pressure. If “people are so desperate for hope”, she says, that is not her or the other strikers’ responsibility. “I don’t care if what I’m doing – what we’re doing – is hopeful. We need to do it anyway. Even if there’s no hope left and everything is hopeless, we must do what we can.” In this regard, her family see her Asperger’s as a blessing. She is someone who strips away social distractions and focuses with black-and-white clarity on the issues. “It’s nothing that I want to change about me,” she says. “It’s just who I am. If I had been just like everyone else and been social, then I would have just tried to start an organisation. But I couldn’t do that. I’m not very good with people, so I did something myself instead.” While she has little time for chit-chat, she gets satisfaction from speaking to a big audience about climate change. Regardless of the size of the crowd, she says she does not feel the least bit nervous. She seems incapable of the cognitive dissonance that allows other people to lament what is happening to the climate one minute, then tuck into a steak, buy a car or fly off for a weekend break the next. Although Thunberg believes political action far outweighs individual changes to consumer habits, she lives her values. She is a vegan, and only travels abroad by train. At its best, this sharpness can slice through the Gordian knot of the climate debate. It can also sting. There are no comfortable reassurances in her speech, just a steady frankness. Asked whether she has become more optimistic because the climate issue has risen up the political agenda and politicians in the US and Europe are considering green New Deals that would ramp up the transition to renewable energy, her reply is brutally honest. “No, I am not more hopeful than when I started. The emissions are increasing and that is the only thing that matters. I think that needs to be our focus. We cannot talk about anything else.” Some people consider this a threat. A handful of fossil fuel lobbyists, politicians and journalists have argued Thunberg is not what she seems; that she was propelled into prominence by environmental groups and sustainable business interests. They say the entrepreneur who first tweeted about the climate strike, Ingmar Rentzhog, used Thunberg’s name to raise investment for his company, but her father says the connection was overblown. Greta, he says, initiated the strike before anyone in the family had heard of Rentzhog. As soon as she found he had used her name without her permission, she cut all links with the company, and has since vowed never to be associated with commercial interests. Her family says she has never been paid for her activities. In a recent interview, Rentzhog defended his actions, denied exploiting Greta and said that climate change, not profit, was his motive. On social media, there have been other crude attacks on Thunberg’s reputation and appearance. Already familiar with bullying from school, she appears unfazed. “I expected when I started that if this is going to become big, then there will be a lot of hate,” she says. “It’s a positive sign. I think that must be because they see us as a threat. That means that something has changed in the debate, and we are making a difference.” She intends to strike outside parliament every Friday until the Swedish government’s policies are in line with the Paris climate agreement. This has led to what she calls “strange contrasts”: balancing her maths homework with her fight to save the planet; listening attentively to teachers and decrying the immaturity of world leaders; weighing up the existential threat of climate change alongside the agonising choice of what subjects to study in high school. It can be gruelling. She still gets up at 6am to get ready for school. Interviews and writing speeches can leave her working 12- to 15-hour days. “Of course, it takes a lot of energy. I don’t have much spare time. But I just keep reminding myself why I am doing this, and then I just try to do as much as I can.” So far, this does not appear to have affected her academic performance. She keeps up with homework and is in the top five in her class, according to her father. And now that she is active on climate, she is no longer lonely, no longer silent, no longer so depressed. She is too busy trying to make a difference. And enjoying herself. This Friday, when she takes her usual spot outside the Swedish parliament, she will be joined by classmates and students from other schools. “It’s going to be very, very big internationally, with hundreds of thousands of children going to strike from school to say that we aren’t going to accept this any more,” she says. “I think we are only seeing the beginning. I think that change is on the horizon and the people will stand up for their future.” And then the activist slips back into being a teenager. “I’m looking forward to it and to see all the pictures the day afterwards. It’s going to be fun.” • This article was amended on 11 March 2019 to revise an explanation of mutism. An earlier version of the piece said: “People with selective mutism typically do not suffer from an inability to talk; rather, they choose not to engage in conversations they do not consider worthwhile.” This is not the accepted definition. The National Health Service, for example, notes: “Selective mutism is a severe anxiety disorder where a person is unable to speak in certain social situations , such as with classmates at school or to relatives they don’t see very often … A child or adult with selective mutism doesn’t refuse or choose not to speak, they’re literally unable to speak.”"
"My name is Hugh Hunter. I am 15 years old and I live on a farm in Gunnedah in regional NSW. This Friday, I am joining hundreds of thousands of students around the world to strike from school and call for urgent political action to stop the climate crisis. Our message to politicians is simple: if you care about us, our kids and their kids, then please treat climate change for what it is – a crisis – and take urgent action to stop it.  That means stopping Adani’s monstrous coal mine, saying no to all new fossil fuel projects and rapidly transitioning Australia to 100% renewable energy by no later than 2030. My principal doesn’t want me to join the strike, and I do see his point of view. But it wasn’t until I heard about the school strike that I felt I could do something about the climate crisis. When I walk out those gates on Friday I will be creating hope for myself and my generation. I am only at school for another two years but I will be feeling the effects of climate change for the rest of my life. It’s not only Gunnedah that is grappling with climate change. I see the impacts everywhere: the crippling drought that is pushing farmers to the brink, sea levels rising and increasing catastrophic events, yet still many people deny it is happening. The evidence is everywhere, and ignoring it isn’t going to make it go away. But this crisis isn’t just about us. It’s about the people and countries that are too poor to change or don’t have the right to ask for it. These are also the people we are standing up for because we all have to share this world, and at the moment some countries are suffering the worst when they contributed the least to the problem. The climate crisis is not a vague future threat. It is here and it is hurting people right now. The cause of all this is short term thinking. Our government wants what they think is good for Australia; however, this means profits come first and it seems that not much thought is given to the repercussions and long term impacts. I have friends and family that work in coal mining, and I don’t want to risk their livelihoods. But our governments must put in place strategies to transition to 100% renewables immediately. We have the sun and the space for renewables – and they don’t risk our water, communities and climate the way that fossil fuels do. In NSW, 14 new and expanding coal mine projects are in the approvals pipeline. This includes one right near me on the banks of the Namoi River. According to analysis by Lock the Gate these projects would together produce more carbon pollution than Adani’s mega mine proposed for Queensland, and contaminate our valuable water sources. Meanwhile, politicians are discussing the Narrabri Gas Field which is likely to open up our farms to more across the state. Why are these projects and Adani’s coal mine even up for discussion? Communities like mine are already grappling with climate change. Us young people shouldn’t have to go to bed each night worrying about how much worse off we’ll be if all these new coal and gas projects go ahead. As school students, we can’t vote yet. But it’s us who will have to clean up the mess that our politicians are leaving behind. This is not fair, and that is why we are striking. The scientists tell us we have just over a decade to turn the climate crisis around. I will not even be 30 by then. My whole life will be ahead of me, as will the lives of today’s almost 2 billion children. So on 15 March we strike – in over 50 locations across Australia and over 70 countries around the world. And then we go back to our communities to continue the hard work moving Australia beyond fossil fuels to a brighter future for everyone. See you at the strike! • Hugh Hunter is 15 years old and lives in Gunnedah"

"Jeremy Corbyn has downplayed the Brexit crisis by claiming that poverty and climate change are far greater priorities for Labour and the country. Addressing Scottish Labour’s annual conference, Corbyn said his party was not “obsessed by constitutional questions, like the others are. We’re obsessed, absolutely obsessed, with tackling the problems people face in their daily lives”. In an apparent effort to shift the focus away from his party’s deep divisions over Brexit, Corbyn said the UK’s greatest challenge was global warming. “We are facing a climate crisis. There’s no bigger threat to our future. And fundamentally, the destruction of our climate is a class issue,” he said. “We believe that the real divide in our society is not between people who voted yes or no for [Scottish] independence. It’s not between people who voted to remain or to leave the EU,” he told party members in Dundee. “The real divide is between the many – who do the work, create the wealth and pay their taxes – and the few, who set the rules, reap the rewards, and dodge their taxes. So let me spell it out: our mission is to back the working class, in all its diversity. And that’s what drives our approach to Brexit.” Lesley Laird, the shadow Scottish secretary, echoed his emphasis on poverty and class in her conference speech. However, the party’s pro-EU parliamentarians believe Corbyn’s remarks were designed to highlight his hostility to anti-Brexit forces within his party. Ian Murray, a Scottish Labour MP at the forefront of the pro-Europe campaign, said Corbyn was right to point out poverty and climate change had been overshadowed by Brexit. But he added: “Where he is completely wrong is, we can’t resolve these issues with Brexit because Brexit makes delivery of them that much harder. His timing is off. The most meaningful vote on Brexit, the biggest vote in parliamentary history, is next Tuesday. So we need laser-like focus on that, please – and the rest we can deal with later.” Stephen Doughty, a pro-remain Welsh Labour backbencher, said Brexit was a “rightwing Tory project that threatens communities that depend on Labour. [There] is no such thing as a Labour Brexit or a jobs-first Brexit”. The Scottish party has been beset by bitter rows over Europe after a conference statement by its two MEPs, David Martin and Catherine Stihler, was allegedly edited to remove remarks in support of a people’s vote. With pro-European figures in the party convinced that both Corbyn and Labour’s Scottish leader, Richard Leonard, prefer Brexit to remaining in the EU, its Scottish executive decided to include backing for a second referendum in Sunday’s conference agenda only on Thursday night. Corbyn insisted that Labour would attempt to block Theresa May’s deal in Tuesday’s Commons vote and resist a no-deal exit from the EU. Hinting at his lack of enthusiasm for a second referendum, he stressed again that he wanted a general election, before adding that only if that did not take place “we will be ready to support a public vote to prevent disaster”. Corbyn said Labour would commit his party to a target of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, a goal many climate experts and campaigners say is not fast or ambitious enough to halt runaway climate change. “It’s working-class communities that suffer the worst pollution and the worst air quality,” he said. “It’s working-class people who will lose their jobs as resources run dry. And it is working-class people who will be left behind as the rich escape rising sea levels. “Big corporations will never do anything serious about it. The Conservative government will never do anything serious about it either. But Labour will make it a central objective of our industrial strategy. We need to reduce our net emissions to zero by 2050 at the latest. It’s not just an ecological priority – it’s a socialist priority too.” Corbyn also addressed the antisemitism problems engulfing Labour, saying he was “utterly determined” to rid the party of the scourge. He said that, rather than fighting within itself, his party should turn its fire on the Tories. “The only thing that can hold us back is if we were to turn our fire on each other rather than on the Tory government and the wealthy establishment interests they represent,” he told delegates. The Labour leader added: “Racism, religious bigotry and misogyny have no place whatsoever in any part of our movement. And we will root out antisemitism in our party, and in society at large. And I am utterly determined to achieve that.” "

"Extinction Rebellion is an environmental direct action group  If you had told me a few years ago that I would be involved in an environmental movement, I would have thought you were joking. I was far more interested in social inequality and minority rights. But I came to realise that the environment crisis is the biggest threat to us all, and it is people from my background – more disadvantaged, ethnic minority – who are going to bear the brunt of what is coming. The environment is often seen as a white, middle-class issue, while people from my demographic have other things to worry about, such as putting food on the table and paying the bills. But I went along to the first Extinction Rebellion meetings and found that they were organised and people were prepared to do what it takes to make a change: sleeping on office floors, working until 4am, or running around London in the rain, blocking roads – all of which I have done. Being part of that is incredibly inspiring – after a successful action, you can really feel the electricity in the room. But it is also emotionally draining. I was involved in the swarming protests blocking roads, and I saw that we were making life harder for people who were just trying to get to work. But when I raised that point, my voice was heard, and so we are working hard to take actions that only directly impact the elite, who are complicit in creating environmental harm . We have a huge movement building towards Rebellion Day on 15 April and it is incredibly exciting to see it come together. I want to let people know that this is their fight too. Climate justice is tied up with fights for equality and our wider rights – if we don’t take this on, then everything else will be lost. We cannot afford to stand by and do nothing. MT Founded the Ella Roberta Family Foundation, in memory of her nine-year-old daughter who died in 2013. She is campaigning for a new inquest into her daughter’s death, which she believes is linked to air pollution. My daughter suffered terribly – she would stop breathing, have seizures and I would take her to A&E – but no one could explain why it was happening. When she died, I wanted answers. I wanted to know how she became so ill, so quickly; how she died so quickly. She died of an asthma attack, but all the doctors could come up with as a trigger was “something in the air”. She was allergic to pollen, but the consultant said there was no way that her seizure was an allergy to pollen. The first inquest did not come up with any answers. I did not think of air pollution. This was new to me. If you’re a scientist and this is your specialist area, it might not be surprising, but I didn’t know about particulates and nitrogen dioxide. Awareness is key, and so is education – I would say that, as I am a teacher. We should be told more about monitoring air pollution. We have a right to know. So many children are at risk – we believe that the deaths of 16 children in the past 18 months are linked to air pollution. Children continue to get ill, to die. Voices are not being heard. If parents could speak about their experiences – telling a politician not just, “I am worried about my children”, but that “My child had to be resuscitated in A&E last night” – it might make a difference. Two weeks ago, my friend went to buy a new car, and they tried to sell her a diesel car – they told her it was “green”. Who is allowing people to say this in 2019? I continue to be devastated [by Ella’s death], it is still unbearable. What I am learning is how I can use what I have been through to help other young children. I don’t feel like giving up. I feel very strongly that people should shout about this. FH The Lancashire Nanas are a group of women who have been opposing fracking at Preston New Road since 2011. I hadn’t even heard of fracking until 2011. That’s when the energy firm Cuadrilla started fracking, just outside Blackpool, and caused a series of small earthquakes. I had been busy bringing up my three daughters – and latterly, my four grandchildren – and hadn’t really been paying much attention to where my electricity or gas came from. Then I saw an advert in the Blackpool Gazette inviting people to a meeting to learn more about fracking. I went along with my sister and the more we heard, the more concerned we became. Everything we read convinced us that fracking was not a safe or well managed industry. Around that time I was made redundant from my IT job and so my husband and I agreed I would focus on campaigning full-time, and we would just tighten our belts. The idea of the Nanas came because we realised that the media liked to portray people raising these concerns as tree-huggers. We were just normal, everyday women concerned about something on our doorstep. There were 25 to 30 of us at the start, aged between 30 and 70. Now, there are Nanas in their 80s. Not everyone is actually a nana. We just liked the idea of portraying ourselves as matriarchs: you don’t mess with your grandma, do you? It was absolutely devastating in October 2016 when the government gave Cuadrilla the go-ahead to frack at Preston New Road. But we didn’t give up. We were at the gates every day, doing what we could to prevent or slow down vehicles entering the site. The funniest day was when a group of women sat in the road, knitting. It all looked so innocent. The police didn’t notice until it was too late that the women were knitting themselves together. It was a total farce, watching 50 Lancashire police officers try to cut them apart, tripping over wool and pulling them left and right. Fracking didn’t go as Cuadrilla hoped. The drilling produced seismic tremors that breached legal limits. They planned to do more than 40 fracks but only managed two. I would say I am cautiously optimistic they won’t be back. Shares in Cuadrilla’s parent company are down and finally more Tory MPs are coming out against it. And if we can end it here, we might be able to end it everywhere. HP The #FridaysForFuture global school strike takes place tomorrow, inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg It took about a month to persuade my parents that striking was a good idea. I’m 13 and I had seen a video of Greta Thunberg on Twitter, and I thought that was something I could do too. I asked some of my friends, but only one joined me; now we’re averaging about four students and 15 adults . At the first strike, it was quite scary because I didn’t know what people’s reactions would be. It really helped having my friend there. We tried to ignore the people in cars, sitting and pointing at us, but there were a lot of people beeping in support. My mum phoned my headteacher about a week before I started. He can’t support it and he says my school has a lot of climate and environmental education, but I don’t think it does. I get laughed at quite a bit. I’ve met quite a few climate-deniers in school. It makes me really annoyed because people don’t understand, or they don’t care when you try to explain it to them. I’m surprised at how the movement has taken off. Education is valued and if children are sacrificing that, it must be important. The government’s response has been pitiful. At the climate change debate, 610 MPs skipped it – that’s a shocking representation of how little our political leaders care about the very existence of life on this planet. I think there will be hundreds of thousands [of children striking on the 15th]. I wish people knew that we can’t change this unless everyone is working together. ES Manchester Animal Action is an organisation aiming to change society’s attitude towards animals I grew up on a little family farm in the Czech Republic and when I was a kid I was taught to kill animals. It was absolutely normal. I also worked in a chicken slaughterhouse in England when I was 25 to earn some money. That was like hell on earth. I started reading about climate change. One day I learned that there is massive environmental damage and climate change caused by animal agriculture – 80% of deforestation is caused by agriculture. All my illusions about being an environmentalist disappeared. I thought: “I just can’t be this person any more.” I became a vegan six years ago. Every Sunday, we have a stall on Market Street in Manchester – we put out lovely vegan food and leaflets. The ethical aspect doesn’t seem to worry people. So I try to switch the discussion to the environment – people are often shocked and start googling. I also emailed all the [500] employees at my work explaining my views. I got plenty of positive feedback; I did also get people ridiculing it, but I was not offended. The fact is that laughing is better than ignorance. My children have never eaten meat. We used to get their blood tested every six months for iron, vitamins D and B12 etc, but the doctor said we should stop coming back as the results were always perfect. My advice to people who want to talk about veganism would be: stay calm, don’t be judgmental, and never give up trying to help people see there are good reasons for being vegan. In the future, our children will thank us. DC Chief executive of the charity Surfers Against Sewage, who turned their focus to plastic pollution 10 years ago My love of the shoreline and ocean really spans back to the great tidal banks of the Thames, where my father used to take me mudlarking, and exploring UK beaches on family holidays. It is there that the fascination with flotsam and jetsam started. I’ve been surfing in one form or another since I was about 10. Surfing is a perfect nexus between my passion for the environment and my love of sport. In 1991, I entered the Surf to Save competition in Polzeath, which supported NGOs, including the newly formed Surfers Against Sewage. I met some of the founder members – gas mask-wearing, surfboard-waving activists taking to the streets of London. The early days were a true wave of people power that coincided with brilliant new European legislation to clean up our ocean from sewage pollution. The past 30 years have seen water quality at beaches improve dramatically. But the public have been shielded from the growing extent of plastic pollution We have worked for a decade auditing plastic on our beaches, running beach cleans, calling for legislation and industry action. Blue Planet II had only 14 minutes on plastic, out of seven hours of broadcasting, but it changed how the world sees plastic. It helped to propel our work to a bigger stage. Now, a dynamic movement of people, which we describe as #GenerationSea, has come together to help us call for new government policy and legislation, and changes within industry. FH Sheffield Tree Action Groups formed to stop Sheffield council felling as many as 17,500 trees in the city. In the past five years, 5,500 have been chopped down by contractors for the Labour council. When they started taking the trees down, it took a while for people to realise the extent of it. It is so upsetting to see these magnificent trees felled; it has turned me and others into a city of environmental activists. I have taken more direct action in the past few years than I have ever done before. About four of us are older women; we call ourselves the Tree Sisters. People say we chain ourselves to the trees, but we stand under them. Around Christmas 2017, we were on watch for trees we knew were going to be felled. It meant getting up very early – you never know when they are going to come – and being on the lookout all day long, in the winter cold, to get out there before the contractors reached the tree. It was just punishing hours and it was shit. The advantage was you could see them arriving to put barriers around the trees. They employ security men, who were previously bouncers, and the police can get involved. In a lot of cases, 60 men will arrive to fell one tree. This time it was just the barrier men and a team of security. The security man was trying to tell me it was illegal for me to be there – it wasn’t. I didn’t move and they put the barriers up around me. I was feeling a bit shaken because it is a scary situation, and I am 66 and a pensioner. But friends were gathering round to support me, and it was cold, so I thought: “Let’s sing some carols.” I started singing The 12 days of Christmas, replacing the words with: “A goldfinch in a plane tree and 12 barrier men.” In the end, when they left without felling the tree, one of the men said to me: “Thank you, we have really enjoyed that.” SL Grow Heathrow is an eco-squat on 30 acres of land, adjacent to the site of the proposed third runway. I grew up on a small farm in the Gower, Wales, which is a really beautiful place and so I have always been connected to nature. But my first direct action was marching against student cuts. It was the first time I got really angry and realised that the people in charge are not always right, they don’t always know the answers and I needed to get my voice heard out there. Two years ago, I went to my first mass action, protesting about the coal mining in a massive area of the Rhineland, Germany. Our group stopped a train from delivering to a power plant. We linked our arms and sat down on the train track. You have an adrenalin rush like you have never felt before. It was there that I heard about the Grow Heathrow camp. Living here gives me the freedom to get involved in lots of environmental campaigns, anti-fracking and protests against open cast coal mining in the Pont Valley. We are all one movement, united in fighting for environmental justice. The way society is living now is not sustainable. We have to act now or regret it later. SL Works with ClientEarth charity that uses the law to protect the planet and the people who live on it I don’t feel I am a hero. I’m a lawyer. I use the law to protect the environment and people’s health. We are a legal NGO that works on climate litigation and strategic cases that can help to develop the law, to compel governments to put proper environmental measures in place. I didn’t start out this way. I used to be a defence lawyer, representing companies that were sued. Now, I have changed sides. We are working at the cutting edge of the law. Things are moving rapidly. Before I joined ClientEarth four years ago, people I knew thought climate litigation was far-fetched. But now cases are being brought in the US, the Philippines and Europe. In the UK, our biggest victory was over air pollution, which is closely linked to emissions cuts. The first case went all the way to the supreme court and the European court of justice. Climate change is so amorphous that it affects everything – how much food we can grow, whether our homes are flooded, what damage payouts insurance companies have to make. All these areas involve legal risks. In the future, I think you will see more individuals seeking to hold governments to account to reduce emissions. You could see more claims against companies for not doing enough. And there will be more challenges related to human rights, by the people impacted by climate change. Lawyers will be busy. The past four years has made me very concerned about the need to drive down CO2 emissions and how interesting and helpful the law can be. Used incisively and carefully, it can deliver change and major shifts in thinking. I’ve learned that there are opportunities to be creative. You don’t expect that with the law, do you? JW A birder and activist from the Chew Valley, she campaigns for endangered wildlife and organises nature camps for inner city minority ethnic teenagers  I’m 16 and my parents have taken me birdwatching since I was a baby. It has always been part of my life. When I was seven, my parents heard that the first ever eastern crowned warbler had been seen in Britain. Luckily, I had a day off school, and we drove five hours to see it. It was around the edge of a huge quarry like an amphitheatre and I was amazed to see so many people cared about this little brown bird. I’ve been very lucky to travel around the world. During half-term in Spain recently, I saw my 5,000th bird species in the world. It was a rock bunting, which is a brilliant bird. My parents have always been very open about what is going on in the world. I was 12 or 13 and had built up a relatively large online following when I started campaigning. The first proper campaign I launched was to save the spoonbill sandpiper in Bangladesh, where my mum is from. I also campaigned over the 2014 oil spill in the mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. In 2015, I read an American Birdwatching Association article about how the environmental sector is incredibly white. It made me stop and think. I knew I was the only one like me as a kid. I just felt sad because others should have that opportunity. Since then I’ve campaigned to bring diversity into wildlife conservation. In three-and-a-half years, I’ve seen so much change. People forget that we are animals, too. The NHS has started prescribing going out into nature because it is good for our mental health. If we care for nature, it’s not entirely altruistic. We get benefits, too. PB"
"Greta Thunberg, the founder of the Youth Strike for Climate movement, has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize, just before the biggest day yet of global action. Thunberg began a solo protest in Sweden in August but has since inspired students around the globe. Strikes are expected in 1,659 towns and cities in 105 countries on Friday, involving hundreds of thousands of young people. “We have proposed Greta Thunberg because if we do nothing to halt climate change it will be the cause of wars, conflict and refugees,” said Norwegian Socialist MP Freddy André Øvstegård. “Greta Thunberg has launched a mass movement which I see as a major contribution to peace.” “[I am] honoured and very grateful for this nomination,” said Thunberg on Twitter. Tomorrow we #schoolstrike for our future. And we will continue to do so for as long as it takes.” She has already challenged leaders in person at the UN climate summit in late 2018 and at Davos in January. “Change is coming whether they like it or not,” she said. National politicians and some university professors can nominate candidates for the Nobel peace prize, which will be awarded in December. There are 301 candidates for the 2019 prize: 223 individuals and 78 organisations. In 2014, the peace prize was awarded to 17-year-old Malala Yousafzai, “for the struggle ... for the right of all children to education”. She survived a Taliban assassination attempt in 2012. While some politicians have opposed the school strikes, many have supported them, including Germany’s Angela Merkel and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar. The mayors of Paris, Milan, Sydney, Austin, Philadelphia, Portland, Oslo, Barcelona and Montreal added their backing on Thursday. “It is truly inspiring to see young people, led by brilliant young women, making their voices heard and demanding urgent climate action. They are absolutely correct that our actions today will determine their futures,” said Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris and chair of the C40 group of cities. “My message to young citizens is clear: it is our responsibility as adults and political leaders to learn from you and deliver the future you want.” The strikes have also been supported by the former head of the Anglican church Rowan Williams and the head of Amnesty International, Kumi Naidoo. “Children are often told they are ‘tomorrow’s leaders’. But if they wait until ‘tomorrow’ there may not be a future in which to lead,” said Naidoo. “Young people are putting their leaders to shame with the passion and determination they are showing to fight this crucial battle now."
"A Senate committee examining whether to lift the current cap on water buybacks has heard evidence that it would be cheaper to buy more water from farmers and then inject savings into rural communities to create other types of jobs than opt for water-savings projects – but the federal government has never explored the option. The committee is examining legislation, backed by Labor, the Greens and independents to repeal the cap that prevents more than 1,500 gigalitres of water being bought back from agriculture to assist the environment.  Instead, the government wants the balance of the 2,750-gigalitre target for environmental water to be achieved through efficiency and on-farm projects, in order to avoid what it says will be serious economic impacts of withdrawing water from farms in rural areas. But under questioning this week, departmental officials said they had not looked into whether it would be more efficient to invest in basic services such as education, health or other activities in affected regions, rather than pour money into “supply and efficiency measures” which include projects such as lining irrigation channels to reduce evaporation. “It’s a gaping ‘waterhole’ in the government’s due diligence and policy,” said Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick. Evidence presented to the committee shows that the cost of past river “infrastructure projects” has come in at 2.7 times more per megalitre (returned the river) than simply buying back water entitlements, and could be even higher, depending on accounting methods used. “On the latest numbers from the Australian government data that’s available, the difference is approximately $5,400 per megalitre for water infrastructure subsidies versus just over $2,000 per megalitre for the purchase of water entitlements from willing sellers,” Prof Quentin Grafton, from the Crawford school at ANU, told the committee. The committee heard this week that a study by professorial fellow Glyn Wittwer showed that spending on health, education and basic services produced three to four times more jobs than the same level of expenditure on irrigation infrastructure investment. Both the Department of Agriculture and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority conceded they had never examined that approach. The first assistant secretary of the agriculture department’s water division, Paul Morris, said government policy was to “focus on infrastructure”. “I find this almost unbelievable and most irresponsible,” Patrick said. “The government has a low-risk option that creates more jobs and it’s not taking it. Indeed, it hasn’t even investigated it”. The difference between buying back water and efficiency projects is looming large in water policy because the next stage of the Murray-Darling basin plan relies much more heavily on efficiency projects to achieve 605GL of water for the environment. Most of the easier projects have already been implemented, meaning that governments will now have to back more risky and untested projects. One of these is the Menindee Lakes project put forward by NSW, which aims to save 105GL by reducing evaporation. This involves shrinking the lakes and managing them differently. The project has been heavily criticised for its lack of work on environmental impact, particularly in the wake of the fish kills in the Menindee Lakes area."
"Scott Morrison’s recent pivot on climate policy is unlikely to have a positive impact on Australia’s emissions profile because it fails to grapple with the underlying drivers of increased pollution, according to a new analysis by the Investor Group on Climate Change. The IGCC, a group that represents institutional investors such as super funds, with total funds under management of about $2tn, has told its members Morrison’s “climate solutions package” won’t change the current trajectory of rising emissions because it is “small scale and unlikely to be a durable policy framework through time”.  The group has also questioned the Coalition’s investments in Snowy 2.0 and Tasmania’s “battery to the nation”, arguing that these projects “could be crucial to decarbonising the electricity system” but also noting “they are not a substitute for private sector investment in new zero emissions generation and a national strategic plan for enhanced transmission and distribution”. The government has attempted to appeal to voters concerned about the Coalition’s record on climate action by rebooting and rebadging Tony Abbott’s emissions reduction fund; investing in large pumped-hydro projects; supporting energy efficiency measures; and also setting out a carbon budget detailing how it proposes to meet the Paris target. The IGCC is underwhelmed by the recent pivot. It says that until a policy is produced creating a credible pathway to net-zero emissions, investors will continue to sit on the sidelines. “In the absence of this, policy uncertainty will be increased, the necessary investment in zero emissions generation will be delayed and upward pressure will continue on electricity prices,” the new paper warns. The group is also critical of the government’s use of carry-over credits as a tool to ensure Australia complies with its obligations under the Paris agreement, warning that it will only delay the necessary transition, and increase the adjustment costs – socially and economically. The Morrison government is counting a 367-megatonne contribution from carry-over credits – an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030 – to help meet the 2030 target. The IGCC notes taht there is currently a gap between the targets that countries have set, and actions required to achieve the objectives of the Paris agreement. “For investors this is concerning because the economic and social impacts of current projected levels of climate change risk investment returns and economic prosperity over the longer-term,” the paper says. It points to recent economic analysis suggesting that, “conservatively, currently projected warming of 2.5-4C could reduce global economic output by 10% to 30% over the lifetime of assets and superannuation returns”. “The use of carryover to weaken Australia’s emissions commitments is also fundamentally at odds with limiting warming in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement and driving global momentum for coordinated, and increased ambition,” the paper says. “This could threaten to spread a low ambition contagion in the international system by further encouraging other countries like Russia to use carryover to delay emissions reductions.” The IGCC also says Labor is yet to take a position on the use of carry-over credits. It says that if the ALP uses the same accounting as the government, factoring in a 367-megatonne contribution in its carbon budget, Labor’s 45% emissions reduction target would become a 35% target. The most recent emissions data confirms that emissions in Australia are continuing to rise, with the latest increases driven predominantly by higher liquefied natural gas production in Western Australia. Emissions for the year to September 2018 went up 0.9% on the previous year, according to the latest inventory, primarily due to a 19.7% increase in LNG exports, but there were also increases in stationary energy, transport, fugitives, industrial processes and waste sectors. The trend of rising emissions has been in evidence since the Abbott government repealed the carbon price Labor legislated during the 43rd parliament. While boosting funding for the emissions reduction fund, the government has also this week foreshadowed changes to the accompanying safeguard mechanism. The changes will make it less likely that heavy polluters such as mines and smelters will be caught by the scheme in the short term – although the adjustments also set the mechanism up for a more seamless transition to a baseline and credit scheme, which Labor has flagged for liable entities – big polluters emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon a year. The safeguards mechanism – part of the Direct Action scheme, which is at the centre of Morrison’s recent climate redux – sets emissions “baselines”, or limits, for big polluters. The mechanism is supposed to ensure pollution cuts paid for through the taxpayer-funded emissions reduction fund – rebadged by Morrison last week as the “climate solutions fund” – are not undone by a blowout in emissions in other parts of the economy."
"The young people taking to the streetsfor the climate strike are right: their future is being stolen. The economy is an environmental pyramid scheme, dumping its liabilities on the young and the unborn. Its current growth depends on intergenerational theft. At the heart of capitalism is a vast and scarcely examined assumption: you are entitled to as great a share of the world’s resources as your money can buy. You can purchase as much land, as much atmospheric space, as many minerals, as much meat and fish as you can afford, regardless of who might be deprived. If you can pay for them, you can own entire mountain ranges and fertile plains. You can burn as much fuel as you like. Every pound or dollar secures a certain right over the world’s natural wealth. But why? What just principle equates the numbers in your bank account with a right to own the fabric of the Earth? Most people I ask are completely stumped by this question. The standard justification goes back to John Locke’s Second Treatise of Government, published in 1689. He claimed that you acquire a right to own natural wealth by mixing your labour with it: the fruit you pick, the minerals you dig and the land you till become your exclusive property, because you put the work in. This argument was developed by the jurist William Blackstone in the 18th century, whose books were immensely influential in England, America and elsewhere. He contended that a man’s right to “sole and despotic dominion” over land was established by the person who first occupied it, to produce food. This right could then be exchanged for money. This is the underlying rationale for the great pyramid scheme. And it makes no sense. For a start, it assumes a Year Zero. At this arbitrary point, a person could step on to a piece of land, mix their labour with it, and claim it as theirs. Locke used America as an example of the blank slate on which people could establish their rights. But the land (as Blackstone admitted) became a blank slate only through the extermination of those who lived there. Not only could the colonist erase all prior rights, he could also erase all future rights. By mixing your labour with the land once, you and your descendants acquire the right to it in perpetuity, until you decide to sell it. You thereby prevent all future claimants from gaining natural wealth by the same means. Worse still, according to Locke, “your” labour includes the labour of those who work for you. But why should the people who do the work not be the ones who acquire the rights? It’s comprehensible only when you realise that by “man”, Locke means not all humankind, but European men of property. Those who worked for them had no such rights. What this meant, in the late 17th century, was that large-scale landrights could be justified, under his system, only by the ownership of slaves. Inadvertently perhaps, Locke produced a charter for the human rights of slave holders. Even if objections to this could somehow be dismissed, what is it about labour that magically turns anything it touches into private property? Why not establish your right to natural wealth by peeing on it? The arguments defending our economic system are flimsy and preposterous. Peel them away, and you see that the whole structure is founded on looting: looting from other people, looting from other nations, looting from other species, and looting from the future. Yet, on the grounds of these absurdities, the rich arrogate to themselves the right to buy the natural wealth on which others depend. Locke cautioned that his justification works only if “there is enough, and as good, left in common for others”. Today, whether you are talking about land, the atmosphere, living systems, rich mineral lodes or most other forms of natural wealth, it is clear there is not “enough, and as good” left in common. Everything we take for ourselves we take from someone else. You can tweak this system. You can seek to modify it. But you cannot make it just. So what should take its place? It seems to me that the founding principle of any just system is that those who are not yet alive will, when they are born, have the same rights as those who are alive today. At first sight, this doesn’t seem to change anything: the first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights”. But this statement is almost meaningless, because there is nothing in the declaration insisting that one generation cannot steal from the next. The missing article might look like this: “Every generation shall have an equal right to the enjoyment of natural wealth.” This principle is hard to dispute, but it seems to change everything. Immediately, it tells us that no renewable resource should be used beyond its rate of replenishment. No non-renewable resource should be used that cannot be fully recycled and reused. This leads inexorably to towards two major shifts: a circular economy from which materials are never lost; and the end of fossil fuel combustion. But what of the Earth itself? In this densely populated world, all land ownership necessarily precludes ownership by others. Article 17 of the Universal Declaration is self-contradictory. It says, “Everyone has the right to own property.” But because it places no limit on the amount one person can possess, it ensures that everyone does not have this right. I would change it to this: “Everyone has the right to use property without infringing the rights of others to use property.” The implication is that everyone born today would acquire an equal right of use, or would need to be compensated for their exclusion. One way of implementing this is through major land taxes, paid into a sovereign wealth fund. It would alter and restrict the concept of ownership, and ensure that economies tended towards distribution, rather than concentration. These simple suggestions raise a thousand questions. I don’t have all the answers. But such issues should be the subject of lively conversations everywhere. Preventing environmental breakdown and systemic collapse means challenging our deepest and least-examined beliefs. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

"The Morrison government, which is battling a persistent internal fracture on energy policy, is attempting to foment divisions between Labor and the union movement over the opposition’s 45% emissions reduction target in the run up to the election. The energy minister Angus Taylor, has written to trade union leaders claiming the 45% economy-wide emissions reduction target will lead to wages being cut by $9,000.  The source for Taylor’s claim is a summary of as yet unreleased modelling by BAEconomics about the impact of the 45% target, which was handed to The Australian newspaper in late February. The summary of the unreleased modelling says the government’s target of 26-28% emissions reduction by 2030 will reduce average real annual income for a full-time worker by around $2,000. Under the high target, the summary points to a projected fall in real annual wages of “around $9,000 per year by 2030”. In the new form letters to union officials, Taylor advises them to to seek “urgent clarification” from Bill Shorten about the impact of a 45% target on the wages outcomes of their members. Taylor says the Labor leader has elected to make the coming federal election a “referendum on wages”, but the opposition’s climate policies will have an negative impact on earnings. “Every Australian worker deserves to know how Labor is going to reach their economy wrecking targets,” the energy minister said. While the government has grabbed the as yet unreleased modelling as a tool to try to increase political pressure on Labor over its policy offering, climate policy experts have already questioned whether the modelling also takes into account the costs of climate change, which a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank highlighted starkly in a speech this week when he warned climate change poses risks to financial stability. Erwin Jackson, the director of policy at the Investor Group on Climate Change, has also pointed out that previous modelling indicates that the economy continues to grow even with ambitious pollution targets, just at a slightly slower rate. The summary from BAEconomics suggests the economy will continue growing under a 45% target at around 2.3% per year over the decade to 2030 compared to a rate of 2.9%. While there has been no sign union leaders are troubled by a 45% target, there have been public tensions between Labor and the union movement over the party’s position on the Adani coal mine. Labor will come under increasing scrutiny as it prepares to release the remainder of its climate change policies, which are expected in the coming weeks. Labor has already released its policy on the energy sector. The opposition is expected in the coming weeks to confirm specific measures to reduce pollution in heavy industry, transport and agriculture, and to outline whether it intends to use carry-over credits from the Kyoto period to meet the Paris 2030 target, and whether it will use permits to help with the abatement task. The government’s attempts to apply political pressure to Labor comes as divisions continue within the Coalition about whether the government should sign up to taxpayer underwriting of new coal plants. The backdrop to the running battle is escalating voter concern about the impact of climate change, which is clear in major party polling. School students are expected to strike on Friday to draw attention to the climate issue. The issue has blown up spectacularly in government ranks over the past week, with Nationals brawling with Liberals and among themselves about what projects should be supported by the government underwriting program. Taylor has confirmed the Morrison government is continuing to assess new coal-generation projects despite strong pushback from moderate Liberals, but he says taxpayers will only support projects that are “viable”. Nationals want the government to produce a shortlist of projects before the election, but many Liberals are completely opposed to the government nominating taxpayer support for a new coal project before the coming election, fearing it will cost them electoral support. On Thursday, the government’s most senior conservative, Peter Dutton, joined Liberal colleagues in arguing the Morrison government should not be in the business of building coal-fired power stations, and he put a question mark over whether taxpayers should support upgrades to existing plants. Dutton said the government was not opposed to providing support to coal projects, but he was opposed to building them, because money to build that infrastructure would take away opportunities to build new roads and tunnels. “We’ve got taxpayers’ money to spend, the question is whether the federal government should be building a coal-fired power station. I don’t agree with that. I don’t think we should be,” Dutton said. While saying the government was not opposed to assisting coal, Dutton also indicated he wasn’t in favour of assisting projects with upgrades. “You’ve got power stations now that will be asking for taxpayers’ money, to upgrade. “The question is whether people want to pay more taxes or whether you are going to use taxpayer money, instead of building that new road or that tunnel.” The Greens on Friday will also release a new policy to promote the uptake of batteries for storage. The party will propose household battery storage incentives of up to $7,000 per battery tapering down annually to July 1, 2023."

"For all the skittishness of Australian politics through the years of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments there’s been one factor that has been remarkably consistent. Amid leadership coups, cultural offensives and the revolving door of energy policy acronyms, the Australian public has remained steadfast in its belief that more needs to be done to address climate change. Whether the focus has been an ETS, an ERF, a CET or a Neg or just a big stick, the majority of the voting public has not moved from its view that meaningful action is required by government. After the craziness of another fortnight of Coalition energy policy where our fossil-fondling PM has whipped up some new renewable buzzwords while his National party partners are baying for taxpayers to fund new coal projects, it’s worth reminding ourselves of this baseline. Because it explains so much of why this government’s condition has reached terminal status. For the past decade the Essential poll has asked two benchmark questions when it comes to climate change. The first is around whether people believe the climate science. Over the past decade this split has been stable. Granted, it dipped into the high 50s at the height of Tony Abbott’s attack on the Gillard government’s so-called carbon tax, but that was after Labor had spent the best part of a term faffing around on the issue. What’s most striking in these numbers is the disconnection between the climate sceptics within the government and Coalition voters. Indeed, on the science they are much more aligned with One Nation and conservative independent voters who make up the “other” cohort of voters. As for younger voters, the Coalition comes across every bit as much a fossil as the fuel they seek to dig up. The second question we have regularly asked is whether people believe Australia is doing enough to address climate change. Again, a majority – including one-third of Liberal voters – say they are not. All of which makes Barnaby Joyce’s entreaty for an election fought on coal appear delusional, as some of the more tethered members of the government have felt compelled to point out in recent days. These words of moderation come too late. Joyce’s indulgence will only provide further impetus to the swathe of moderate independents challenging the Liberal heartland in more affluent areas of Sydney and Melbourne where Sky after dark does not rate. Meanwhile, as the Coalition’s self-inflicted wounds fester, Labor simply holds its line with a commitment to 50% renewables by 2030 and aggressively promotes battery storage. Yes, there are calls for a more rapid phaseout of coal from the left, but all the pressure on policy is currently on the Coalition. As a separate table in this week’s report shows, one of Labor’s core brand advantages over the Coalition, alongside wages and workplace conditions, is climate change. While Scott Morrison will blow his foghorn on taxes and boats, it is the climate change policy failure that leaves his government condemned in the eyes of so many of its own. Perhaps it’s the ultimate revenge on a government that came to power through a cynical attempt to deny the need for climate action. As the summers have got warmer and warmer, the public’s anger at the inaction has got hotter. The failure of this government has not just been the toppling of its leaders. It’s been the reason for the topplings, which has been more than the blind pursuit of power, but power in the name of energy. And even in its dying days, key members of the government continue in this state of denial. Not just of the science, nor the need for meaningful action, but denial that this is the sort of leadership elected governments are expected to exhibit. The reckoning is coming and it will be harsh. And it can’t come soon enough. • Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential and a Guardian Australia columnist"
"The Greens will use the resumption of parliament for the looming budget session to try to extract documents associated with the Morrison government’s decision to use carry-over credits from the Kyoto period to meet the Paris 2030 target. The move by the Greens to extract documents relevant to the decision is an effort to keep the spotlight both on the Coalition’s decision to count a 367-megatonne contribution from carry-over credits, and also on Labor, with the opposition yet to take a decision on whether it will follow suit. Carry-over credits are an accounting system that allows countries to count credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030. The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said it was important to chase documents because the public deserved to know “whose idea it was to use dodgy credits instead of actually cutting pollution” – and he noted other countries had declined to use carry-overs for Paris. Bandt said he was concerned Labor was leaving its options open, but argued it was possible the ALP was leaving its options option because it could be forced to rely on credits and permits to meet its target of a 45% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030. The Greens say Labor’s decision to apply their economy-wide target of 45% to the electricity sector, instead of forcing steeper abatement in electricity, where it is comparatively cheaper to cut pollution, meant it would have to chase more expensive abatement in sectors like heavy industry, transport, agriculture and waste. Bandt contends Labor may not be able to meet its target “without relying on Scott Morrison’s accounting trick”. “If you stick with low targets in electricity, where it is much cheaper and easier to reach zero pollution, you just shift the burden onto other sectors like agriculture,” he said. The government confirmed it would bank the 367-megatonne contribution from carry-overs as part of a recent pivot on climate change policy. Morrison released a carbon budget detailing the emissions reductions from various programs that will be required to meet the Paris target. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has said his “bias is to steer clear of cop-outs and accounting tricks”, but Labor wants to consult with stakeholders before resolving whether carry-overs are in or out under its climate policy. Labor has already unveiled some of its climate change initiatives for the coming federal election, but there is more policy to come, including a likely trading scheme for liable entities – big polluters emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon a year – and also vehicle emissions standards to bring down pollution in transport. It is unclear whether Labor will release a carbon budget as the government has done, quantifying abatement in specific sectors. The Investor Group on Climate Change, a group that represents institutional investors such as super funds, with total funds under management of about $2tn, over the weekend warned against using carry-over credits as part of the emissions reduction toolkit for Paris. “The use of carryover to weaken Australia’s emissions commitments is also fundamentally at odds with limiting warming in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement and driving global momentum for coordinated, and increased ambition,” the IGCC said. “This could threaten to spread a low ambition contagion in the international system by further encouraging other countries like Russia to use carryover to delay emissions reductions.” The group pointed out if Labor ultimately uses the same accounting as the government, factoring in the 367-megatonne contribution in its carbon budget, it’s 45% emissions reduction target would become a 35% target. Emissions for the year to September 2018 went up 0.9% on the previous year, according to the latest inventory, primarily due to a 19.7% increase in LNG exports, but there were also increases in stationary energy, transport, fugitives, industrial processes and waste sectors. The trend of rising emissions has been in evidence since the Abbott government repealed the carbon price Labor legislated during the 43rd parliament."
"Long-haul flights, tons of guns and a bagpipe flamethrower: such are the special demands of his career that James Bond has never been considered a poster boy for an eco-friendly lifestyle. But next year’s 25th Bond film looks set to have Ian Fleming’s hero make his first concession to climate change, by driving an electric Aston Martin – albeit one which retails at £250,000. According to reports, the film – whose working title of Shatterhand was recently debunked – will see Daniel Craig’s 007 behind the wheel of an Aston Martin Rapide E, one of only 155 electric cars being built by the British manufacturer.  The Sun reports that director Cary Joji Fukunaga has spearheaded the change, with their source describing him as “a total tree-hugger”. “This is something Cary pushed for and Daniel and the producers are going along with. Everybody is afraid of Bond getting labelled ‘too PC’ but they all felt the time was right to put him in a zero-emission vehicle.” Aston Martin’s relationship with the spy franchise began in 1964, when Sean Connery drove a DB5 sports car in Goldfinger.  Shooting on the new film is expected to start in April, after a series of delays involving the replacement of Danny Boyle as director following reported “creative differences” between he and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson. No more has officially been revealed as to the nature of such differences, but many suggested Boyle and his long-standing co-writer, John Hodge, were eager to bring Bond up to date with a plot including nods to the #MeToo movement – and, potentially, 007’s own death. More recently, last-minute script alterations pushed the release date back a further three months, to April 2020. Rami Malek – who won an Oscar last month for his performance as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody – is reported to be in final negotiations to take on the role of the chief villain. The Guardian has contacted distributors Universal for comment."
"Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, has announced a radical plan to meet the “existential threat” of climate change by constructing a new section of Manhattan , extending hundreds of feet out into the narrow East river, in order to protect Wall Street and other downtown areas.  Plans to fund the scheme, however, are far from firm. He said the project, which would cost an estimated $10bn, will aim to be funded partly by private development “if federal funds are not available”. “If there’s federal money in play it probably looks one way,” De Blasio said. “If there’s not federal money in play, we have to get some private money into it and there has to be some development.” Officials have been developing schemes to fortify New York’s waterfront since Superstorm Sandy destroyed thousands of homes and businesses, and took more than 50 lives in the city, in 2012. De Blasio said it will cost about $500m to fortify most of lower Manhattan from future effects of climate change, including rising sea levels and intense precipitation, by providing grassy berms and removable barriers. But planners determined that protecting the lowest-lying area, including South Street Seaport and the adjacent financial district at the tip of Manhattan, will require adding more land over several years. De Blasio, who is contemplating joining the crowded field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, said the $10bn landfill project should be supported by federal funds, but that’s unlikely to happen during the administration of Donald Trump. “Lower Manhattan is one of the core centers of the American economy,” he said. “It’s where the financial capital of the United States is. The security of lower Manhattan should be a national priority. The fact is it is not. And it’s incomprehensible to me that there’s no sense of urgency from the federal government,” he said. The plan to extend the coastline will go through the city’s environmental review process, De Blasio said, but he hopes to avoid “the endless dragging on that usually accompanies something of this scale”. De Blasio admitted that the Trump administration is unlikely to support dishing out money for the plan. A new president could bring possibility, especially if the Green New Deal is passed, he said. But the prospect of private development on the newly built land is expected to meet resistance from downtown Manhattan community members. City council member Margaret Chin, who represents the area, said a more resilient plan to combat climate change “cannot be paid for by private real estate development that would destroy the waterfront neighborhoods that we are trying to protect”. De Blasio announced the so-called climate resilience plan at a news conference on Thursday. He said a study undertaken by his office and others has determined that if the city does not prepare for climate change, rising seas will expose 20% of lower Manhattan to daily flooding by 2100. “This is the existential threat,” De Blasio said. “This is the core issue we all must face as aggressively as humanly possible.” Efforts to protect New York from the next big storm have been studied for years. Existing initiatives, like stone revetments and solar-powered streetlights in flood-prone areas, have already been implemented across the city. Lower Manhattan has been the subject of much attention. In 2014, the city adopted the “Big U” – a plan to flood-proof lower Manhattan through measures such as storm barriers along walkways and elevated green spaces. Some New Yorkers were skeptical that the proposal represented the best use of the city’s resources in light of other problems the city faces. Mackenzie Montagna, a 24-year-old Battery Park City resident, said she doesn’t trust the plan because other similar projects have been “just a waste of money”. She said: “They could’ve instead focused on other issues we have like subway improvement.”"
"It is high school students who have helped reinvigorate the climate change debate in Australia and they are preparing to march again this week. The effect they have had is similar to the reaction created by the Green New Deal in the United States in the last month. Last month newly elected congressional representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez brought a new proposal to the Congress: a 14-page vision for a Green New Deal. More statement than legislative proposal (it was a non-binding resolution), the Green New Deal outlined the total economic transformation required to respond to escalating climate change, then combined that action plan with a values proposition – that the economic and social transition must be just (indeed the resolution began by outlining the combined challenges of climate change and inequality). The Green New Deal released a rocket into the US climate change debate. Until very recently climate change was not seen as a vote winner. Rather most Democrats saw it as a kind of fringe, green issue that only moved small-liberal middle-class people living in gentrified inner-city pockets of a few “blue” cities. While climate campaigners would shout about how this was wrong, especially after the IPCC’s 2018 dire predictions of rapidly rising temperatures, they struggled to change the conversation. Enter the Green New Deal. Ocasio-Cortez, surrounded by the youth-run Sunrise Movement, has in one month demonstrated that not only is climate change a planet changer, but that climate action is a vote winner. How do we know? They shifted Chuck Schumer. Schumer is the Democratic leader in the Senate and a politician known for his middle-of-the-road positions. He shares much in common with some senior leaders in the Australian Labor party. But last week in a tremendous shift that responded entirely to the rise of the Green New Deal, Schumer has embraced a bold new path on climate. He hasn’t backed the Green New Deal. But he has called for new bold climate action that he wants use to frame the Democrats agenda in the lead up to the 2020 election. Schumer says that one of the reasons for his change of heart is that he is a new grandparent. But let’s be clear, he is a politician – he is doing this because he is an astute observer of polls. Like most of the 2020 presidential candidates, who have also embraced the Green New Deal, what the last month in the US has unearthed is that climate action will be a vote winner for any Democrat who gets on board. So what does this mean for Australia? The Australian Labor party doesn’t have to wait until 2020 to run an election on bold climate action, and they would do well to listen to Schumer’s argument. Schumer has said that the reason the Democrats need to act on climate is to build trust with millennials. Schumer can see that if the Democrats demonstrate that they care for the climate, that they might build a loyal relationship with young voters. The Democrats know that the Republicans are climate sceptics but also that young people don’t trust politicians. To create a relationship of trust they need to go big on climate. That might be hard, but the rewards are big – if they can go bold they might take a generation of voters with them, for life. The ALP has the same opportunity. Young people, like those who will strike on Friday, are worried about the climate because they will have to learn to live with climate change. But the ALP’s “small target” approach will not build trust. In Australia bold action requires the ALP to saying how they will stop the Adani coalmine. And that kind of leadership might also do wonders for Shorten’s personal approval ratings, like it did for Bob Hawke when he stopped the Franklin Dam. The Green New Deal has done more to shift climate politics in one month than more moderate campaigning has done in years There are also lessons for Australian social movements. The Green New Deal is a “big”, almost boundless proposal for progressive policy goodness. Wrapped up in the resolution are not only proposals for energy, agriculture and transport (key causes of climate change) but a vision for healthcare for all. In one sense, it’s a manifestation of Naomi Klein’s argument that climate change is “about everything” and solutions to it need to not only technically fix carbon emissions but also create greater social justice. That’s exciting. For those involved in Australian social movements who are curious about what a similar policy mix looks like for Australia, a bunch of work is needed. In the US a network of movements like Sunrise, thinktanks (led by New Consensus) and academics have worked on this proposal. Building the Green New Deal has at times been divisive, there are splits between some labour unions around the policy. Building a grand coalition of interests isn’t easy, and perhaps it could have been done better slower. But beginning this conversation quickly generated success. Arguably the Green New Deal has done more to shift American climate politics in one month than more moderate campaigning has done in years. But the Green New Deal has only just begun, and hopefully as it builds it is able to take on some of the strengths of the original New Deal. One of the most lasting legislative reforms in the 1930s were the changes made to labour law, where Roosevelt in effect “changed the rules” in how unions could organise. In 1935, the National Labor Relations Act removed many of the restrictions on union organising – arguing that in order to get wages growth, workplaces needed more economic democracy (sound familiar?). Over the next two decades workplaces transformed, industrial unions grew, wages increased and the economy became stronger. Fundamentally the New Deal wasn’t just about the state acting to “fix” the economy but the state creating space for people to act collectively to improve the economy for themselves. It’s food for thought in modern-day Australia. Our two most significant social movements are arguably the climate movement and the union movement. What would it take for them, and others, to forge an unusual alliance that connected the joint needs of climate action and a just economy? And what other civil society organisations might participate? And what would be the place for researchers and thinkers – the modern-day Keynes – in a Green New Deal? Ocasio-Cortez’s resolution calls for consultation with all these groups, but imagine if in Australia this was stronger – a glorious unusual, robust coalition of activists and academics, workers and student strikers who together could handle their differences and prosecute a vision for the country in this moment of uncertainty. And what if through this same moment we could see bolder leadership from our politicians too. • Amanda Tattersall is a postdoctoral fellow on social change strategy and a research lead at Sydney Policy Lab.

"It started in front of the Swedish parliament, on 20 August – a regular school day. Greta Thunberg sat with her painted sign and some homemade flyers. This was the first school climate strike. Fridays wouldn’t be regular schooldays any longer. The rest of us, and many more alongside us, picked it up in Australia, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, New Zealand, Uganda. Today the climate strike will take place all around the world. This movement had to happen, we didn’t have a choice. We knew there was a climate crisis. Not just because forests in Sweden or in the US had been on fire; because of alternating floods and drought in Germany and Australia; because of the collapse of alpine faces due to melting permafrost and other climate changes. We knew, because everything we read and watched screamed out to us that something was very wrong. That first day of refusing to go to school was spent alone, but since then a movement of climate strikers has swept the globe. Today young people in more than 100 countries will walk out of class to demand action on the greatest threat humankind has ever faced. These strikes are happening today – from Washington DC to Moscow, Tromsø to Invercargill, Beirut to Jerusalem, and Shanghai to Mumbai – because politicians have failed us. We’ve seen years of negotiations, pathetic deals on climate change, fossil fuel companies being given free rein to carve open our lands, drill beneath our soils and burn away our futures for their profit. We’ve seen fracking, deep sea drilling and coalmining continue. Politicians have known the truth about climate change and they’ve willingly handed over our future to profiteers whose search for quick cash threatens our very existence. This movement had to happen, we didn’t have a choice. Last year’s UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s special report on global warming could not have been clearer about the extreme dangers of going beyond 1.5C of global warming. To have any chance of avoiding that extreme danger emissions must drop rapidly – so that by the time we will be in our mid- and late-20s we are living in a transformed world. The students who are striking in cities, towns and villages around the world are uniting behind the science. We are only asking that our leaders to do the same. If those in power today don’t act, it will be our generation who will live through their failure. Those who are under 20 now could be around to see 2080, and face the prospect of a world that has warmed by up to 4C. The effects of such warming would be utterly devastating. Rivers would flood, storms would wreak havoc on coastal communities and coral reefs would be eliminated. Melting polar ice caps would lead to dramatically higher sea levels, flooding coastal areas. Places on Earth will become uninhabitable. Scientists have also shown us that burning fossil fuels is “the world’s most significant threat to children’s health”. Nine out of every 10 children around the world are breathing dangerous air. Our lives are being compromised before we are born. Toxic particles from exhaust fumes pass through the lungs of pregnant women and accumulate in the placenta. The risk of premature birth, low birth weight and cognitive dysfunction this causes is a public health catastrophe. Pollution from diesel vehicles is stunting the growth of our lungs, leaving us damaged for life. Toxic air from burning fossil fuels is choking not only our lungs but our hopes and dreams. And the worst effects of climate change are disproportionately felt by our most vulnerable communities. This is not just about cutting down emissions, but about equity – the system we have right now is failing us, working only for the rich few. The luxury so few of us enjoy in the global north is based on the suffering of people in the global south. We have watched as politicians fumble, playing a political game rather than facing the facts that the solutions we need cannot be found within the current system. They don’t want to face the facts – we need to change the system if we are to try to act on the climate crisis. This movement had to happen, we didn’t have a choice. The vast majority of climate strikers taking action today aren’t allowed to vote. Imagine for a second what that feels like. Despite watching the climate crisis unfold, despite knowing the facts, we aren’t allowed to have a say in who makes the decisions about climate change. And then ask yourself this: wouldn’t you go on strike too, if you thought doing so could help protect your own future? So today we walk out of school, we quit our college lessons, and we take to the streets to say enough is enough. Some adults say we shouldn’t be walking out of classes – that we should be “getting an education”. We think organising against an existential threat – and figuring out how to make our voices heard – is teaching us some important lessons. Other adults keep saying: “We owe it to the young people to give them hope.” But we don’t want your hope. We don’t want you to be hopeful. We want you to panic and we want you to take action. We want you to join us. We’ve relied on adults to make the right decisions to ensure that there is a future for the next generation – surely we don’t have all the answers. But what we do know is that we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground, phase out subsidies for dirty energy production, seriously invest in renewables and start asking difficult questions about how we structure our economies and who is set to win and who is set to lose. And we are no longer alone. Tens of thousands of scientists from around the world have released statements in support of the strikes by children. The scientists have been very clear about what we need to do to tackle climate change. We are uniting behind the scientists. We are only asking that our leaders do the same. It is so important that this happens now. The kind of changes that need to happen mean everyone recognising that this is a crisis and committing to radical transformations. We strongly believe that we can fight off the most damaging effects of climate change – but we have to act now. There is no grey area when it comes to survival. There’s no less bad option. That’s why young people are striking in every corner of the globe, and it’s why we are asking that older people join us on the streets too. When our house is burning we cannot just leave it to the children to pour water on the flames – we need the grownups to take responsibility for sparking the blaze in the first place. So for once, we’re asking grownups to follow our lead: we can’t wait any longer. This movement had to happen. And now, you adults have a choice. • Greta Thunberg is a youth climate strike leader in Sweden, Anna Taylor in the UK, Luisa Neubauer in Germany, Kyra Gantois, Anuna De Wever and Adélaïde Charlier in Belgium, Holly Gillibrand in Scotland, and Alexandria Villasenor in USA"
"A deputy governor of Australia’s central bank has issued a stark warning that climate change poses risks to financial stability, noting that warming needs to be thought of by policymakers and business as a trend and not a cyclical event. As a debate over coal and energy fractures the Morrison government, Guy Debelle warned a forum hosted by the Centre for Policy Development on Tuesday that climate change created risks for Australia’s financial stability in a number of different ways.  “For example, insurers may face large, unanticipated payouts because of climate change-related property damage and business losses,” he said. “In some cases businesses and households could lose access to insurance. “Companies that generate significant pollution might face reputational damage or legal liability from their activities, and changes to regulation could cause previously valuable assets to become uneconomic. “All of these consequences could precipitate sharp adjustments in asset prices, which would have consequences for financial stability.” Debelle noted Australia had traditionally come at the climate change debate largely through the prism of its impact on agriculture, but he said the changing climate created “significant risks and opportunities for a broader part of the economy than agriculture – though the impact on agriculture continues to be significant”. He said policymakers and businesses needed to “think in terms of trend rather than cycles in the weather”. “Droughts have generally been regarded, at least economically, as cyclical events that recur every so often. In contrast, climate change is a trend change. The impact of a trend is ongoing, whereas a cycle is temporary.” He said there was a need to reassess the frequency of climate change events, and “our assumptions about the severity and longevity of the climatic events”. He said the insurance industry had already recognised the frequency and severity of tropical cyclones and hurricanes in the northern hemisphere had changed, and this reassessment had prompted the sector to reprice how they insure and reinsure against such events. “We need to think about how the economy is currently adapting and how it will adapt both to the trend change in climate and the transition required to contain climate change,” Debelle said. He said the transition path to a less carbon-intensive world was “clearly quite different depending on whether it is managed as a gradual process or is abrupt”. “The trend changes aren’t likely to be smooth. There is likely to be volatility around the trend, with the potential for damaging outcomes from spikes above the trend.” Debelle noted the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had provided “strong evidence” that another half degree of warming was likely in the next 10 to 30 years. He said work from the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO pointed to an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events, and noted “extreme events may well have a disproportionately large physical impact”. “There is also a greater possibility of compound events, where two or more climatic events combine to produce an outcome that is worse than the effect of one of them occurring individually,” Debelle said. “Combined with the increased volatility, this increases the likelihood of nonlinear impacts on the economy.” Debelle said assessed through that lens, climate change-induced shocks to the economy would be “close to permanent” if droughts were more frequent and cyclones happened more often. “That situation is more challenging to assess and respond to.” He said the impacts of climate change on the economy were mixed both domestically and in terms of export earnings. The deputy governor pointed to the huge transition under way in Australia’s energy sector where the levelised cost of generating electricity had declined in the case of wind and solar “to the point where they are now cost-effective sources of generation”. But he said the massive shift in the direction of rooftop solar had consequences for the cost of electricity transmission and also the efficacy of current infrastructure. He said the RBA was paying close attention to developments in the energy market, “given the importance of the cost of electricity in inflation both directly to households and indirectly as a significant input to businesses”. Debelle noted there was a move in China to transition to cleaner energy sources. In the short run this had benefitted Australian coal exports, because the product was higher quality. But as China transitions away from coal, “natural gas is expected to account for a larger share of its energy mix and Australia is well placed to help meet this increase in demand”. He said Australia had prospects as an exporter of materials used in the production of renewable energy, including lithium, which is necessary for the batteries used in storage."
"Jaguar Land Rover has been forced to recall more than 44,000 cars for repairs after UK regulators found some models were emitting more carbon dioxide than previously thought. The Vehicle Certification Agency found 10 models for the Land Rover and Jaguar brands were emitting more greenhouse gases than had been certified initially. JLR then informed the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, which handles recalls, of the findings.  Britain’s largest carmaker will have to carry out free repairs on the models. JLR’s cars “may emit excessive levels of CO2 and may not conform with the certified condition”, according to the European commission’s rapid alert system. Recalls of cars to fix safety defects happen fairly often, but full product recalls because of exhaust emissions are rare. It is thought to be the first carbon dioxide-related recall for JLR. It will affect versions of the Land Rover Discovery, Discovery Sport, Range Rover Sport, Velar and Evoque made between 2016 and 2019. Jaguar models affected include the E-Pace, F-Pace, F-Type, XE and XF. Petrol and some diesel models will be part of the recall. The repairs could include software updates as well as physical alterations, and some Range Rover Evoque models will need new tyres, a JLR spokesperson said. Vehicle emissions have come under increased scrutiny in recent years following Volkswagen’s diesel scandal, in which it was found to have installed software to trick emissions tests. At the same time, international agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions has prompted multiple governments to announce plans to ban the sale of new fossil fuel-powered cars, with the UK to do so from 2040. European manufacturers are under pressure to reduce the average emissions of their new cars from 118.5g of CO2 per kilometre to less than 95g by 2021. Neil Barlow, DVSA’s head of vehicle engineering, said: “DVSA’s priority is to protect everyone from unsafe drivers and vehicles. This includes vehicles that are damaging our environment.” JLR’s recall is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s finances, but comes at a challenging time for the carmaker. JLR posted a record quarterly loss in February and announced about 4,500 job cuts the previous month. In a statement, JLR said: “Affected vehicles are being rectified to ensure the correct CO2 performance is dependably achieved. The modifications made to affected vehicles will be made free of charge and every effort will be made to minimise inconvenience to the customer during the short time required for the work to be carried out.”"
"Four months on, 17-year-old Doha Khan says the school climate strikers have learned a lot. On Friday, thousands of primary and high school students are again planning to walk out of class across the country, protesting against the government’s inaction on climate change, and what they see as the destruction of their future.  Up to 50 rallies, in scores of regional towns, are planned for 15 March. This time, the students will be joined by others in America and Europe, in what has become a global movement. At the November protests, thousands took to the streets. In Canberra, they met Greens senators, Labor MPs and the independent MP Rebehka Sharkie. They were told by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to “go to school”, and by the resources minister, Matt Canavan, that they were “learning to join the dole queue”. More recently, the New South Wales education minister, Rob Stokes, told students to stay in class because “you can’t strike if you don’t have a job”. But the leaders of Friday’s strike say the movement has only grown, gained momentum, and become smarter. “We really did take into account a lot of the criticism that came out of last year,” says Khan, who goes to the Glenunga International high school in Adelaide. “There were claims that the kids were just striking and didn’t have any demands. So this time around we’ve made our demands a lot clearer. “We have them set out on all banners: stopping the Adani coalmine. No new fossil fuel projects, 100% renewables by 2030.” This year, the number of rally points has grown, mostly in regional areas. There are 18 in New South Wales alone – from Bowral to Byron Bay – and Khan feels enthusiasm has risen, rather than quietened down. “This time our response rate has doubled,” she says. “Last time, a week before the strike, we had 1,000 responses on Facebook. This week we are over 2,300. We are now getting a hundred responses a day. That’s pretty cool – and this is just the Adelaide strike.” Shellie Joseph, a year 12 student from St Patrick’s College in Gympie, Queensland, is one of those regional students joining the protest for the first time. “Last year, I was so busy with work and school and extra-curricular things, I just couldn’t do it,” she says. “But after I heard about the impact it had, I really regretted not getting involved. “As soon as I heard there was another one this year, I called [the Australian Youth Climate Council] and said ‘Look I’d love to be part of this and organise a bus down to Brisbane or something’. They said ‘Why don’t you organise one for the Sunshine Coast?’” She says what has happened is “a dream come true”. “The reason for me declining initially [last year] was that I live in such a rural area. I live in Gympie. I thought I would really be by myself. I thought, ‘What’s the point?’. “I was so wrong. I was pleasantly surprised by the support from all of my peers and people from different schools, parents and teachers. We’ve got over 900 going or interested on our Facebook event. “I think the misconception is that we are bludging. [That] we are having the day off school for something that isn’t that important. I think people need to understand the science of it a bit more. “At school at the moment I do all the science subjects. I’m really passionate about science and I’m passionate about facts and passionate about our future … We’ve been forced into this by our government’s inaction. We shouldn’t have to be doing this.” Khan says she is confident there will be a big turnout. “Just this week I put together a little Instagram chat with school strikers in my school,” she says. “There’s 40 kids, and they’re just the ones I know. I’m sure they are going to bring their own friends.”"
"Sharp and potentially devastating temperature rises of 3C to 5C in the Arctic are now inevitable even if the world succeeds in cutting greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris agreement, research has found. Winter temperatures at the north pole are likely to rise by at least 3C above pre-industrial levels by mid-century, and there could be further rises to between 5C and 9C above the recent average for the region, according to the UN. Such changes would result in rapidly melting ice and permafrost, leading to sea level rises and potentially to even more destructive levels of warming. Scientists fear Arctic heating could trigger a climate “tipping point” as melting permafrost releases the powerful greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere, which in turn could create a runaway warming effect. “What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic,” said Joyce Msuya, the acting executive director of UN Environment. “We have the science. Now more urgent climate action is needed to steer away from tipping points that could be even worse for our planet than we first thought.” The findings, presented at the UN Environment assembly in Nairobi on Wednesday, give a stark picture of one of the planet’s most sensitive regions and one that is key to the fate of the world’s climate. Last year’s stark warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, setting out the dramatic impacts of 1.5C of global warming, did not include the impacts of potential tipping points such as melting permafrost. If melting permafrost triggers a tipping point, the likely results would be global temperature rises well in excess of the 2C set as the limit of safety under the Paris agreement. Nearly half of Arctic permafrost could be lost even if global carbon emissions are held within the Paris agreement limits, according to the UN study. Even if all carbon emissions were to be halted immediately, the Arctic region would still warm by more than 5C by the century’s end, compared with the baseline average from 1986 to 2005, according to the study from UN Environment. That is because so much carbon has already been poured into the atmosphere. The oceans also have become vast stores of heat, the effect of which is being gradually revealed by changes at the poles and on global weather systems, and will continue to be felt for decades to come. The assembly heard that there was still a need to fulfil the aims of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change and to take further action that could stave off some of the worst effects of warming in the near term. “We need to make substantial near-term cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, black carbon and other so-called short-lived climate pollutants all over the world,” said Kimmo Tiilikainen, Finland’s environment minister. Making drastic cuts to black carbon and short-lived pollutants such as methane could reduce warming by more than 0.5C, according to previous research."
"It’s been a while since we saw images of smog-obscured Beijing landmarks in the news. A United Nations report explains this. In four years, sulphur dioxide in the city was reduced by 70% and particle pollution by 36% by tackling the problem at source. Initially, old coal-powered industry and power stations were fitted with air pollution abatement systems before being replaced by cleaner facilities built to run on natural gas.  Cleaner road fuels, scrapping old vehicles and reducing solid fuel home heating helped too; all from an investment programme that reached 18bn yuan per year (£2bn) in 2017. But China’s efforts have not stopped there. Particle pollution in the 62 Chinese cities tracked by the World Health Organization (WHO) dropped by an average of 30% between 2013 and 2016. Beijing still has a long way to go to comply with WHO guidelines. Tackling the remaining air pollution requires new, smarter policies but the Chinese example shows what can be achieved with sufficient political will. In the UK, progress has been slower. Air pollution from traffic alongside some London roads worsened between 2010 and 2016. This underlines the need for stronger action such as the new ultra-low emission zone."
"It was a very long list. When we first considered the idea of a new investigative series looking at Australia’s less-scrutinised environmental issues, we knew we had to speak to those on the frontline. We discussed the idea with Australia’s top scientists and environmentalists and it became clear there were many issues needing urgent attention.  They were deeply worried about our fragile environment – our rivers, oceans, forests, flora and fauna were in trouble. When we launched Our wide brown land, this list of environmental concerns seemed to grow.  More animal and plant species than ever are under threat with little attention from those in power, native flora and fauna continue to be threatened by invasive species and our commitment to protecting the land through national parks is waning. We are in midst of a land-clearing crisis, the hard fought for forestry agreements are under threat, and, as highlighted by the recent fish kills, and communities running out of water, the Murray-Darling basin plan is falling apart. And Australia’s environmental protections are shrinking. There was more. The emissions reduction fund, which was set up to help cut greenhouse gases, has been used to upgrade fossil-fuelled power plants or to pay for cuts that would have happened anyway, while the increase in natural gas production means these emissions will cancel out any recent savings anyway. The recycling crisis has deepened and a lack of funding is stymying solutions, but plastic is now so ubiquitous it has been found in ocean floor sediment in one of Australia’s most isolated marine environments. Plus we’re lagging behind the rest of the world in the switch to electric cars. Fortunately there were also a few bright spots: Port Augusta, a former coal mining town, is leading the way in Australia with a raft of renewable energy projects. And citizen scientists are increasingly lending a hand to collect data for underfunded research projects. Our reporting helped to shape the debate. Some of the highlights include environment reporter Lisa Cox’s work on the questionable use of government funding earmarked for threatened species, which led to the launch of a national Senate inquiry. The issue was also raised during Senate estimates and forced the environment department and government to correct its record on threatened species spending. It has led to calls from scientists, environment groups and volunteers for an overhaul of Australia’s environment laws. Our articles on the renewal of the regional forest agreements caused a stir, and New South Wales Labor refused to sign off on the proposed extensions to the NSW RFAs because the government “knows the science underpinning the RFAs is out of date and incomplete”. And our extensive coverage of the crisis in the Murray-Darling basin plan helped to speed up the implementation of the royal commission. The team of journalists who worked on this section of our series won a 2018 UN day media award for the promotion of climate action. Yet clearly more work needs to be done. Only by highlighting these issues will they get the attention they deserve. So now we need to turn the spotlight on the growing climate crisis and its devastating impacts – some seen, some unfolding out of sight. This is why we are launching a new investigative series: The Frontline: Australia and the climate emergency. And once again we need your help to support our journalism and continue to raise awareness of these issues that we know you care so deeply about. If you would like to send us an idea, email us at thefrontline@theguardian.com."
"Carmakers gathering at the annual Geneva motor show this week were hoping the Alpine spring air and customary launches of new models would be a springboard for an industry fightback. Some of the world’s largest manufacturers have stumbled in the past 12 months, with sales under pressure on various fronts, particularly in Germany’s giant car industry. Ford and Jaguar Land Rover skipped the show after announcing thousands of job cuts in January.  Concerns in Europe over pollution have led to tighter restrictions on diesel cars and an ensuing dent in sales, and the Chinese market on which many manufacturers rely for growth shrank during 2018 for the first time in decades. Then there is Brexit. It hangs over manufacturers with British operations and the many more who sell to one of the world’s most lucrative car markets. Here are six things we learned at the show. This year’s gathering was the last before Brexit day on 29 March, and with only three weeks to go and the political mood pointing to either an extension of the negotiation period or no deal at all, carmakers’ warnings reached a new pitch of alarm. BMW gave a clear signal that a no-deal Brexit, in which trade defaults to World Trade Organization terms, including tariffs on cars and parts, could prove destructive for the British car industry. BMW’s Mini brand would face a “huge burden”, according to the board member Peter Schwarzenbauer, which might make it consider moving out of its Cowley plant in Oxford. Top executives from Toyota, Bentley and Vauxhall’s owner, PSA all expressed similar concerns about short and longer-term costs if barriers to trade between the UK and EU are erected. Maxime Picat, PSA’s operational director for Europe, said: “It’s difficult for me to imagine that you can rebuild a UK automotive industry, self-centred, looking only at the UK.” Despite JLR’s recent travails and its absence on the showroom floor, the victory of the Jaguar I-Pace in the coveted European car of the year award underlined one of the key trends in Geneva, the quickening pace of electrification as the price of batteries falls and demand for zero-emission vehicles rises. The I-Pace’s success set the stage for a range of models that rely on battery technology. Peugeot unveiled an electric version of its 208 supermini aimed at the mass market, Renault said its new Clio would have a hybrid option and the Volvo-owned Polestar 2 saloon is aiming for the same customer base as the US battery pioneer Tesla. Volkswagen, which is trying to move on from the emissions-cheating scandal that accelerated diesel’s decline, unveiled a beach buggy vehicle as part of the electric ID range, which will be in dealerships in 2020. Motor shows are still monuments to the consumer dream of owning and driving one’s own car but the coming shift to driverless vehicles is starting to register, even if the technology is not quite there yet. The German company e.Go Moove aims to produce almost fully autonomous minibuses by the middle of the next decade. Aston Martin’s sister brand, Lagonda, said it wanted its autonomous SUV to roll off its Welsh production line in 2022. While we await fully autonomous technology, Citroen’s Ami One concept takes a different approach to city mobility. The low-powered car would be picked up by anyone – even without a licence – using an app, in a similar way to city cycle hire schemes. At the luxury end of the market carmakers face completely different challenges in attracting customers. The French supercar maker Bugatti’s gambit at Geneva was nothing less than the world’s most expensive new car, La Voiture Noire, a one-off extravagance for an unnamed buyer priced at €11m (£9.5m). Stephan Winkelmann, Bugatti’s president, said the car represented extreme luxury, with a black carbon fibre body and a 1500-horsepower, 16-cylinder engine. Despite the hype over the gas-guzzling Bugatti, electrification is coming even at the very top end of the market. The Italian marque Pininfarina introduced the Battista all-electric hyper car, which can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph within two seconds. The challenge for luxury manufacturers is the timing of the inevitable change to electric. “We want to sell clean, high-power petrol engines for as long as we can,” said Bentley’s chief executive, Adrian Hallmark. Aside from carbon dioxide, however, the company still has another important output from internal combustion to work on, engine noise. Designers are focused on identifying the all-electric experience that will prompt drivers to shell out hundreds of thousands of pounds on a car. “We are in the entertainment industry, at the end of the day,” said McLaren’s chief financial officer, Paul Buddin. “It’s about how you feel when you’re driving the car.” Even Formula 1 racing bowed to the inevitable and got rid of its “grid girls” last year but a minority of exhibitors at Geneva appear to have missed the memo that having conspicuously young and tightly clothed women on their stands tends to be frowned upon. With the uncomfortable exception of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, most of the big brands have stamped out the practice. More niche brands, however, still featured the occasional throwback. The luxury car modifiers Mansory and Klassen, Pininfarina and the tyre makers Yokohama and Pirelli – maker of the infamous calendars - all featured models with expressions of intense boredom posing for men’s photos."
"Hundreds of thousands of children are expected to walk out of their classrooms on Friday for a global climate strike amid growing anger at the failure of politicians to tackle the escalating ecological crisis. Children at tens of thousands of schools in more than 100 countries are due to take part in the walkouts which began last year when one teenager – Greta Thunberg – held a solo protest outside the Swedish parliament. Since then the climate movement has snowballed with schoolchildren on every continent except Antarctica taking part. Friday’s strike is expected to be the biggest yet as evidence mounts of the climate emergency facing the planet. Amnesty International has warned that the failure of world governments to tackle the crisis could amount to “one of the greatest intergenerational human rights violations in history”. Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said: “It’s unfortunate that children have to sacrifice days of learning in school to demand that adults do the right thing. However, they know the consequences of the current shameful inaction both for themselves and future generations. This should be a moment for stark self-reflection by our political class.” Young people are expected to take to the streets in cities across Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa and the US on Friday. In the UK more than 10,000 children walked out of class last month and organisers expect Friday’s event to be even bigger with about 100 events taking place involving thousands of schools across the country. Anna Taylor, 17, who co-founded the UK student climate network, said: “Young people in the UK have shown that we’re angry at the lack of government leadership on climate change. “Those in power are not only betraying us, and taking away our future, but are responsible for the climate crisis that’s unfolding in horrendous ways around the world.” Taylor said the UK had been relatively shielded from the effects of the crisis so far, adding that “those least responsible for contributing to climate change are already suffering the worst effects”. She added: “It is our duty to not only act for those in the UK and our futures, but for everyone. That’s what climate justice means.” In Scotland, the Guardian is aware of strikes planned in 19 different locations, from South Uist in the Outer Hebrides to St Andrews on the east coast, with large gatherings expected in Glasgow’s George Square and outside the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh. One of the UK’s most prominent school strikers, Holly Gillibrand, will be taking part, after staging a weekly action outside her school in Fort William, in the Scottish Highlands.  “It’s going to be quite impressive,” said Gillibrand of the School Strike for Climate movement, “and it’s incredibly inspiring that it all started with Greta striking on her own”. Asked whether she feels optimistic about the potential of Friday’s protest, Gillibrand replied: “I wouldn’t say optimistic is quite the right word. It shows there are thousands of students out there who care very deeply about the environment and are willing to miss school to demand that politicians take this ecological crisis seriously.” World leaders may listen to the school pupils taking part in one of the largest global climate change protests ever, but the key test is whether they take action, said the 13-year-old. According to the Scottish Green party, nine councils – which cover 16 of the 21 Scottish locations understood to have schoolchildren involved in protests – have indicated in response to letters from their MSPs that they will not pursue punitive action against young people taking part. Méabh Mackenzie is organising a protest with about 30 fellow pupils from Daliburgh primary school on the island of South Uist, with the express purpose of standing in solidarity with other threatened island communities across the globe. The 11-year-old explained: “I just wanted to share what I believe in. Uist is really low lying and I really love the place and don’t want it to disappear.” Some friends are “not into it at all”, she suspects because they do not want to go out in the cold – the forecast is for hail on Friday. “I think all the striking around the world will let politicians and lawmakers know that they have to do something because it is falling down the list of priorities. They are arguing about things like Brexit but we need them to act now on climate change. because in 12 years we can’t turn anything back.” In Belgium, thousands of workers will be striking to join the school students’ protest in locations such as Antwerp, Bruges and Liège, before travelling to Brussels for a large demonstration. Blue- and white-collar workers are being mobilised across the Flemish-Francophone divide, after an appeal from the Youth For Climate campaign, which has organised weekly demonstrations of up to 35,000 youths since January. Gina Heyrman, a spokeswoman for the 1.6 million-strong socialist trades union ABVV-FGTB, noted “similarities” with the Paris protests of 1968. She said: “This is the first time we have had a political strike together with young people. Maybe we’re at the beginning of a new era. I hope so. Everyone talks about the climate now. Everyone is aware of it, thanks to the students.” The rival CSC Christian trade union is also planning a “massive mobilisation”, although some of its workers cannot strike because of a strike notification law. The CFDT union in France is also calling for every member to participate in Friday’s climate action. Earlier this year Thunberg, who started the movement, told a gathering of political leaders and billionaire entrepreneurs in Davos: “I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act.”"

"It doesn’t surprise me that the environmental justice movement began in the south, a place where, historically, the pressure of injustice builds until it explodes into organized resistance. The Warren, North Carolina, protests of 1982 are considered one of the earliest examples of the environmental justice movement. A manufacturer of electrical transformers dumped tons of cancer-causing PCB waste along 240 miles of North Carolina’s highways. When it came time for the clean up, the North Carolina government chose Warren – a small, predominantly African American town – for the toxic waste facility. There were weeks of protests and over 500 arrests. It was an awakening, showing the country that race and class play a part in who has to live near toxic waste. I spoke with Almena Myles, one of the protesters. Even 30 years later, the incident has left a mark. “I learned why we were targeted. They chose us because we were rural and poor and they thought we couldn’t fight it,” she told me. “They thought we wouldn’t understand. It was a crash course in advocacy. We felt we had stepped back in time, like it was the 1960s all over again and we had to fight for our rights as if it was the civil rights movement.” These are, unfortunately, not just corporate practices of the past. Today, Louisiana’s impoverished river communities are polluted by big oil and companies, creating the so-called “Cancer Alley”. Pahokee, Florida, a town whose population is 56% African-American and 29% Hispanic, has had to confront the sugar industry, which polluted nearby Lake Okeechobee, endangering drinking water, fish safety, and property values. Paper mills have polluted Africatown, Alabama. Burlington Industries dumped cancer-causing PCBs in Cheraw, South Carolina. There’s toxic coal ash in Uniontown, Alabama. The list goes on and on. In January, I travelled to Mississippi to meet Heather McTeer Toney, an Obama appointee to the Environmental Protection Agency and the first black mayor of Greenville, Mississippi. On her mind were the minority communities on the frontlines of climate change disasters in the south. “Immediate action is required, and we can’t just have the conversations in Washington,” she said. “Citizens need to step into roles to protect themselves from what’s coming. The government isn’t agile enough.” An estimated 70% of the country’s contaminated waste sites are located near low-income housing, and an Associated Press analysis suggests 2 million people live within a mile of one of the 327 Superfund sites vulnerable to climate change-related flooding, most of them in low-income communities and communities of color. The south-east, particularly North Carolina and Virginia, is notorious for its coal ash deposits, spills, and anti-regulation mentality. People of color have outsized exposure to coal ash pollution, which contains carcinogens like mercury, lead, and arsenic. The EPA estimates that 1.5 million people of color live in areas vulnerable to contamination. I decided to visit Virginia to learn more and arrived in February, Black History Month. Governor Ralph Northam was on a listening tour following his blackface photo scandal, and a bill allowing local governments to determine the future of Confederate monuments had just been easily defeated, 6-2. I wondered: if Virginia is still fighting culture battles, how can it address the imminent threats of climate change effectively and protect all its citizens? Norfolk, Virginia, is one of the most flood-prone cities on the east coast. Through a grant from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, the city is piloting advanced resilience measures like micro-grids, oyster reef restoration, green stormwater management, and a “People First Initiative” that sets aside money to help the displaced. However, some of the actions meant to help low-income residents – like moving people out of flood-prone housing – raise questions of gentrification. For example, a public housing neighborhood called Tidewater Gardens will soon be razed to make way for a mixed-use project. The Norfolk city councilman Paul Riddick feels that the initiative is yet another example of urban gentrification that excludes non-white contractors, and of the generational transfer of wealth. Though Northam recently encouraged bipartisan legislation requiring Virginia’s Dominion Power Company to excavate and clean up its ash ponds, citizens will fund the $5bn cleanup bill, not the company. Furthermore, Dominion is pursuing a pipeline project that would place a pollution-generating compressor station in the historic black community of Union Hill. While in Virginia, I visited Rick Middleton in Charlottesville to learn more about the history of environmental justice in the south. Middleton is an Alabama-born lawyer and founder of the Southern Environmental Law Center, one of the largest environmental law organizations in the world. Its work has been instrumental in coal ash cleanup across the south, and it has sought to help communities of color such as Union Hill, Virginia, and Walnut Tree, North Carolina, challenge industrial pollution. I asked him why he started the organization. “I was idealistic,” he said. “And I believe in justice.” Virginia’s current ethical race-based fumbles are stereotypical of what people expect from the south. What outsiders don’t always expect are the intelligent and passionate movements that grow in response to systematic injustice here. “Why did you come back to the south?” I asked Middleton, wondering why he chose to open the SELC in Charlottesville. “Yale Law School was my first time in the north-east,” he said. “Because of my Alabama accent, people assumed I was an ignorant southerner, and it made me want to identify even more as a southerner.” He witnessed what he felt was a lack of interest from major environmental groups. “They didn’t know the area or think they could raise money down here,” he said. At the time, air pollution was a serious problem, and there was a clear need for the enforcement of standards. Middleton thought he could help. “Advocacy is essential,” Middleton continued, ”but you cannot succeed at environmental protection without lawyers, especially when you’re up against political power and resources.” I asked what it was like working against conservative ideology in the south. “It wasn’t always that way,” Middleton explained. “When we first started, people wanted clean air. The environment wasn’t politicized. We had public opinion behind us.” In the late 70s and early 80s, Middleton told me, companies weren’t savvy about environmental laws, and winning cases was easier. Eventually, companies began to staff their own environmental lawyers, and then came the Reagan administration, which strengthened the conservative ideology that still persists in the south today: that government is the enemy, and regulation prevents prosperity. Those ardently opposed to regulation might ask themselves how much they trust corporations to keep their air and drinking water clean. They might review the sheer number of Superfund sites that sat in the path of Hurricane Florence, and consider that the burden of cleanup costs often falls on taxpayers instead of the polluting companies. Combined, the six southern states the SELC represents, Middleton tells me, would be the eighth-largest contributor of greenhouse gases in the world. It isn’t a region environmentalists can afford to ignore. Despite working against the political grain, the SELC has taken energy cases to the supreme court, resulting in the largest power plant cleanup in history. They’ve cleaned up coal-fired power, resulting in a 29% decrease in CO2 emissions in the region. The organization has protected millions of acres of land, and prevented uranium mining projects that would have endangered the drinking water of 1.1 million people. I realize that in my 30 years of living in the region, even I took this work for granted. It isn’t fast or glamorous – the SELC sometimes spends 10 to 15 years in litigation. When Middleton and I walk two blocks from his office to the Charlottesville mall, a city center lined with shops, Middleton points first to an independent bookstore he loves, and second to the place where, a year ago, a white supremacist murdered the protester Heather Heyer with his car. Environmental advocates, like those at SELC, are working across a divided nation. “I had no idea it would become as partisan as it is today. It has gotten so bad,” Middleton says. “People will tell me, ‘You’re not so bad for an environmentalist.’ Tell me - how did the idea of caring about the environment become leftwing political ideology?” We both acknowledge that climate change is going to make things worse. “It’s a slow, insidious process,” he says. “America is a crisis society – we don’t pay attention to anything until there’s a real crisis.” If companies are not held responsible for the pollution they cause, and the government does not act to protect all citizens, we may have several crises to choose from."
"As soon as Blythe Pepino got together with her partner Joshua two years ago, she felt “this overwhelming urge to create a family with him”, she says. “I think it was the fifth day after having met him, I said: ‘I’ve got to meet your parents.’ He was like: ‘You’re mad.’” Then, late last year, she attended a lecture held by the direct action group Extinction Rebellion, which set out starkly the catastrophic reality of the changing climate. That galvanised Pepino, an activist and musician (she is the former singer of Vaults, now Mesadorm), to do research of her own and, eventually, to have a series of sad conversations with Joshua. “I realised that even though I wanted to have a family at that point, I couldn’t really bring myself to do it,” she says. “I had to say to him: ‘I don’t know if I can do this, considering what we know – if there isn’t a political will to fix this, we really don’t stand much of a chance.’” Pepino, who turns 33 today, found that other women – especially those in climate-conscious circles – were struggling with the same question, but were “too afraid to talk about it” for fear of judgment or ridicule. The US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gave voice to their concerns last month, pointing to the increasingly dire scientific consensus and widespread government inaction: “It does lead young people to have a legitimate question: is it OK still to have children?” And so Pepino decided to publicly announce her decision – strategically making the personal political – by setting up BirthStrike, a voluntary organisation for women and men who have decided not to have children in response to the coming “climate breakdown and civilisation collapse”. In doing so, she hopes to channel the grief she feels about her decision “into something more active and regenerative and hopeful”. In just two weeks, 140 people, mostly women in the UK, have declared their “decision not to bear children due to the severity of the ecological crisis”, says Pepino. “But we have also had people get in touch to say: ‘Thank you for speaking out about something that I didn’t feel I could even talk to my family about,’” she adds. Many of these BirthStrikers are involved with Extinction Rebellion, which on Saturday threw buckets of red paint outside Downing Street to symbolise “the death of our children” from climate change. Pepino says that BirthStrike is distinct from the antinatalist movement (which says that having children is morally wrong because sentient life is so awful), and its aim is not to discourage people from having children, or to condemn those who have them already, but to communicate the urgency of the crisis. It is a “radical acknowledgment” of how the looming existential threat is already “altering the way we imagine our future”. “We’re not trying to solve it through BirthStrike,” she says. “We’re trying to get the information out there.” In fact, she says, population reduction has been shown to be an ineffective strategy. A 2017 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA explored various scenarios for global human population change by adjusting fertility and mortality rates. It found that even imposing one-child policies worldwide and “catastrophic mortality events” would not significantly reduce the global population by 2100. It proposes instead that “more immediate results for sustainability would emerge from policies and technologies that reverse rising consumption of natural resources”. “Even with drastic, draconian, eugenic policies of population reduction – which are completely immoral,” says Pepino, “we wouldn’t save ourselves. We have to change the way we live.” A different 2017 study did find that having one fewer child was the most effective way a person could cut their own carbon emissions – but there is damning evidence that the crisis is well past the point of being able to be mitigated by the choices of individuals. Hannah Scott, 23, works for an environmental charity. She says that even climate activists are in denial about the gravity of the situation, with her own BirthStrike eliciting responses such as “maybe it won’t be so extreme and apocalyptic” and “life is about having children”. She believes it is already too late to claw back the damage done. “That’s why I am not having one – because I feel so desperately that it would be bringing a life into a future that does seem ever more desolate. Every time a friend tells me they’re pregnant, or planning on having children, I have to bite my tongue.” BirthStrike, she says, “is about saying: ‘It is OK to make this choice, but it’s not OK to have to make this choice.’ We should never be in a situation where we are genuinely scared to bring life into the world.”  BirthStrike is as much a support group as it is a political statement, says spokeswoman Alice Brown, a 25-year-old charitable campaigns manager from Bristol. As a former nanny and support worker, having children of her own had been on Brown’s “to-do list for life” until one of the girls she used to care for developed allergies which, Brown says, was as a result of pollution. Her decision was cemented with last month’s report on the “catastrophic” impact of plummeting insect numbers, and the increasingly “panicked, emergency language” of the scientific community. “We are hurtling towards disaster, and if I can bring awareness to the situation by sharing this personal choice that I’ve made, I’m willing to do it. It is sort of desperation. I don’t know if I’ll regret being so public about it one day.” Brown is especially concerned about the potential toll her decision may have on her relationship, which she is reluctant to speak about beyond confirming that – were it not for the state of the planet – children would likely have been part of the conversation. She is keen to adopt, but worries that the option may be removed from her: she was arrested last year for civil disobedience for spraying chalk paint on the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy during a protest with Extinction Rebellion. “I hate telling people that, it sounds so childish,” she says, but she worries that further direct action campaigns could land her with a criminal record. “I’m just so terrified of what my child will be facing when they are my age,” she says. “It’s not just about the ideology – will they be born into a world where things are fair, where things are safer – it’s the practical side of it: will they actually be in survival mode?” There are infinite unknowns about the future, Brown agrees. She is reading the US journalist David Wallace-Wells’s apocalyptic page-turner The Uninhabitable Earth, which explores many of them – but none, she says, have persuaded her that it would be right to have a child of her own. “I understand many people may think it’s a strange response. Someone said to me the other day: ‘People still have children in war zones.’ I can only say that it is totally personal and probably no one – certainly not me – is qualified to decide what would make it worthwhile and what wouldn’t.” But it was nonetheless a relief, she says, when Ocasio-Cortez said it was “legitimate” for millennials to consider not having children because of the state of the earth. “It makes me feel more confident and maybe more legitimate in what I’m talking about – that somebody who is in the public eye, who is taking the crisis as seriously as it should be taken, is saying the same thing.” Yet Wallace-Wells, whose book begins “It is worse, much worse, than you think”, goes on to write about the birth of his daughter. In interviews, he has said that he wanted to have children “for reasons independent of climate … Most people do. I don’t think this is an impulse we need to disavow before we have finished the final act of this story. I think it is a reason to fight.” If calamity proves a catalyst for change, “the greatest story ever told … may well have a happy ending”, he concludes in The Uninhabitable Future. The 10,000 young people in the UK alone who went on strike from school over climate last month and activists such as 16-year-old Greta Thunberg suggest his daughter’s generation may play a pivotal role. Pepino, at least, takes a similarly optimistic view of BirthStrikers’ approach. It is, she says, “in a sense a very hopeful act. We’re not just making this decision, hiding it and giving it up. We’re politicising that decision – and hoping that will give us the chance to change our minds.”"
"There will be another large-scale school climate strike tomorrow, following a controversial walkout by pupils last month. I say controversial; the reaction in much of the grownup media was perhaps better described as a reluctant obligation to be adult about the whole thing, while secretly cheering them on. Even prominent Conservatives struggled to feign disapproval of this wanton act of civic engagement by the next generation. Energy minister Claire Perry wistfully told the BBC she would have joined the walkouts in her younger years. She may take a different line if the kids keep it up – it is, after all, her department they are protesting against. To my surprise, the most ardent voices of dissent have come from educators. In opposing the protests, education reformers such as Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, and Toby Young, the free schools evangelist, seem to have missed the point of efforts over the past decade to raise education standards. For what does excellence in education look like if it’s not pupils being engaged enough on issues such as climate change to do something about them? Rather than calling schoolchildren truants when they show up for society in a way that puts the rest of us to shame – we should be using the strikes as a measure of school performance. In my book, any secondary school that doesn’t have pupils informed enough to join the protests is underachieving. Perhaps that sounds like irresponsible, progressive nonsense. But it is fully in line with the education policies that those opposing the strikes have spent the last decade championing in schools. Under this government, the Department for Education has been zealous about the importance of promoting “character” in schools. This is the idea that, alongside formal learning, schoolchildren need to be developing traits such as courage, resilience, and determination in order to thrive in adult life. In lockstep with this agenda, the education sector has been near universal in its support over the past six years of a government-backed campaign to promote social action in schools as a way of building these traits and skills. Educators had it right then. Social action – practical action to achieve social change – is shown to have a huge range of educational benefits for children who take part from a young age. It cultivates skills that are highly sought after by employers and aids wellbeing, while tapping into the natural motivations of young people, who care about social issues more than any other generation. This is why any truly responsible teacher out there should be supporting and encouraging their pupils to walk out of school. It is a golden learning opportunity – for the whole school, on an issue that can be drawn into subject teaching. The real problem with the climate strike is not a conflict between education and campaigning. Schools have been doing campaigns for decades. The problem is that this time, the children mean it – and this time, they’re doing it on their own terms. You see, politicians and grownups love the idea of young people being “active citizens” – as long as it is in a way that is obedient and upholds the status quo. Get your Duke of Edinburgh award. Pick up some litter. Do it at the weekend. What they can’t stomach is the idea that schoolchildren should have real power and agency on the issues they care about. Greta Thunberg, who instigated the climate strikes, is 16 years old. Yet she has more acumen and conviction than the entire generation of adults who are supposed to be educating her. This is not how power is supposed to work. But she is not an outlier. As the director of Generation Change, I have seen primary school pupils as young as five and six debate the refugee crisis before deciding how they make a difference. I’ve seen teenagers on programmes such as Envision and City Year tackle social problems that politicians from all parties have failed to solve for decades. This is what education can look like when we don’t have such pitifully low expectations about the role young people can play in society. In an age where children and teenagers have the same tools of achieving change as the rest of us, we will continue to see them take up power on the big issues of our time. This leave us with a choice. We can either redesign education so that change-making is a normal part of growing up; or we can keep pushing young people to the sidelines of society and hope they’ll leave things to the grownups. Given the state of the world today, why on earth would we want that? • David Reed is director of Generation Change, a charity that promotes youth social action in the UK"
"A relief teacher at a New South Wales high school, who is also a Greens candidate, is being investigated by the Department of Education over remarks made at a candidates’ forum about the upcoming student climate strike. Will Douglas, who has worked casually at Moruya high school on the state’s south coast since 2006, has been told he will not be offered any more shifts at the school while the investigation takes place.  It comes as the principal of a Victorian Catholic school warned students that striking was an “unapproved” absence that could lead to a zero if they missed any official tests on the day. Inspired by Swedish student Greta Thunberg, the movement calls on students to partially strike from school to protest government inaction on fighting climate change. More than 50 rallies, in Australian capital cities and regional towns, are planned for 15 March. Douglas, who is contesting the seat of Bega in the upcoming state election, appeared at a lunchtime candidates’ forum organised by Youth Action at the Moruya golf club last Thursday, alongside local Liberal MP Andrew Constance and Labor candidate Leanne Atkinson. Douglas said he attended the forum with the knowledge of his superiors at the school. During the forum, which was attended by students from a range of high schools, Douglas said “please don’t forget March 15 the climate strike … if there’s something happening at your school will you please get online and register because there’s a whole community out there wanting to support you guys, young people, in that strike”. The remarks were published in News Corp’s Daily Telegraph on Monday, in an article that also revealed a complaint had been made to the department and that an investigation was under way. Douglas told Guardian Australia he had no knowledge of any investigation until contacted by the newspaper and he did not know who had made the complaint. He said the principal told him this week he would not be working any more shifts at the school until the investigation was complete. “I was speaking on my own time in my lunch break as a Greens candidate at a youth forum,” he said. “Now I don’t have any work. It shouldn’t be this hard to speak up for climate action.” Douglas said Moruya high was a wonderful school, and that he had been treated with nothing but respect by the principal. However he believed the complaint itself was “politically motivated”. A spokeswoman for the department said they were making inquiries into the matter but that it would be inappropriate to comment on the employment status of an individual teacher. “While the department understands students may be passionate about a range of issues, all students who are enrolled at school are expected to attend that school whenever instruction is provided,” she said.  “Staff members providing advice contrary to departmental policies may be subject to allegations of misconduct.” Meanwhile in Victoria, the principal of Catholic girls school Siena College sent a letter to students and parents last week warning that striking students could receive a zero if they missed official tests and assignments on the day. “We acknowledge the students’ right to give voice to their very genuine concerns regarding the federal government’s record on climate change,” the principal, Gaynor Robson-Garth wrote. “Attendance at the strike will however be an ‘unapproved’ absence from school. If a student chooses to participate in the strike, VCE school-assessed coursework and other assessment tasks will be recorded as not assessed (NA) and no alternative opportunity will be provided to complete any missed assessments. “The decision to participate in the strike is entirely a decision for parents and students. The strike is not endorsed by the college.” Last November, thousands of Australian students walked out of school to attend rallies across the country. Since then, strikes have been organised in the UK and the United States, and 15 March has been billed as a global day of action, with further strikes organised for the US and Europe on the same day. In February, the NSW education minister, Rob Stokes, told students that they “should be at school” on the day. Student Doha Khan from Adelaide told Guardian Australia on Monday the students had three demands: stopping the Adani coalmine, no new fossil fuel projects and 100% renewables by 2030."
"It is no surprise that the government’s strategy on fracking has been deemed unlawful (Fracking guidance illegally ignores climate change, 7 March). Gas may be more fuel efficient than coal when burnt, but shale gas is 95% methane, and methane is a powerful greenhouse gas. According to the IPCC it has a global warming potential (GWP) 85 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe. Misleadingly, HMG have relied on an obsolete figure of 36 for the GWP of methane, dating back to 2013. Methane levels plateaued in the late 1990s, but have started to increase again over the past decade and have now reached 1,900 parts per billion, against a pre-industrial level of 700. Fracking is the obvious culprit. Satellite data over the US has shown that methane leakage exceeds 5% of shale gas production, an observation that fits with more recent studies by Nasa showing that fossil fuels are the major contributor to the continuing rise in atmospheric methane.  Despite this evidence, the government’s energy strategy is to forge ahead with fracking while reducing environmental safeguards and providing tax incentives for its development. The government claim that gas is better than coal from a climate change perspective is only sustainable if fugitive emissions of methane are ignored. Let us hope that the high court judgment means that fracking will be abandoned in the UK as it has been elsewhere in Europe.Dr Robin Russell-Jones Scientific adviser to the all-party parliamentary group on air pollution (APPG) Geraint Davies MP Chair, APPG • Although I agree that climate change needs to be tackled, it is too simplistic for the Committee on Climate Change to suggest not connecting all new-build schemes to the gas grid from 2025 (Call for ban on gas hobs and boilers in new homes by 2025, 21 February). If the committee gets its way and all new builds are off-gas, then electricity for solutions such as heat pumps still needs to come from somewhere. Unless the electricity comes from a zero-carbon source, it defeats the object. If the whole of the country came off gas, we would need the power of about 30 nuclear power stations, and currently we have eight! Also, if we do switch to hydrogen gas then these homes without a gas connection could not be connected in the future and would miss the other benefits that hydrogen gas could deliver such as carbon-free cooking. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has already acknowledged that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the decarbonisation of heating. Instead, different solutions should be working together. A hybrid system that uses a heat pump up to a certain temperature, which is then supported by a gas boiler, would be very effective not only in new build but many existing homes as well. Carbon emissions will be even lower if the gas boiler is run on hydrogen gas. Instead of advocating for unreasonable promises from government, the CCC should be supporting the research that is already under way into new “no carbon fuels”. I’d even like to extend an invitation to the CCC’s chief executive, Chris Stark, to a prototype demonstration we have planned later in the year, where we will show how a 100% hydrogen boiler will run.Carl Arntzen CEO, Worcester Bosch Group; chairman, the Domestic Heat Strategy Group  • Our unsustainable lifestyles and commitment to perpetual economic growth have become the major drivers of climate change. Jason Hickel suggests that the solution is “about changing the way our economy operates” (Climate breakdown is coming. The UK needs a Greener New Deal, theguardian.com, 5 March). Encouragingly, the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) form a new roadmap for our future that in principle aligns the economy with the Earth’s life support systems. Yet a recent report by the Stockholm Resilience Centre[1] shows that attempting to achieve the socio-economic goals using conventional growth policies would make it virtually impossible to reduce the speed of global warming and environmental degradation. The research team tested three other scenarios and the only one that met all goals was the one that implemented systemic transformational change. A key element in the model was reducing inequality by a redistribution of wealth, work and income, including ensuring that the 10% richest people take no more that 40% of the income.

"We’re the UK Student Climate Network. We’re young, we’re students and we’re calling for change. Our movement started in February when tens of thousands of young people took to the streets in towns and cities around Britain, in an unprecedented emergence of a youth climate justice movement. We’ve joined a movement that’s spreading rapidly across the world, catalysed by the actions of one individual in taking a stand in August last year. Greta Thunberg may have been the spark, but we’re the wildfire and we’re fuelled by the necessity for action.  The climate is in crisis. We will be facing ecological catastrophe and climate breakdown in the very near future if those in power don’t act urgently and radically to change our trajectory. Scientists have been giving increasingly dire warnings about the state of our planet for years, with the urgency and severity of their message escalating in recent times. It’s abundantly clear: change is needed, and it’s needed now! Previous generations and those in positions of power have failed to protect us, they’ve failed to ensure we’ve got a future to look forward to. Not only this, those elected to lead and govern have betrayed countless people across the world already suffering the devastating impacts of climate change. The burden for creating the change we need to see in the world has sadly fallen upon us and our peers around the world, unified in our common struggle to address the climate crisis. Failure is not an option, that’s why we’re demanding the following: The government must declare a climate emergency and prioritise the protection of life on Earth, taking active steps to achieve climate justice. We must realign our economy along environmental principles to protect not only the planet, but also to create an equitable world for all people. Our education system is failing us. We’re not being adequately taught about the climate crisis in our classrooms. Schools are not preparing us for the world we’re about to enter, yet still prepare us for jobs and a society based on the system that caused the crisis. We must urgently reform the national curriculum and learn to address the ecological crisis as an educational priority. The government must also communicate to the general public the severity of the ecological crisis and the necessity to act now. The population cannot be expected to hold those in power to account without the necessary information. Our environment is being destroyed and we have a right to know the facts. The government must recognise that us, young people have the biggest stake in the future. Legislation must be immediately adopted to lower the voting age to 16 and incorporate youth views into policy making. For too long we’ve been disenfranchised and frozen out of the political system. It’s clear that politics isn’t working. We can’t keep operating within these failing models of civic engagement. Without reconfiguring the way decision making takes place, we’ll be incapable of addressing the climate crisis. We need you to listen, we need you to support us. This is a common struggle. It encompasses all people, and will require action across all of society. There’s no longer time for those who want to deny or delay. We need to continue demonstrating, we need to keep rising up and we need to disrupt the status quo. If the politicians and those in power won’t make the changes we need to see in the world, then it’s time they step aside or else we’ll remove them to put those in power that will. • UK Student Climate Network is a small group of volunteers who were inspired by the powerful and direct protests made by young people against climate inaction across the rest of Europe"
"I first encountered Barry Lopez’s work in 1997, buying a copy of Arctic Dreams from a Vancouver bookshop because I was attracted by the picture of an iceberg on the cover, and intrigued by its subtitle: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape. I subsequently read it while walking the west coast of Vancouver Island over several days. Arctic Dreams was to me – as it has been to so many others – a revelation. It was a life-changing book. Its braiding of cultural and natural history, archaeology, ethnography, philosophy and something very like prose-poetry was both audacious and graceful. Lopez broke open for me the possibilities of what we still weirdly call “non-fiction” (thereby defining it only in negative and restricting relation to fiction). I was only, of course, catching up with what millions of readers had known for a decade: Arctic Dreams was recognised as a landmark work immediately on publication in 1986, winning a National Book award and staying in the US bestseller lists for months. It has never been out of print and now, in our fast-warming world, reads as a premonitory elegy for a vanishing Arctic. Like many who came to Lopez first through Arctic Dreams, I sought out much of his other work, compelled by its stylistic adventure, its ethical address and the secular spirituality of land that it advanced – evident especially in its deference to traditional ecological knowledge, and to animals as tutelary presences. I read Of Wolves and Men (1978), as well as Crossing Open Ground (1988) and About This Life (1998) – two slender essay collections that are, to my mind, stone-cold classics – and I explored Lopez’s fiction, from Desert Notes (1976) to The Grace Note of the Canyon Wren (1994). All the while I waited impatiently for his next full-length work of non-fiction – the follow-up to Arctic Dreams. For almost two decades I waited. Still it did not come. Would it ever? Then I began to hear whispers; there was a title, Horizon. There was a huge typescript, 30 or more years in the travelling and writing, undergoing meticulous revisions.  Now, at last, that book has sailed into view. Anticipation often leads to overdetermination, and overdetermination to disappointment. Not so in this case. Horizon is magnificent; a contemporary epic, at once pained and urgent, personal and oracular. It is being described as Lopez’s “crowning achievement”, but I prefer to see it less teleologically as a partner to Arctic Dreams, and the late enrichment of an already remarkable body of work. In his memoir Berlin Childhood Around 1900, Walter Benjamin reflected on the possibility of representing one’s life cartographically. Horizon comes as close as any book I know to realising this ambition. It tells the story of Lopez’s life through six main landscapes – from Cape Foulweather on the Oregon coast to the Queen Maud Mountains of Antarctica, by way of Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic, the Turkana Uplands of East Africa and Port Arthur in Tasmania. Place becomes the means of fathoming time; the book also moves over its course from Lopez as an “unsuspecting boy, a child beside himself with his desire to know the world, to swim out farther than he can see”, to Lopez now – an “elder” who carries a huge cargo of wisdom but is unsure how best to land it or what good it might do. The life journey told here is one from “longing to go” to “having gone”; it may also theologically be characterised as one from hope to doubt. It has always been among Lopez’s great powers as a writer to bring the natural world to resonate metaphysically, without treating it as just another form of resource. Throughout Horizon, matter is present both as itself and as metaphor – from the great storm that threatens Cape Foulweather in the first chapter, to the tiny, ancient flakes of “debitage” (knapped and discarded flint) over which he stoops in the Thule region of the Canadian Arctic. Again and again, phenomenal presences – birds, elk, rocks, ice – ring like struck bells in the mind. Of these, the most recurrent is that of the horizon itself. Ralph Waldo Emerson described the horizon as the “point of astonishment”, mischievously converting it to a thing that it is not. For a horizon is always a line and never a point. The word comes from the Greek hóros, meaning “boundary”; whether that boundary seals the eye in or summons it on depends on circumstance. Early on, Lopez describes setting up a telescope on Cape Foulweather and “working the ocean’s horizon from right to left … the beckoning line where the dark edge of the ocean trembled against the sky”. The sweep he makes is a probing of space, but we understand it also to be a prospecting of the future. To look to the horizon has long been – for mariners, explorers and fieldworkers of all kinds – the simplest form of augury. What weather is coming? The Anthropocene answer to that is, of course: “the worst imaginable – and fast”. The event horizon of climate change is swiftly narrowing its noose. Lopez’s writing throughout this book is pulled taut between his need to register the extreme urgency of the environmental crisis, and his long-held belief in time, patience and the careful observation of other cultures as the basis for a fix: “As time grows short, the necessity to listen attentively to foundational stories other than our own becomes imperative.” “One of the penalties of an ecological education,” the US conservationist Aldo Leopold famously noted, “is that one lives alone in a world of wounds.” The wounding has intensified drastically since Leopold’s remark, but the loneliness has decreased. Environmental anxiety – “psychoterratica” in Glenn Albrecht’s jagged term – is now widespread; at least one has company for one’s fears. Lopez quotes the Polish poet Adam Zagajewski on “the mutilated world”, and speaks himself of “the throttled Earth” that “is now our home”. Horizon is a deeply wounded book. It grieves for harm done and harm ahead. “I want everyone here to survive what is coming,” Lopez says. A lifetime’s training in listening to others has left him vastly empathic – blessed and burdened with a love for all. A poetry of pity is present here that is recognisable from Arctic Dreams. What is new is the fury. In a startling passage, he excoriates “the hedge fund manager who amasses material wealth with no thought for the fate of the pensioner he cheats”, calling him “a kind of suicide bomber”. Lopez sets forth a running argument with free-market capitalism and fiduciary duty, for causing us to “characterise other people as vermin in the struggle for market share”, to “navigate without an ethical compass”. He reports on the “cultural detonation” under way on the Burrup Peninsula in western Australia, where “25,000 years’ worth of Aboriginal rock art” have been bulldozed to allow industrial development; petroglyphs turned to “construction debris”, “the flayed walls of the caves at Lascaux and Chauvet, dumped in a barrow ditch”. Lopez is happiest at high and low latitudes. The chapters on the Canadian Arctic and Antarctica are superb sustained pieces of writing set in “siren landscapes”; short books in themselves, really. The “dark threads” of both places are traced and acknowledged, but – more distant from the frontlines of atrocity – Lopez is freer to focus and to roam. He accompanies specialists – archaeologists, native hunters, polar scientists – and learns to read place as they do. Here, as in previous books, his respectful fascination for indigenous communities is apparent; especially their powers of resilience, skilful adaptation and community-based decision making under pressure. Lopez himself is also a veteran fieldworker, of course; his skills are those of attention and interpretation. In one of the few even faintly comic moments in the book, he recounts how the Inuit hunters refer to him as naajavaarsuk, the ivory gull, a species distinguished by its habit of “standing on the perimeter of the action, darting in to snatch something when there’s an opening”. One might add – though Lopez does not – that he is also an isumataq, a storyteller who “creates the atmosphere in which wisdom reveals itself”. The achievement of Lopez’s work has always been ontological before it is political; a “redreaming”, to use his verb, of the possibilities of human life. Horizon’s brilliant last chapter describes the weeks he spent searching for meteorites in the Antarctic. At 7,500ft in the Queen Maud Mountains, the flow patterns of ice have created a “concentrating mechanism” that causes meteorites fallen on to the ice cap over thousands of years to gather on a “stranding surface”. Here, “fragments from the asteroid belt, from Mars and from Earth’s moon, find their way eventually into the planet’s upper mantle”. Holding a meteorite in his palm, Lopez considers “the history of each one in the gigantic sweep of time … they suddenly seemed wilder than any form of life I’d ever known. Like the wind, they opened up the landscape.” This sense of the vibrancy of more-than-human matter shivers throughout the book; his glittering prose becomes a concentrating mechanism and stranding surface for such moments. Horizon is long, challenging and symphonic. Its patterns only disclose themselves over the course of a full, slow reading. Rhythms rise and surge across 500 pages; recursions and echoes start to weave. This is a book to which one must learn to listen. If one does, then – to borrow phrases from Lopez – “it arrives as a cantus, tying the faraway place to the thing living deep inside us”. He has given us a grave, sorrowful, beautiful book, 35 years in the writing but still speaking to the present moment: “No one can now miss the alarm in the air.” • Horizon by Barry Lopez is published The Bodley Head (£25).

"An invasive bug with a taste for beans has jumped into the top 10 list of the worst garden pests as it benefited from the warm summer. The Royal Horticultural Society said its latest annual list of which pests and diseases were causing the most trouble in gardens revealed the impact of the hot dry weather in the UK last summer.  The southern green shield bug, which is thought to have been introduced from mainland Europe and was established in Britain in the 2000s, came sixth in 2018’s ranking based on inquiries to the RHS by gardeners. The bug is a sap feeder with some preference for vegetables, particularly beans, and benefited from the warm weather in early summer, the experts said. Young stages of the bug are distinctively black with white or pink markings and an adult looks similar to the harmless native green shield bug, but with no brown marking at its rear. Pear rust is also of growing concern to gardeners, with the fungus that causes orange spots on pear leaves and canker-like swellings on juniper branches becoming very common over the last 16 years, in part due to warmer, drier summers. But the dry conditions helped keep some problems at bay, including leaf spot and canker of Prunus and box blight, which both benefit from warm, wet weather during the growing season. Overall, however, 2018 was another bad year for gardeners with box trees and hedges as box tree caterpillars spread to Wales and Northern Ireland. The caterpillar, which strips box of its leaves, topped the list for the worst pests for the third time, the experts said. Despite the dry conditions, perennial pests slugs and snails were in second place in the ranking of gardener inquiries, while honey fungus topped the list of diseases again in 2018. Matthew Cromey, principal scientist at the RHS, said: “Our pest and disease ranking may be evidence of how climate change is impacting on what we find in our gardens. “With the UK predicted to see wetter winters, warmer summers and more extreme weather events, root diseases of trees and shrubs could become even more problematic and the array of pests is likely to change. “As the UK faces new plant health problems, it’s imperative that the country has the skills needed to predict, exclude and manage the worst.” The RHS said it was conducting research into several of the most prevalent pests and diseases including the range of slug and snail species in the UK, controls for box tree caterpillar and box blight and improved strategies for managing honey fungus. 1 Box tree caterpillar 2 Slugs and snails 3 Viburnum beetle 4 Vine weevil 5 Woolly aphid 6 Southern green shield bug 7 Fuchsia gall mite 8 Capsid bug 9 Cushion scale 10 Ants 1 Honey fungus 2 Phytophthora root rots 3 Pear rust 4 Volutella blight of box 5 Verticillium wilt 6 Blossom wilt of fruit trees 7 Box blight 8 Kerria twig and leaf blight 9 Leaf spot and canker of Prunus 10 Powdery mildew of Prunus"
"Over the past 30 years I have reported so many broken climate policy promises and quoted so much rhetoric that proved to be hollow, it is difficult to trace it back to the start. I think it’s a faded press release from 11 October, 1990 headed “government sets targets for reductions in greenhouse gases”. “The government recognises the greenhouse effect as one of the major environmental concerns facing the world,” said Ros Kelly, Bob Hawke’s environment minister. “This decision puts Australia at the forefront of international action to reduce emissions of all greenhouse gases.” We knew we had to do something almost three decades ago. Children have grown to adulthood and had their own children during the time we have known, and done not very much. We were then, apparently, going to meet our target through “no regrets” actions – things that made sense for other environmental reasons as well as climate concerns. We didn’t meet it. We haven’t ever met any of a succession of greenhouse gas reduction targets by actually reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, which continue to rise, still. No regrets? At the forefront? If only. 1990 was the year the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report made clear predictions – of higher temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns and impacts on agriculture. They are no longer predictions. They are our reality now. We just endured the hottest summer on record. In Port Augusta the thermometer hit 49.5 degrees. Across the country more than 200 temperature records were broken. Nine of the 10 warmest years in Australia’s records have occurred since 2005. Communities have no water. Flying foxes are dropping dead from the trees. Up to a million fish have died in the parched Murray-Darling – an ongoing environmental, social and economic catastrophe. We have been warned that without urgent action, the Darling will die. The bushfire season is starting earlier and different kinds of forests are burning, one in Tasmania stands over 1,000 years old. Flooding is more frequent and rainfall patterns are changing. Our ecosystems are being driven to collapse. For all those decades some politicians tried and failed to act, because others tried harder and succeeded in preventing it. For a brief moment we had a carbon price, and greenhouse emissions did fall, but then it was abolished, ostensibly in the name of reducing the price of groceries and services, which had never risen much in the first place, but mostly in the cynical interests of trying to win an election. There were various other attempts at credible policy over the years, from across the political spectrum, as well as some spectacularly bad ones, but in the end effective policy was mostly washed away by political timidity, outright ignorance and the well-financed lobbying efforts of mining companies determined to delay the eventual phasing-out of coal. But as the evidence of a changing climate defies denial, those who have spent careers delaying or refuting the need for action have untethered their arguments from fact. Climate policy is no longer a real “debate” about the existential threat at the heart of the issue, and competing ideas about how to address it, but rather it has become a proxy for an ongoing war of attrition, in particular between the Coalition’s moderates and conservatives, stripped of policy meaning to become a vacuous argument about being “for” or “against” fossil fuels. Those who would thwart action are also again resorting to that tired contention that would undermine any action by any nation on any global issue – we shouldn’t have to do anything because we are responsible for just a proportion of the problem, or put another way, we shouldn’t do anything because we can’t solve the problem on our own. They sow uncertainty and sometimes they descend to farce, such as citing Dorothea MacKellar’s poetic reference to “droughts and flooding rains” in refutation of scientific fact or claiming that renewable energy will “kill” night sporting fixtures. They ignore or misquote their own advice to persist with the blind belief that building new coal-fired power stations is the only way the nation can secure affordable, reliable power. They claim, for example, that the energy market operator backs investment in coal-fired power, when in fact its modelling says the opposite. And, just for the record, as Guardian Australia’s Katharine Murphy has pointed out, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission didn’t recommend it either. No one has, because underwriting a coal-fired power station and indemnifying it against any future climate measures makes no economic sense. But the government – including its resources minister – is persisting with its faith in new plants, even as the mining and power companies that have profited richly from coal fired power for years, and spent millions on secret public relations campaigns trying to prolong its use, are conceding the gig is up. Even more bewilderingly, it is persisting with the idea even as it seeks to build credentials with an electorate increasingly concerned about global warming, informed by what they are seeing and reading about current events, and what they are experiencing in their lives. The prime minister who once fondled a lump of coal in the parliament, is brandishing a “climate solutions package”, the contradiction most baldly evident in the fact that he is now simultaneously advocating taxpayer support for renewable projects that rely on coal-fired power stations closing, and also taxpayer support for opening new ones. We’ve seen this eleventh hour conversion before – when John Howard reluctantly said he would introduce an emissions trading scheme in 2007, faced with rising voter concern after the millennial drought. (He later admitted he did it only because of the political pressure, and never really believed in the idea.) At Guardian Australia, we think it is time, a long way past time, to take a breath and go back to the facts. We’ve tried to do this all along, of course, but at this crisis point we want to take stock of what is already happening – things we know about but need to understand better, such as the crisis in the Murray-Darling – and also consequences of climate change that are less well known or just emerging. We want to look at the latest forecasts and what they mean for our lives, our communities and our environment, and – putting the political rhetoric and posturing aside – assess the policies for emission reduction and adaptation and the broader impacts and consequences. Regret, at this point, is unavoidable: regret that Australia has been a drag on global efforts to address climate change, regret for having scrapped so long that the cost and disruption of doing what we must has risen and will be borne largely by our kids, regret for the billions of dollars wasted on half-baked policies, regret for the scandalous waste of time and effort and opportunity. But given what’s at stake, it can’t be too late to regroup, and assess the facts, to inform the most sensible path from here."
