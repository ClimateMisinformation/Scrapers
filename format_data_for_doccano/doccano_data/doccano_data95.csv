"“Global heating” is a more accurate term than “global warming” to describe the changes taking place to the world’s climate, according to a key scientist at the UK Met Office. Prof Richard Betts, who leads the climate research arm of Britain’s meteorological monitoring organisation, made the comments amid growing evidence that rising temperatures have passed the comfort zone and are now bringing increased threats to humanity.  “Global heating is technically more correct because we are talking about changes in the energy balance of the planet,” the scientist said at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland. “We should be talking about risk rather than uncertainty.” Earlier this month, the Met Office produced a new report that showed the searing heatwave that hit the UK this summer – along with other parts of the northern hemisphere – was made 30 times more likely by human-caused climate change. Betts said the shifting climate was pushing some natural processes – such as the blossoming of trees and laying of eggs – out of sync. “That’s already happening. We are also seeing higher temperatures of heatwaves. The kind of thing we saw this year will happen more often. “The risks are compounding all the time. It stands to reason that the sooner we can take action, the quicker we can rein them in.” His views were echoed by Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a professor of theoretical physics and founder of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He said his recent Hothouse Earth report , which was one of the most widely quoted and downloaded studies of this year, had helped to change the language used to describe the climate crisis. “Global warming doesn’t capture the scale of destruction. Speaking of hothouse Earth is legitimate,” he said. The scientists expressed frustration at the slow pace of action by political leaders. In signing the 2015 Paris agreement, governments around the world aimed to keep global warming to within 1.5C to 2C above pre-industrial levels. But current commitments are far off track. The Met Office upgraded its forecasts this week to show the planet is on track to warm by between 2.5C and 4.5C. “We have broadened out the range of possibilities,” said Betts, who is conducting a risk assessment based on the new projections. In the UK, he said the trend was towards wetter winters with more floods, hotter summers with more droughts interspersed with increasingly intense rain. At 3C of change, Schellnhuber said southern Spain would become part of the Sahara. Even 2C, he said, could not be guaranteed as safe. The Paris pact was a firewall, he said. “It’s not helping us to keep the world as it is now. We’ve lost this opportunity already. It’s a firewall against climate chaos.” Johan Rockström, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said “cracks” were starting to appear in the climate system that were pushing nature from being a friend that absorbs carbon dioxide to an enemy that releases carbon dioxide. These concerns are fuelled by the growing intensity of forest fires, the effect of melting ice-sheets on the jet stream, and the rising risk of permafrost thaw, which would release trapped methane. Although he stressed it might not yet have passed a tipping point, he said the warnings were getting louder. “This shift from friend to foe is no doubt a scientific nightmare. That is the biggest worry that we have,” he said. “It does terrify me. The only reason we sit here without being completely depressed is that we see we have policy measures and technology to move in the right direction. “We need to have a diagnosis just like a patient who comes to a doctor and gets a really bad diagnosis. But if the science is right, the technology is right, and the policy is right you can cure that very dire situation. There is no scientific suggestion that the door is shut.” This week’s climate talks have crept forward with only small progress towards a new global rulebook, but emissions continue to rise and the planet continues to heat. “Things are obviously proceeding very slowly,” said Betts. “As a scientist, it’s frustrating to see we’re still at the point when temperatures are going up and emissions are going up. I’ve been in this for 25 years. I hoped we’d be beyond here by now.” Schellnhuber concurred. “I’ve worked on this for 30 years and I’ve never been as worried as I am today.”"

"They lacked the drama, excitement and eventual breakthrough that marked the Paris agreement of 2015, but this year’s UN climate talks produced important steps forward in putting the landmark accord into practice. After last-minute wrangling over wording, late on Saturday night delegates in Poland finally agreed a text that contains most of the “rulebook” needed to guide countries’ implementation of the Paris goals.  These include complex technical issues such as how countries should measure and report on their greenhouse gas emissions, and account for progress on meeting their commitments on curbing carbon, with an agreement to work on setting new targets for financial assistance to poor countries. Resolving these should mean countries can move ahead with meeting their targets. “This is a good agreement,” the European commissioner Miguel Cañete told the Guardian. “We have more to do but we can move forward now.” Nicholas Stern, author of the seminal review of the economics of climate change, said: “This has been another summit of tough negotiations, but it has ultimately succeeded in its crucial primary task of agreeing the so-called rulebook for the Paris agreement.” One important issue that could not be resolved was over carbon markets, and how countries can gain credits for their efforts to cut emissions and their carbon sinks, such as forests, which absorb carbon dioxide. After Brazil, which hopes to benefit from its huge rainforest cover, insisted on wording that critics said would allow for double counting of credits and undermine the integrity of the system, this issue was postponed until next year. While the conference broadly succeeded within its narrow technical remit, however, key questions on tackling climate change were ignored or put off. Foremost among these is the inadequacy of countries’ current national targets for curbing greenhouse gases. With current targets, the world is likely to face 3C or more of warming, which scientists warn would bring disaster. Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser to President Bill Clinton, said: “Gaining a strong regime of accounting for emissions is an essential step on getting a handle on global emissions, and a major achievement. But the biggest breakthroughs on emissions cuts must be done at the head of state level over the next several years, not in a few days by ministerial negotiators.” The conference also failed to take account of the warnings by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global body of the world’s leading climate scientists, which only two months ago presented a bleak picture of the damage that would be done if global temperature rises reached or exceeded 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The panel said that the result would be heatwaves, droughts, floods, the die-off of coral reefs, and the decline of agricultural productivity in large swathes of the world. The Paris agreement binds countries to avoid a 2C temperature rise, with an aspiration to limit warming to no more than 1.5C. Time is running out: the IPCC’s findings imply that there is about a decade left to set the world on a new track. This year was the fourth hottest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization, and extreme weather – such as the heatwave in the UK, wildfires in Europe and the US, floods in India and storms in south-east Asia – affected every continent. Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace, said: “A year of climate disasters and a dire warning from the world’s top scientists should have led to so much more. Instead, governments let the people down again as they ignored the science and the plight of the vulnerable. Adopting a set of rules for climate action is not nearly enough; without immediate action, even the strongest rules will not get us anywhere.” The two-week conference, known as COP24, in Poland’s coal-fuelled heartland started with Sir David Attenborough warning of the collapse of civilisation if untrammelled climate change were allowed to take hold. “Right now, we are facing a manmade disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years: climate change,” the veteran broadcaster and naturalist told delegates. “If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.” The secretary general of the UN, António Guterres, also stepped up his rhetoric, warning it would be “immoral and suicidal” to fail to take strong action. The 15-year-old Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg, whose strike to raise awareness of the issue drew global attention, was scathing in her speech to the conference: “You’re not mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden you leave to your children.” There were encouraging signs of shifting geopolitics at the talks. China and the EU were able to settle differences on how to account for and verify greenhouse gas emissions, and the EU and a handful of other rich countries joined with scores of developing nations in promising to focus on the 1.5C limit in setting their future emissions-cutting targets. But while the conference ended in a show of unity, with the Polish minister in charge leaping from the podium table into the audience in glee as it finally closed 30 hours after the deadline, the talks also displayed new rift lines. Brazil, under its incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is hostile to the Paris agreement and sceptical of climate science, held up agreement for nearly a day by insisting on a change to the rules on carbon credits that critics say would undermine the system. That decision has been put off to next year, but the stance of Brazil under Bolsonaro – he also withdrew Brazil’s offer to host next year’s conference – troubles many other countries. Brazil previously acted as a powerbroker between developed and developing nations, and without that role future talks may be more acrimonious. The US also showed how Donald Trump’s presidency is changing its role, when it joined with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to prevent the conference from fully embracing the IPCC’s findings. In previous years, while Saudi Arabia has played an obstructive and delaying role behind closed doors, it has rarely been willing to take a public stance against agreement, and Russia has remained largely quiet since allowing for the adoption of the Kyoto protocol in 2004. Australia, which has played a shifting role in the talks under successive governments, also joined with US supporters in a celebration of coal. It seems that Trump’s hostility to climate science is emboldening other countries to take a more aggressive role in fighting progress. David Waskow, of the World Resources Institute, told the Guardian: “[The US’s new stance] is giving these countries more space for what they want to do.” Despite the progress made at this year’s talks, some believe that the UN process will always be too slow to measure up to the scale and urgency of the problems, and new ways should be found to take action independently. Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said: “In the climate emergency we’re now in, slow success is no success. [The rulebook] is decades too late. It should be clear that the UN consensus process can never produce the muscular agreement we need to meet the emergency.” He advocates sectoral agreements for heavy industries such as steel, aluminium and cement that would require companies in those industries to reduce their emissions, removing any competitive disadvantage to businesses in being first-movers in cutting carbon."
"The UN met on Saturday in Poland to discuss a draft agreement on climate change, which sources said was likely to pass, as exhausted delegates made compromises on some key issues but left other contentious problems to be resolved next year. The result will not be the breakthrough campaigners and some countries were hoping for, but will keep discussions alive on formulating key aspects of the implementation rules for the 2015 Paris accord.  Delegates have been thrashing out a text on the complex mechanisms required to put the Paris goals into effect for the past two weeks, and appeared partly successful as the talks overran their Friday deadline and looked likely to continue into late afternoon on Saturday at least. The text will give countries clarity on key points such as accounting for their greenhouse gas emissions and recording their carbon reductions. They will also go some way to encourage the stepping up of each country’s climate change efforts. Among the issues holding up progress is the highly technical question of what should happen to the market for carbon credits, held by some countries in recognition of their emissions-cutting efforts and their carbon sinks, such as forests. These credits count toward countries’ emissions-cutting targets. Brazil introduced wording that would benefit the country for its huge rainforest cover, but critics said contained loopholes that allowed for double counting of carbon credits would severely undermine the integrity of the system. That question is unlikely to be resolved in the time remaining, but gave an indication of Brazil’s likely stance in future talks. Next year’s conference was supposed to be held in Brazil, but will take place in Chile because Brazil’s incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, withdrew the offer to host. Brazil has been a reliable supporter of the annual talks in the past and has worked to broker deals between the developed and developing world. Without that support in future, the talks are only likely to grow more fractious. The US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have also played a disruptive role, watering down a resolution that would have welcomed the recent IPCC report that a temperature rise of 1.5C would have dire consequences. The compromise in the redrafted text would have all countries “welcome the timely completion” of the IPCC report, but campaigners pointed out that this was weak because it refers merely to the timing of the report rather than its content. The EU, by contrast, and several other developed countries joined with scores of developing nations in announcing they would focus on preventing a 1.5C rise in their carbon-cutting efforts. There were few new offers from the rich world of financing for developing countries to help them cut emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change, another issue that has been pushed to future talks. As the last-minute negotiations wore on, delegates were saddened to hear of the death overnight of the veteran Philippine negotiator, Bernaditas de Castro Muller, who was a notable presence at the talks for nearly three decades. Tributes came from many who admired her forthright style."
"Australia appears likely be allowed to exploit a controversial climate loophole, using carryover carbon credits from the Kyoto protocol to meet its Paris agreement targets. New Zealand has already ruled out using the carryover credits, saying it would discourage other countries from the practice.  Australia’s environment minister, Melissa Price, said Australia would meet its Paris commitment of a 26% to 28% carbon emissions reduction – “equivalent to a halving of emissions per person” – but would not comment on whether the government would use carryover credits from Kyoto to reach that target. New Zealand’s climate change minister, James Shaw, said this week the practice of claiming credits was not in the spirit of the Paris agreement, and “we would discourage any country from using [it]”. He has previously described the practice as “dodgy accounting” and like “trying to have two meals for the price of one”. The use of carryover credits is one of dozens of technical elements being negotiated at the UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland where 193 countries have gathered to negotiate the “rulebook” for each meeting the emissions reductions targets made three years ago in Paris. The practice of carryover credits allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030. Australia’s environment department projects its surplus at 294m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, but independent climate analysts suggest that figure could be as high as 333m tonnes, or up to 400m tonnes if tree-planting and other land use changes are counted in Australia’s favour. Most of these additional carbon credits have been won through Australia’s unique deal under Kyoto to count land-clearing changes towards emissions reductions. Having those credits already “banked” against Australia’s emissions reduction target would make meeting its 2030 Paris goal of a 26% to 28% emissions reduction significantly easier: closer to 15% in actual reductions, Climate Analytics has said. Government figures show the Australia’s carbon emissions continue to rise. Emissions from fossil fuels and industry have been increasing by about 2% a year since 2014. At the UN climate change talks in Poland this week, the Marshall Islands has raised objections to the use of carryover credits in informal negotiations, but with little support. Preliminary documentation from inside the talks, seen by Guardian Australia, suggest that using carryover credits is not going to be prohibited under the “rulebook” for the Paris agreement, meaning countries will be able – and some likely – to do it. The chief executive of Climate Analytics and a lead author on former IPCC assessment reports Bill Hare said it appeared almost inevitable Australia would be allowed to – and would – use carryover credits. A change of government would not change the policy, he said. “Every indication is that both the government, and the Labor party, have every intention of trying to carry over surplus credits from the Kyoto protocol into Paris. “The [Australian government] delegation has made statements at negotiations over a period of time that are consistent with that.” Hare said Australia, based on its current climate policies, could not meet its Paris agreement target without using surplus credits. He described the use of carryover credits as “fake climate action”. “About half of the cumulative abatement task from 2021 to 2030 could be met by the projected Kyoto second commitment period surplus … in other words, the overall mitigation effort to reach the already inadequate target would be halved.” Along with New Zealand refusing to use its credits, other countries have previously declined to use theirs. In 2015, Denmark, Germany, the UK, Sweden, and the Netherlands cancelled 635m tonnes of carbon credits. In Katowice, Price told Guardian Australia that the government was committed to the Paris Agreement and its targets. “Our priority at COP 24 is to secure agreement on a comprehensive rulebook to guide the implementation of the agreement. “Our 2030 target is to reduce emissions by 26 to 28% below 2005 levels, which is equivalent to a halving of emissions per person. The government is confident of meeting this target, based on our track record of meeting and beating our first and second Kyoto protocol targets.” Australia, however, has consistently won specific exemptions to the calculation of its carbon reductions targets over decades of climate negotiations. During negotiations over the Kyoto protocol, the Howard government negotiated a special deal, allowing it to actually increase emissions by 8% between 2008 and 2012. An additional article negotiated in the dying hours of the conference – known as the “Australia clause” and condemned at the time by a European environment spokesman as “wrong and immoral... a disgrace” – allowed Australia to include land use changes in its emissions calculations which meant the target could be reached with only minor changes to land-clearing laws. When Australia met – and exceeded – its first Kyoto target, it was able to bank those extra carbon credits, carrying them over to meet its second target for 2020. That excess appears now likely to be calculated in assessing its Paris commitment."
"ExxonMobil’s alleged role in spreading misinformation about climate change will be scrutinised by the European Union for the first time, in a move welcomed by campaigners. The world’s biggest international oil company has been investigated in the US over allegations that it knew about the dangers of global warming for decades but deceived the public over the risks, a charge the firm has rejected.  EU politicians will now turn their attention to the role the company has played in Europe, where it has a sizeable presence from the huge Groningen gas field in the Netherlands to oil and gas fields in the North Sea. MEPs on the environment, public health and food safety committee will quiz a series of speakers on misinformation campaigns on climate change, which could include representatives of the company. The hearing on 21 March, jointly held by the petitions committee, comes after a petition by fossil fuel campaigners calling for a closer look at the information the company “wants to withhold from us now”. “ExxonMobil has misled the public on climate change for over 40 years. Now it’s time to correct the record and hold them accountable,” said Wenonah Hauter, the executive director of Food & Water Europe, which organised the petition. She called on the the new US Congress to follow the European parliament’s lead. “The weak outcome of the climate negotiations in Poland show that we can’t wait – leaders everywhere must take climate denial and climate action seriously,” she said, in reference to the UN climate talks which concluded on Saturday. The group would like to see lobbyists for the company barred from Brussels because of the firm’s alleged past behaviour. Molly Scott Cato, the Green MEP for South West England and Gibraltar, agreed that lobbying of EU institutions by companies that had been linked to climate denial should not be permitted. She said: “Exxon has a shameful history of funding climate change denial – paying for fake science and dangerous lies that have prevented us from taking timely action on climate change and forcing the world into the current climate crisis.” An ExxonMobil spokesperson said: “We unequivocally reject allegations that ExxonMobil suppressed climate change research contained in media reports that are inaccurate distortions of ExxonMobil’s nearly 40-year history of climate research. We understand that climate risks are real.” In recent years the company has softened its stance on climate change, urging the US to stay in the Paris climate agreement and agreeing to join an industry alliance on climate change. The company has recently been targeted by shareholders calling on it to set carbon targets at ExxonMobil’s AGM next year."
"Your article about which Christmas trees to buy (Fake or real: which ones look best – and won’t cost the Earth?, 8 December) failed to make some important points that need seriously considering if all environmental consequences are to be taken into account when making an informed decision about choice of tree. In the uplands of south-west Shropshire, Christmas trees are grown on increasingly shrinking moorland habitat, home to threatened and severely declining species like curlew, snipe, kestrel and barn owl. Your photograph showed a Christmas tree plantation on heather moorland, which proves my point. Heathland, one of the UKs priority habitats and home to many iconic species, has declined by as much as 90% over the last 200 years.  The insecticides sprayed on most Christmas trees against leaf-damaging aphids are washed into watercourses, where they not only contaminate potential drinking water but poison invertebrates in streams and rivers. Residues of these chemicals will later pollute the internal environment of the home, along with the antifreeze sprayed on the trees so they retain their leaves. Many of the trees grown in Shropshire and surrounding counties are transported to London for sale so that a large carbon footprint is added to the already burgeoning environmental cost. Due to these pollution and habitat issues we have in Shropshire and elsewhere, I welcomed the news that this is the year of the artificial Christmas tree. Plastic trees are not really the answer, though. The suggestion for growing your own tree in a pot is by far the best choice and, failing that, decoration of a collection of branches from any tree can be a stunning alternative.Fiona GomersallEcologist, Shropshire • The uncomfortable truth about the climate talks taking place in Poland is what isn’t being discussed (‘We’re running out of time’: UN chief’s dash to climate summit, 13 December). A new report about paying our fair share of the climate change debt compares the amount of money and effort going into combating the problem to the quantity of greenhouse gas pollution each country emits now and historically, and the ability of countries and people to respond. Something important is being side-lined, though: richer nations must cough up more. Asking poorer countries to pay for problems that they didn’t cause – and that they are now bearing the brunt of – means climate breakdown is disproportionately affecting those who are the least responsible. After all, the poorest half of the world receives less than one tenth of the total global income, and generates virtually no emissions. Until countries pay their fair share, we will fail to contain global temperature rises. We still have time – just – to reverse the worst effects of climate chaos. Now that we know that the cost of ignoring the problem is literally species-ending, isn’t it time to pay up, and do it fairly?Rachel KennerleyClimate campaigner, Friends of the Earth • The 100 academics and others who signed the letter (10 December) about the all too real danger of an “environmental catastrophe” are undoubtedly erudite. But, apparently, they cannot see the significance of human numbers in the crisis. Thus their letter completely ignores population growth. This year, the human impact on the planet will be further aggravated by the addition of some 83 million to the rightly named human race. Sir David Attenborough has been much criticised in some circles for his “softly softly” approach. But at least he had the insight and courage to state unequivocally that “all our environmental problems become easier to solve with fewer people, and harder – and ultimately impossible – to solve with ever more people.” Some 42% of all births are estimated to be unwanted: that would be a good place to start. It would not only reduce unsustainable pressure on environmental systems but also create better lives for many women.Sandy IrvineNewcastle Green party • At the end of his opinion piece (Our era lacks gravitas. That’s why we cannot deal with crisis, 8 December), Ian Jack identified our problem as being obsessed with money when it should be temperature or some other parameter of global warming. We can make a start on this in a painless and cost-free manner. We simply have to replace VAT with CAT, carbon-added tax. Activities are taxed according to the incremental amount of carbon they add to the atmosphere. Since most of this will come from the use of fossil fuels, it will actually be relatively easy to keep track of. Support this idea here. The rate of CAT can be sent so that the money take for the government is equal to that of VAT but it will reward those who purchase goods and engage in activities with a low carbon footprint.John HobsonDevizes, Wiltshire • Ian Jack is right to be asking for the media to provide information about climate change, but wrong to say that comparisons with 20 years before would be necessary. In the case of parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere, the safe level is said to be around 350 parts per million (ppm) and the current measure is 400ppm. The weather forecasts in print should simply place the seasonally adjusted measure of ppm of carbon next to the required level. On television, viewers could watch the carbon counter from the monitoring station at Mauna Loa moving in the wrong direction in real time.Daniel ScharfAbingdon, Oxfordshire • I read with interest Professor Henrietta Moore’s article (In the face of climate change, ranking states by prosperity invites disaster,theguardian.com, 5 December). We welcome her observations that “there’s much to be commended in assessing the impact of healthcare, education, the rule of law and personal and media freedom”, and that the places at the top of rankings “are better than most at providing foundations for a good life for the majority of fortunate inhabitants”. Professor Moore is also correct in observing that “when it comes to building sustainable prosperity from which everyone can benefit in the future, we are all ‘developing countries’”. However, we do not share the belief that ranking nations by prosperity invites disaster. The high correlation between GDP and aspects of governance, freedom, social capital, education, health and the quality of the natural environment can hardly be regarded as “uncomfortable”. It is the very quality of these that enables wealth generation. How resource-intensive such economic activity can and should be is a very important question, but should not be presumed to come at the expense of either institutional quality or social wellbeing. It is important to celebrate that wellbeing has increased around the world. More children are educated than ever before, more people have a choice about their future, fewer people are impoverished. These are huge gains, which we need to recognise and understand how to sustain. Given the purpose of sustainability is to enhance the lived experience of future generations, we should not reject measuring that very experience for the current generation.Dr Stephen BrienDirector of policy, The Legatum Institute • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Through the cacophony of the UN’s global climate talks, an Australian farmer is quietly spreading his plan to reforest the world. Over more than 30 years in west Africa, Tony Rinaudo has regenerated more than 6m hectares – an area nearly as large as Tasmania. His farmer-managed natural regeneration technique is responsible for 240m trees regrowing across that parched continent.  But it very nearly never happened. Having grown up in Myrtleford, in country Victoria, Rinaudo moved to Niger, one of the world’s poorest countries, in 1981, inspired by his Christian faith and a desire “somewhere, somehow to make a difference”. But after two years of intense tree-planting and trying to coax some life from the arid landscape regularly devastated by severe drought, he despaired. “I was in charge of a reforestation project that was failing miserably, it wasn’t that I was particularly dumb, it was the same story all over west Africa. And I remember the frustration that just hit me: north, south, east, west, was a barren landscape, and I knew perfectly well that 80 or 90% of the trees I was carrying [in my car] for planting would die.” But this day, crouching in the sand to reduce his tyres’ air pressure, he looked more closely at the few low desert bushes scattered around the landscape, the only thing that would grow there. Rinaudo knew they were not small bushes, but trees that had been hacked down. Looking more closely, he realised that, if pruned and allowed to grow, they stood a chance of flourishing. “In that moment, everything changed. We didn’t need to plant trees, it wasn’t a question of having a multi-million dollar budget and years to do it, everything you needed was in the ground.” The root system of the chopped down trees remained alive under the ground – Rinaudo describes it as an “underground forest” – it just needed to be pruned and allowed to grow. “Nature would heal itself, you just needed to stop hammering it.” Thirty years on, his technique – he describes it as akin to pruning a grape vine back to just one or two stems each season – has a name, farmer-managed natural regeneration (FMNR). It is, Rinaudo says, an “embarrassingly simple solution” to what appeared to be an intractable problem. But it involved overturning generations of accepted wisdom, and a resistance to giving some land back to nature. “When you’ve got people who are on the edge of starvation every year, not just in famine years, you’ve got this perception that you need every square inch of farmland to grow food crops. And here’s this nut telling people they should sacrifice some of their land for trees.” Rinaudo – known then as “the crazy white farmer” – managed to convince 10 farmers in as many villages to back his plan, to allow trees to regrow across the land they’d been intensively farming for decades. A drought was the catalyst for a work-for-food program, which brought reluctant farmers into the fold, but when the farming yields were, at first, no worse, then better, then dramatically so, the new technique took off. Thirty years on, 6m hectares of land have been regenerated under FMNR, totalling 240m trees. The reforestation of the landscape can be seen on satellite images from space. At the UN’s global climate talks in Katowice, Poland, this week – as thousands of delegates from all over the world debated the minutiae of a complex worldwide rulebook for climate change – Rinaudo quietly took his farming message from meeting room to meeting room, delegation to delegation. The trees, Rinaudo says, improve farming yields, reduce ground temperatures and hold water in the soil. They provide firewood and make farming, in places where the temperature regularly reaches 40C, more comfortable. But the trees also act, Rinaudo says, as a powerful carbon sink, and with the potential to draw in billions more tonnes of carbon. For his work on regeneration, Rinaudo was recognised this year in the Right Livelihood Awards, often described as the alternative Nobel, and focused on fields such as environmental protection, human rights, sustainability and peace. Working with World Vision, Rinaudo has taken his technique across the world, from arid Somaliland to tropical East Timor. There are 2bn hectares of degraded land in the world, he argues, and much of that land can be restored to help pull carbon from the atmosphere. Regeneration is not the silver bullet for climate change – no such thing exists – but it could be a powerful tool to assist. “We can do this very cheaply, we can do this very quickly, and we can do this at scale.” "

"Each dead house fly was worth a quarter, my mom told us kids, but I never earned any money. Every time I cornered a fly, I pictured goo marks left on the wall – spots splayed with tiny black guts and twisted legs. My halfhearted swats gave even the most sluggish fly time to escape. That I genuinely couldn’t hurt a fly might have been something I picked up in church. I grew up attending a Mennonite congregation in Indiana. We weren’t the bonnet-wearing, buggy-riding sort, but we embraced some traditions, like the Anabaptist teaching of nonviolence. This sometimes expressed itself in an instinct for conflict avoidance. So I was surprised when violence crept into my speech three years ago when I started working as a journalist covering climate change. Some ancient spirit took hold of me, and I found myself deploying the narrative of war. Carbon tax proposals were “battles” to be fought. Greenhouse gas emissions had to be “slashed”. “Eco-warriors” and “climate hawks” were leading the charge. Coming from a pacifist background, and obsessed with linguistics, I’ve grown uneasy with the way war shapes our words I’d adopted the language of the climate movement’s leaders. The only way to overcome climate change inaction, the environmentalist Bill McKibben once wrote, “is to adopt a wartime mentality, rewriting the old mindset that stands in the way of victory”. Hillary Clinton reportedly wanted to equip the White House with “a situation room just for climate change”. Other activists are calling for mobilization against global warming on the scale of the second world war. The whole “fighting climate change” frame rests on the assumption that opposition is the best way to get things done. But that’s not always the case, as the linguist Deborah Tannen wrote in The Argument Culture: Stopping America’s War of Words in 1998. Military and sports metaphors train us to see everything in terms of conflict – this side versus that side – and that perspective limits our collective imagination about what we can do to fix complex problems. Coming from a pacifist background, and obsessed with linguistics, I’ve grown uneasy with the way war shapes our words. The thought struck me earlier this year: by pitting one group against another, do war metaphors undermine our ability to address the complex problem of climate change, the biggest global crisis we face? Are there other ways to frame our predicament and convey the sense of urgency that’s needed – without dividing us? My gut feeling was that talking about climate change as a battle between rivals would ensure our ultimate defeat. But the reality might be more complicated. War narratives are everywhere, so prevalent that they usually pass unnoticed. Politicians and the media have declared wars on poverty, drugs, obesity, and terror. These wars were declared against concepts, trends, and tricky issues with no simple solutions. And none of them have been won. Reading Tannen’s book, I saw these metaphors in a new light. There’s a “pervasive warlike culture” in the US that leads us to approach just about any major issue as if it were “a battle or game in which winning or losing is the main concern”, she wrote. That tendency has shaped politics, education, law, and the media. Hostility is definitely in fashion. Anger spreads faster across social media networks than any other emotion, as studies have shown (and anyone who’s spent more than one minute on Twitter can attest). Cable news has devolved into shouting matches. “Americans on both the left and the right now view their political opponents not as fellow Americans with differing views, but as enemies to be vanquished,” wrote Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld in a recent Atlantic essay. Here’s the important thing about this war on climate change: we’re losing it. Scientists have sounded the alarm bells for 40 years; the window to address the problem is shrinking; drastic action on greenhouse gas emissions keeps … not happening. The future of humanity is at stake.   It’s an aggressive moral appeal, explicitly trying to arouse an emotional reaction and a commensurate commitment. The enemy is coming. Are you with us? I get that this war message works for some people. In a study published in the journal Environmental Communication last year, participants read one of three articles about the effort to reduce carbon emissions, which was framed as either a “war”, a “race”, or an “issue”. Those who read the war version perceived the most “urgency and risk” and expressed “greater willingness to increase conservation behavior”. That’s the spirit behind the Climate Mobilization, a group that invokes the war mentality in the service of climate action. The organization’s director, Margaret Klein Salamon, takes inspiration from the history of the second world war. Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the US had overhauled its economy and society for the war effort. Government spending soared from 30% of the economy in 1941 to 79% at the peak of the war in 1944. With a shared sense of national purpose, people made sacrifices for the common good. They planted victory gardens, bought war bonds, and rallied to produce the tanks, planes, and machine guns needed to fight a global war. Klein Salamon said climate change was such an enormous threat to the planet that it demanded similar sacrifices. “That’s really the challenge we face now,” she told me. “Can we achieve the mentality we had as a species that we had [achieved] only exclusively during wartime?” Her organization has had some success. Cities in California, New Jersey, and Maryland have declared a “climate emergency” and committed to an all-hands-on-deck, wartime-like response. Oakland aims to “reach zero net emissions at emergency speed”.  But what about places where people aren’t deeply concerned about climate change? A full 30% still don’t think it’s a thing, despite the overwhelming scientific consensus behind it. And Americans who accept the obvious generally prefer to avoid the subject. Is war rhetoric the right way to bring a divided nation together? My sister once got into a heated argument with my uncle about the Iraq war in 2003. Pacifism is a core Anabaptist belief, my sister argued, so how could you be a Mennonite and support a war? She vividly remembers him saying, “If you don’t believe in good and evil, well, I’ve seen the other side …” in reference to a near-death experience. That may have been the point when we stopped talking politics with the extended family. It felt like arguing would only make family get-togethers more awkward while accomplishing nothing. The good news is that there’s a way to break through seemingly intractable disputes Psychologists call this sort of fruitless argument an “intractable conflict”. An us-versus-them narrative turns people away from logic and into the realm of emotion and values. As the conflict drags on without resolution, partisans become increasingly bewildered by the other side’s beliefs and actions. A recent study showed how two-sided narratives drive public opinion on climate change. Psychologists from the University of California at Santa Barbara and the University of Colorado at Boulder found that most Republicans believed climate change was real, but didn’t support policies to address the problem simply because they thought Democrats did. Climate change, in other words, has been packaged together with issues such as immigration and gun control, and positions have turned into symbols of opposing sides. Why? “The study suggested that the discrepancies were likely the result of a media landscape that emphasized conflict,” Newsweek reported. So all those headlines I’d been writing about pipeline fights and carbon tax battles could have been making things worse. Labeling people “climate hawks” or “deniers” only reinforced divisions. I wondered whether the act of picking an enemy – even an abstract one, like climate change – inevitably made enemies of other people. In the search for an opponent, climate activists have landed on several suspects: climate deniers. Reluctant politicians. Capitalism. The blame points in every direction.  It reminds me of something I noticed in high school, listening to my classmates yell insults at rival teams during football games.While they called it “school spirit”, I deemed it “zip-code loyalty”: we had been pitted against one another by outside forces, and we really weren’t different from the supposed “enemy”.  The good news is that there’s a way to break through seemingly intractable disputes. As the journalist Amanda Ripley wrote, the key is not to avoid conflict, but to complicate it. Ripley pointed to a study hatched at the Difficult Conversations Laboratory at Columbia University, where researchers sat down people who disagreed with each other in a windowless room, then recorded their uncomfortable exchanges. Participants with opposing views on abortion, gun control, or other hot-button issues were paired together and asked to write a joint statement on the subject in 20 minutes. “Over time,” Ripley wrote, “the researchers noticed a key difference between the terrible and non-terrible conversations: the better conversations looked like a constellation of feelings and points, rather than a tug of war.” What the participants read before the conversation made a difference. Some were handed an article that presented only two sides to a polarizing argument. Others read a more nuanced version that focused on the complexity of the debate and considered several points of view. Surprise, surprise: people who read the more complex story beforehand were more likely to come up with better ideas for their joint statement and leave more satisfied with the experience. Hundreds of other studies have shown that the best way to get people to stop demonizing each other is to introduce them to the actual human beings they disagree with. A few months ago, I happened to meet a retired Chevron executive. Considering how often I write about politics and the evils of oil money, our conversation could have gone very badly. It didn’t. I mentioned my work as an environmental journalist, but we mostly talked about food, travel, and family.  In a similar vein, labor and environmental groups that often squabbled over issues in the past have come together to start talking climate policy. At the Colorado Climate, Jobs, and Justice Summit this fall, union members who work in the fossil fuel industry shared their perspectives on taking care of communities who depend on the industry. “For many in the environmental community, it was the first time they had heard those stories,” wrote Dennis Dougherty, executive director of the Colorado AFL-CIO, in a column in the Denver Post. “And in turn, it was the first time many workers got to interact face-to-face with folks from the environmental movement and learn how diverse and compassionate its members could be.” As for getting rid of war metaphors themselves, well, it’s not easy. “I don’t know if it’s possible to express the kind of action that’s needed in peaceful terms,” Bhikkhu Bodhi, a Buddhist monk and climate advocate, told me. It’s certainly going to require some imagination. Perhaps Earth is running a fever, and we need some wind-turbine ibuprofen to bring down the heat. Or maybe it’s a sinking boat, and instead of scooping water out, our crew needs to patch the hole where it’s rushing in.  Whatever you choose, I’m putting down my metaphorical weapons and fighting for … no, adopting more peaceful metaphors. And instead of turning differences into fights, I could frame the climate discussion in positive terms – discussing how a shift to renewable energy creates jobs, for example. Charles Eisenstein, author of Climate: A New Story, agreed that framing an important problem like climate change as a fight stokes partisanship.  “There is a time and a place for resolving problems by fighting,” he told me, “but it’s kind of taken over everything.” This story originally appeared in Grist"
"Nalini Nadkarni is sitting with her notebook and tape measure near the top of a strangler fig in Costa Rica’s Monteverde forest, on a branch 35 metres above the ground that is almost broad enough to walk along. Attached to the rope she has climbed to reach her perch, she squats among mosses, orchids and other plants that grow thickly on the bark, giving the canopy the impression of a hanging garden. Known as epiphytes – plants that grow on other plants – they are Nadkarni’s special field of scientific research, omnipresent in the unique ecosystem of Costa Rica’s montane cloud forest. They thrive between 1,500 and 1,800 metres and depend on their ability to take water and nutrients directly from the swirling mists that should cloak these slopes. But the continued existence of the cloud forest in Monteverde, familiar to the millions of tourists who have visited it, is under threat from global warming. Only occurring in a narrow altitude band whose upper limit is defined by where the mountain tops run out and by the altitude at which the trees can grow, it is being squeezed in a vice from below by warmer and drier weather patterns eradicating the enfolding cloud. Amphibians that once lived here have died back, to the point of species extinction in some cases. The breeding patterns of the area’s emblematic resplendent quetzals – the colourful birds that have long drawn tourists to the area – are being disrupted. Lowland species of bats and birds, including toucans, have begun moving into the cloud forest. One of the Costa Rica cloud forest’s most persistent and high-profile champions, Nadkarni has become increasingly concerned about the forest’s future. A 64-year-old American scientist who has spent almost 40 years climbing ropes to study the forest canopy, she has seen profound changes in the decades she has spent studying the Monteverde forest. “The tropical cloud forest is a very particular type,” Nadkarni says, reflecting on the fact that only about 1% of the planet’s woodlands are cloud forest. “Its most important aspect is the fact that it gets a lot of mist and cloud during most of the year. What’s fabulous about it is that it really nurtures this incredibly diverse and abundant group of plants that live in the canopy, which obtain their water and their nutrients from this mist and cloud. “When I climb into the forest, when I get away from the dark, damp, windless forest floor – well, you really enter kind of a different world.” Nadkarni identifies the montane cloud forest as one of the world’s three most sensitive along with the threatened coral reefs and ice caps. “It is one of the canaries in the coal mine, more sensitive to climate change than others. All are indicative of a world that is experiencing climate change and that’s happening now.” Nadkarni is not wrong. Once inside, the forest is a dark and dripping place at ground level, its perspectives shifting spookily with the passage of the mists across the rise of the continental divide. Punctuating the green curtain are flashes of colour. Subtle mauve bells of drymonia compete with the spiky balls of yellow justicia and the blades of vibrant red that attract butterflies and other insects. There are sloths and monkeys in the branches, while coatis and agoutis scamper in the undergrowth. But it is the trees that are most striking, not least the towering strangler figs with trunks like church buttresses. The sheer scale of the diversity is explained by another facet of this ecosystem: the compression of multiple “life zones” into the narrow band of the cloud forest supports huge numbers of species, many still to be identified. Following Nadkarni and her colleague Cameron Williams 30m up a free hanging rope into the branches, it is hard to credit that her passion for the forest tops almost killed her three years ago. Then, climbing in a forest in the American Pacific north-west, a rope severed, precipitating a 15-metre ground fall. “You know I’ve climbed for 39 years and never had a problem. I always felt that if we take care with our equipment – with our process or protocols – that trees actually are one of the safest places to be. “But three years ago, in the temperate rainforest of the Olympic Peninsula, my rope failed. My graduate students said that I didn’t utter a scream. I just fell like a silent sack of sand. I was knocked out for 10 minutes and I was on the forest floor for about six hours before the helicopter came.” The injuries would have stopped most people of 61. Five thoracic vertebrae were “exploded”. She lost her spleen as well, and her pelvis was broken in three places; she suffered nine broken ribs, lacerated lungs and a broken fibula. “I was in bad shape.” And Nadkarni sees her accident as a metaphor for the threat to the cloud forest. “I think that fall from a tree made me realise how fragile the human body is. By extension it relates to what I’m trying to do in understanding and communicating the importance of forests. “You can walk into a forest that seems so robust and so healthy and so diverse and so connected and so strong and so useful and so beautiful. Just like I was – I was robust, I was vibrant, I could climb to the top of any tree.” Because one of the paradoxes of the cloud forest, even under threat, is that it still looks vibrant even as new species move in, undermining its uniqueness. In the research centre at the Monteverde cloud forest reserve, Nadkarni’s fellow scientist Alan Pounds, one of the first people to warn of the threat to the cloud forest from the lifting cloud base in the 1990s, explains that it is not simply a question of the cloud rising. Instead the weather appears to be in the midst of a complex, wholesale change that has seen dry days in the forest quadruple in the last four decades. That has also been accompanied by more extreme rainfall, including flash-flooding. “While it’s hard to quantify exactly, judging from some of the shifts in cloud forest organisms, I would say [the cloud has] shifted upward, so maybe a couple hundred metres over these last 40 years or so. What you can see looking over the years is an increasing number of dry days, in fact quadrupled since the 70s. It’s averaged over 100 days [a year] since 2011. “What we’re teasing out in our analysis is the fact that it’s getting wetter and drier at the same time,” he says, explaining how the persistent mist has given way to drier periods, punctuated by heavy episodes of rain. “Actually it’s becoming more like a rainforest. We just have more contrast between wet and dry periods.” Among species challenged by these changes, Pounds – like many the Guardian talks to – mentions the resplendent quetzal which comes to breed in the cloud forest, feeding on a kind of small avocado. Male resplendent quetzal, which breeds in the cloud forest “It’s a good example of what we are talking about when we say it is getting squeezed because there’s no place for it to go upslope. Pounds mentions a nearby area of woods. “I used to hear them singing every day during breeding season and now they’ve moved out of that area and they’ve become more restricted, moving higher up the mountain here.” What is doubly ironic, given the threat, is that the community in Monteverde has long been ahead of the curve in terms of conservation efforts, in part the result of a historical coincidence. One key element was the arrival in the 1950s of US Quakers – pacifists – who emigrated to the area fleeing the draft for the Korean war. Daily life in Santa Elena, which borders the Monteverde cloud forest While these new residents cleared forest for pastures for dairy farming, they protected parts of the forest to conserve the watershed. In the 1970s, as recognition of the uniqueness of the infrastructure grew, Quakers, incoming scientists and local Costa Ricans formed an informal coalition that has continued to this day as ecotourism emerged as an economic mainstay. But if there is a catch, it is that on an isthmus bounded by warming oceans on two sides – the Atlantic on the Caribbean side and the Pacific on the other – it has been impossible to insulate the cloud forest from what is a worldwide phenomenon. And the impact of global warming has been noticed not only in the forest but in the coffee plantations at its edges. On his plantation, Guillermo Vargas, who doubles as the head of the local tourism council, has seen the mountains transform in his 58 years. “It’s been over the last 30 that we have noticed the change in the precipitation,” he says. “It used to rain – like drizzle – for many months. It used to be very cloudy most of the year. It used to be very windy with a lot of drizzle and now – like today [in November, at the end of the rainy season], it’s almost like the dry season. “Now it is raining differently. It rains very hard so it impacts the soil, causing more erosion. “Also, the fact that the wet and dry seasons are now not very well defined means that the coffee blooms in January through June. In the past the bloom was concentrated in a period of maybe four or five weeks in the beginning of May, June.” That, says Vargas, has caused economic issues both for farmers and the pickers, including those who come from Nicaragua, who need to come for longer but with fewer coffee beans per day to pick, as the period of the harvest has become much more spread out. Another issue, he adds, is that pests once just seen in Costa Rica’s lowlands have begun appearing at ever higher elevations. It is not only the impact on coffee he is worried about but ultimately on the ecotourism that sustains many of the jobs in the local community. “I know that for more than 40 years we have said we are the most famous cloud forest in the world. That this is unique in Costa Rica. “We have been selling Monteverde as a cloud forest and it won’t be a cloud forest in a few decades. It will be like a rainforest. So what visitors can see here, in 2040 they will be able to see [elsewhere].” All of which means, says Vargas, that the ecotourism industry – which the community has built from a base of 15,000 visitors a year to almost 200,000 – will also have to adapt to climate change. “The fact that the cloud forest is changing means we have to adapt in terms of the story we tell, to be able to understand the process, and then explain to visitors about the process and still be able to demonstrate that Monteverde is a unique destination not just because of the cloud forest but because of our capacity to teach about climate change. Down from the tops of the swaying strangler figs and on solid ground again, Nalini Nadkarni reflects on how the threat of climate change to the place where she has worked for four decades has transformed her in recent years from a scientific researcher into something more activist. “[Climate change] is actually happening faster than we thought it was even 10 years ago. And there are certain points that might turn what’s going on in Monteverde right now to change even faster. “You know when I first came here in 1979 as a graduate student and I looked up into the canopy of this Monteverde cloud forest and I saw these plants and animals high above the forest floor, I was just curious about what is going on. I wanted to find out about what’s going on with these canopy plants. “But just 15 years ago I was up in a tree and I heard the sound of a chainsaw just outside the boundary of the Monteverde cloud forest, and I realised in an almost metaphorical way that in fact deforestation, human activities and their negative effects were literally right outside the border of this beautiful little reserve.” It is an issue, she concedes, that has become even more pressing in the Trump era, where climate change denial has been embraced by the White House. “As an American and as a scientist I am horrified. I am ashamed. I actually feel like going into denial about my own country in terms of its response to global climate change. “All of us scientists, not just in America but around the world, know that climate change is being exacerbated. Being caused by human activities, by overconsumption, by use of fossil fuels. And for our leadership to take exactly the wrong turn, to remove ourselves from the Paris treaty, to encourage coal mining … “What I feel I need to do is to bring my science, bring my understanding of what’s going on in the tropical cloud forest and other ecosystems to the people, to policymakers. “I think that scientists are becoming more political. We have become less afraid to speak out against the political regimes that are making these wrong decisions. In the past, even ten years ago, my fellow scientists would not be making these statements.” Nadkarni reflects on the change. “You know each species that moves or disappears has repercussions in terms of the ecosystem as a whole. Now the plants are a little bit harder to see. But I know when I climb in the forest, that compared with when I started here 39 years ago, the canopy dwelling plants – the mosses, the filmy ferns – they were much more abundant, much more plush, much more … just wet, than they are now.”"

"Climate campaigners are calling on the BBC to declare a climate emergency and make the issue its top editorial priority. In a letter published in the Guardian, the new civil disobedience group Extinction Rebellion (XR) says the BBC, “as a respected media voice in the UK, needs to play a key role in enabling the transformative change needed”.  The group came to prominence last month when it organised the largest civil disobedience protest seen in the UK for decades, culminating in the occupation and closure of five bridges in central London. Since then it has grown rapidly and XR branches have sprung up in more than 35 countries. In the letter, a version of which will be delivered to the BBC on Monday, campaigners request a meeting with the director general, Tony Hall, to “discuss how the corporation can tell the full truth on the climate and ecological emergency”. They also call on the BBC to make the crisis its “editorial and corporate priority by adoption of a climate emergency strategic plan, at the level of urgency placed on informing the public about the second world war”. The group, which launched at the end of October with a blockade of Parliament Square in London, said it would hold a peaceful demonstration outside the BBC on Friday. The rapid spread of XR comes as frustration rises with policymakers who are failing to slow perilous levels of global warming and biodiversity loss. There have been a flurry of reports on the scale of the climate crisis , including one from the UN which said there were only 12 years left to limit some of the most devastating impacts. During UN climate talks in Poland this month, David Attenborough said that unless action was taken “the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon”. Several cities in the UK, including London, have now declared a climate emergency. XR is calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a “citizens assembly” to devise an emergency plan of action, similar to that seen during the second world war. During a second wave of civil disobedience this weekend, thousands of people staged peaceful direct action protests in towns and cities around the UK. The latest XR group to set up internationally was in New York, where activists announced plans at their first meeting this weekend for a US national day of action on 26 January. The group is planning an international week of rebellion in April. This month 100 prominent figures including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and the authors Philip Pullman and Naomi Klein backed XR, calling for people around the world to rise up and organise against political leaders’ “paralysis”. “We must collectively do whatever’s necessary non-violently, to persuade politicians and business leaders to relinquish their complacency and denial,” their open letter stated. "
"Olafur Eliasson is putting the chill into climate change. The revered Scandinavian artist has placed 24 large blocks of centuries-old ice, harvested from the Nuup Kangerlua fjord in Greenland, in a circle outside the Tate Modern in London, with another six on display in the City. The purpose of Ice Watch London, a collaboration with award-winning Greenlandic geologist Minik Rosing, is to bring the effects of climate change closer to home, putting people in direct contact with its effects so that they can feel – and even sniff and lick – the ice as it slowly melts away. “I’ve been studying behavioural psychology, and looking into the consequences of experience,” says the Icelandic-Danish artist. “What does it mean to experience something? Does it change you or not change you? It turns out that data alone only promotes a small degree of change. So in order to create the massive behavioural change needed [to tackle climate change] we have to emotionalise that data, make it physically tangible.” Each ice block was fished out of the sea after it had broken away from the Greenland ice sheet – then transported in fridge containers to the UK (“Just like the ones that take your frozen prawns to Selfridges,” grins Rosing). The blocks, which weigh between 1.5 and 6 tonnes each, all have to be of a shape that is unlikely to break – when Ice Watch was on display in Copenhagen and Paris, the public were fond of scrambling up and sliding down the blocks. Of course, such interaction is the point of the project. As Eliasson puts it: “Roll around on it, climb on it, listen to it!” The icebergs are made up of compressed snow rather than frozen water, meaning that each block contains tiny little bubbles of air. Put your ear up against them and you will hear a magical popping and fizzing sound. “It sounds so beautiful,” says Rosing. “That is air that was trapped before we started polluting the atmosphere. Those bubbles have almost half the CO2 content as the air outside the iceberg. It was trapped maybe 10,000 years ago, maybe 100,000, so you can smell what air used to smell like before we polluted it. And you can take a drink of it, beautiful, natural water.” The artwork arrives here to coincide with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest stark warning that we have only 12 years to limit the worst effects of climate change. Eliasson and Rosing both point out the rather chilling statistic that 10,000 blocks of ice such as the ones on display in London are falling from the ice sheet every single second. However, they both passionately believe that focusing on scare stories is the wrong way to tackle climate change. “Instead of fear-based narratives, you need a positive narrative to make people change their behaviour,” says Eliasson, “and that’s why I think the culture sector has a strong mandate to take on some leadership here.” “We have to provide a glimpse of hope,” adds Rosing. “People think the scientists come with the bad news about climate change but actually we come with the good news. We understand what’s happening, we know exactly what needs to be done and we actually have the means to fix it. The only reason we’ve been able to upset the global environment system is because we have enormous power. If we direct that same enormous power to improving the system, we can get it back on track.” Eliasson’s is perhaps best known here for his 2003 Tate Modern installation The Weather Project, which hung a gigantic sun in the gallery’s turbine hall and attracted over two million visitors. His work has often focused on environmental themes: Green River used uranine, a non-toxic dye, to turn rivers in Stockholm, Tokyo and LA a dazzling bright green, while his Little Sun project provided small, solar-powered lamps to local entrepreneurs in communities where electricity was scarce. Even during the installation of this latest work, which started on Monday, Eliasson says his ice blocks have had an unusual effect on people: “The crane guy outside who was lifting and putting them down said ‘You know what? These are actually really heavy!’ Another woman touched it and said ‘wow, it’s really cold!’ Of course she knew this but the knowledge of her hand is so different to the knowledge in our heads.” Ice Watch is set to run until 21 December, providing the weather doesn’t melt them away before. After that date, any ice left unmelted will be taken to local community and cultural institutions as part of an extended educational programme. The exhibition comes before a major retrospective of Eliasson’s work at the Tate Modern that starts on 11 July 2019. That, too, will have a climate focus, perhaps inevitably so given Eliasson’s longstanding interest in environmental matters. For the catalogue, he has interviewed Elke Weber, the psychologist whose research into human behaviour has shaped his recent thinking about how to change people’s actions through art. The show will also contain a work from 20 years ago, in which Eliasson flew over Iceland documenting glaciers from above with a camera. “It’s one of my oldest works, but also one of the first where I was focusing on the question of climate and glaciers,” he says. “And now,” adds Rosing, striking a rare forlorn note, “those glaciers will probably be gone.” • Ice Watch London continues until the ice melts, details here"

"London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has declared a climate emergency and urged the UK government to do more to avert an ecological breakdown that he says poses an existential threat to future generations. Speaking as City Hall outlined its new climate change plan, Khan said he was implementing measures to protect people from floods, fires and the political upheaval caused by climate change. He accused central government of “dragging its feet” on dealing with these issues.  “We are in the midst of a climate emergency which poses a threat to our health, our planet and our children and grandchildren’s future,” Khan told the Guardian. “City Hall is doing everything in our power to mitigate the risk in London but the stark reality is that we need urgent government action and funding.” The acknowledgement of the scale and nature of the ecological crisis by the leader of one of the world’s major cities comes amid growing concern about the impact of climate change. A succession of scientific reports have laid bare the scale of the unfolding disaster, including one from the UN that said there were only 12 years left to avert the most extreme consequences of climate breakdown. On Sunday 100 academics, philosophers and authors wrote to the Guardian to back a new civil disobedience group – Extinction Rebellion – and called for people around the world to rise up and organise against the “paralysis” of political leaders. Khan’s intervention follows that of civic leaders in the UK and around the world. Last month Bristol declared a climate emergency and set a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2030, while Manchester said it would become “carbon zero” by 2038. Both are more ambitious than the UK’s national target of an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050. It follows similar moves by several US cities. London’s existing plan, unveiled by Khan in May, was for the city to be carbon neutral by 2050. But last week the London Assembly passed a motion saying that target should be brought forward to 2030 and called on Khan to draw up “a specific emergency plan”. Caroline Russell from the Green party, who proposed the motion, said it was crucial Khan backed a more radical target and called on the government to give him the appropriate powers and funding. “Catastrophic climate breakdown might be as little as 12 years away,” she said. “This would have profound impacts on every aspect of our lives in London from flooding and overheating in summers, disruption in our food supply chains as well as in the wider natural world. “The mayor needs to be at the forefront of this challenge, declaring a climate emergency and an urgent updating of his carbon reduction targets to make London carbon neutral by 2030, decades ahead of his current plans, setting a precedent for other major and world cities.” Khan said he had already introduced a series of measures to tackle climate breakdown – from investing £500m in low carbon technologies to divesting pension funds from fossil fuels. But he said a City Hall analysis due to be published on Wednesday showed London would need a huge programme of investment as well as new powers to bring forward its zero-carbon target to 2030. The cash would be used to: • Retrofit hundreds of thousands of homes and offices to make them more energy efficient. • Decarbonise the national grid. • Install low-carbon heating systems, such as heat pumps. • Move private and public transport away from diesel and petrol, and towards electric. Khan said: “My message to ministers is clear – stop dragging your feet and gambling with our future and give London and cities across the UK the real powers and funding needed to protect our future generations.” The Green party welcomed Khan’s move and backed his call for more help from central government. But Russell said there was more that could be done now. “Sadiq should start this mission by cancelling the Silvertown road tunnel and fighting harder against things that will make the climate crisis worse. “He should call right now for a halt to climate-wrecking aviation expansion, including at Gatwick, and ask his C40 [global green city network] counterparts to join him.”"
"My crumbly crew are having coffee at the community centre after its annual carol concert and Charlie hits his usual glass-half-empty note. Trouble is, he’s right. Goodwill seems pretty thin on the ground nowadays, wherever you look. Wars and rumours of wars, famine, drought, fires, floods, plagues among the people, pestilence among the beasts, it’s all beginning to sound a tad apocalyptic. An end time has begun, or so it seems.  End time is something on which we elders have authority: reminders of its imminence fill our days. As a life with any future purpose evaporates, dissatisfaction with the present becomes my lingua franca as I acknowledge my redundancy. I become, like Charlie, querulous and fault-finding as I lose touch with the world, its language, its mores, and its business. However, if I am honest, I am faced with a most inconvenient truth. If social literacy has morphed into narcissism, if civic ethics have been exchanged for consumer loyalty cards, that’s my doing, because today’s world is yesterday’s creation and I am yesterday’s man. I am responsible. But these are minor issues, a form of displacement activity to shield me from acknowledging my contribution to a darker crisis, for which my generation is largely responsible: the human obsession with growth, comfort and convenience that has poisoned the air, contaminated the seas, intoxicated the soil and barbarised its creatures. Nowhere is our hubris better illustrated than by our describing the crisis as a planetary issue. It isn’t the planet that’s in crisis, simply its top predator. Our fellow inhabitants of Earth are praying for the end of the Anthropocene era – which is surely better described as the androcene, in recognition of its primary authority. We have been here before. Our species spent 200,000 childhood years refining the social contract as subordinate residents. Then, around 17,000 years ago, we experienced our first episode of global warming when the thaw ended the ice age. It produced the same degree of societal and elemental chaos that will occur this time. We emerged to dominate the globe as tooled-up owner-occupiers. The next stage of our evolution will hopefully empower us as adults to be custodial tenants of our exuberant planet. This is an evolutionary moment and how we address this prospect will be our legacy and that’s where the crumbly perspective may be of use, because I am experiencing on a personal level what our species is facing on a global dimension. When my end comes, my legacy for those who survive me will depend on the manner in which I departed, either as curmudgeonly life-denier or gracious celebrant. I should confront the dying of my light, not with rage, but with gratitude to a generous planet and remorse for my profligacy. Goodwill should be my legacy: like a dog, goodwill is for life, not just for Christmas, and I should bow out benevolently. This will not avert the end time but it may inform the mindset of the next epoch of our remarkable species and earn it the right finally to be called sapiens.  • Stewart Dakers is an 80-year-old voluntary community worker"
"China called on rich countries to “pay their debts” on climate change at global talks on Thursday, criticising developed countries for not doing enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide finance to help poor countries do the same. The trenchant intervention by Xie Zhenhua, the minister who leads the Chinese delegation and a veteran of the UN climate negotiations, came as China faced increasing pressure to shift its stance on some of the key rules required to implement the 2015 Paris agreement.  He told a small group of journalists: “Developing countries are not comfortable or happy. [We need to] see if developed countries have honoured their commitments. Still some countries have not started their mitigation efforts, or provided financial support [to poor nations]. We strongly urge them to pay up on their debts.” By contrast, he said, developing countries had been “very flexible and constructive” at the talks. One of the key sticking points at the UN negotiations in Poland is over how countries should account for their greenhouse gas emissions, and how their progress in meeting their commitments on curbing carbon should be measured and verified. Developed countries prefer strict standards but developing countries have historically been allowed some leeway, in recognition that their governance structures and capabilities may lag behind. But the EU and other developed countries are concerned that large rapidly developing economies such as China are not agreeing to adequate transparency in accounting for their emissions. Xie said the talks were “deadlocked”, but maintained that China should continue to be treated as a developing country, and that developing countries should have flexibility over transparency rules. “We need flexibility,” he said. “Developing countries have very varied capabilities. If more [financial and technological] support is given to developing countries, they will have more capabilities and stronger actions [on emissions].” Claire Perry, the UK’s climate minister, who arrived on Thursday after the Tory party’s dramatic vote of confidence in Theresa May on Wednesday night, said she was making transparency a key focus of her efforts at the talks. If no compromise can be reached, the talks may end this weekend without finalising the rulebook for implementing the Paris agreement, which was the key aim of these two weeks of negotiations. Developed countries also came under heavy fire in other parts of the conference. A coalition representing scores of the poorest and most vulnerable nations called on them to raise their emissions-cutting targets, and separately the Pacific island states – acutely vulnerable to climate change – called for the world to abandon coal power generation. “We call on all OECD countries to quickly phase out their use of coal by 2030 and for all other countries to phase out their use of coal by 2040,” Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama, the president of COP23, said. “There must be no expansion of existing coal mines or the creation of new mines.” Pacific Rim powers Australia and the US have both this week said publicly they have no plans to begin phasing out coal-generated power. By contrast, Perry said the UK would have no unabated coal-fired power stations by 2025. “The United States has an abundance of natural resources and is not going to keep them in the ground,” President Donald Trump’s international energy and climate adviser, Wells Griffith, told a US government-run panel discussion on fossil fuels. Australia’s ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling, added: “Fossil fuels are projected to be a major source of energy for a significant time to come.” Cook Islands prime minister Henry Puna told the Guardian the phase-out of coal was critical to the survival of Pacific island states. “We have made that call, it is not directed at any one country, but it applies to all. We know that coal power plants are a significant cause of the climate change we see affecting the whole world.” The Pacific island states also called for the establishment of an international protection regime to protect people displaced by climate change. Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives and now leading the country’s negotiating delegation, said “four countries” – referring to the US, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia, the bloc resisting welcoming the IPCC’s 1.5C special report – were deliberately frustrating negotiations. “Nothing’s happening. Absolutely nothing is happening,” he said. “You have this whole dictionary of words that has been brought into these climate conferences, then they talk about brackets, and we go round and round and round, and we don’t go anywhere.” While at the political level, oil-producing and large emitting nations have resisted increasingly strident calls from several country blocs to announce new targets for deeper emissions cuts, inside the negotiating rooms, officials from countries such as the US and Australia are reported to be working constructively to progress discussions on a Paris agreement rulebook. “Countries are negotiating in good faith, some in better faith than others, but there is progress,” Costa Rica’s minister for the environment and energy, Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, said."

"Australia’s carbon emissions are again the highest on record, according to new data from the emissions-tracking organisation Ndevr Environmental. Ndevr replicates the federal government’s national greenhouse gas inventory (NGGI) quarterly reports but releases them months ahead of the official data. Data it has produced for the year up to September 2018 shows Australia is still on track to miss its Paris target of a 26%-28% cut to emissions on 2005 levels by 2030. Matt Drum, the managing director of Ndevr, said if emissions continued at their current rate, Australia would miss the target by a cumulative 1.1bn tonnes. When excluding unreliable land use data, Australia’s emissions for the year to September reached 558.3m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, an all-time high.  Land use data refers to emissions from activities such as land clearing and forest management, as well as removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through activities such as reforestation. Ndevr excludes land use data because the methodology the government uses to calculate these figures is opaque and there have been questions about whether the scale of land-clearing in Queensland is being accurately represented. “There’s still no policy in place to ratchet them down which is why they’re increasing,” Drum said. Electricity sector emissions were stable, but fugitive emissions, and emissions from stationary energy and transport are all still trending sharply upwards. Release of the report comes as the environment minister, Melissa Price, addressed global COP24 climate change talks in Katowice, Poland. Both the Coalition government and Labor have not ruled out using controversial carryover credits from the Kyoto protocol to help meet Australia’s obligations under the Paris agreement. Labor has promised that if it wins the election it will increase Australia’s target to 45% on 2005 levels, in line with recommendations from the independent Climate Change Authority. Ndevr’s analysis said this would require a reduction of 197.1m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent based on current emissions levels, which would be equal to taking 75m cars off the road for a year. In comparison, the Coalition’s emission reduction target would require an 80.8m tonne reduction. Breaking up Labor’s target across sectors, Ndever suggests a range of reductions will be necessary in several industries, including 61.2m tonnes from the electricity sector, 33.4m tonnes from the stationary energy sector, 23.7m tonnes from agriculture and 34.2m tonnes from transport. “If Labor come into government we can’t afford a policy vacuum,” Drum said. “It’s looking grim. We need policy levers and we need them quickly.” Drum said the need for action was so urgent there would be no time for a full redesign of policy if there was a change of government. Instead, he said existing policies, such as the safeguard mechanism, should be amended. “They need to utilise existing policy like the safeguard mechanism and tweak it so it achieves what it is intended to achieve, which is reduce emissions,” he said. On Thursday, the Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said Australia was using “creative emissions accounting” to try to meet its Paris targets. “Counting Kyoto credit towards Paris cheats our environment and the rest of the world,” she said. “Our emissions are going up, yet our environment minister is telling the world we are doing our bit to meet our Paris targets.”  "
"The mood was more one of relief than triumph on Sunday when the world’s governments eventually found common ground at the UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland. This was not just because exhausted delegates were glad to go home after negotiations that dragged on 30 hours beyond the deadline. It also reflected the harder miles and tougher battles to come over the next two years if the planet is to remain habitable.  Scientist after scientist told the conference that the decisions made by 2020 will determine whether global heating can be kept to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, after which the already apparent dangers of climate instability become far worse. The toughest decisions, however, were pushed into the future, to a special climate summit next September called by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the next two COP conferences – in Chile in December 2019, and then to the country chosen to host in 2020. Katowice showed that the multilateral system of global decision-making is still alive, but under growing threat from fossil fuel interests and the nationalist politicians they fund. Decision-making at the UN is painstakingly difficult at the best of times, because it requires a consensus among 195 nations. In Poland, 14,000 delegates took two weeks to debate the latest science and proposed policy instruments as they whittled down more than 2,800 areas of disagreement. The result was a new global rulebook on emissions that requires nations to report every two years on their progress towardParis agreement commitments to keep temperature rises to between 1.5C and 2C. Several past obstacles were overcome. China accepted standards on transparency, and richer nations – particularly Germany and Norway – put their hands deeper into their pockets to provide more than $100bn (£80bn) to help poorer nations adapt. A renewed division between the developed and developing world did not materialise as feared. But more fundamental obstructions also came more sharply into focus. The malign role of fossil fuel interests has often been hidden in bureaucratic language or lost in the distractions of diplomatic spats, but in Katowice there were several moments of blinding clarity. Chief among them was the alignment of the world’s top three oil-producing nations – the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia – to downplay scientific warnings about temperature rises beyond 1.5C. Soon after, an ambassador from Australia – a major coal exporter – joined Trump administration officials in a panel that promoted carbon fuels. Brazil was also accused of holding up talks with a highly contested carbon-accounting proposal that could have reshaped how emissions from the Amazon are calculated. The country’s diplomats denied this but the issue has been kicked forward and it is unlikely the incoming nationalist president Jair Bolsonaro will make life easier for the negotiations. There was also more clarity as a result of the recent protests in France, which prompted policymakers to think twice about the social implications of higher fuel prices. The leading energy economists Nicholas Stern and Ottmar Edenhofer said carbon taxes were still an important instrument to nudge economies away from fossil fuels, but that the transition has to be fair as well as fast, which means using the extra tax revenue for green infrastructure or redistributing it among poorer members of society who are often hardest hit by fuel tax rises. Tensions will grow along with the stakes, as will frustration at the widening gap between the science and politics. More protests and lawsuits can be expected from climate litigation groups, financial divestment activists and a growing number of direct action campaigners, including 350.org, Extinction Rebellion and striking students such as Greta Thunberg. They, along with many scientists, say it is not enough to agree on rulebooks. After delaying action for so long, they argue the world now needs leaps rather than steps. All of which suggests the next two years will be among the most fraught and crucial in the history of humanity. Investment decisions on power stations and infrastructure taken during this period will determine whether carbon emissions can be cut by the 45% needed by 2030 to give the 1.5C target a chance. It would be fitting if the UK won the right to host the crucial climate summit in 2020. Done well, it would showcase how the world’s first industrialised nation is shifting away from carbon faster than almost any other. Done badly, the UK – by then probably outside the EU – will highlight the folly of shifting away away from multilateralism just when when the world needs to pull together."
"There’s a line in the 2018 Arctic Report Card that I keep coming back to. Released this week by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, it notes with alarm the record low extent for virtually the entire ice season in the Bering Sea. The line brings me back to a sunny midsummer morning in Teller, Alaska. I’m standing with Mayor Blanche Obanoke-Garnie, just above Teller’s shoreline. I had traveled 4,000 miles north as a National Geographic explorer to listen and learn how Americans were responding to the dynamic and dangerous shifts along our coastlines as sea levels rise. As we looked out into sea’s wide expanse, Blanche explained that ice, and the protection it brings, had always been a given for Teller. Teller sits on the most north-western edge of the North American continent. A remote town of around 230 Iñupiat residents, the community is built on a gravel spit that juts out into the Bering Strait. Sea ice is critical to the survival of the village, which is surrounded on three sides by water. In normal years, ice begins to form around coastlines of the Bering Sea in early fall. It serves as an extension of the shoreline, providing a thick buffer to protect coastal villages like Teller from strong seasonal storms. But climate change has introduced a new, dangerous normal. Alaska is warming at twice the rate of the global average. And as air and sea temperatures warm at record-breaking speeds, sea ice forms much more thinly and much later into the year. According to the Arctic Report Card, during the winter of 2017 and 2018 when ice historically accumulates, the Bering Sea lost a section of ice the size of Idaho. With no ice, Teller has no natural defense from increasingly intense storm surges that annually flood the town’s streets and sewage system. The US Army Corps of Engineers has identified Teller as one of the most imminently threatened villages in Alaska from this flooding. It is one of 12 communities currently exploring relocation away from the coastline further inland to higher, drier ground. For Blanche, the loss of sea ice is more than a scientific indicator of persistent Arctic warming. It represents the daily danger of losing the places, histories and traditions that define Teller as a centuries-strong Native community. But while the fate of Teller is intimately connected to the fate of sea ice, it is not the only community facing the consequences of the Arctic’s unprecedented melt. The extent of sea ice in the Arctic affects the safety of Americans in Alabama and Arizona just as much as it does in Alaska. Sea ice in the polar regions helps to moderate global climate by reflecting solar radiation back into space. But as more ice is lost each season, more heat is absorbed by the ocean, compromising the Arctic’s ability to keep earth cool. And with more global warming, come more extreme storms across our shared world. Today, 96% of Americans live in counties that have been hit by major weather disasters in the last five years alone. Arctic ice loss is changing our shared planet at an extraordinary and life-threatening rate No matter what corner of this country you call home, whether it be the coast, the mountains, the Great Lakes or the Great Plains, climate change is already causing billions of dollars in damages and irreplaceable cultural loss. The severe warming and 95% loss of the Arctic’s oldest ice documented in the Arctic Report Card is not only pushing the region into uncharted territory. It is pushing our entire world into the most “unprecedented transition in human history”. Arctic ice loss is changing our shared planet at an extraordinary and life-threatening rate. For me, the Bering Sea ice loss noted in the Arctic Report Card represents the danger of losing the places, histories and traditions that define communities across America – not just in Alaska. In October, the world’s leading scientists warned that we have just 12 years to contain a climate change catastrophe in a landmark UN report. We cannot afford to wait to act ambitiously on climate change. The Arctic is already facing a climate change catastrophe in 2018. And what happens in the Arctic, doesn’t stay in the Arctic. It affects us all. Victoria Herrmann is the managing director the Arctic Institute, a Gates scholar at Cambridge University, and a National Geographic explorer"
"The world has been put on notice that its best efforts so far will fail to halt the devastation of climate change, as countries came to a partial agreement at UN talks that failed to match up to the challenges faced. Leading figures in climate science and economics said much more must be done, and quickly, to stave off the prospect of dangerous levels of global warming.  Nicholas Stern, the former World Bank chief economist and author of a seminal review of the economics of climate change, said: “It is clear that the progress we are making is inadequate, given the scale and urgency of the risks we face. The latest figures show carbon dioxide emissions are still rising. A much more attractive, clean and efficient path for economic development and poverty reduction is in our hands.” Johan Rockstrom, director designate at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said: “My biggest concern is that the UN talks failed to align ambitions with science. We continue to follow a path that will take us to a very dangerous 3-4C warmer world within this century. Extreme weather events hit people across the planet already, at only 1C of warming.” The two-week-long UN talks in Poland ended with clarity over the “rulebook” that will govern how the Paris agreement of 2015 is put into action, but the crucial question of how to lift governments’ targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was left unanswered. Countries will meet again next year. The annual climate talks have been going on since 1992 when the UN framework convention on climate change was signed, binding governments to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. That agreement followed years of scientific predictions on global warming, culminating in a landmark report in 1988 that warned of the dangers. Since then, the warnings have grown clearer and scientists have eliminated the possibility that the global warming observed in recent decades has been due to natural forces. It is a manmade problem arising from the use of fossil fuels, which has poured the heat-trapping gas carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. On current national emissions-cutting targets, the world would reach more than 3C of warming, scientists say. Two months ago the world’s leading body of climate scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, found that even 1.5C of warming would cause sea level rises, coral reef die-off, extinction of species and droughts, floods, storms and heatwaves that would threaten the world’s stability. Levels of warming greater than that would devastate parts of the globe, wiping out agricultural productivity, melting the Arctic ice cap and rendering many areas uninhabitable. Some businesses called on governments to act. Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which represents investors with more than $21tn (£16.7tn) in funds, said: “It is vital that the world’s governments recognise the serious challenge posed by climate change and urgently scale up their efforts, both at a national level and globally. It is only through signals such as these that investors will have the confidence necessary to allocate the required capital to the low-carbon and climate-resilient transition.” Next year’s negotiations, in Chile, are likely to focus on narrow technical issues. But the 2020 conference, which may be held in the UK or Italy, will be the biggest since the landmark Paris agreement of 2015. There, countries will have to come up with plans for cutting emissions drastically in order to avert a climate crisis that scientists say will cause greater economic, social and natural disruption than anything in humanity’s history."

"Riots in Paris, turmoil in Westminster, death in Strasbourg, stasis in Katowice at climate talks: some weeks, optimism can seem thin and remote, like the atmosphere on Neptune. Happily, there are thinkers such as Thomas Piketty to tell us how it could all be so different. A new plan for the EU, devised by the French economist and dozens of other Europeans, takes aim at some of these perennial problems – and offers some tentative solutions.  It seems particularly relevant, at a time when France’s gilets jaunes are tearing up Paris because of grinding austerity, that here is a plan that would raise money from big multinationals, not struggling families. It also seems apposite that, with few concrete plans to deliver the cuts in carbon emissions required to keep the planet from overheating, here is a plan that would set a firm carbon price. It feels urgent that, at a time when immigration and asylum have upended European politics, here at last is a proposal for funding a response. And any plan to make the EU more lovable is surely overdue: the British predicament is a testament to that. Prospects for enacting the Piketty plan may be slim, given Europe’s perennial difficulty in finding consensus: not even everyone on the left will agree, as Yanis Varoufakis makes clear in this piece about his own plan to revive the EU.  But at least it’s a plan. Elsewhere, one of our abiding themes in 2018 has been homelessness, an issue that always comes to the fore at this time of year. With rates climbing in many wealthy countries, it was good to hear of the remarkable work by a Dublin doctor to try to make a difference.

"Those attending the COP24 climate negotiations in Katowice, Poland, this week have been greeted by a bizarre sight: an artistic celebration of one of the main fuels responsible for destroying the global climate. Katowice is the centre of Poland’s coal industry, and despite hosting a conference that represents the last chance saloon when it comes to taking meaningful action on climate change, local politicians pride themselves on the black stuff. Perhaps we could have expected no different when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change decided on such an inappropriate venue and to allow coal companies to sponsor the talks. If we do make it through climate change with some form of civilisation intact, we will look back at some of the things we are doing now with the moral repugnance we feel towards slavery. There are legitimate parallels here. Climate change will most hurt those yet to be born. Our failure to make the dramatic changes needed to our economy and society means we are behaving as if we own the lives of future generations and have a right to steal their lives from them.  Art plays a key role in recording contemporary life, but because it is exploratory and imaginative it also invites us to challenge the assumptions we live by. In Katowice there is a counter-exhibition on coal by art students, drawing attention to the “dark side of coal”. Meanwhile the campaign movement Art Not Oil, which has been pushing for an end to oil sponsorship of the arts, ran a parallel protest exhibition alongside the British Museum’s I Object show in opposition to financial backing from BP – a company that proudly boasts it is one of the most significant corporate investors in UK arts and culture. Performers acted as “rebel curators”, presenting objects to the public that represent BP’s complicity in climate breakdown. Just as in Bristol, where the Green lord mayor, Cleo Lake, has banished paintings related to the slave trade from her office, so galleries should shun BP funding. Musicians are also challenging corporate sponsorship. Neil Young is due to play a large concert in Hyde Park next summer. Recently he criticised the event’s sponsor, Barclays, declaring the bank a “fossil-fuel-funding entity”. Young said such sponsorship was incompatible with his beliefs about the climate, and that he was seeking to rectify the situation. Yesterday he claimed victory, saying the concert was now proceeding without Barclays as a sponsor. Others need to follow his lead. And perhaps Young and other musicians concerned about climate change will also need to think carefully about the carbon footprint of performing concerts around the globe. There’s also a strong case against continued fossil fuel sponsorship from an economic perspective. The financial sector is rapidly divesting from fossil fuels, realising the smart money is in renewables and the green economy. Since the Paris agreement was adopted in November 2015, the sustainable finance agenda has moved rapidly. In the European parliament I’ve worked on legislation that requires all financial market players to give full information about how customers’ money is invested. Since the EU has committed to phasing out fossil fuels by 2050, any pensions for people aged under 40 that contain assets based on fossil fuels could be claimed to have been mis-sold. So decisions not to throw money at fossil fuels are increasingly looking hard-headed and rational rather than purely moral. There’s also a growing divestment movement, and universities and colleges have been at the forefront. Almost half of UK universities have made divestment commitments. Students and academics of the arts can play a vital role in pushing this agenda, again using their talents to do this in creative ways. No matter how much they are struggling for cash, galleries and arts promoters should be made to feel too ashamed to take money from the industries that are leading us to climate breakdown. In the same way we now look back on the slave trade, those who took the filthy fossil fuel lucre will be condemned by future historians. But the arts sector must go further than simply seeking clean sources of funding. Artistic creation invites us to imagine alternative worlds and to subvert the power of the old. Envisioning a future where fossil fuels have no place in our economy or society could provide a rich creative vein for artists and musicians, allowing them to play a vital role in generating ideas about how we are to live in the post-fossil fuel era. • Molly Scott Cato is Green party MEP for South West England"
"It was a blazing hot day in La Quinta, California, and Irving Berlin was inspired to write a song. Not just any old tune: having completed the lyric, the composer told his secretary he “just wrote the best song that anybody’s ever written”. Though not everyone would agree with his boast, White Christmas went on to become a commercial and cultural success. Made famous by Bing Crosby, who sang it in the film Holiday Inn, it is thought to be the bestselling single of all time, shifting at least 150m copies worldwide.  White Christmas was not a hit initially. But in 1942, two years after it was written, the song topped the US charts, thanks in part to its popularity with American soldiers stationed overseas during the second world war. It was a hit in Britain, too, perhaps helped by the fact that, unlike swathes of the southern US, we actually experience white Christmases – or at least we used to. The last “proper” white Christmas – at least in southern Britain – with snow settling on the ground, was in 2010, though in the Highlands snow falls every winter. However, as global warming takes hold, soon the only link with white Christmases may be the famous song."

"Scientists have laid down the gauntlet for political leaders as the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, wrestles with the challenge of cutting emissions without sparking social tensions like those seen recently in France. The UN climate talks – known as COP24 and the most important since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015 – aim to set a new rulebook for governments to reduce greenhouse gases and to raise ambitions, after warnings of dire consequences if global warming rises more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.  The climate crisis is already here and the risks are growing, said Hoesung Lee, chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who led a study by thousands of scientists on ways to avoid 1.5C of warming via accelerated transition from fossil fuels. “The IPCC made a tremendous collective effort to bring you the best scientific knowledge on the subject. We tell you limiting warming to 1.5C is possible but the window is narrowing,” Lee told a plenary on Tuesday. “The scientific community has delivered, now it is up to governments to take action.” There has been fierce debate about what to do with the study. All but four of the world’s governments want to formally welcome the 1.5C report to spur a more ambitious shift towards renewable energy. However, four oil producing nations – the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait – said the study should merely be “noted”. This issue has overshadowed the past few days of the talks in Poland. Saudi Arabia has claimed there are “gaps and uncertainties” in the study. The US held a long-planned event promoting coal, gas, oil and nuclear power. In a thinly veiled criticism of such tactics, Laurent Fabius, a former prime minister of France and president of the 2015 Paris climate talks, told the plenary that political leaders would play a negative role if they were “not only somnambulists but spoilers”. He noted that global emissions rose by 2% this year, when they need to decline if warming is to be kept to a less dangerous level. “Let us be clear, the real world is not on track. We need to do more and to do it faster,” Fabius said. “The IPCC 1.5C report shows the tremendous importance of every half degree and the disastrous consequences of missing that boundary.” But many delegates said more attention should be focused on the social challenges of rapid change, as workers in old industries, such as coal, lose their jobs and the price of fossil fuels is pushed higher to stimulate the transition to alternative energies. Without greater consideration of how the costs and benefits could be equally shared there could be a violent backlash, as France has experienced with the gilets jaunes protests that were initially about a planned rise in an eco-tax on petrol. Jonathan Pershing, a former US climate envoy, said technology and the markets would drive change, and it was already cheaper to build a new renewable power plant than a new coal or gas plant. “But you have to think about how to manage it. What happens to people who no longer have jobs from the old economy in the new economy? How do you think about new opportunities and the training you give young people? If you close down old facilities, how do you do it in a manner that keeps the communities alive and helps maintain the traditions and cultural structures?” Pershing said. “We don’t do it very often so we don’t have much experience. No report tells us how to manage the political difficulties. We need to manage the transitions. They’re hard.” This was echoed by Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, who said it was important for governments to separate raising tax revenue from addressing climate change. “The yellow vest implications are huge and show the danger if we take wrong moves,” he said. “We haven’t paid enough attention on the short-term impacts [of putting a price on carbon]. The environment movement needs to look at itself in the mirror.”"

"The EU and scores of developing countries have pledged to toughen their existing commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to enable the world to stay within a 1.5C rise in global warming. The promise, which follows increasingly dire scientific warnings, was the most positive message yet to come from the ongoing talks in Poland. The announcement came at the end of a day in which the UN secretary general made an impassioned intervention to rescue the talks, which have been distracted by US, Russian and Saudi moves to downgrade scientific advice. “We’re running out of time,” António Guterres told the plenary. “To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.” The talks have centred on devising a rulebook for implementing the 2015 Paris agreement and raising countries’ level of ambition to counter climate change, but progress has been slow on several key issues and divisions have emerged between four fossil fuel powers – the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait – and the rest of the world. The UN believes China could play a stronger role in the absence of leadership from the US. Sources said Guterres would make a telephone call to Xi to ask for his help in nudging talks forward. The EU also wants China, which is a key member of the block of 77 developing countries, to step up to ensure that countries all follow the same rules in being transparent over their greenhouse gas emissions. Campaigners praised the decision by the High Ambition Coalition group of countries, made up of the EU and four other developed countries, including Canada and New Zealand, as well as the large grouping of least developed countries and several other developing nations, to scale up their emissions-cutting efforts in line with a 1.5C temperature rise limit. Wendel Trio, director of the Climate Action Network Europe, said: “The spirit of Paris is back. The statement will boost greater ambition at the crunch time of these so far underwhelming talks. For the EU this must mean a commitment to significantly increase its 2030 target by 2020, even beyond the 55% reduction some member states and the European parliament are calling for. We call upon the countries that have not signed the statement so far to stop ignoring the science.”  Guterres, in a pointed criticism aimed at the four countries that have been refusing to “welcome” the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s special report on 1.5-degree warming, said rejecting climate science was indefensible. He added: “The IPCC special report is a stark acknowledgment of what the consequences of global warming beyond 1.5 degrees will mean for billions of people around the world, especially those who call small island states home. This is not good news, but we cannot afford to ignore it.” Frank Bainimarama, the prime minister of Fiji and the outgoing chair of COP23, amplified Guterres’ message. He told delegates they risked going down in history as “the generation that blew it – that sacrificed the health of our world and ultimately betrayed humanity because we didn’t have the courage and foresight to go beyond our short-term individual concerns: craven, irresponsible and selfish”. The former US vice-president Al Gore told delegates they faced “the single most important moral choice in history of humanity”. Behind the scenes, delegates said there had been strong progress on finance thanks to a doubling of commitments by Germany and Norway to help poorer nations adapt to climate change and build institutions capable of monitoring emissions. Nicholas Stern, the author of a landmark review on the economics of climate change, praised “the level of ideas and cooperation”. But others said there were still many disputed brackets in the negotiating text on transparency and other elements of the rulebook. “There has been some progress, but it’s a very worrying time. There is still a lot more on the table than we hoped for at this stage,” said Helen Mountford, vice-president of the World Resources Institute. “The secretary general is coming in to make sure this COP can land in a good place. He will hold a summit next year to raise ambitions. If he wants success there, then here we need a robust rulebook and clear signals on ambition and finance.” Janos Pasztor, the former climate adviser to Ban Ki-moon, told the Guardian that Guterres was doing the right thing by intervening at a crucial stage. “He needs to make clear what the IPCC has described as a major challenge, and that we have to deliver on that,” he said. Pasztor added: “We are talking about the need for massive emissions reductions, that have to happen now, not in the future. It is very daunting. The secretary general has reminded the world of what is at stake, and the political significance of that.” The contrasts with the Paris climate summit, in terms of the political atmosphere, were striking. David Levaï, who was part of the French government team that helped to broker the successful 2015 conference, said the geopolitical winds were far less favourable today. Globally, the rise of nationalists such as Donald Trump in the US and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil has tilted power towards fossil fuel and agribusiness interests. He said: “In the year before Paris, all countries made clear that they wanted an agreement. Now, there are repeated attacks on multilateralism, and this has empowered groups that take negative actions.” Levaï, who is at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations, expressed hope that the secretary general might make a difference. “The fact that he has come back shows he feels a need to whip countries into order,” he said. There has been some criticism of the pro-coal government of Poland for failing to press governments to raise their ambitions. But it joined Fiji as co-chair of the Talanoa phase of the negotiations to issue a call for action that recognised the importance of the 1.5C report as the basis for more urgency and ambition. “The window for action is closing fast. We need to do more and we need to do it now,” said the document, which would form part of the official statement from this conference."

"The United States and other high carbon dioxide-emitting developed countries are deliberately frustrating the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, Vanuatu’s foreign minister has said. His warning came as Pacific and Indian ocean states warned they faced annihilation if a global climate “rule book” could not brokered. In a bruising speech before ministers and heads of state, Vanuatu’s foreign minister, Ralph Regenvanu, singled out the US as he excoriated major CO2-emitting developed countries for deliberately hindering negotiations. “It pains me deeply to have watched the people of the United States and other developed countries across the globe suffering the devastating impacts of climate-induced tragedies, while their professional negotiators are here at COP24 putting red lines through any mention of loss and damage in the Paris guidelines and square brackets around any possibility for truthfully and accurately reporting progress against humanity’s most existential threat,” he said. Regenvanu said the countries most responsible for climate change were now frustrating efforts to counter it. The UN’s climate change talks in Poland have been distracted by a semantic debate over whether the conference should “welcome” or “note” the IPCC’s special report warning of dire consequences if global warming rises more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with a bloc of four oil-producing countries – the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Kuwait – insisting the report be only “noted”. Documents from the conference presidency, seen by the Guardian, indicate the issue of how to acknowledge the report will be returned to later in the week and is likely to further slow progress on negotiating a final outcome. Negotiators said they are growing increasingly pessimistic that talks can be concluded by their deadline on Friday. “Whether you welcome, or note, or shamefully ignore the science altogether,” Regenvanu said, “the fact remains that this is catastrophic for humanity, and party negotiators blocking meaningful progress should have much on their conscience.” He said climate change represented an existential threat to humanity, but “we have overcome greater human-induced wrongs before like colonialism, like slavery”. As 193 countries at the climate talks seek to establish a “rule book” on how to implement the commitments made in the Paris agreement three years ago, Regenvanu condemned a two-tier system that exempted high-emissions countries from reductions obligations, saying the world needed “one common rule book, in which rules apply to all”. The US state department declined to comment on his remarks. Regenvanu was part of a cohort of small island states in the Pacific and Indian oceans that urged greater global action on limiting global warming to 1.5C; leaders from Kiribati, Samoa, Tuvalu, the Cook Islands and the Maldives argued their countries faced an impending existential threat from climate change. Speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island Developing States, the Maldives’ environment minister, Hussain Rasheed Hassan, said the world needed to question “why we are continuing failing?”. He said: “After a quarter of a century of UNFCCC negotiations and three years since the historic Paris agreement, we are further from approaching our goal of stabilising emissions than ever, and … rapidly approaching the point of no return. The prime minister of Kiribati, Taneti Maamau, said the countries that had contributed least to climate change were feeling its impacts first – and most acutely: “Truly, but sadly, the prosperity enjoyed by a few developed countries, has become the tragedy and misery of the mess of developing countries and particularly those most vulnerable to climate change.” Henry Puna, the prime minister of the Cook Islands, said while the Paris agreement represented a moment of global solidarity, inaction and infighting since then had paralysed efforts to reduce emissions. “I am scared for my children’s future, and for the future of generations to come,” he said. “Parties have called for action, but it is evident our current efforts are not enough.” He said climate change denialism jeopardised the future of Pacific countries: “Some are not willing to accept the stark realities.”"
"Global warming is a crisis for civilisation and a crisis for life on Earth. Human-caused climate change was behind 15 deadly weather disasters in 2017, including droughts, floods and heatwaves. The world’s leading climate scientists, in a special report for the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), have warned that there is only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C. To meet that target, global carbon emissions need to drop by 45% by 2030. Instead they are going up. We need radical, urgent change. So it is appalling that negotiators in Poland at the 24th Conference of the Parties, or COP24, are finding it so hard to push ahead with implementing the climate deal signed three years ago in Paris. This is largely because rising rightwing nationalism has vitiated the global solidarity needed to avoid a catastrophe. Under the Paris agreement, effective action to tackle climate change requires global cooperation on three fronts: first, nations set demanding carbon-reduction targets for their own societies; second, countries are held accountable for meeting these targets through surveillance mechanisms; and third, rich states provide cash for poorer ones to transition to a carbon-free future. Yet none of this is possible when the most important actors on the world stage think that the chief business of the nation state lies at home. The biggest problem is the US president, Donald Trump – a longtime climate-change denier. While negotiators were discussing how to lower carbon emissions, Mr Trump’s officials unveiled two schemes promoting fossil fuels. The US’s rogue behaviour has encouraged others to behave badly: notably Saudi Arabia, which played a key role in attempts to wreck the summit’s “welcoming” of the IPCC report. Last month, Brazil’s president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro, chose as his foreign minister a climate-change denier, and the nation has pulled out of hosting COP25. The top European leaders – Emmanuel Macron, Theresa May and Angela Merkel – are inwardly focused, leaving Poland, the current talks’ host, to sing the virtues of its large coal stocks. The other big players are India and China: the latter has the global heft but is not internationally deft; for the former, the opposite is true.  Public opinion is way ahead of national politics. In the US there has been a definite shift in beliefs: more than 80% of Americans, including most Republicans, believe climate change is happening. Tens of thousands of people in Brussels marched ahead of the summit in Poland. The collapse of the planet’s biosphere has permeated the public consciousness. This means that there are breakthroughs: Poland relented to create a group that will make sure the summit’s goals will be ambitious. Germany has stumped up extra cash to ensure funding pledges are met. Even the US has been allowed to play a constructive role in creating rules by which nations agree to abide by in meeting climate targets – because everyone has an interest in creating a backdoor for Washington to re-enter the agreement. About 80% of all energy traded is oil, coal or gas. The world’s economy runs on fossil fuel, which is destroying our planet. Creating and deploying zero-carbon technologies is a formidable and costly challenge. But threats to future lives are as morally reprehensible as threats to our own. We owe them more than this."
"Two great dramas are unfolding. One concerns the future trading status of a small, rich country, and is marked by febrile debate, political histrionics and inflated egos. The other sees the rest of the world trying to control climate change. The differences between the two shows could not be starker. The UN summit in Katowice, Poland, is a challenge for civilisation, for the benefit of the common good, an existential thriller for 7.5 billion people and all of nature which is being played out in relative calm. In contrast, in Westminster we are witnessing the culmination of a long-running political schism that is of much less consequence to the planet. Major studies have in the past few weeks made it clearer than ever that we are facing, in David Attenborough’s words at the opening of the summit last week, “a manmade disaster of global scale … our greatest threat in thousands of years”. First came a UN climate change special report, which showed how we may have only 12 or so years left for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which the risks of floods, drought and extreme heat will increase, and food shortages and poverty are likely for hundreds of millions of people. Then came a Global Carbon Budget study, which showed that, at current trends, the world is heading towards a catastrophic 3C of warming by 2100. An unseen revolution is taking place: from denial and inaction just two decades ago, countries now dare to think big To add gloom to the pessimism, some of the world’s biggest investors issued a stark warning to governments at the Katowice summit that failure to act urgently would result in financial catastrophe. And the UN’s World Meteorological Organization has provisionally confirmed that the past four years have been the hottest on record, and that extreme weather caused by manmade climate change now affects all continents. Taken together, these reports show conclusively that we are on the edge of climate breakdown, and that governments are failing to prevent it. Factor in the dramatic but linked decline in biodiversity, and the potential for collapsed ecosystems and mass extinctions, and we can see we are at an existential crossroads, heading inexorably towards a fatally denuded Earth. Some leaders, such as the US president, Donald Trump, and the incoming president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, say in wilful ignorance that all this science is wrong and that nothing needs to change – indeed forests must be felled and fossil fuels be further subsidised and promoted as “clean coal”. Others, such as the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, do not deny the science but coldly calculate how much they would lose and try to water down commitments. In the middle at Katowice are the 10,000 government negotiators and NGOs trying to make rich countries reduce emissions and help poor countries adapt to inevitable climate change. But these UN climate talks depend on the consensus of all countries, so the progress appears incremental, even glacial. And because they do not involve adversarial politicians, they are considered unimportant by most of the world’s media. Beyond Katowice, though, are many millions of people who expect their leaders to act in the interests of all, and who are increasingly dismayed that the global economic system threatens everyone’s future. We are now in a race against time to address climate change. We have started late, the signs are not good, and the gap between high-level rhetoric and action to reduce emissions is widening. Fury is now building against governments, with the Extinction Rebellion climate protest group taking non-violent direct action, which has spread to 35 countries in just a few weeks. There are, however, lots of reasons to believe we can meet the challenge. This year, Trump’s decision to pull the world’s second-biggest carbon emitter out of the Paris agreement to cut emissions has backfired. Not only did US emissions fall in 2018, many US states, cities and businesses said they intended to fulfil their Paris obligations. The transition to a less carbon-intensive energy system is also gathering pace. The share of renewables in meeting global energy demand is expected to grow by at least one-fifth in the next five years . By 2020 it should be cheaper to build new renewable energy plants in most countries than to keep coal or fossil fuels burning. Countries can already save money by retiring coal plants and substituting wind and solar. Soon only subsidies worth around £5tn a year will keep coal alive in many countries. Even more optimistically, the world’s largest developing countries are now in the forefront of the transition to lower emissions. India and China, with nearly a third of the world’s people, are at the forefront of the next solar revolution and, like Europe, are firmly on the path to decarbonisation. An unseen revolution is taking place in the way we power the world. From denial and inaction just two decades ago, countries now dare to think big. China is to build a giant solar park in the Gobi desert big enough to power 1 million homes; a single project in India will be even larger, covering 10,000 acres of Rajasthan, and one in the desert near Aswan in Egypt should deliver as much power as two nuclear power stations. The world is full now of major initiatives. Spurred by the commitments made at the Paris climate meeting in 2015, many countries, for example, are furiously planting trees; carbon capture and storage to take the emissions of fossil fuels is becoming a reality; millions of rice farmers have adopted the system of rice intensification which halves the water needed and reduces methane emissions from rice cultivation by up to 50%. These and many others are, so far, only incremental initiatives, coming far too slowly to even brake the warming. These are the seeds of change, lifting ambition, inspiring hope and showing the potential for change on a planetary scale. They also help politicians and bankers understand that getting to net zero emissions in just 40 years is technically and financially possible, and the best investment any country can ever make. By the end of the week, Britain may have weathered another political storm and people may be able to see a little clearer what is happening. Perhaps then our politicians will lift their heads and turn to address the greatest challenge any generation is ever likely to face. They will see that people are up for the challenge. If they then don’t respond with urgency, we are not just metaphorically in the soup, we may literally be cooked. • John Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor"
"Climate marches, raging and unseasonal bushfires, the Adani coal mine. It seems like climate change and global warming is a conversation that’s going to be hard to avoid this Christmas. But some ways of talking are better than others. To help you prepare for difficult conversations here are five different ways you can try to talk about climate change, or anything else difficult and controversial, this holidays. This is not a winning strategy in itself. The facts have been around for more than 50 years but the debate has taken a course that has at times ignored science. Sure, you can throw intellectual spaghetti at the wall and see if it sticks. But there are better options. In a recent interview, professor of linguistics and cognitive science George Lakoff railed against “enlightenment reasoning”, which is the belief that “if you just tell people the facts, they’ll reach the right conclusion” “That just isn’t true,” Lakoff says. “People think in terms of conceptual structures called frames and metaphors. It’s not just the facts.” Compelling stories steeped in emotion and backed with facts – that’s the way to talk about global warming. Earlier this year the UN released a handbook for talking about climate change which recommends “telling a human story, talking about the real world, knowing what matters to the audience, and employing visual aids”. This advice takes advantage of processes that are literally hardwired in our brains and have assisted with our survival. Or, as moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt said, the “human mind is a story processor, not a logic processor”. You don’t have to look far to find these stories. Tell your family about the joint US and Australian firefighting efforts that have been running for 20 years but may be stopped because we are moving towards a “year round” fire season and will be too busy battling blazes at home to help anyone else. The process of simply hearing what the person says is enough to defuse the emotional charge Tell them about the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, which could hit again next year with heat waves breaking records that have stood for 118 years by more than 5C. Tell them about the low-lying island nations like Kiribati, which are being threatened by storm surges and rising sea levels, and then show them this picture. If you need something festive perhaps mention that summer heat waves have destroyed one third of the Christmas tree crops in the UK, something already well known in Australia. If you do have to quote facts and figures, use graphs to bring them to life. These animated charts of global temperature over time are compelling and this collection of 10 graphs is a little dated but still worth bookmarking. Chances are you’re not going to meet outright deniers this Christmas. The overwhelming majority of people believe in global warming – 73% of the Australian public at last count. The problem is urgency. So make your conversations about the tangible present with solutions. This might mean talking about smaller things first so it doesn’t sound so big and difficult to deal with that it is overwhelming. Talk about the droughts across Australia. The fires in Queensland and California. The increased severity of storms and hurricanes such as those that hit Florida and Houston or the single cyclone that wiped out more than 60% of Vanuatu’s economy. Keep things real, immediate, and tangible. In the case that you do run into deniers, or denialist rhetoric, it’s important to resist the urge to repeat false claims while attempting to refute them. I’ve written before about the downsides of acting as a publicist for views you disagree with. In short, it’s counterproductive and usually ends up strengthening the other side’s arguments. You want to avoid repeating claims – but by all means refute them forcefully.  An example of this would be if someone raises scientific consensus. You say “more scientists agree on global warming than on plate tectonics” but don’t repeat whatever claim has prompted this. Then there is framing. A frame is a theory that suggests that how something is presented to an audience can influence how people process that information. Think about the “carbon tax”. This was either a failure or triumph of framing depending on how you look at it. The ETS was actually not a tax, in fact, as this article  explains, it’s kind of the opposite. But still, it was framed as a tax. People don’t like taxes. Opposition built. Election were lost. The tax that was not a tax was scrapped. We can learn from this. In 2003 Republican consultant Frank Luntz laid out the climate strategy used by conservatives for the last 15 years. This was leaked in a memo and included advice such as using the term “climate change” instead of “global warming” because it sounded more natural and less alarming. This has led to the often repeated “climate is always changing” argument. To counter this framing you have to not engage with it but to push a different, more compelling, frame – Lakoff suggests “climate crisis” but global warming also works. This is about all of our futures – our lives, our quality of life, and that of our children. Keep it in that frame and you’re a lot closer to changing minds. Non-violent communication (NVC) is a methodology created by psychologist Marshall Rosenberg as a way to bridge communication divides by focusing on universal human needs. While it sounds quite touchy-feely, it is used by everyone from companies to personal therapists, and even hostage negotiators. NVC is all about listening, repeating, asking questions, and thinking about what needs are being expressed. You begin with neutral observation and repetition. These conversations can degenerate to yelling matches without people even realising what the other is trying to say. If someone tells you “climate change is natural” and that they’re sick of alarmists, NVC advises repeating back “I’m hearing you say that what’s happening is normal and people are exaggerating the dangers, is that right”. In conversations that can quickly devolve into sloganistic shouting the process of simply hearing what the person says is enough to defuse the emotional charge. The second step is to talk about emotions rather than policy positions or facts, which should sound familiar by now. If someone tells you they are sick of the “climate change cult” and “lying scientists”, ask them what they are feeling rather than arguing about something they are already upset about. Do they feel confused, angry, overwhelmed, incredulous? Talking about the feeling behind the statement and your own feelings can help you start to see things from each others perspective, as long as you are doing it respectfully. That’s a lot of talking about feelings but I assure you, this is effective – you can probably see now why I brought up hostage negotiations at the start. Step three is to identify what need is being expressed – you can find a list here. I’ve written before about the empowering belief of climate denialism – and what a relief it would be if it were true. The truth is that people don’t simply believe things. They hold beliefs because they empower them or give them utility. Try to understand what that utility or empowerment is. The final step is a request. Ask the person if they would be willing to look at one of the graphs above, or read a first person piece from a firefighter, a farmer, or a soldier. The main thing is to keep trying. Stress the urgency, try to understand where people come from, have the conversations. This affects us all. • Simon Black is senior media campaigner for Greenpeace Australia"
"Countries settled on most of the tricky elements of the “rulebook” for putting the 2015 Paris agreement into practice. This includes how governments will measure, report on and verify their emissions-cutting efforts, a key element because it ensures all countries are held to proper standards and will find it harder to wriggle out of their commitments.  There was a row over carbon credits, which are awarded to countries for their emissions-cutting efforts and their carbon sinks, such as forests, which absorb carbon. These credits count towards countries’ emissions-cutting targets. Brazil, which hopes to benefit from its large rainforest cover, insisted on a new form of wording that critics said would allow double counting of credits, undermining the integrity of the system. This issue has been put off until next year. Largely absent from these talks, which had a technical focus, was the key question of how countries will step up their targets on cutting emissions. On current targets, the world is set for 3C of warming from pre-industrial levels, which scientists say would be disastrous, resulting in droughts, floods, sea level rises and the decline of agricultural productivity. The key deadline is 2020, when countries must show they have met targets set a decade ago for cutting their emissions, and when they must affirm new, much tougher targets. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global body of the world’s leading climate scientists, warned two months ago that allowing warming to reach 1.5C above pre-industrial levels would have grave consequences, including the die-off of coral reefs and devastation of many species. If we extrapolate from the IPCC’s findings, the world has little more than a decade to bring emissions under control and halve them, which would help to stabilise the climate. After years in which the world’s carbon emissions appeared to be stabilising, they are on the rise again. Coal use continues and oil is still the engine of much of the world’s economy. Clean energy is coming on-stream at a faster rate than many predicted, and the costs of it have come down rapidly, but its adoption needs to be speeded up. Infrastructure, such as energy generation plants, transport networks and buildings, is a central issue: infrastructure built now to rely on high-carbon energy effectively locks in high emissions for decades to come. Some people are also saying we need to invest in projects to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and a new focus of the talks is helping countries to adapt to the effects of climate change. The US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait joined forces to prevent the conference fully embracing the IPCC’s findings, watering down a statement to a weak commendation of the timing of the scientists’ report. Australia joined with the US in a celebration of coal, and Brazil signalled its climate scepticism under Jair Bolsonaro by withdrawing its offer to host next year’s talks. But the EU, a handful of other developed countries and scores of developing nations including the poorest and most vulnerable affirmed that they would strive to meet the IPCC’s advice on limiting warming to no more than 1.5C. The UN will meet again next year in Chile to thrash out the final elements of the Paris rulebook and begin work on future emissions targets. But the crunch conference will come in 2020, when countries must meet the deadline for their current emissions commitments and produce new targets for 2030 and beyond that go further towards meeting scientific advice. That conference may be held in the UK or Italy, both of which have bid to be hosts. The UK’s intention in offering to host is to signal it will retain its role on the world stage after Brexit. The event may also provide a welcome change from wranglings over Brexit and intractable trade deals. But whoever hosts will have a diplomatic mountain to climb, if the fractious nature of this year’s talks is anything to go by."

"The UN climate change talks ended late on Saturday night in Poland with a deal agreed on how to put the 2015 Paris agreement into action, but with other contentious problems left to be resolved next year. Countries thrashed out the complex details of how to account for and record their greenhouse gas emissions, which will form the basis of a “rulebook” on putting the Paris goals into action. But difficult questions such as how to scale up existing commitments on cutting emissions, in line with stark scientific advice, and how to provide finance for poor countries to do the same, were put off for future years.  In the final hours, agreement was held up by a debate over the market in carbon credits, awarded to countries for their emissions-cutting efforts and for their carbon sinks, such as forests, which absorb carbon dioxide. Brazil wanted an amendment that would benefit the country for its large rainforest cover, but this was opposed by others as it could allow the double-counting of carbon credits, undermining the integrity of the system. This question has now been pushed back to next year’s annual conference. Brazil’s stance, however, under incoming president Jair Bolsonaro, who also rescinded the country’s offer to host next year’s talks, presages troubles to come. Brazil has been a reliable supporter of the annual talks in the past, and has worked to broker deals between the developed and developing world. Without that support in future, the talks are only likely to grow more fractious. Even when Brazil’s carbon-credits issue was postponed, a further obstacle was opened up by Turkey, which wants to be counted as a developing country rather than a developed one. Weary delegates finally filed into the closing session at nearly 10pm to hail the compromise agreement. Despite these hitches, the two-week conference – the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP24 – finally ended in clarity, at least on some of the key building blocks for putting the Paris agreement into action. David Waskow, of the World Resources Institute, said the final deal was “a good foundation for countries to go about implementing the Paris agreement”. He added: “It sets the direction of travel and will spur countries to take action. Now countries need to go home and do their homework, by increasing their commitments [on emissions].” But the key question of whether countries are doing enough to cut their emissions, in the light of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that predicted dire consequences if temperatures were allowed to rise more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, was left out. The IPCC’s report in October showed that the world must change course drastically in the next decade to avoid the consequences of a 1.5C rise, including the die-off of coral reefs, droughts and floods, and a decline in agricultural productivity over many areas. This year has seen extreme weather across many parts of the globe, and the fourth highest global average temperatures on record, while the IPCC warning is the starkest yet to come from scientists. António Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, praised countries for coming to an agreement, but demanded more. “The approval of the Paris agreement work programme is the basis for a transformative process which will require strengthened ambition from the international community,” he said. “Science has clearly shown that we need enhanced ambition to defeat climate change. From now on, my five priorities will be: ambition, ambition, ambition, ambition and ambition.” He cited the need for countries to toughen their emissions-cutting targets and to adapt their infrastructure to cope with the effects of climate change. Jennifer Morgan of Greenpeace said: “A year of climate disasters and a dire warning from the world’s top scientists should have led to so much more. Instead, governments let people down again as they ignored the science and the plight of the vulnerable. “Without immediate action, even the strongest rules will not get us anywhere. People expected action, and that is what governments did not deliver. This is morally unacceptable.” Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate change at WWF-UK, said: “[There has been] some positive progress, but we have not yet done enough. The world is in a state of climate emergency and yet some of our leaders prefer to stay in a state of denial. “Everyone’s future is at stake. We need all countries to get much more serious about climate ambition."
"Britain is bidding to host the UN climate change conference in 2020, the biggest since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, as part of the government’s aim to be seen as a green leader. The conference will mark a vital deadline for countries to comply with their commitments on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and move on to tougher targets for the decade to 2030, and so it is likely to be a fractious affair.  If successful, the move would be a strong signal of the UK government’s determination to retain its role on the world stage after Brexit. Claire Perry, the climate change minister, flew to Poland on Thursday after taking part in the Conservative party’s vote on Theresa May’s future, which she called “24 hours of political self-indulgence”. Perry told journalists: “We have to make sure we can deliver a good COP [Conference of the Parties], as 2020 will be a really vital COP, and we absolutely want to be part of that process [of making it a success].” She pointed to the UK’s efforts in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and investing in green jobs, saying Britain had decarbonised faster per unit of GDP than any other country in the past decade, and created 400,000 jobs in the low-carbon economy. “We have a really good track record in the UK,” she said. In Poland, the UK joined with other EU member states and scores of developing countries in committing to scale up their ambition on climate change, with a focus on preventing global warming from breaching 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, in line with scientific warnings. The UN awards the hosting of the COP, as the annual meeting is known, usually by alternating among developed and developing countries, and different continents, though the rules can be somewhat flexible. Next year’s host was supposed to be Brazil, but the incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, is hostile to the Paris agreement and has withdrawn the offer. Chile and Costa Rica are understood to be considering alternative bids. Some campaigners at the current climate change talks in Poland, which have stalled over continuing disagreements on how to implement the Paris agreement, praised the UK’s move. Gareth Redmond-King, the head of climate change at WWF UK, said: “This is great news and we welcome the bid to host the 2020 [conference]. It’s an opportunity for the UK to lead the way on climate change at a time when the need for action has never been starker.” COP26, as the 2020 conference is known in UN jargon, will also be notable for the role of the US. Under Donald Trump’s presidency, the country has begun the process of withdrawal from the Paris agreement, but that could be halted if he is replaced in the 2020 election. Bolsonaro has indicated he may take Brazil out of the Paris agreement, and the divisions between developed and developing countries that have characterised the current talks are likely to remain in the intervening years, giving the UK a diplomatic mountain to climb to make a success of the talks if awarded host-country status.

"In the face of the emerging climate emergency (Letters, 10 December) and projected unconstrained growth in global fossil fuel use, this is a plea for people with relevant expertise and influence to take forward the idea for a “non-proliferation treaty” (NPT) for fossil fuels, floated by Andrew Simms and Peter Newell (theguardian.com, 23 October) and supported by Bill McKibben, Naomi Klein and others (Letters, 30 October). The analogy between fossil fuels and fissile nuclear materials is imperfect, but it should not be overlooked that the nuclear NPT promotes cooperation in and equal access to “peaceful use” of nuclear technology. “Peaceful use” of fossil fuels could mean their continued but decreasing extraction, within enforceable limits constrained by the Paris agreement goals, and an offsetting role for carbon capture and geo-sequestration (funded by fossil fuel producers). Safeguards and oversight could be provided by a new United Nations monitoring agency, akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which could also administer a global fossil carbon budget.  Fossil fuel companies extract their products where relevant governments permit. The number of nations permitting extractions on scales that threaten all of us is greater than the number of nuclear weapons states, but it is nevertheless small. This could make rapid negotiation of a fossil fuel “NPT” relatively tractable. It would not even have to include all producer nations at first to be effective.Hugh RichardsStroud, Gloucestershire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Environmental and progressive activist groups are urging Australia’s major banks and financial institutions not to fund new coal projects now that the Morrison government has flagged taxpayer assistance for power generation. The Australian Conservation Foundation, GetUp, Greenpeace, Environment Victoria, the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility and the Australia Institute wrote on Thursday to chief executives of the major lenders, warning the provision of finance for new coal, or retrofits of old coal-fired power stations, would be inconsistent with their public commitments to the Paris agreement.  The pressure on financial institutions follows the energy minister, Angus Taylor, calling for expressions of interest in new power generation projects to be underwritten by taxpayers, including, potentially, new coal builds or retrofits. The government has made it clear that the new projects must be coal, gas, batteries or pumped hydro to be eligible for the government underwriting. A very tight timeframe is also proposed, with proponents having to put their hands up by January 23. The environmental groups have told the banks the evidence is in on climate change, and an urgent response is required to combat the risks. The groups have told the banking chiefs they risk providing finance for stranded assets if they finance new coal projects. “We strongly believe that the provision of finance from your financial institution for any new coal generation project or any retrofit to extend the life of an existing coal generator, would be inconsistent with your public position on climate change, counter to the concerns of your customers, and unmindful of the high risk of any new coal investment resulting in a stranded asset.” The Investor Group on Climate Change – an organisation representing more than 70 Australian and New Zealand institutional investors with more than $2 trillion of funds under management – has raised similar concerns with Taylor. The IGCC has told the energy minister subsidising high-emission electricity generation is inconsistent with the objectives of the Paris agreement and exposes the assets to substantive carbon price and transition risks. “For around a decade, investors and banks have been expressing no appetite for exposure to new coal fired generation assets in Australia and investors are unlikely to provide any capital towards new high emission generation assets moving forward,” the IGCC’s letter to Taylor says. “Institutional investors would strongly oppose any policy that indemnifies new generation from current and future carbon risk”. The IGCC also advises the government not to set itself up as the “central planner of generator investment”. It says if the government pursues policies that “effectively nationalise part of the electricity market at short notice” there will be significant impacts on investor confidence and market efficacy. While progressive groups have moved into overdrive at confirmation that coal is in the mix, the lobby group representing Australia’s resources giants has welcomed the government’s move. Tania Constable, the chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, said on Thursday the immediate focus of the underwriting program should be ensuring that investors are able to replace Liddell power station’s capacity “with a technology mix that will maintain reliability and security at the lowest sustainable cost”. Government conservatives are focused on Liddell, and have wanted Taylor to use his much vaunted “big stick” divestiture powers to extract the ageing power plant from AGL, its current owner. AGL plans to retire the plant and replace it with a mix of gas and renewables. But the “big stick” legislation cannot be passed before budget week next year, and it appears to lack the necessary support to clear the Senate. Labor and the Greens are opposed to any taxpayer support for coal projects, and will continue efforts once parliament resumes next year to try to frustrate the Coalition’s program, potentially by attempting to amend the divestiture bill, which stalled in the final sitting week, to include a prohibition on power companies receiving commonwealth support. The MCA said any contracts agreed under the underwriting program needed to be honoured by a future government. The government’s policy document suggests phase one of the underwriting program is anticipated to commence in the first quarter of 2019 – which puts some of the decision making pre-election in the event the government goes to the polls in April. Labor has attempted to warn market participants it does not support taxpayer support for coal projects, but has a policy at the federal level of honouring contracts."
"Pacific countries vulnerable to climate change have urged Australia to abandon coal power generation within 12 years, and to prohibit new coal plants or expansion of existing plants. The call from 15 small Pacific island states came one day after the Australian government called for expressions of interest in new power generation projects, indicating it would be prepared to use taxpayer money to underwrite new coal plants. Leaders warned Australia’s relations in the Pacific were being eroded by a perceived intransigence in Canberra over coalmining. As the COP24 UN climate talks in Poland remained stalled over an unwillingness from major emitters to commit to further carbon emissions cuts, frustrated Pacific states, traditional allies of Australia, said the world must abandon coal-powered energy generation. The Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, the outgoing president of COP23, said: “We call on all OECD countries to quickly phase out their use of coal by 2030 and for all other countries to phase out their use of coal by 2040. There must be no expansion of existing coal mines or the creation of new mines.” Australia and the US have both this week said publicly they have no plans to begin phasing out coal-generated power. “The United States has an abundance of natural resources and is not going to keep them in the ground,” Donald Trump’s international energy and climate adviser, Wells Griffith, told a US-government-run panel discussion on fossil fuels at the UN climate talks. Australia’s ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling, told the same panel: “Fossil fuels are projected to be a major source of energy for a significant time to come.” Asked whether the Pacific declaration on abandoning coal was directed specifically at Australia and the US, Bainimarama was curt but diplomatic: “We request that everybody increases their ambition – that goes for everyone, all countries.” The prime minister of the Cook Islands, Henry Puna, told the Guardian the phase-out of coal was critical to the survival of Pacific island states. “We have made that call,” he said. “It is not directed at any one country, but it applies to all. We know that coal power plants are a significant cause of the climate change we see affecting the whole world.” The Tuvalu prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, cited the Boe Declaration, which Australia signed in Nauru in September, stating that climate change was the single greatest threat to the security and wellbeing of Pacific peoples. “It is unfortunate that we are hearing that Australia might continue to go on coalmining, opening up new mines, [such as] the Adani project [for the Carmichael mine in Queensland],” Sopoaga said. “I was in Canberra last week. I spoke to PM Scott Morrison, and the understanding I got from him was that, yes, they are seriously looking into coal efficiency … and also relooking at the proposal for the Adani project. I said, ‘Prime minister, our partnership onwards, bilateral or regional, in this period of the Boe Declaration, will be centrally influenced by coalmining in Australia and I hope you set a pathway to move away from coalmining and focusing on renewable energy’.” Sopoaga told the Guardian he proposed an annual high-level meeting between Australia and Pacific partners, specifically focused on countering climate change in the region. Bill Hare, director of climate analytics and former Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report lead author, said the Pacific states were right to be concerned about coal. “Their call for an end to coal by 2030 – including new mines – is highly relevant to Australia – their regional neighbour,” Hare said. “The timing is important, just as the government announces plans to underwrite a new coal-fired power station. I hope Australians will listen, even if their government won’t.” The Pacific island states also called for the establishment of an international protection regime to protect people displaced by climate change. While Australia has publicly positioned itself with the United States, representatives from several countries say it has played a constructive role inside the negotiating rooms at the climate talks, where the “rule book” for the implementation of the 2015 Paris agreement is being hammered out. The environment minister, Melissa Price, met the UN secretary general, António Guterres, after the secretary general flew back to Poland, concerned the talks had reached an impasse. A spokesman for the minister said, as a courtesy, she would not be discussing details of her meetings at the COP. Price told the Guardian: “Australia takes a technology-neutral approach to our electricity generation. We are focused on reducing emissions through a range of technologies while maintaining the stability and reliability of our grid and keeping electricity prices down.” But Australia’s schism with the Pacific islands over climate change is a diplomatic discomfort. As China has rapidly increased its involvement and influence across the Pacific through massive infrastructure projects and loans, Australia has sought to buttress its position as the regional hegemon, with a new commitment of $2bn for infrastructure. But its perceived political intransigence on climate, particular its commitment to maintaining, and even expanding, coal power generation, is alienating it from Pacific neighbours – historic allies, many of which are low-lying atoll nations experiencing the effects of climate change most acutely."

"The shadow climate minister Mark Butler has not ruled out using carryover carbon credits from the Kyoto protocol to help Labor meet its more ambitious emissions reduction targets in the event it wins the next election. Butler expressed reluctance about using accounting tricks as part of Labor’s climate policy arsenal, but told the ABC he would not make a decision about whether carryover credits were in or out until after the Paris rule book was established.  The use of carryover credits is one of dozens of technical elements being negotiated at the UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland, where 193 countries have gathered to negotiate the “rule book” for each meeting the emissions reductions targets made three years ago in Paris. The practice of carryover credits allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030. Preliminary documentation from inside the talks, seen by Guardian Australia, suggest that using carryover credits is not going to be prohibited under the rule book for the Paris agreement, meaning countries will be able – and some likely – to do it. “I well understand the objections to this idea of carryover and my bias is to steer clear of cop-outs and accounting tricks,” Butler told the ABC on Thursday. “But we want to look at the final rule book and, in government, get proper advice, not just from government agencies, but talk to climate groups, talk to other stakeholders in the area and make the best decision in the national interest,” he said. Butler said Labor’s commitment, point to point, was reducing carbon emissions by 45% by 2030. This week New Zealand’s climate change minister, James Shaw, said the practice of claiming credits was not in the spirit of the Paris agreement, and “we would discourage any country from using [it]”. He has previously described the practice as “dodgy accounting” and like “trying to have two meals for the price of one”. The Marshall Islands has also raised objections to the use of carryover credits in informal negotiations, but with little support. The Australian Greens are pressuring Labor to take a definitive position. “Labor needs to immediately rule out using any carryover from Kyoto to meet Australia’s international obligations,” said the Greens climate change spokesman, Adam Bandt. “If they refuse, they’ll be profiting from climate denialism and making it harder to stop global warming.” Australia’s environment minister, Melissa Price, who is in Katowice, declined to answer a question from Guardian Australia about whether the government would use carryover credits to meet the Paris targets. “The government is committed to the Paris agreement,” Price said. “Our priority at COP24 is to secure agreement on a comprehensive rule book to guide the implementation of the agreement.” She said the government was confident of meeting the emissions reduction target of 26-28% below 2005 levels “based on our track record of meeting and beating our first and second Kyoto protocol targets”. The Morrison government has dumped an emissions reduction target for electricity, and thus far has not spelled out how it intends to deal with the trend of rising emissions that has been in evidence since the repeal of the carbon price."
"A Trump administration presentation extolling the virtues of fossil fuels at the UN climate talks in Poland has been met with guffaws of laughter and chants of “Shame on you”. Monday’s protest came during a panel discussion by the official US delegation, which used its only public appearance to promote the “unapologetic utilisation” of coal, oil and gas. Although these industries are the main source of the carbon emissions that are causing global warming, the speakers boasted the US would expand production for the sake of global energy security and planned a new fleet of coal plants with technology it hoped to export to other countries. The event featured prominent cheerleaders for fossil fuels and nuclear power, including Wells Griffith, Donald Trump’s adviser on global energy and climate, Steve Winberg, the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the energy department, and Rich Powell, the executive director of the ClearPath Foundation, a non-profit organisation focused on “conservative clean energy”. The only non-American was Patrick Suckling, the ambassador for the environment in Australia’s coal-enthusiast government. None of the US participants mentioned climate change or global warming, focusing instead of “innovation and entrepreneurship” in the technological development of nuclear power, “clean coal” and carbon capture and storage. Ten minutes into Griffith’s opening speech, he was interrupted by a sudden, sustained, loud volley of laughter by several dozen protesters that was then followed by a single shout of “It’s not funny”, and then a series of chants of “Keep it in the ground” and “Shame on you”. Several campaigners read statements. “There is no such thing as clean coal. Coal is deadly from the beginning to the end. They talk about the life cycle of coal, I talk about it as a death march. My father died of black lung, and I am in this struggle with others whose fathers and husbands are dying of black lung right now,” said Teri Blanton of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, which represents Appalachian coal workers in North America. After the protesters were led away by security guards, Griffiths said: “In the US our policy is not to keep it in the ground, but to use it as cleanly and efficiently as possible”. This statement was contradicted by climate analysts, who noted the US environment agency estimates that 1,400 more deaths per year will result from Trump’s proposal to replace the Clean Power Act. “It’s ludicrous for Trump officials to claim that they want to clean up fossil fuels, while dismantling standards that would do just that,” said Dan Lashof, the director of the World Resources Institute. “Since taking office, this administration has proposed to roll back measures to cut methane leaks from oil and gas operations, made it easier for companies to dump coal ash into drinking water, and just days ago proposed easing carbon pollution rules for new coal-fired power plants.” Griffith boasted the US had the largest coal reserves in the world and was producing more petroleum than ever. “To achieve economic growth and eradicate poverty, all energy uses are important and they will be utilised unapologetically,” he said. Echoing a claim often made by Trump, Griffiths said the US would not be subject to agreements that hamstrung domestic growth, while allowing China to operate with high emissions. This was the second consecutive year that the Trump team was heckled after promoting fossil fuels and nuclear power at the climate talks, underscoring how the US position has shifted since the president took power in 2017. The US was a key player in forging the Paris agreement in 2015, but its standing has steadily eroded since. In 2017, Trump announced he would pull the US out of the global accord. This year, his representatives have taken a still more destructive stance by aligning with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to try to downgrade a key report by the world’s scientists that warned of the dangers of global warming moving beyond 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. None of the panelists would be drawn on the study, but Griffith spoke out against “alarmism” that, he claimed, displaced pragmatic solutions to address environmental concerns with prescriptive regulations that put jobs at risk and raised costs for consumers. In fact, scientists say their forecasts about climate impacts have been too conservative, while economists say the shift to renewables has resulted in cheaper energy for many users. Winberg said the US government was planning to support a new fleet of small, modular coal plants that he claimed would be energy-efficient and have near-zero emissions if combined with carbon capture technology. After initial development in the US, he said they could be exported to other countries. “They offer opportunity for developing nations to access tomorrow’s coal technology to improve energy security,” he said. He also proposed more pipelines to oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite this public commitment, the US use of coal is declining because renewables are cheaper, according to Nathaniel Keohane, the senior vice-president for the Environmental Defense Fund nonprofit group. “Trump is playing politics, but it’s not changing the facts on the ground,” he said. “Coal usage in the US just hit a 39-year low. If we really want to protect our economy, we’ll move aggressively toward 100% clean energy.” An alternative, non-official US delegation has backed a faster transition to renewables. Made up of city- and state-level governments, business executives and religious leaders, the “We’re still in” group is staging dozens of events in a bid to show action is still possible without White House support. Nonetheless, many observers at the official US panel were ashamed at the position of their federal government. “I was completely embarrassed to be an American”, said Leo McNeil Woodberry of the Climate Action Network. “Everything they proposed was absolutely wrong. I can’t believe they are putting profits over the planet, and profits over people.”"
"The gilets jaunes movement in France is a leaderless political uprising. It isn’t the first and it won’t be the last. Occupy, the Arab spring and #MeToo are other recent examples of this new politics. Some of it is good. Some of it is not: a leaderless movement, self-organised on Reddit, helped elect Donald Trump. But leaderless movements are spreading, and we need to understand where they come from, what is legitimate action and, if you want to start one, what works and what doesn’t. Leaderless movements spring from frustration with conventional top-down politics, a frustration shared by many The Arab spring began with the self-immolation of one despairing young man in Tunisia; the revolt rapidly spread across the region, just as protests have proliferated in France. In highly connected complex systems, such as the world today, the action of a single agent can suddenly trigger what complexity theorists call a “phase shift” across the entire system. We cannot predict which agent or what event might be that trigger. But we already know that the multiplying connections of our worldoffer an unprecedented opportunity for the rise and spread of leaderless movements. Leaderless movements spring from frustration with conventional top-down politics, a frustration shared by many, not only those on the streets. Polls suggest the gilets jaunes are supported by a large majority of the French public. Who believes that writing to your MP, or signing a petition to No 10 makes any difference to problems such as inequality, the chronic housing shortage or the emerging climate disaster? Even voting feels like a feeble response to these deep-seated problems that are functions not only of government policies but more of the economic system itself. What such movements oppose is usually clear, but what they propose is inevitably less so: that is their nature. The serial popular uprisings of the Arab spring all rejected authoritarian rule, whether in Tunisia, Egypt or Syria. But in most places there was no agreement about what kind of government should replace the dictators. In Eygpt, the Tahrir Square protests failed to create an organised democratic political party that could win an election. Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood, long highly organised and thus prepared for such a moment, stepped into the political vacuum. In turn, this provoked further mass protest, which eventually brought to power another dictatorship as repressive as Hosni Mubarak’s. When the demand is for change in social relations– norms more than laws – such as the end of sexual harassment, the results can be as rapid but also more enduring and positive. The #MeToo movement has provoked questioning of gender relations across the world. The British deputy prime minister, Damian Green, was forced to resign; in India, a cabinet minister. The effects are uneven, and far from universal, but sexual harassers have been outed and ousted from positions of power in the media, NGOs and governments. Some mass action has required leadership. The race discrimination that confronted the US civil rights movement was deeply entrenched in both American society and its laws. Martin Luther King and other leaders paid exquisite attention to strategy, switching tactics according to what worked and what didn’t. King correctly judged, however, that real and lasting equality required the reform of capitalism – a change in the system itself. In a sense, his objective went from the singular to the plural. And that is where his campaign hit the rocks. Momentum dissipated when King started to talk about economic equality: there was no agreement on the diagnosis, or the solution. The Occupy movement faced a similar problem. It succeeded in inserting inequality and economic injustice into the mainstream political conversation – politicians had avoided the topic before. But Occupy couldn’t articulate a specific political programme to reform the system. I was in Zuccotti Park in New York City, where the protest movement began, when the “general assembly” invited the participants to pin notes listing their demands on to trees. Ideas were soon plastered up, from petitioning Washington DC to replacing the dollar – many of which, of course, were irreconcilable with each other. This is why a leaderless response to the climate change disaster is tricky. It’s striking that in Emmanuel Macron’s fuel tax rises the gilets jaunes opposed the very thing demanded by Extinction Rebellion, Britain’s newly minted leaderless movement: aggressive policies to reduce carbon emissions to net zero. Macron’s proposals would have hit the poorest hardest, illustrating that resolving the crises of the environment and inequality requires a more comprehensive, carefully wrought solution to both. But leaderless movements have largely proved incapable of such complicated decision-making, as anyone at Zuccotti Park will attest. Conventional party politicians, reasserting their own claim to legitimacy, insist that such problems can only be arbitrated by imposing more top-down policy. But when most feel powerless about the things that matter, this may only provoke further protests. Ultimately, to address profound systemic challenges, we shall need new participatory and inclusive decision-making structures to negotiate the difficult choices. An example of these forums has emerged in parts of Syria, of all places. Rightly, this is precisely what the Extinction Rebellion is also demanding. Inevitably, leaderless movements face questions about their legitimacy. One answer lies in their methods. The Macron government has exploited the violence seen in Paris and elsewhere to claim that the gilets jaunes movement is illegitimate and anti-democratic. Mahatma Gandhi, and later King, realised that nonviolent action – such as the satyagraha salt march or the Montgomery bus boycott – denies the authorities this line of attack. On the contrary, the violence used by those authorities – the British colonial government or the police of the southern US states – against nonviolent protestors helped build their own legitimacy and attracted global attention. Complexity science tells us something else important. System-wide shifts happen when the system is primed for change, at so-called criticality. In the Middle East there was almost universal anger at the existing political status quo, so it took only one match to light the fire of revolt. Meeting people in colleges and towns across the UK but also in the US (where I lived until recently) you can hear the mounting frustration with a political and economic system that is totally unresponsive to the needs of the 99%, and offers no credible answer to the climate emergency. There will be more leaderless movements to express this frustration, just as there will be more rightwing demagogues, like Trump or Boris Johnson, who seek to exploit it to their own advantage. For the right ones to prevail, we must insist on nonviolence as well as commitment to dialogue with – and not denunciation of – those who disagree. Messily, a new form of politics is upon us, and we must ensure that it peacefully and democratically produces deep systematic reform, not the counter-reaction of the authoritarians. Get ready. • Carne Ross is a former British diplomat and author of The Leaderless Revolution"
"Richard Oswald did not need the latest US government report on the creeping toll of climate change to tell him that farming in the midwest is facing a grim future, and very likely changing forever. For Oswald, the moment of realisation came in 2011.  The 68-year-old lives in the house he was born in and farms 2,500 acres with his son, some of it settled by his great-great-grandfather. The land sits where the Missouri river valley is about four miles wide. Growing up, Oswald heard tales of a great flood in 1952 which prompted the army to construct levees. “The next flood wasn’t for another 40 years, in 1993. Heavy rains day after day after day after day until the runoff water and the rain just overpowered the river and the levees,” said Oswald. “Both the ’52 and ’93 floods lasted three weeks. They were abnormal.” Then came the big Missouri river flood in 2011. “Heavy rains and heavy snow in the Dakotas and Montana created a huge amount of water. That flood lasted here almost four months. More rain than anybody really ever has any memory of coming down the river,” he said. Oswald’s farm was underwater for much of that time and the corn lost. Missouri declared a state of emergency. Crops were ruined or never planted. Grain prices surged. The flooding was memorable in its own right but Oswald also sees it as marking a shift in weather patterns which has forced him to farm differently. “When I was a kid, my dad would say an inch of rain was a good rain. That’s just what we needed. Now we get four inches, five inches, six inches in one sustained wet spell that lasts two or three days. I don’t ever remember that as a boy. I’ve never seen the sustained wetness in the land that we have now. Even though the river hasn’t gone on the land it’s raised the water table so that the rains that we’ve had this fall, which have been unusually heavy, make it muddy. Continually muddy,” he said. On 23 November, the National Climate Assessment warned of “substantial damages” across the US in the coming years from increasing wildfires in the west to flooding in the east. But the sharpest rise in temperatures will be between the coasts as the midwest endures longer and hotter summers, heavier rains and droughts that collectively are predicted to significantly reduce US agricultural production. “Expected increases in challenges to livestock health, declines in crop yields and quality, and changes in extreme events in the United States and abroad threaten rural livelihoods, sustainable food security, and price stability,” said the 1,600-page report, the work of 13 federal agencies. Climate change is likely to make it harder to grow crops, and to make those that do grow more vulnerable to diseases and pests because of rising humidity. The report said heat and diminishing air quality will take its toll on livestock. Farmers will collectively have to spend billions of dollars to adapt. The effects are already seen from prolonged drought in Kansas and torrential rains in Iowa. Before the flood in 2011, Oswald, a Missouri river valley crop farmer, was skeptical about the warnings that rising temperatures heralded a more difficult future. Since then, the routines of planting and harvesting that his family has pursued on the same land for five generations have given way to a haphazard cycle governed by waves of extreme heat and intense rains. “The changes have become more radical. The way the rains come down and the temperatures. You’re constantly trying to manage it,” said Oswald, a former president of the Missouri Farmers Union. “There’s so much unknown about the weather now that it’s pretty hard to do much about it.” As his son, Brandon, works a combine harvester up and down a field, Oswald kicks the soil with his foot. “If you look at this, it’s pretty dry right on top but not too far down it’s mud. Two weeks ago there was water standing here from all the rain and the inability of the soil to absorb that much moisture because the level of the river was such that the water level was pretty close to the top of the ground here,” he said. That mud makes it difficult to plant and to harvest. The rains narrow the number of days when Oswald can get a crop in the ground. If it forces him to delay planting the corn, that means the soybeans will go in late. Worst of all, Oswald said, is that it is all so unpredictable. Where planting was typically spread over the same few days in spring and summer every year, now it can vary by weeks. Gene Takle, one of the authors of the climate change report and director of the climate science programme at Iowa State University, traces the sharply increased rainfalls to rising temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico. He said that for centuries, the gulf’s waters have been carried as moisture into the midwest and delivered consistent rainfalls that made the region America’s breadbasket. But as temperatures have risen so has the amount of moisture in a dome of vapour over the Gulf of Mexico. Takle said that at the same time climate change has moved a pressure centre in the Atlantic, known as the Bermuda high, westwards and closer to a band of low pressure over the Rocky mountains creating higher windspeeds across parts of the midwest. That, in turn, has intensified the flow of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. The result is heavier rains dumping huge amounts of water on to fields, alongside rising temperatures. “Humidity is the the key, the smoking gun, for the increase in our rainfall,” said Takle, a professor of agronomy and of geological and atmospheric sciences. Takle said that heavy rains in 2013 forced farmers in north-western Iowa to abandon planting altogether on more than 700,000 acres, more than 10% of the state’s land. That came a year after Iowa was hit by widespread drought that also hit the crop harvest. Some farmers are installing drainage systems to cope with the higher rainfalls, a sign that they know climate change is here to stay. Others are buying expensive new equipment that allows them to plant more seeds in the narrowing windows between rains. Takle, who grew up on a farm and whose brother still farms in Iowa, said the intense rains have a long-term impact, too. Scientists calculate that dry soil is unable to absorb the water from a rainfall of more than about 1.25in over 24 hours. After that the water starts to erode the soil. “You start to get excess water moving down slope surfaces and carrying with it any nutrients and nitrogen and phosphates or soil particles,” he said. “We’re getting more of the soil erosion promoting rainfalls. Farmers are using cover crops in the spring period to have some some residual vegetation on the surface to protect it from these extreme events.” Standing amid his soybeans, Oswald nods north toward the hills on the edge of the valley. “We farm some upland fields up over that hill a couple of miles,” he said. “They’re rolling hills and they’re terraced. They have structures on them to help control the runoff of the water. But when you have those big rains, none of the terraces or the dams can keep up with that as well as they should. So you have more erosion.” The size of harvests is already falling. This year, heavy rains have hit soya bean crops, delaying planting or washing out the plants in parts of the midwest, including Iowa. Alongside the rains are increasing temperatures. “This year we saw 100-degree temperatures in May which is very unusual,” said Oswald. “I don’t ever remember that in my lifetime or even heard about it. That’s a first ever.” The Missouri Climate Center recorded that temperatures were above average throughout the spring and summer this year, with September on average 3F warmer than during the 20th century In the short term, higher temperatures have had some benefit because in parts of the region they extended the growing season and contributed to bigger harvests. “In the midwest we have about nine days more now than we did 50 years ago,” said Takle. “Part of the increase in yields that we’ve been experiencing over the last 20 or 30 years definitely has been due to the earlier planting and the longer growing season.” But Takle said those benefits are being lost, and will be reversed in the coming years, as rising temperatures combine with the heavy rains to make growing ever more difficult. He said corn is vulnerable to high temperatures during pollination. A decade ago, Oswald was on the fence about climate change. “At a certain point you just have to look at what’s going on in your own world and try to decide what you think the impacts of that are,” he said. As Oswald’s thinking changed, so did his determination to persuade others of the reality of climate change. As president of the Missouri Farmers union, he had some success in getting a discussion going among its members. But he said climate change is politically charged among farmers in part because some see it as a stick to beat them over their practices. “One of the problems farmers have is when we start talking about environment, a lot of times Sierra Club comes to mind and Sierra Club is pretty radical in their approach. When you have a group that says cows are the problem, you need to get rid of all the cows, and raising corn is a problem, we need to get rid of all the corn, then you’re not going to have a lot of farmers who want to join in and follow you,” he said. Still, Oswald believes that denial is in retreat. Where farmers, including him, were once skeptical they now see the change with their own eyes. The problem is what to do about it. “A lot of them will say there’s nothing we can do about it so we might as well not worry because we can’t have an impact, we just have to live with it,” he said. But he said as climate change bites, farmers are increasingly accepting of the science as they are forced to spend more money on equipment and seeds to maintain current crop yields. “It’s become almost an annual assault on their ability to produce good crops. So they are now starting to ask questions and I think are listening a little more to what the scientists are saying about the potential future.”"
"Displays of coal jewellery and coal soap, coal in a glass walkway beneath your feet, coal in the air that you breathe … the Polish hosts of this week’s UN climate talks have been anything but subtle in reminding delegates that we still live in a fossil-fuelled world despite the urgent necessity to move to a cleaner path. The conference centre is near the mineshaft of the colliery museum in Katowice, the heartland of Silesia’s vast coal industry. The sponsors include JSW, the EU’s largest coking coal producer, and PGE, which runs the world’s second-largest fossil-fuel power plant.  If that were not enough, the summit host, President Andrzej Duda, opened the summit with a boast that his country was sitting on 200 years’ worth of coal supplies and “it will be hard not to use them”. To underscore that intention, PGG, the state-owned thermal coal producer, announced plans during the summit for a new $400m (£320m) shaft at Imielin, 12 miles from Katowice. Yet for all of this, the single clearest fact that has emerged from this conference is that the world must break from this dirtiest of carbon fuels if we are to have any chance of avoiding dangerous levels of climate disruption. “We are seeing a coal renaissance. This is disastrous,” said Ottmar Edenhofer, the deputy director at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “We are really at risk. It is not enough to pray. We have to do something.” It is not just Poland. Coal is on the rise in Japan, Indonesia, India, Vietnam and Russia. In China, the world’s biggest producer, output has increased after several years of declines. Planned new coal investments in the world would add 330 gigatonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere, Edenhofer said. Added to existing infrastructure, this would use up all of the world’s remaining carbon budget under the Paris agreement. “If we continue with these investments we close the door to 2C,” he said, referring to the world’s least ambitious climate target. But there are signs of change. Campaigners are accelerating efforts to halt expansion plans – which lock in consumption for decades – and gradually replace existing collieries with alternative green energies, such as wind and solar. This is even happening in the host country. This week, 17 Polish cities joined a zero-carbon coalition. A proposal to phase out coal by 2030 has the support of 69% of Poles, according to a survey last month by Greenpeace. There is also increasing awareness about the true costs of coal, which have long been off the books. Thirty-six of the 50 most polluted cities in the EU are in Poland, mostly in the Silesian region, where visitors can smell the sulphur in the air as they arrive at the airport. Numerous studies have shown the dire health impacts, including an estimated 47,500 premature deaths. This has promoted a growing anti-smog movement. Climate impacts are also becoming more apparent. Poland suffered heatwaves and droughts this year that reduced harvests and impeded the country’s ability to feed itself. With the cost of coal likely to rise, Poland is investing heavily in renewables. Wind power, in particular, has risen sharply in the past two decades. The old jobs are now less attractive. “In the socialist era, the coalminer was a working-class hero, but young people don’t want to work in the mines. The pay is not so good compared with jobs in other EU countries,” said Irma Allen, an anthropologist writing a PhD on coal communities at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. “Life with coal is now radically different than it was 20 to 30 years ago The costs now outweigh the benefits.” Easing the pain of transition is a vital political task, say campaigners. Many pits were closed in the 1990s, destroying communities and leaving some laid-off miners’ families so poor they have to scavenge for coal to heat their homes. Pessimism is rife. Miners are not intrinsically anti-environment, says Allen, but their futures are insecure. “If people were offered an alternative vision of what the region could be, they might be more hopeful,” she said. “But they saw what happened with Thatcher in Britain in the 1980s and fear the same will happen here.” Katowice has partly filled the gap by reinventing itself as a cultural centre, conference hub and university city, but the pushback has been fierce from the left and right of the old economy. The Solidarity union, which represents tens of thousands of Polish miners, has joined with the rightwing US lobby group, the Heartland Institute to dispute the science of climate change. The conservative Duda claims coal is Poland’s gift from God and made keeping pits open a question of national sovereignty. “This plays to the ultra-nationalist discourse in Poland and elsewhere, but it’s hypocritical,” said Ido Liven, of the CEE Bankwatch Network, one of the biggest environmental groups in eastern Europe. “The Polish president talks about coal as a national treasure yet imports are increasing. Close to 60% of imported coal is from Russia.” Politicians who have tried to introduce changes are struggling, says Mateusz Klinowski, the former mayor of Wadowice, the birthplace of Pope John Paul II. He lost office in an election this year after trying to cut pollution and wean the city off coal. “I thought it was enough to build support from the bottom up; to show the facts on health, to talk about pollution, about the morality of change, but it didn’t work. It’s because people are told on TV that coal is a treasure,” said Klinowski. “But even if I tell them the planet is dying and I will give them 50% of the the cost of a new heating system, they think it’s just green bullshit and not necessary. We need to change the state government and do it at the top level.” The economics are moving in a different direction from the politics. The World Bank and other large international finance institutions are withdrawing from coal investments. Insurance companies are also pulling out. Poland’s neighbours – Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – have taken strides to cut coal subsidies and bring forward a phase-out date. Elsewhere in the world, there are strong signs the coal renaissance is winding down. The UK has rapidly switched from coal to renewables with the help of a carbon tax on power supplies. Despite Donald Trump’s rhetoric, coal is plunging in the US. Germany, the biggest coal user in Europe, will conduct a review of its dependency next year that is expected to prompt a radical shift in policy. India is also building so much solar that some believe it may never need to commission another coal plant. These moves prove the renaissance of coal can be stifled, say academics, businessmen and campaigners, but it needs to be done more quickly – and the main obstacle is at the top. Adair Turner, of the Just Transition Partnership, said it was possible to build a zero-carbon economy by 2060 at a cost of just half a percent of GDP. “With the technology and the economy I am more confident than I was three years ago, but I’m now less confident about the politics,” he said. “If we don’t get there, it will be because of special interests.”"
