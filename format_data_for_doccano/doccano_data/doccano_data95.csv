"Recently the Guardian has featured a back and forth about Ecomodernism. Ecomodernism holds that not only are humans driving the future of our world, but through technology can decouple our future from natural ecosystems. In this process the world would turn into urban enclaves surrounded by mechanically farmed agricultural lands and islands reserved for nature. It is a vision of naive young urban professionals.  George Monbiot touched on some of the practical problems of Ecomodernism and this paper published a response from the proponents. In the words of Mark Lynas, one of the authors of their manifesto, the British launch of Ecomodernism turned into “a screw up of epic proportions” used by Owen Patterson to bash environmentalists of all stripes. To date, the discussion about Ecomodernism has been based on considerations of practicality, but there are hidden depths which lead me to oppose this program on all levels.   When I was a young, being civilized by my teachers, there were two dystopian models of instruction used to warn against the future: George Orwell’s 1984, and and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. 1984 is a dark vision of perpetual war and oppression with obvious roots in Stalinism and Nazi Germany, a war just fought and a cold war starting, both with the potential of destroying the world. Marxists, particularly Stalin and Mao discovered industrial marxism and their many attempts to control nature produced only disasters. Their heavy handed attempts to create technology produced contaminated industrial wastelands.  Brave New World is an exercise in Paradise Engineering and the best illustration we have to the darker implications of the Ecomodernist Manifesto. Ecomodernism revives the faith in technology of the late 19th and early 20th century, an optimism that found expression in our growing ability to shape the world coupled with hubris and belief that nature has nothing necessary to offer us.  The Ecomodernist Manifesto sees progress as a decoupling humanity from nature using technology as in Huxley’s vision. While one can quibble for or against the specific technologies that the Ecomodernists favor, one should first seriously consider the implications for the organization of society which make the Brave New World a model for how an Ecomodernist society must be organized to function.  Ecomodernism postulates movement of population to large cities, industrialization of agriculture and the isolation of areas for nature. There is no room for enjoyment of hunting and fishing, botanizing and birdwatching. There is no understanding of the ecological services that nature offers us and without which we could not survive. No backyards to grill in and mow, but all must move into the megopolis. No place for wild pollinators. It is not that we do not know where that vision leads, and we even have examples today of nations that are essentially single cities such as Singapore moving in that direction.  Huxley’s brave new world was based on genetically engineered social classes with the Alphas at the top and the Deltas and Epsilons at the bottom collecting the garbage and providing other services. Today’s city states and those of the Ecomodernists require vast numbers of Deltas and Epsilons to support the Alphas. They are ancient Greek city states with a small number of citizens benefiting from the labor of a large number of contract workers many on temporary visas. If you are an alpha, it is a good deal, if not, maybe not so much.  The reliance of the Ecomodernist city state on complex technologies requires strong central control to keep the machine running, leaving little room for individuality. City states may occupy not much land, but they require a great deal of land and resources from that land to provide all that the people living in them need. Urban organization and governance is complex. As a friend points out, the Ecomodern city state requires a social monoculture with no room for dissent and that monoculture is enforced by the power of the state. The brave new world of Ecomodernism will be a very uncomfortable fit to many Ecomodernists’ dreams. Josh Halpern blogs and tweets as Eli Rabett"
"The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has raised China’s human rights record and the impact of its imports on the UK steel industry at a meeting at Buckingham Palace with President Xi Jinping, which the party described as “cordial and constructive”. A statement from Labour following Corbyn’s meeting stressed the good nature of the exchange, and praised “the remarkable Chinese achievements in poverty-reduction, lifting over 600 million people out of poverty”. Discussion between Corbyn and Xi also ranged over historic links between the UK, Labour and China, the sacrifice of the Chinese people in the struggle against fascism during the second world war, and Xi’s New Silk Road strategy. They then spoke about working together to address major threats to world security such as climate change, persistent economic inequality and international terrorism, as well as opportunities to upgrade cultural and people-to-people exchanges between China and the UK. At the end, the statement said Corbyn “also raised the issues of human rights and the impact of Chinese imports on the UK steel industry”. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has revealed that Corbyn’s concerns for the steel industry were put in a letter, which was expected to be handed over the Chinese president. The timing of the meeting at 6pm on Tuesday meant the Labour leader had a chance to mention human rights and the steel industry before David Cameron, who is expected to raise both of those topics in bilateral talks at Downing Street on Wednesday. Corbyn will be attending the state banquet held in Xi’s honour at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday night, despite being a republican. Earlier, the Labour leader listened to Xi address MPs and peers in the Palace of Westminster, at which he had to sit awkwardly next to Cameron."

"A climate change deal to be agreed in Paris in December will not be able to come up with a global carbon price, the United Nations’ climate chief, Christiana Figueres, said on Tuesday.  Big multinational companies and investors, and most recently oil majors, have called for a global carbon price to help spur investments in low-carbon energy.   A global carbon price would help to create an incentive for operators of power plants and factories to switch to cleaner fuels such as gas or to buy more energy-efficient equipment.  When the European Union launched a carbon trading scheme in 2005 there were expectations this would eventually lead to a global carbon scheme by 2020 worth around $2 trillion.  But the difficulties of bringing together different carbon schemes from countries around the world means the goal of a global carbon price remains elusive.  “[Many have said] we need a carbon price and [investment] would be so much easier with a carbon price, but life is much more complex than that,” Figueres told a climate investor event in London.  “I agree it would be more simple ... but it’s not quite what we will have,” she said, adding that the world would move towards that in the future.  Figueres said six jurisdictions around the world already have a carbon price or carbon pricing mechanism such as a tax. “I would argue we already have a strong carbon price signal,” she said.  Countries are due to meet in Paris from November 30 to December 11 to agree on a global deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change.  This month, the leaders of 10 companies that produce 20% of the world’s oil and gas recognised that current greenhouse gas levels were inconsistent with a goal of limiting global warming to 2C over pre-industrial times. But they stopped short of outlining goals to cut their own emissions. "
"A new study published in Nature by scientists at Stanford and UC Berkeley has made waves for its finding that thus far we have dramatically underestimated the damage human-caused climate change will do to the global economy. By looking at data from 160 countries across the 50-year period from 1960 to 2010, the authors found that an average local temperature of 13°C (55°F) is economically optimal, particularly for agricultural productivity. That temperature roughly reflects the current climate in many wealthy countries like the USA, Japan, France, and China.  If regional temperatures are cooler, then warming benefits the local economy, but past that peak temperature, warming reduces economic productivity. The robustness of this result is particularly interesting. The study found that it held true for both rich and poor countries, and that the relationship held for both the 1960–1989 and 1990–2010 time frames.  To date, economists had believed that global warming would not impact economic growth in wealthy countries, because it was assumed they would have the resources to adapt to a changing climate. However, looking at data over the past half century, the authors found that wealthy countries have been nearly as vulnerable to temperatures warming beyond 13°C as poorer countries. We find only weak suggestive evidence that richer populations are less vulnerable to warming, and no evidence that experience with high temperatures or technological advances since 1960 have altered the global response to temperature. This suggests that adaptation to climatic change may be more difficult than previously believed, and that the accumulation of wealth, technology and experience might not substantially mitigate global economic losses during this century. The study finds that if we continue on a business-as-usual path of high fossil fuel consumption and carbon pollution, 77% of countries will be poorer in 2100 than they would be in a world in which we curb global warming. Some countries (5–43% of the world’s nations) might even be poorer in 2100 than they are today as a result. The news isn’t all bad. Some colder countries like Canada and Russia will see economic benefits from global warming. However, most of their trade partners will be experiencing slowed economic growth at the same time.  Moreover, the countries with hot climates whose economic productivity will take a particularly hard hit from further global warming tend to already be poor, in regions like Africa, southeast Asia, and South America. This reinforces the unfortunate reality that poorer countries, which contribute the least to the problem, are the most vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), which combine climate and economic modeling, are our best tools for estimating the economic impacts of climate change. However, these models essentially assume that economic growth will continue regardless of climate change.  A study published earlier this year by Stanford economists Frances Moore and Delavane Diaz concluded that continued global warming will significantly slow economic growth in poorer countries. Their paper concluded that the ‘social cost of carbon’ – the dollar amount that carbon pollution costs us via climate damages – is between about $70 and $400, with a best estimate of over $200 per ton. This is a higher cost than IAMs currently yield, with best estimates generally at $100 per ton or less. Professor Marshall Burke, lead author of this new study, says that his team is still working out how their results will impact estimates of the social cost of carbon. However, because their study finds that continued global warming will hurt economic growth in both poor and wealthy countries, Burke believes that it will yield an even higher social cost of carbon estimate than in the Moore & Diaz study.  As their paper notes, they are also likely underestimating the economic costs of climate change by focusing on temperature impacts, excluding other factors like sea level rise. the slope of the damage function is large even for slight warming, generating expected costs of climate change 2.5–100 times larger than prior estimates for 2°C warming, and at least 2.5 times larger for higher temperatures. Notably, our estimates are based only on temperature effects (or effects for which historical temperature has been a proxy), and so do not include other potential sources of economic loss associated with climate change, such as tropical cyclones or sea-level rise As Professor Burke told me, [Economists] have significantly underestimated the potential for very negative climate impacts on the global economy. It is just really hard to see how the damage functions in the IAMs are consistent with historical experience.  Basic economics suggests that markets should include a price on carbon pollution that reflects our best estimates of the social cost of carbon. Carbon pollution creates costs that societies pay via climate damages and reduced economic productivity, but if the market doesn’t reflect those costs, consumers can’t make informed purchasing decisions. Economists call this an ‘externality’ and a ‘market failure,’ which Economics 101 says should be remedied by putting a price on carbon pollution. Crucially, this is a point on which even contrarian economists agree. There is a consensus among economists that there should be a price on carbon pollution. One economist who is an advisor to the anti-climate policy Global Warming Policy Foundation concluded in a recent working paper, The optimal carbon tax in the near term is somewhere between a few tens and a few hundreds of dollars per tonne of carbon. Even chief executives of many of the world’s biggest oil companies have called for a global carbon pollution pricing system. Exxon Mobil, the world’s largest oil company and the second-most profitable company in the world, has explicitly called for a revenue-neutral carbon tax. As this new study shows, the economic impacts of global warming are likely even bigger than previously realized, and the need for carbon pollution pricing even greater."
"President Obama met with executives at a roundtable at the White House on Monday, as part of his efforts to enlist corporate America in the push for an international climate change agreement. White House officials said 81 companies have signed on to the American Business Act on Climate pledge, an addition of 68 since the White House unveiled the pledge in June.  “The perception is that this is an environmental issue, it’s for tree huggers, and hardheaded business people either don’t care about it, or see it as a conflict with their bottom lines,” Obama said. “Considerations of climate change, energy efficiency, renewable energies are not only not contradictory to their bottom lines, but for these companies they are discovering that they can enhance their bottom lines.” By signing on, the companies promise to advocate for a strong climate deal ahead of final negotiations in Paris next month. They also agree to take steps to reduce their own carbon emissions. The White House said companies that signed the deal include Intel, Coca-Cola, Monsanto, Google and Walmart. Todd Brady, global environmental director at Intel, said the administration’s drive had given companies the push needed to deepen already existing climate efforts. “Our pledge is a combination of both actions that are continuing, and new steps,” he said. “It has caused us to step back and take a look at the steps we are taking and say maybe we should be doing more.”"

"Governments working on the proposed new global deal on climate change, to be agreed this December, must step up their efforts after a slow week of talks produced little progress, observers have said. In December, governments will meet in Paris to decide a new global agreement on greenhouse gas emissions, which would kick in from 2020 when current international commitments on emissions expire.  This week, officials have been meeting in Bonn to hammer out some of the final details of such a deal. However, progress has been slow and the talks – the final official negotiating days before Paris – ended without a clear conclusion. The draft text of an agreement went from about 20 pages to more than 30 pages in the course of the week, despite French hopes that it could be slimmed down. Disagreements emerged over key issues such as the financial assistance from rich countries to poorer ones to help them cut emissions and cope with the effects of global warming. Before Paris, ministers will meet again formally, and there will be informal discussions among countries to smooth out differences. There were no major catastrophes in Bonn – no countries walked out or publicly said they would not agree to a deal in Paris. Previous UN climate meetings have often been marred by such disagreements. For these reasons, the French hosts are still hopeful that an agreement will be reached in Paris, but the discussions must be stepped up and world leaders may need to intervene to ensure their negotiators are willing to forge a deal. Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate programme at the World Resources Institute, said: “Negotiators made some significant strides in Bonn but a much more vigorous pace is needed to secure a strong climate agreement in just a few weeks. We’ve been running a marathon for years to reach this point. Now we need an all-out sprint to get over the finish line in Paris.” She said the draft text showed countries were close to reaching consensus on issues such as cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and the transparency needed for international monitoring of such efforts. However, she said, the issue of financial assistance to the poor was still showing “more fundamental differences”. More than 150 countries have now submitted plans on limiting their greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2020, when current commitments expire. These commitments cover about 90% of the global economy, and if followed through should lead to global warming of no more than 2.7C, according to analysis, which still falls short of the 2C limit that scientists say gives the world an even chance of avoiding catastrophic and irreversible warming. Martin Kaiser, of Greenpeace, called for countries to speed up the negotiating process. “This process is too important to be a high-risk poker game. They need to put down their cards and play together as a team.” Recent analyses have shown that the financial assistance agreed for developing countries by 2020 is achievable. At the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, at which the biggest developed and developing countries jointly agreed for the first time to limit their emissions by 2020, a package of financial assistance to be worth $100bn a year by 2020 for poor countries was agreed. Developing nations want it to be restated that they will receive this, as a precondition of any deal in Paris. The OECD has said that on current funding levels, that figure is likely to be met by the 2020 deadline."
"Onshore wind and large solar farms are likely to be competitive on cost with gas-fired power generation by the end of this decade, according to the government’s climate change advisers, but only if gas pays its fair share through a carbon price. In order to meet these expectations, investors must gear up in the next few years to put new money into all low-carbon sectors, and government must give them the policy signals they need in order to do so, said Matthew Bell, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change. Lord Deben, chair of the committee, added: “The 2020s are crucial in setting the direction for UK power generation, and to ensure the UK can meet its 2050 climate change commitments cost-effectively. The key tools are already in place to deliver the investment in low-carbon generation that is required. “The government must now urgently clarify the direction of future policy to ensure the power sector can decarbonise at lowest cost to businesses and households.” While onshore wind and ground-mounted solar projects are regarded as mature technologies, these industries have been shaken up by major changes to the support regimes in place for them, by changes to the planning environment, and by negative comments from ministers. Several solar power companies have recently gone bust or fear financial trouble, with job losses already topping 1,000. Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate Group, which represents business and campaigns for a greener economy, said the UK’s low-carbon policies had led to the growth of a green sector now worth £122bn and employing 460,000 people.  But, he added, many key support policies, on issues such as low-carbon heating and low emission vehicles, were due to expire within this parliament. “The low carbon sector is now at a crossroads, with urgent clarity needed on the funds available to support investment in low-carbon power stations in the 2020s and the support mechanisms that will help improve the efficiency of the UK’s building stock.” Simon Bullock, senior energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The government’s own advisers say it will be cheaper to use low-carbon electricity rather than gas to power our economy in the 2020s. Ministers should be championing the UK renewable sector, instead of strangling the life out of solar and onshore wind, threatening tens of thousands of jobs and pushing up bills in the future.”  Offshore wind and other low-carbon technologies such as carbon capture and storage will still need significant support in the early 2020s, the Committee on Climate Change said, in an advisory report that precedes its statutory report to come on 26 November. That report will carry the full weight of the committee’s authority, which under the Climate Change Act is to propose carbon budgets more than ten years into the future, and assess whether governments are meeting them through their policies. Thursday’s report predicted that the full cost of new gas-fired generation would reach £85 per MWh for new plants coming online in 2020, and £95MWh for 2025, including the likely cost of carbon. This compares with onshore wind and ground-mounted solar projects that are under contract to deliver electricity at £83MWh from 2016-17. However, these prices rise by about £10 per MWh if the intermittency of the renewables is taken into account. Household energy bills will continue to rise, the committee predicted, beyond 2020. The impact of low-carbon investment on bills is likely to increase from about £105 a year in 2020 to about £120 a year by 2030. Luke Warren, chief executive of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, called on the government to fulfil its promise of two pioneering CCS projects. “As the date for the comprehensive spending review approaches, we urge the government to deliver on the outcome of the CCS competition, to ensure CCS can become cost-competitive with other low-carbon technologies in the 2020s.” In its report, Power Sector Scenarios for the Fifth Carbon Budget, the committee suggested the carbon price for gas-fired generation should reach £78 a tonne in 2030. It noted: “Low-carbon technologies are, and in the 2020s will continue to be, a more expensive way to generate electricity than burning gas and allowing the emissions to enter the atmosphere for free. However, in a carbon-constrained world this is not an option. A carbon price that reflects the full cost of emissions would increase the cost of gas-fired generation to a level at or above the cost of some low-carbon options.” Carbon pricing is one of the factors that has been blamed for recent closures in the British steel industry, as critics say high energy costs make the sector less competitive. Molho argued that a clear policy framework could help such sectors. “In setting out future policies to support investment in low-carbon infrastructure, cut its cost and deliver supply chain benefits, the government should also provide support to energy-intensive industries at risk of competitiveness impacts, to ensure they can play a role in the UK’s future low-carbon energy supply chain.”"
"I’m well aware that with Paris looming it’s time to be hopeful, and I’m willing to try. Even amid the record heat and flooding of the present, there are good signs for the future in the rising climate movement and the falling cost of solar. But before we get to past and present there’s some past to be reckoned with, and before we get to hope there’s some deep, blood-red anger.   In the last three weeks, two separate teams of journalists — the Pulitzer-prize winning reporters at the website Inside Climate News and another crew composed of Los Angeles Times veterans and up-and-comers at the Columbia Journalism School — have begun publishing the results of a pair of independent investigations into ExxonMobil.  Though they draw on completely different archives, leaked documents, and interviews with ex-employees, they reach the same damning conclusion: Exxon knew all that there was to know about climate change decades ago, and instead of alerting the rest of us denied the science and obstructed the politics of global warming. To be specific:  But of course Exxon did dispute that fact. Not inside the company, where they used their knowledge to buy oil leases in the areas they knew would melt, but outside, where they used their political and financial might to make sure no one took climate change seriously.  They helped organise campaigns designed to instil doubt, borrowing tactics and personnel from the tobacco industry’s similar fight. They funded “institutes” devoted to outright climate denial. And at the highest levels they did all they could to spread their lies.   To understand the treachery – the sheer, profound, and I think unparalleled evil – of Exxon, one must remember the timing. Global warming became a public topic in 1988, thanks to Nasa scientist James Hansen – it’s taken a quarter-century and counting for the world to take effective action. If at any point in that journey Exxon – largest oil company on Earth, most profitable enterprise in human history – had said: “Our own research shows that these scientists are right and that we are in a dangerous place,” the faux debate would effectively have ended. That’s all it would have taken; stripped of the cover provided by doubt, humanity would have gotten to work.   Instead, knowingly, they helped organise the most consequential lie in human history, and kept that lie going past the point where we can protect the poles, prevent the acidification of the oceans, or slow sea level rise enough to save the most vulnerable regions and cultures. Businesses misbehave all the time, but VW is the flea to Exxon’s elephant. No corporation has ever done anything this big and this bad.  I’m aware that anger at this point does little good. I’m aware that all clever people will say “of course they did” or “we all use fossil fuels”, as if either claim is meaningful. I’m aware that nothing much will happen to Exxon – I doubt they’ll be tried in court, or their executives sent to jail.  But nonetheless it seems crucial simply to say, for the record, the truth: this company had the singular capacity to change the course of world history for the better and instead it changed that course for the infinitely worse. In its greed Exxon helped — more than any other institution — to kill our planet."

"When the world finally agrees to constrain the fossil fuel coming out of the ground, one result will be a price on carbon. Whether this comes about through a universal carbon tax or through a global carbon cap and trade system, the effect will be an additional cost that will be passed up the supply chains of all goods and services and reflected in the purchasers’ price.  So let’s have a look at what a price of $100 per tonne of carbon dioxide might mean for both consumers and businesses. We can argue about the exact carbon price the world needs in order for enough fuel to stay in the ground, but $100 (£65) is probably in the right ballpark; even though this is somewhat higher than most businesses are currently contemplating. Based on a decade or so of analysing the carbon footprint of products and business supply chains, here are some rough estimates of how some specific prices might change in response. A kilo of local seasonal vegetables might incur a price rise of around 4p whereas the same weight of asparagus, air-freighted out of season from Peru, would be more likely to go up by about £1.  Meanwhile the cost of a small petrol car might go up by around £500 while a heavy four-wheel drive would end up rising in price by £2,500. And the cost of the fuel to drive them would probably go up by about 22p per litre (once you take account of both the direct emissions from burning it and those from taking it out of the ground, refining it and transporting it to the pump). I estimate that a laptop might cost between £10 and £60 more, depending on its features and the carbon efficiency of the manufacturing supply chains.  All these costs are significant and provide incentives for low carbon choices without absolutely precluding high carbon habits. Since, in round numbers, the carbon footprint of the average UK person is about 10 tonnes per year, the carbon price would track through to about $1,000 (£650) of additional costs per year on average (for simplicity I’ve left out the other greenhouse gases and only include carbon dioxide). But the effect on each of us would depend on our own buying choices. Before assuming that everyone will be worse off, remember that the £100bn or so revenue from a $100 carbon price would be about enough to enable a cut in the basic rate of VAT from 20% to the EU legal minimum of 15%. And if that were done, the carbon price could, overall, enable a hefty rise in standard of living for anyone prepared to follow the new price signals guiding them towards a more sustainable lifestyle.  Turning to the effect on businesses, while fossil fuel companies have long been keenly aware of the commercial threat from a global move to leave the fuel in the ground, companies that want to get more use from less carbon will see huge opportunities. Within any competitive market for a product or service, those with the cleanest supply chains will also have the advantage.  Since it typically takes a few years for a business to clean up its supply chains, if the carbon price is coming, it might be commercially smart to start the clean up now. This is probably why the CDP (formally Carbon Disclosure Project) supply chain membership forum is experiencing such rapid growth.  To give one example of how supply chains might change, a few years ago my company did a study for a house builder, looking at the carbon and energy footprint of different construction types to understand what proportion of the build cost could be tracked back to energy in the supply chains. At that time, energy accounted for just 13% of the build cost and since a timber frame (which has a lower carbon intensity) was slightly more expensive than bricks and blocks it didn’t make straightforward financial sense to switch across. The introduction of a carbon price changes the whole equation. A carbon price will make it automatic for shoppers to factor the carbon into their buying choices, without having to be knowledgeable about the mysterious world of carbon footprints. High carbon choices will still be possible for us all but we will have to want them more.  Most of us should be able to feel better off provided governments recycle the revenue from carbon taxes in ways that counterbalance the cost burdens for the person on the street, and provided we allow the new pricing to guide us gently towards to lower carbon habits.  For business, the winners will be those whose products enable more utility for less carbon and those who take action ahead of time to sort out their supply chains. This includes all businesses that deliver efficiency and innovation and those whose business models allow for longevity of products.  When it comes to like-for-like products, those with the cleanest supply chains will have the edge – so if you think that world might be coming soon, right now would be very good time to take action."

"Malcolm Turnbull had two possible political weak spots when he became prime minister, which left Labor with two strategic choices. They picked the wrong one.  The first was the weakness that brought Turnbull unstuck the first time he was Liberal leader – an impetuousness, a perceived arrogance which, in the minds of Labor strategists, could be morphed and moulded into the charge the new prime minister is out of touch with the lives of ordinary voters because he is rich, that he lives in a universe where normal people’s rules don’t apply. The second was the dilemma evident from the moment Turnbull took charge. The public liked him because he seemed different, but his colleagues voted for him because in key policy areas he promised to be pretty much the same. Despite some strong internal dissent, after a half-hearted initial foray on the policy front, Labor began its efforts to take the “gloss” off Turnbull by attacking the man, rather than his obvious policy dilemmas. It readily conceded it had no evidence of wrongdoing or illegality, but spent a week targeting Turnbull’s investments in offshore managed funds registered in the Cayman Islands. The point was to paint the new prime minister as “not one of us”, because “we” don’t have a lazy million to pop into a Cayman Islands investment fund. Turnbull himself called out the real attack by week’s end – that he was rich. Some Labor strategists continue to insist in the long term, and despite what they complain is the press gallery’s “starry-eyed” position on Turnbull, this was a good idea – that in the minds of voters anything registered in the Cayman Islands equates to dodgy. But two clear indicators suggest otherwise, and other senior Labor figures concede this. One is Monday’s Fairfax Ipsos poll, which showed both the Coalition’s two-party-preferred vote and Turnbull’s personal popularity soaring. It’s just one poll, and we need a few more to ascertain a clear trend, but the general direction of the major parties’ fortunes is obvious. The other is Labor has now dropped the Cayman Islands attack.  Instead it used question time on Monday to demand the Coalition back Labor policies on things such as higher education, multinational tax regulation and tax breaks for high income earners’ superannuation, most of which Turnbull swatted off.  Some questions he deflected to treasurer Scott Morrison, who largely stuck to the former Abbott government’s script – for example, trotting out the increases in commonwealth spending on health and education instead of answering a question about the $80bn cut from forward projections in the Abbott government’s first budget. Others he deflected to environment minister Greg Hunt, who managed to skate past a question about whether any industrial emitters will have to reduce their greenhouse pollution by launching an extraordinary attack on the reputation of an analytical firm. But since he has asked for rational, evidence-based policy debate, things get harder for Turnbull the deeper the opposition dives into policy. It would be difficult, for example, for him to explain how his own climate policy could possibly meet Australia’s greenhouse targets, if he could be forced to take the question. Or why he is continuing with a legally unnecessary plebiscite on marriage equality he previously argued against. Or how he can justify a water policy that does not take into account the impact of climate change on long-term water availability. Or how it makes sense for ministers to hypothecate a specific unpalatable budget cut with possible new spending when everyone knows there are many options available to reduce spending. Turnbull has changed the tone of the political debate quite quickly, and in a way Australians seem to like. That meant Labor’s Caymans attack jarred and looked all the more tawdry by comparison with the new prime minister’s reasonableness. But it will take him longer to change some of the Coalition’s policy substance, with the wary Liberal conservatives and National party hovering as a constant constraint. If Labor targets these policy dilemmas, Turnbull’s own promise of rational debate might finally force him to answer in uncomfortable detail. "
"The world faces a looming and potentially calamitous “cold crunch”, with demand for air conditioning and refrigeration growing so fast that it threatens to smash pledges and targets for global warming. Worldwide power consumption for air conditioning alone is forecast to surge 33-fold by 2100 as developing world incomes rise and urbanisation advances. Already, the US uses as much electricity to keep buildings cool as the whole of Africa uses on everything; China and India are fast catching up. By mid-century people will use more energy for cooling than heating. And since cold is still overwhelmingly produced by burning fossil fuels, emission targets agreed at next month’s international climate summit in Paris risk being blown away as governments and scientists struggle with a cruel climate-change irony: cooling makes the planet hotter. “Most people tend to think of energy in terms of heat and light and transport,” said Toby Peters, visiting professor of power and the cold economy at the University of Birmingham. “But more and more, it’s going to be about cold. Demand for cold is already huge, it’s growing fast, and we’re meeting it in basically the same way we’ve been doing for a century. Cold is the Cinderella of the energy debate. If we don’t change the way we do it, the consequences are going to be dramatic.” Artificial cold is a recent phenomenon: the first domestic air-conditioning unit appeared in 1914, the first home fridges in 1930. As late as 1965, only a third of UK homes had one.  But cold has quietly become a part of 21st-century life, certainly in advanced economies: people expect air conditioning to make homes, offices and cars comfortable (and many cities habitable); most food in the developed world is chilled or frozen; medicines, including vaccines, need refrigeration; industries such as steel, chemicals and plastics depend on cooling; deprived of cold, data centres – and the internet – would collapse in minutes.  “Heat we know, and we talk about it no end,” said Nick Winser, a former head of Britain’s National Grid who chairs the Energy Systems Catapult, a new UK technology and innovation centre in the energy field. “Cold has become a hugely significant – yet almost unsung – part of our energy footprint. We know the energy landscape is going to be very different in the near future. We need to see cold’s place in it; start thinking of heat and cold as parts of one integrated system.” Demand for cold is rising exponentially. Driven by a warming planet and a rapidly expanding middle class in the developing economies – and warmer climes – of south and south-east Asia, air conditioning in particular is surging. As Stan Cox notes in Losing Our Cool, it took 15 years for the number of air-conditioned homes in the US to grow from 64m to 100m – but 50m new domestic AC units were bought in China in 2010 alone. The proportion of Chinese homes with refrigerators also soared, from 7% in 1995 to 95% in 2007.  But there is a problem. Almost all cold is still produced by what is known as vapour-compression refrigeration, 100-year-old technology that uses refrigerants – fluids, now usually hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs, that absorb and release heat – plus large amounts of electricity. “It’s a mature industry,” said Graeme Maidment, professor of refrigeration and air conditioning at London South Bank University. “And for years it wasn’t an obvious industry: it hummed along in the background, like an air conditioner, in fact. That’s only changed in the past 15 years or so, because it’s grown so fast and because we’re so much more concerned by energy consumption, carbon emissions, climate change.”  Air conditioning already accounts for about 40% of power use in Mumbai, India. More than half of Saudi Arabia’s peak summer power consumption – generated by burning 1bn barrels of oil a year – also goes on air conditioning. Even in Britain, air conditioning and refrigeration account for almost 20% of total electricity use, Maidment said.  Most projections suggest that figure will rise sharply. Over the next 15 years, according to the EU, the energy used to cool buildings across Europe is likely to increase by 72%, while the energy used for heating them will fall by 30%.  About 87% of US buildings are now air conditioned, and trends in the developing world suggest it is advancing fast down the same route. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that demand for residential air conditioning alone will rise from 300 terawatt hours a year in 2000 to 4,000 in 2050 and 10,000 by 2100. New sources of demand are expanding fast, too: according to Computer Weekly, global data centre power consumption quadrupled from 2007 to 2013, and is set to nearly double again over the next 15 years.  Research by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency predicts that by about 2060, the amount of energy used worldwide in cooling will overtake that used in heating.  “In the west,” said Richard Williams of Heriot-Watt University, “we’ve traditionally been more concerned with efficiently capturing and reusing heat. The source for cold has mostly been conventional electricity, or diesel. We’ve just been very slow to realise how important cold has become to our lifestyles.” But air conditioning and refrigeration are doubly polluting: not only are they produced from climate-warming fossil fuels, but the HFCs and other refrigerants cooling systems use produce greenhouse gases that can be up to 4,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide. If fossil fuel-generated energy still accounts for about 75% of all cooling emissions, these refrigerant leaks could cumulatively increase the warming effect of manmade CO2 emissions by up to 25% by the middle of the century, according to the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands. Altogether, Maidment said, refrigerant leaks and energy use in cooling account for “around 10% of global CO2 emissions. Already.”  Some refrigeration units are far more harmful. According to a report by the energy consultancy E4tech, the small diesel-powered fridges on food trailers emit nearly 30 times more harmful particulate matter and six times more nitrogen oxides than the engine that powers the trucks. That matters, because the world needs an awful lot more refrigerated food trailers. With the world’s population forecast to reach 9 billion by 2050, cold’s role in food security will be key. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, global food demand is set to grow by 50% in that time.  But the FAO also reckons as much as a third of all food is lost or wasted between harvest and home, mostly in the developing world. Halving food waste would feed 800 million of the 1 billion chronically undernourished people in the world, research by the International Institute of Refrigeration suggests.  “What’s remarkable,” said Peters, “is that 95% of agricultural research is about increasing yields.” Reducing waste should be a priority, he said, and “cold really is the key. But cold done smartly. If we just replicate the old technologies, we’re heading for environmental disaster.” What is cold done properly? For Maidment, who laments the fact that less than 0.2% of UK engineering research is devoted to cold technologies, it is about “reducing the need for cooling by – for example – designing buildings better. It’s increasing the efficiency of the cooling process. And then making sure the energy you do use is as clean as possible.” Winser sees “real opportunities for British businesses in all this”. Peters, who co-authored a report on the cold economy to be published by the Birmingham University policy commission on 28 October, said we must “completely rethink cold. We need cooling, and we need it globally. Is sucking electricity off the grid really the best way to provide it?” What if, he suggested, you could use cheap, off-peak renewable energy – wind, say – to make ice at night, and use that for cooling during the day? What about district cooling systems? “Storage,” he said, “will be critical: we store heat, why aren’t we storing cold? And new materials, to move cold around.” Cold is also wasted. Peters pointed to liquefied natural gas, or LNG. “That’s gas cooled to about –160C to be transported, then ‘unpacked’,” Peters said. “At present, all that cold gets dumped in the sea. And meanwhile, just up the road, someone’s burning diesel to create cold.” Waste LNG cold could also be used to power clean cold technologies: Dearman, a small UK engineering company with which Peters is involved, is road-testing a zero-emission, cold-producing engine that runs on liquid nitrogen and could replace the diesel refrigeration unit in a food trailer.  “We just need to think about cold differently,” said Peters. “Because solving cold, really doing it smarter, would actually do more to help the world meet its climate-change targets than almost anything else I can think of.”"
"The perfect average temperature for national economic success is 13C (55.4F), academics have discovered.  But the fundamental link they have revealed between a country’s economy and its temperature has led them to warn that the costs of unchecked climate change will be many times worse than previously thought.  The new analysis has “stark repercussions”, according to one independent expert, and indicates that all economic activity in all kinds of countries is affected. It estimates that the average citizen’s income in 2100 will be a quarter lower if global warming is not tackled and that global inequality will widen much further. Underlying the link is the impact that rising temperatures have on people’s ability to work, their health and even their ability to think, as well as harm to crops and machinery. Today, the US, Japan and China have average annual temperatures close to the sweet spot of 13C, meaning that further warming will begin to harm their economies. But Brazil, India, Indonesia and Nigeria are already much warmer, meaning the impact of climate change on their economic growth will be even greater. The UK and Germany are currently cooler than 13C, meaning their economies may improve a little as temperatures rise, before starting to decline. “We are already experiencing the economic impacts of climate change - heatwaves, for example, are increasing health costs and employee absenteeism, as well as reducing crop yields,” said Thomas Sterner, at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, who was not involved in the research.  “The conclusion [of the new research] that temperature-associated costs will be higher than previously calculated will cause a stir, and should have stark repercussions for policy. My feeling is that we are only beginning to understand just how much damage a changed climate can wreak.” The new analysis, published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, began by examining the economic performance of countries between 1960 and 2010. When a country’s average temperature was above 13C, they found that national economies performed worse in warmer years than in cooler years. Below 13C, the reverse was the case. “This relationship we have uncovered is almost like a law,” said Solomon Hsiang, at the University of California, Berkeley, a member of the research team. “Over the last 50 years, this relationship between how temperature fluctuates and how economies perform hasn’t changed a bit.” The researchers checked the results had not been skewed by factors like changes in oil price or the arrival of new technologies and then applied the findings to standard models of future economic development. They found that unrestricted global warming would cut expected incomes in 2100 by between 15% and 75%, many times higher than previous estimates. In the analysis, 77% of nations were worse off than they would be in 2100 if climate change is not tackled. Furthermore, if projected economic growth is sluggish, nearly half the world’s nations would be poorer in 2100 than they are today. “The effect of climate change is to massively increase global income inequality,” said Hsiang. The analysis shows the poorest 40% of nations would see their expected incomes plummet, while the richest 40% would experience much smaller falls. “Very slowly, economies start performing worse and worse [as temperature rises], but over time those little differences add up, so by 2100 there is a huge wedge between where we could be and where we find ourselves,” said Hsiang. High temperatures are known to harm crop productivity, but they also harm people’s ability to work. “People are known to be very sensitive to temperature,” said Hsiang. “So as a country warms up, millions of people start to experience warmer temperatures and their productivity starts to decline.” The impact of heat on manual workers is more obvious but Hsiang says it can affect white collar workers too: “There is a lot of interesting work showing that cognitive errors, or other types of mistakes, increase as workers are subjected to higher temperatures. So in places where increasingly we are relying on people to sit and think to be productive, that could be costly.” Another impact of rising temperatures is on health, with heart and pulmonary diseases rising as well as malaria and dengue fever. Air conditioning can cool people, but is expensive and means that money is not being used elsewhere in the economy, Hsiang said “When we hear of a few degrees of temperature change, it doesn’t sounds like a lot, but when you look in detail at what will happen on the ground, you are looking at a completely different planet,” said Hsiang.  “So it shouldn’t be too surprising that it is going to reshape the global economy in ways that are going to be quite traumatic. We can then ask whether or not we want to subject future generations to that turmoil and change, or if we want to invest what seems like a relatively small amount of today to avoid that scenario.” Climate economist Lord Nicholas Stern, at the London School of Economics, said: “This paper recognises that climate change could have impacts that increase very steeply with rising global average temperature. This is an advance on other previous studies [which have] made severe underestimates of the economic effects of unmanaged climate change.”  But he said even the new estimate could be unduly lower, because many possible and severe disruptions suggested by scientific evidence had not been included."
"Pledges on greenhouse gas emissions made by governments ahead of landmark climate talks this December will result in a rapid and dramatic slowdown in the growth of carbon from the energy sector - but will not reverse that growth within the next 15 years, the world’s energy watchdog said on Wednesday. The International Energy Agency (IEA), regarded as the gold standard on energy data, found that the pledges would result in an increase of 3.7 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide from 2014 to 2030, which is only one-third of the increase in energy emissions seen in the last 15 years.  Gas use will rise, while coal and oil decline, the agency predicts. By 2030, the annual growth in energy-related emissions worldwide will slow to just 0.5% a year, in its forecast, if the pledges are followed through, leaving total energy emissions at 42Gt in 2030. But, the analysis found, even if annual energy-related emissions are barely growing by 2030, they will still be substantial, and halting their growth is “a critical and urgent milestone to achieving the global climate goal” of limiting warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said: “The energy industry needs a strong and clear signal from the Paris climate summit. Failing to send this signal will push energy investments in the wrong direction, locking in unsustainable energy infrastructure for decades.” Meeting the pledges will require investment of about $13.5tn in energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies by 2030, or about $840bn on average for each of those years. Birol said the fact that so many countries - representing about 90% of the global economy - had published their pledges, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions or INDCs in UN jargon, was “in itself remarkable” and would help “build political momentum” for a deal in Paris. However, in the latest round of talks aimed at clearing the way for a new global climate change agreement post-2020 in Paris, the messages were mixed. Governments are meeting in Bonn for the last official days of negotiating time scheduled before the two weeks of Paris talks begin at the end of November. The French hosts and the UN see it as essential to get as much of an agreement as possible agreed in advance of the start of Paris, in order to have the final days run smoothly and produce a deal. Central to that is slimming down the text of an agreement, which earlier this year stood at an unwieldy 90-plus pages.  That was reduced by the co-chairs to about 20 pages, but at this week’s talks parts of it have ballooned again as countries try to re-insert their favoured language or issues they feel have been sidelined. As a result, the text quickly nearly doubled in size, and countries are now trying to prevent further rises and slim down the crucial document once more. Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, called on the negotiators to use the final hours to build bridges and make compromises. “Countries need to move past just re-proposing their well-known national positions, and start working hard to craft bridging proposals on as many issues as possible. On crunch political issues where agreement can’t be reached here in Bonn, negotiators need to craft limited sets of clear options for ministers to grapple with in advance of or during Paris.” As negotiators filed off into rooms to try to wrangle over aspects of the text in smaller groups, in an effort to get the progress required, some NGOs were furious that they were excluded from these spin-off negotiating groups, saying that their expertise could help countries reach agreement. Amid concerns over sluggish progress at the negotiations, on the fringes there was also significant activity. A group of more than 20 business associations, representing more than 100,000 companies from around the world, wrote an open letter to Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief, as well as more than 90 government around the world, to call for carbon markets and the provision of international links among such markets to be re-included in the draft text of the agreement, which at present is scant on the subject. The groups included some with numbers of members dependent on fossil fuels or which have raised objections to carbon regulation in the past, including the Business Council of Australia, Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Edison Electric Institute, the Federation of German Industries and BusinessEurope. However, a campaign called Kick Big Polluters Out called for all businesses with fossil fuel interests to be removed from the policymaking process, accusing corporate lobbyists of acting like those who advised the tobacco industry decades ago. Separately, the OECD produced a report showing that emissions per unit of GDP had fallen since the 1990s in almost all of the world’s biggest economies, developed and developing. Taxes on energy are gradually being changed to reflect the carbon contents of fuel in these countries, but taxes have to date been “insufficient to spur technological change or significantly alter consumer behaviour”, the thinktank warned. In addition, it noted, public spending on research and development in energy remains low."
"So, California is in a drought. That’s what everybody says. The media says it. The scientists say it. The firefighters working overtime to put out the hundreds of wildfires say it, as do the farmers trying to explain that if something doesn’t happen soon salad will just be something in an exhibit at a natural history museum. I’ve even gotten used to restaurants in California — no matter how simple or fancy — having signs that remind me to ask for water with my meal. I’m forced to ask for water like a sucker, instead of the water just being on my table when I sit down the way the framers of the Constitution intended.   But the thing I don’t understand is: why is California in a drought? I mean, I understand why, literally: we haven’t had enough rain. But what about all the water in the rest of the country? Isn’t it supposed to be the United States of America? If California is in a drought, shouldn’t we have each others’ backs? Admittedly getting each others’ backs is not our strong suit in the states. But this isn’t something complicated like wanting fewer people murdered by guns. This is water. As a comedian, I travel these so-called United States a lot. Two weeks ago in the span of six days, I was in Austin, Houston, Washington DC, Baltimore and New York City. I ate in a lot of restaurants. In none of these cities did I see signs telling me that I had to ask for water. I was just brought water as soon as I sat down. In these other cities, they made it rain with water. In DC, it actually did rain, I think just to mock me and my fellow Californians. At the same time, it was flooding in South Carolina. Yes, at the same time California was experiencing one of the worst droughts in, some experts say, over a thousand years, South Carolina was being hit by a one-thousand-year flood. How do we get these two together? It’s like the ecosystem’s version of a romantic comedy. I can hear the trailer now: “Drought and Flood – if only we could get these two together, they’d be perfect for each other. See what happens this fall, in When Arid Met Hurricane Sally”. Global warming is really “global weirding” according to Hunter Lovins, president of Natural Capitalism Solutions. The dry parts of the Earth are getting drier and the wet parts are getting wetter. Yet, at the same time some scientists believe that the Earth has like 26% less water than it did 3.8bn years ago. So even though it may seem like there is plenty of water on the planet, it’s basically like when you realize you don’t need to go shopping for toilet paper this weekend, but if you don’t go next weekend then your world is doomed. Even if, for the time being, there is plenty of water to go around the United States, it’s not going to help much, because it’s in the wrong places. And if you have any doubt about this, don’t worry – you can trust me. I Googled respected climate change experts and water scientists, so I know the facts are good. I wasn’t Googling paranoid, born-again Republican Christians with persecution complexes. In other words, I didn’t ask any of the candidates running for the GOP nomination for president. Because when you are talking about climate change, historical droughts and hurricanes, there is a list of words that you should generally avoid so that your audience will take you seriously: Jesus, The Bible, Revelation, God said, Noah, Moses, Pharaoh, Satan (also Beelzebub), Sodom and finally Gomorrah. Steer clear of those unless you are saying, “Holy Jesus we screwed up the Earth in biblical proportions!” Since the lack of water in California and the surplus (putting it mildly) of water in South Carolina are both significant problems, why don’t we just figure it out? Why didn’t we just drive a bunch of tanker trucks out to South Carolina and fill them up with that sweet, sweet (other) liquid gold? Sound crazy? Why? We do it that with real liquid gold, oil, all the time. We’ve got pipelines and tanker trucks and oil barges crossing (and ruining) the Earth everyday. Is it a dumb idea? Or did I just win a Nobel Prize? The current California governor’s dad basically did a version of this when he was governor during another California drought in the 1960’s. He spent $1.8bn of the state’s money to bring water from — at that time — water-rich Northern California to then — and still — water-poor Southern California. And apparently his plan worked too well. Southern California’s population boomed, meaning they needed even more water. And now Northern California kinda needs to keep all its water. The lettuce, avocados and weed won’t grow themselves. But I’m not advocating taking water from a place that needs the water, like William Shatner suggested when he pitched a Kickstarter campaign to bring water from Seattle to California. I’m suggesting we harvest all that water other places don’t need. Maybe that’s just a drop in the bucket, but hey, sometimes that’s better than a dry bucket. Because like it or not, you need California to keep being California. Without us you have no movies anybody wants to see. Without us you’re still showing off your cool new Nokia flip phone that you are excited about because it has the snake game on it. Without us you have no way to know how bad your weed is where you come from. You need us. And yes, I am currently doing my part for the drought. I’m not showering everyday. (Although mostly that’s because I have two young children and I can’t find the time.) I’m trying to eat less meat because people say that livestock is mostly responsible for the drought … OK, I’m thinking about eating less meat. (Tofu is how we know there’s a God, because the devil must have created it.) I’m drinking less water overall. (Again probably because I’m a dad of two young kids. Mostly I drink coffee and sugar-free Red Bull.) And when I ask for water at a restaurant, I make sure I drink it … unless I forget. But we all know that’s not enough."
"Nearly 50 leaders of America’s defence and foreign policy establishment are calling on political and business leaders to “think past tomorrow” and lead the fight on climate change. In a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal the experts – 48 former secretaries of state and defense, national security advisers, diplomats and members of Congress from both parties – say it is time for America to claim global leadership on climate change.  The appeal is intended to apply pressure to Republicans in Congress who are trying to defeat Barack Obama’s plan to cut carbon pollution at home and seeking to limit US involvement in negotiations to reach a global deal on fighting climate change in Paris in December. The letter, endorsed by Madeline Albright, secretary of state under Bill Clinton; Chuck Hagel, secretary of defense under Obama; George Shultz, secretary of state under Ronald Reagan; James Woolsey, CIA director under Clinton; and other prominent retired officials, declares that climate change is indeed a security threat. “America’s elected leaders and private sector must think past tomorrow to focus on this growing problem, and take action at home and abroad,” the ad says. “This issue is critically important to the world’s most experienced security planners. The impacts are real, and the costs of inaction are unacceptable.” The ad hits back against Republicans who are trying to block a global climate deal, arguing that Obama should have to submit any agreement for approval to Congress – where it would almost certainly be defeated. In the run-up to the Paris climate conference, the Obama administration has rolled out almost daily pronouncements and events – many involving business leaders – to try to build the case that a climate change deal would be good for the economy and the country. Many of the 48 had made previous such appeals. The security establishment has long recognised the threat posed by climate change. In 2006 a report by the influential Center for Naval Analysis defined climate change as a “threat multiplier”, adding fuel to conflicts. The current thinking however sees climate change as a danger on its own – drought, sea-level rise, food shortages, provoking migration and armed conflicts. “Climate change is certainly going to destabilise situations,” General Ron Keys, retired leader of the air force command, told a seminar at the Wilson Centre think-tank on Wednesday. “There are some countries out there that are just hanging on by their fingernails.” Generals also fear a rise in deployments dealing with natural disasters – which would play a strain on resources and could potentially leave the US exposed. “The real problem is what do we do if we are involved in a Fukushima or a hurricane Sandy times three and somebody like Isis decides to make a big push,” Keys said. “If I were a bad guy I’d wait until the US was involved in a big situation and then I would make my move.”"

"A team of researchers has found that steep cuts to emissions during the next decade are the only way to avoid a catastrophic collapse of Antarctic ice sheets and associated sea-level rise that will continue for thousands of years. The study, published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, found that should the global temperature increase to around 3C (5.4F) above the pre-industrial era then the ice shelves that hold back the giant continental ice sheets would be lost over the next few centuries.  This would trigger a collapse that would go on for thousands of years, raising sea levels by 0.6 metres to 3 metres (2-10ft) by the year 2300 depending on how high manmade greenhouse gas emissions remain. Our descendants living in the year 5000 will continue to suffer the consequences of today’s fossil fuel burning, as sea levels continue to rise up to 9 metres (30ft) above current levels. However, the results leave a narrow opening through which humanity can slip. If temperatures remain within 2C (3.6F), the collapse of the shelves will stabilise and the sheets will remain mostly intact. Sea-level rise from Antarctica would remain within 23cm (9 inches) by 2300. To achieve this, the authors said the world will have to follow the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) lowest emissions scenario. This requires global emissions to peak around 2020 and decline to below zero by 2100. In preparation for the climate conference in Paris next month, 150 governments representing 90% of emissions have submitted pledges to cut and curb them. However, these still chart a pathway to a world well above 2C – one analysis suggested they lead to 2.7C (4.9F) of warming, not enough to avoid the runaway decline of the Antarctic ice. The new study “ultimately confirm[s] the suspicions of earlier glaciologists that the fate of ice shelves largely determines whether Antarctica contributes less than 1 metre or up to 9 metres to long-term sea-level rise”, wrote the California Institute of Technology scientist Alexander Robel in an accompanying comment piece in Nature.  Hilmar Gudmundsson, a scientist at the British Antarctic Survey, said the changes between 2100 and 2300 were “large and alarming” although the degree of uncertainty was still high.  In 2014, professor Eric Rignot, a senior researcher at Nasa, made the dramatic finding that the west Antarctic ice sheet and its 4 metres (13ft) worth of sea-level rise had already started slipping away. He said the paper’s assertion that the loss of this ice sheet could be stopped was “hardly believable” because the projections lacked reliable modelling of ocean circulation and iceberg calving. He said the loss of the West Antarctic sheet was “inevitable”; the only thing humans could control was how fast it goes. “Whether we control our emissions or not will only matter in terms of how fast we get there. I find it disheartening that we are still talking about 2C above pre-industrial as a ‘reasonable’ target when we already passed the threshold for a large share of the ice sheets,” he said. “It is counterproductive to give the impression that we have to figure out a way out of carbon soon, when we really need to do this yesterday,” he said. The global sea level has risen roughly 20cm (8 inches) over the past century and is already causing problems for communities in low-lying areas. Only a little of this has so far been caused by melting ice; most comes from the expansion of oceans as they warm. But Golledge and his colleagues warned that this would change in the future if Antarctica’s ice sheets began falling into the sea. Antarctica’s two ice sheets, east and west, cover an area the size of the contiguous US and Mexico combined and would raise the seas 60 metres (196ft) if lost completely, according to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre. The friction of floating ice shelves against the deeply buried rock of the coast slows the flow of ice from the interior. Removing the ice shelves is like taking the chocks from a truck sitting on a slope. Without them, the loss of the giant ice sheets will trigger an “unstoppable” event that will last for thousands of years, said Golledge’s team. Some buttressing shelves have already been lost and others are weakening. Another study this week warned that all may be lost by the end of the century. At the UN climate summit in Paris, much of the talk will be about the steps that can be taken over the next decade to strengthen each country’s emissions cuts. Professor Andrew Shepherd, the director of the Nerc Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling said the new research added urgency to Paris. “Ahead of COP [Conference of the Parties, the Paris summit], this new study is a useful reminder that future climate warming might trigger extreme and irreversible ice losses from Antarctica over centuries. But to reliably predict how things could change within the next century, we need to build and use a new class of ice sheet models that can capture the detailed response of each of the continent’s outlet glaciers,” he said. Note: The article was amended to show that the RCP2.4 scenario requires emissions to drop below zero by 2100. The original said they dropped to zero."

"Rising temperatures and humidity due to climate change are likely to increase the number of days with unsafe “heat stress”, putting south-east Asia at great risk of significant drops in productivity, a research firm said on Wednesday.   South-east Asia over the next three decades could lose 16% of its labour capacity due to rising heat stress, which could cause absenteeism due to dizziness, fatigue, nausea and even death in extreme cases, the British firm Verisk Maplecroft said.  The company predicted the biggest losses in productivity in Singapore and Malaysia, with 25% and 24% decreases from current levels. Indonesia could see a 21% drop, Cambodia and the Philippines 16% and Thailand and Vietnam 12%.  “Climate change will push heat stress impacts to boiling point, with significant implications for both national economies and the health of vulnerable workers,” said James Allan, head of environment at Verisk Maplecroft, in a statement.  The company used climate projections to calculate the drop in labour capacity, based on the occurrence of conditions that prompt heat stress and leave workers unable to perform physical activity.  It said by 2045 the number of heat stress days in Singapore and Malaysia will rise to 364 (from 335 and 338 respectively); to 355 from 303 in Indonesia; and to 337 from 276 in the Philippines.  Calculating potential lost productivity for 1,300 cities, the company found 45 of the 50 highest risk cities were in south-east Asia, including Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Jakarta.  Twenty of the 50 highest risk cities are in Malaysia, 13 in Indonesia, four in the Philippines and three are in Thailand.  High-risk cities outside the region included Cartagena, at the top of the list, and Barranquilla in Colombia, Panama City and Arraijan in Panama, and Manaus in Brazil."
"As the northern hemisphere slides into winter the southern hemisphere is sliding into summer or, in the case of Australia, diving into summer. On 6 October, Melbourne hit 35°C, breaking records for the hottest start to this month, while Sydney and Adelaide have had a string of days over 30°C. But for Australians this record-breaking heat is starting to become familiar. A study, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters , shows that since 2000 hot record-breaking events on average have outnumbered cold record-breaking events by 12 to one. Climate simulations show this imbalance would not occur under natural climate variability, and that human-caused warming is behind the plethora of hot records.  The soaring temperatures, combined with parched soil and dry vegetation (much of east Australia, the west coast and Tasmania have had significantly below average rainfall over the last 10 years) have made Australia a tinderbox. Even if it does rain now the dry state of the ground will make it hard for that moisture to be retained. This year the problem is being amplified by the extra strong “Godzilla El Niño” conditions in the Pacific, associated with reduced rainfall and warmer temperatures in Australia. Already Australia has had its third driest September on record; so far October has been drier than average too. Satellite maps show flames licking dozens of locations, and already serious bush fires have taken hold. Rather than relaxing in the seasonal warmth, Australians are on the look-out for the smallest thread of smoke. It’s a tense time."
"The heads of 10 major oil and gas companies have denied they are paying lip service to climate change initiatives while conducting business as usual. Eightof the 10 companies’ CEOs met in Paris on Friday and issued a joint statement saying they would “play their part” in battling climate change, ahead of the United Nations climate summit which opens in November.  They also pledged their commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the hope of limiting global warning to 2C. But they dropped a commitment to putting a price on carbon that originally brought most of the group together. Six of the ten companies wrote an open letter earlier this year calling for governments to impose a price on carbon dioxide emissions. Critics said the pledges by the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative were little more than hot air. “The oil companies behind this announcement have spent years lobbying to undermine effective climate action, each and every one of them has a business plan that would lead to dangerous global temperature rises, yet suddenly they expect us all to see them as the solution, not the problem,” Greenpeace campaigner Charlie Kronick said. “The world should thank them for their offer of advice but politely turn it down. Arsonists don’t make good firefighters.” The oil and gas company chiefs gathered in Paris, however, insisted their commitment to reducing harmful emissions was sincere and said it was a unique occasion in which the companies, more used to competing, had decided to collaborate. Bob Dudley, head of BP, said a report published by the voluntary group showed they were serious and “being proactive” about climate change and that they had a “sense of commitment and urgency”. The report, however, made no reference to carbon pricing. Environmentalists view a global system of setting a price for each tonne of carbon that emitters produce to encourage companies to adopt cleaner technologies and shift away from fossil fuels, primarily coal, as vital. It was clear that carbon pricing was an issue on which the companies had failed to agree. Dudley admitted the companies were independent and all came at the issue with different views. “In any case, the world itself is not united on carbon pricing,” he added. The key phrase on which they did agree was on the need for “technology, technology, technology” as a way to cleaner energy, a move away from coal, and the increasing use of gas. Josu Jon Imaz, head of Repsol, said: “This is not all blah, blah, blah. We are fully convinced that we can reduce CO2 emissions. We could be part of the problem, but we are convinced we are part of the solution.” There was a slight note of defiance from the oil bosses that, while the oil and gas companies were committed to reducing carbon emissions, this had to be done within a business framework and recognition that energy demands are growing, especially in the developing world. Amin H Nasser, president and CEO of the Saudi Arabian Oil Company Saudi Aramco, who was asked if the world really needed the 12m barrels of crude oil his company extracts every day, replied: “Yes. Oil contributes to global prosperity ... especially in developing countries.” Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of Total, urged critics to “see the glass not as half empty but as half full”. “The most important thing today is that eight CEOs recognise the trend to reduce carbon emissions. We are committing ourselves and committing our companies by making this statement. It’s quite an important step.” Helge Lund, of BG Group, added that producing more energy and less carbon was “a challenge”. “As a global community we don’t look for a total solution, which would be setting ourselves up for failure, we look for measures we can do,” Lund said. The Paris meeting on Friday is seen as a counter-offensive designed to deflect criticism of the companies, who have acknowledged that the current trend in greenhouse gas emissions is too high to meet the UN target of limiting global warming to no more than 2C. Christiana Figueres, the UN climate change chief , told the oil companies they need to step up their own efforts to combat global warming, after six firms – BG Group, BP, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil and Total – wrote to her calling for world governments to introduce a global pricing system for carbon emissions that would punish polluters. Critics say until now the companies have shown little willingness to put their own houses in order. The Carbon Tracker Initiative, a financial thinktank, said oil companies were spending between 1%-2% of their research and development budget on renewable energies, a figure that had not changed in years. “At Carbon Tracker we will measure this initiative and the industry by the concrete and quantitative commitments the companies involved set themselves to deliver,” said the thinktank’s Anthony Hobley. In their joint statement the 10 oil and gas company CEOs from the BG Group, BP, Eni, Pemex, Reliance Industries, Repsol, Saudi Aramco, Shell, Statoil and Total, said: “Our shared ambition is for a 2C future. It is a challenge for the whole of society. We are committed to playing our part. “Over the coming years, we will collectively strengthen our actions and investments to contribute to reducing the GHG (greenhouse gas) intensity of the global energy mis. Our companies will collaborate in a number of areas, with the aim of going beyond the sum of our individual efforts.”"

"Scientists in Alaska will raise the vexed issue of methane and “black carbon” pollution as they discuss tipping-point dangers posed by global warming in the Arctic. A crucial meeting of the Arctic Council, in Anchorage, comes amid evidence that the polar region is warming faster than any other place on Earth and that sea ice coverage there has shrunk by nearly a third since 1979. Researchers now fear that new threats to climate stability are about to be unleashed in the Arctic. Warming in high latitudes is causing permafrost in Siberia and northern Canada to thaw and release plumes of methane stored there, they say. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and these releases threaten to trigger secondary rises in global temperatures.  In addition, researchers warn that black carbon – ultra-fine particles produced by factories and farms and deposited thousands of miles from emission points – could be significantly reducing the brightness of snow and icefields. With less solar radiation reflected back into space, the region will warm up even faster, leading to a longer melt season and even greater reductions in ice. “The sources of black carbon and methane emissions affecting the Arctic are the oil and gas sector, waste, domestic burning, shipping and other modes of transportation, agricultural burning, other industry and agricultural sources, and natural sources including wildfires and wetlands,” said Jon Kahn, director of the ministry of environment and energy in Sweden and an Arctic Council delegate, in a recent blog. Kahn has played a key role in setting up past Arctic Council investigations of the dangers posed by methane and black carbon to the region. Crucially, Kahn noted that the US, which has just assumed presidency of the council, has agreed to maintain this interest and, in particular, to look more closely at flaring, the burning of natural gas that cannot be processed or sold, and which has been linked to the release of secondary climate pollutants such as black carbon. The Arctic Council is made up of representatives of the main north polar nations – Canada, Denmark (through its dependencies of Greenland and the Faroe Islands), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States. In recent years, its work has come into sharp focus as the Arctic has warmed up and its sea ice cover has shrunk, exposing once inaccessible oilfields and sea routes. Russia has been particularly aggressive in claiming rights over newly exposed territories, while US president Barack Obama recently triggered controversy by giving the go-ahead to Shell to drill for oil in the Chukchi Sea. However, the US administration has since made significant retreats over its oil drilling policy in the Arctic and last week announced new curbs on oil and gas exploration in Arctic waters off Alaska’s northern coast. This has raised hopes that it will use its presidency of the Arctic Council to try to strengthen measures that will protect the fragile polar environment. The Arctic suffers by comparison with its southerly counterpart, the Antarctic, which is controlled by an international treaty that bans all mining, oil drilling or the presence of the military, and which strictly controls all environmental hazards. By contrast, the Arctic is owned by nations who have very different ideas about how to run the place. It is the task of the Arctic Council to reconcile these differing aspirations. For its part, the United Kingdom, which has strong interests in both Arctic and Antarctic research and exploration, has permanent observer status at the council and uses its scientific expertise and knowledge of the region to optimise its political leverage at debates. The UK has been criticised for its lack of ambition in Arctic debates. A House of Lords report, Responding to a Changing Arctic, recently warned that the UK does not always take a full role in Arctic discussions. In the report, peers recommended that the post of UK Arctic ambassador be created. However, the government has since dismissed the idea, arguing that such a post is unnecessary. “We already have a strong influence and certainly do not need honorific posts with grand titles to make our presence felt,” said one UK Arctic expert. This year, the UK natural environment research council said it would spend an extra £16m on Arctic research in order to better understand how climate change there is likely to affect wildlife, fish stocks and the environment."
"Nine out of 10 Volkswagen drivers in Britain affected by the diesel emissions scandal believe they should receive compensation, increasing the pressure on the carmaker as it attempts to recover from the crisis. Almost 1.2m diesel vehicles in Britain are involved in the scandal, out of 11m worldwide, and VW faces a hefty bill if it is forced to make payouts to motorists. The company has put aside €6.5bn (£4.8bn) to deal with the cost of recalling and repairing the affected vehicles, but it also faces the threat of fines and legal action from customers and shareholders.  There is a growing frustration among VW drivers in the UK over the lack of information about how their vehicle will be repaired, according to the consumer watchdog Which?. VW has sent letters to affected customers, arriving this week. However, the letters state that the company is still working on its plans and another letter will be sent when these are confirmed. Paul Willis, the managing director of VW UK, told MPs on Monday that the recall of vehicles may not be completed by the end of 2016 and that it was premature to discuss compensation. However a survey by Which? has found that nine out of 10 affected motorists want compensation. Richard Lloyd, the executive director of Which?, said: “Many VW owners tell us they decided to buy their car based on its efficiency and low environmental impact, so it’s outrageous that VW aren’t being clear with their customers about how and when they will be compensated. “Volkswagen UK must set out an urgent timetable for redress to the owners of the affected vehicles. We also need assurances from the government that it is putting in place changes to prevent anything like this happening again.” In the wake of the scandal, 86% of VW drivers are concerned about the environmental impact of their car, while 83% questioned the impact on its resale value and 73% feared the performance of their vehicle would be affected. More than half of the VW customers said they had been put off from buying a VW diesel car in the future.  A total of 96% stated that fuel efficiency was an important factor in buying the diesel vehicle, while 90% said it was the seemingly limited environmental impact. Both these issues are affected by the scandal. Which? surveyed more than 2,000 motorists who bought a VW diesel car between 2008 and 2015. In further developments, VW has admitted that US regulators are examining an additional piece of suspect software in its 2016 diesel vehicles. The “auxiliary emissions control device” heats up a pollution control catalyst faster, boosting the performance of the device that separates nitrogen oxide into harmless nitrogen and oxygen gases. A VW spokesman confirmed that the company reported the device last week to the Environmental Protection Agency, which discovered the initial defeat device that allowed the company to cheat emissions tests.  The regulator is now considering whether to approve the device or if it is another defeat device, designed specifically to manipulate the performance of the vehicle during tests. VW’s new 2016 models cannot be sold until they are approved by regulators and thousands of vehicles remain marooned in ports as a result.  In a separate setback, the company also confirmed that the executive earmarked to become boss of VW in North America has left the company. Winfried Vahland, the head of the VW-owned Skoda brand, was due to become head of a newly formed North America arm, bringing together its businesses in the US, Canada and Mexico. Vahland would have led the company’s fightback in the US alongside Michael Horn, the head of VW in the US. However, the company said Vahland was leaving due to “differing views on the organisation of the new group region”. VW insisted his departure was not linked to the emissions crisis."

"The UN’s new goals for a more equal and sustainable world are designed to apply to all countries, rich or poor. The sustainable development goals (SDGs), which include lofty targets such as eliminating extreme poverty and providing quality education for all, were adopted by world leaders in September.   Unlike the millennium development goals that came before them, the SDGs position wealthy countries as not just providers of aid, but sites of development themselves. In other words, rich countries have a role to play in mitigating climate change, achieving gender equality and addressing the other goals within their own borders and overseas. The goals are attempting to dismantle the north-south divide. So, with a wider remit and a more ambitious agenda, can the SDGs succeed? We’d like to know your thoughts on the role wealthy countries should play in implementing the new goals. Do you think high-income countries will take these goals on board? Or should the poorest countries be the sole priority? And if the 17 goals equally apply to high- and low-income countries, which of the goals should the wealthy countries prioritise? We’d like to hear examples of specific countries if you have them. Submit a response of up to 250 words, answering the question: what role should wealthy countries play in delivering the SDGs? Keep your submissions clear and concise, avoiding development or academic jargon.  Email your response to development@theguardian.com with “Students Speak” in the subject line. Please include your name, the country where you live, and the university or college you attend. Submissions close at 6pm BST on Friday 30 October."
"The Gulf in the Middle East, the heartland of the global oil industry, will suffer heatwaves beyond the limit of human survival if climate change is unchecked, according to a new scientific study. The extreme heatwaves will affect Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Doha and coastal cities in Iran as well as posing a deadly threat to millions of Hajj pilgrims in Saudi Arabia, when the religious festival falls in the summer. The study shows the extreme heatwaves, more intense than anything ever experienced on Earth, would kick in after 2070 and that the hottest days of today would by then be a near-daily occurrence.  “Our results expose a specific regional hotspot where climate change, in the absence of significant [carbon cuts], is likely to severely impact human habitability in the future,” said Prof Jeremy Pal and Prof Elfatih Eltahir, both at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, writing in the journal Nature Climate Change. They said the future climate for many locations in the Gulf would be like today’s extreme climate in the desert of Northern Afar, on the African side of the Red Sea, where there are no permanent human settlements at all. But the research also showed that cutting greenhouse gas emissions now could avoid this fate. Oil and gas rich nations in the region, particularly Saudi Arabia, have frequently tried to frustrate international climate change negotiations. The Gulf, where populations are rising quickly, was hit in 2015 by one of its worst-ever heatwaves, where temperatures topped 50C (122F) and led to a significant number of deaths.  Prof Eltahir said: “We would hope that information like this would be helpful in making sure there is interest [in cutting carbon emissions] for the countries in the region. They have a vital interest in supporting measures that would help reduce the concentration of CO2 in the future.” The new research examined how a combined measure of temperature and humidity, called wet bulb temperature (WBT), would increase if carbon emissions continue on current trends and the world warms by 4C this century. At WBTs above 35C, the high heat and humidity make it physically impossible for even the fittest human body to cool itself by sweating, with fatal consequences after six hours. For less fit people, the fatal WBT is below 35C. A WBT temperature of 35C – the combination of 46C heat and 50% humidity – was almost reached in Bandar Mahshahr in Iran in July 2015. The scientists used standard climate computer models to show that the fatal WBT extremes would occur every decade or two after 2070 along most of the Gulf coast, if global warming is not curbed. Using the normal measure of temperature, the study shows 45C would become the usual summer maximum in Gulf cities, with 60C being seen in places like Kuwait City in some years. Near the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia, where Mecca and Jeddah lie, the WBT is not projected to pass the fatal 35C level, but would be 32C or 33C. This would make the Hajj extremely hazardous, said the scientists. “One of the rituals of Hajj – the day of Arafah – involves worshipping at the site outside Mecca from sunrise to sunset. In these kind of conditions, it would be very hard to have outside rituals,” said Eltahir. Air conditioning might be able to protect people indoors and those in wealthy Gulf oil states might be able to afford it, said the scientists, but less wealthy nations would suffer. In Yemen, for example, the WBT would reach 33C. “Under such conditions, climate change would possibly lead to premature death of the weakest – namely children and the elderly,” they said. However, global action to cut carbon emissions would mean the fatal WBT would not be passed and that temperatures in Saudi Arabia would experience much smaller rises. “The [Gulf] countries stand to gain considerable benefits by supporting the global efforts” to cut emissions, said the scientists. “The consequences of major heatwaves for human health has become apparent from the death toll of recent events such as those in Chicago in 1995, Europe in 2003 [30,000 deaths] and Russia in 2010 [50,000 deaths],” said climate scientist Prof Christoph Schär, at ETH Zurich, Switzerland and who was not involved in the study. But he said the new study “concerns another category of heat waves – one that may be fatal to everybody affected, even young and fit individuals under shaded and well-ventilated outdoor conditions.” Schär said the work showed the threat to human health from climate change may be much more severe, and occur much earlier, than previously thought. “It also indicates that reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation efforts are essential for the inhabitants of the Gulf and Red Sea regions.” The Gulf is vulnerable to very high WBT because regional weather patterns mean it has clear summer skies, allowing the sun to strongly warm the waters of the Gulf, which are shallow and therefore heat up more than deeper oceans. This heating of the sea also produces high humidity, meaning cities near the coast are most affected. Growing up in Dubai in the Gulf, the thing I looked forward to the most every summer was leaving.  Summer meant going back to my birthplace in Alexandria in Egypt, but it also meant getting away from temperatures that could hit a hellish 50C, when going to the beach wasn’t an option, unless you enjoyed scorching your soles in the sand to swim in tepid seawater while burning your skin in the blazing sun. Summer is something you work around in the Gulf. You try to ensure your time spent outside is kept to a minimum because the high humidity of seaside cities, such as Dubai, will leave your clothes soaking wet within minutes. It means an intricate hop from air-conditioned site to air-conditioned site – your apartment to your car to the supermarket or the shopping mall or a friend’s similarly temperature-controlled abode. It means never having to use a water heater because your shower will always be hot – even scaldingly so if you dare to take one at midday.  Now that the holy month of Ramadan falls in the summer, whenever I’m back visiting family I try to keep daytime waking hours, when I have to abstain from drinking water, to a bare minimum. I’ve completed the hajj and the lesser pilgrimage, the umra – the former in the cool February climate and the latter in the heat of summer. I cannot imagine handling the crush of millions of pilgrims marching around the ka’aba in the Grand Mosque during a heatwave. The summer can be insufferable in other places in the region for different reasons. While this year it was relatively mild in Beirut, where I live now, for example, it is always accompanied by water shortages and extended power cuts for days on end, leaving you with little choice but to pay for an expensive generator subscription to preserve perishables such as meat or dairy for more than a day, or sleeping on the ceramic tiles to cool off. This year it was also accompanied by piles of rotting trash baking in the sun after the government’s chronic failures were extended to garbage collection. This isn’t a problem in the Gulf, where save for a freak power cut the constant electricity supply maintains a climate-controlled habitat. I was a bit incredulous when Qatar was awarded the World Cup hosting rights – I hadn’t been able to play football outside of an air-conditioned indoor pitch in the summer since God knows how long.

"Scientists have confirmed what gardeners have long suspected: spring is coming much earlier in the US, with plants projected to bud three weeks earlier by the end of the century because of climate change. By 2100 plants will green up 22.3 days earlier in much of the country, with the biggest jump on spring occurring in the western US. In the Pacific north-west the researchers expected an even shorter winter with spring kicking in up to 28.5 days earlier by the end of the century. The findings, published on Wednesday in Environmental Research Letters, suggest even bigger shifts in the plant calendar due to climate change than had been expected.  Earlier this year another team of researchers suggested that spring was arriving as much as 14 days earlier in most parts of North America because of climate change. The researchers from the Hawthorne Valley Farmscape Ecology Programme drew on thousands of records, from frog mating calls to bird migration patterns and tree and plant flowerings, to compare the shift in timing of natural events.  In some parts of the country, including Wisconsin, some flower species, such as wild geranium, were blooming 24 days earlier in 2012 than in 1945. The newest group of researchers, from government scientific agencies as well as universities, combined historical records of lilac and honeysuckle growth with 19 climate models to project first leaf and first bud in the coming decades. “We know spring is getting earlier. But we provide actual evidence for how much earlier,” said Andrew Allstadt, an ecologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was part of the research team. The change would have far-reaching effects - both for farming and other industries and the natural world. “The timing of events is important,” Allstadt said. “If plants are shifting earlier in the year, there is a worry that the animals that depend on the plants won’t keep up with those shifts.” Those living in warmer parts of the US, such as the south, are unlikely to see as big a difference in the arrival of spring, because it is already so warm. But much of the country will see a shorter winter, Allstadt said. The biggest factor triggering the first green shoots of spring was the slow build-up of milder weather over the course of the year – rather than a burst of above-average days in February or March, he said.  That was especially the case at higher altitudes and across the wind-swept Great Plains, he said.  The researchers did not find a rise in false springs, or hard frosts that could damage or kill off a new season’s growth."

"France has launched an unprecedented diplomatic drive to shepherd nations big and small towards a major climate change deal, ahead of a Paris summit next month that is the next major make-or-break moment for the movement against global warming. Every one of France’s ambassadors, in embassies and consulates around the globe, has been educated on the demands of climate change, and instructed in how to communicate the messages to the governments they deal with, ahead of the summit, which starts on 30 November.  Ambassadors have been holding public events, private meetings, talks with their diplomatic counterparts, businesses, NGOs and even schoolchildren.  At home, the outer walls of the foreign ministry, a stately 19th-century edifice on the banks of the Seine, are covered in a series of banners declaring, in several languages, the messages of Paris Climat 2015. Even the Eiffel Tower, further down the riverbank, has been pressed into service, lit up at night with climate slogans. François Hollande, the president of France, has been visiting world leaders for the past year, urging them to come to Paris. Laurent Fabius, foreign minister, who will be in charge of the talks, has made it his mission, with a punishing schedule of events and public speaking. Ségolène Royal, environment minister and co-host, has also been touring capitals and conferences. Climate diplomacy has never seen such a concerted push. “It’s a top priority for our diplomacy. All our ambassadors are fully mobilised, all around the world,” Sylvie Bermann, the French ambassador to the UK, told the Guardian.  She has hosted a series of public seminars and events in the UK, with one forthcoming on climate change and refugees. The embassy itself has also taken on the green message, with her new official car a hybrid Peugeot 508 – a French manufacturer, of course. Even in countries such as India and Poland where, Bermann said “there might be more fisticuffs” over climate change, the embassies have been engaging governments, and in China, where she was posted before coming to London – she is a fluent Chinese speaker – she notes a major push involving government and NGOs.  Care has been taken to involve public opinion, too: there has even been a boat, the research vessel Tara, sponsored by the French fashion brand Agnès B, that has toured the US, London, Scandinavia and other regions before coming home to France. A special ambassador has been appointed, Laurence Tubiana, who has also embarked on a whirlwind tour of capitals and dignitaries.  With three months to go before the conference, France’s ambassadors were lectured by Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary-general, who also has a big stake in the success of Paris, having presided over the previous conference in Copenhagen in 2009 that was widely derided as a failure, as it collapsed into scenes of chaos in the final hours. “For Hollande’s administration, this is not just about the climate: it is about the government’s political survival,” one prominent global official told the Guardian. “They need this to be a success, to have something to celebrate, as they’re in trouble in so many other areas of politics.” At the two-week summit, governments will meet under the auspices of the United Nations in the first attempt for six years to forge a new global agreement on climate change.  COP21, as it is known in the jargon, is seen as a make-or-break conference, the last chance for the two-decades-old UN process to bring nations together to tackle what many scientists regard as the biggest single threat to humanity. This week, governments will gather in Bonn for the last chance before the Paris conference to amend the text of the potential agreement. Previous such meetings have produced little progress, however. For Hollande, whose low poll ratings have seen him become the most unpopular French president on record, securing a climate change deal is crucial for his reputation at home.  France, marked by high unemployment and economic sluggishness, will go to the polls in regional elections while the climate talks are wrapping up in December, in two rounds on 6 and 13 December. Hollande, who still hopes to run for the presidency in 2017, will seek to use any successful deal to boost his standing. Will the climate diplomacy succeed? Elements of an agreement are slowly falling into place. Most countries, including all the biggest economies, have now submitted plans on their emissions to come into force after 2020, when current commitments expire. The US and China, the two biggest emitters, made a joint announcement on their emissions, for the first time, in a marked show of unity. But there is still no guarantee of success, and France has tried hard to learn the lessons of Copenhagen.  Although a “political declaration” was signed at that summit in 2009, with major developed and developing countries jointly agreeing emissions targets for the first time, it did not amount to the formal treaty that many had hoped for.  That omission, and scenes in which delegates burst into tears, appeared to show world leaders did not know what was going on, and bitter public recriminations showed off all the fault lines among nations, allowed detractors to claim it as a resounding failure. Many things will be different this time, Tubiana has promised. For instance, at Copenhagen the text of a potential deal was in tatters, too unwieldy to produce a formal treaty.  The text for Paris has been slimmed down to just over 20 pages, in a move the hosts hope will make it possible to sign it off in the two weeks of talks. World leaders, who arrived only at the end of Copenhagen, will land in Paris for the first day of talks, then hand over to their ministers and negotiators. Another key question is over financial assistance from richer to poorer countries. At Copenhagen, the developing world was promised $100bn (£65bn) a year would flow to them by 2020. Significant progress has been made on this, not least at the World Bank meeting last week, where its president announced a $29bn increase in climate finance. French diplomats have also been at pains to include civil society groups and businesses at a high level. Civil society groups were excluded from the final fraught day at Copenhagen, to their manifest disgust, which did not help how that conference was portrayed afterwards. “The French have done an excellent job,” says Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate chief, who has also been persuading world leaders to participate. “They have made a great effort.” Most of the world’s biggest economies have now publicly declared they want a deal. However, at the UN talks, small and desperately poor countries have just as much say as the richest. They may not be so happy to oblige. “The biggest problem with Paris is that it is in Paris,” one prominent participant told the Guardian privately, meaning that holding such a major meeting in a G7 country risks alienating poor nations, who often feel that their interests are overlooked in the race to get big economies to commit. The French can hardly help the location, and appear conscious of the need to draw in a broader coalition, sometimes using their historic ties to the French-speaking and French-influenced countries of Africa and Asia – a strategy that could backfire, given the colonial overtones.  But the charm offensive continued with President Hollande visiting Morocco recently. “We have a close cooperation with the Moroccans,” says Bermann. “I know there have been some problems but now cooperation is excellent so we’re keen to work with them.” If Paris succeeds, it will not be down only to the French government and its troupes of ministers, civil servants, ambassadors and negotiators. But if it fails, the French and the UN know they will cop the blame. Additional reporting by Angelique Chrisafis in Paris"
"Periodically, in the vast spans of time that have preceded us, our planet’s living beings have been purged by planetary catastrophes so extreme they make your typical Ice Age look like the geological equivalent of a stroll in the park. Scientists count just five mass extinctions in an unimaginably long expanse of 450 million years, but they warn we may well be entering a sixth. According to a bold new paper in The Anthropocene Review, this time would be different from past mass extinctions in four crucial ways – and all of these stem from the impact of a single species that arrived on the scene just 200,000 years ago: Homo sapiens.   “There is no point in apportioning blame for what is happening,” said lead author and geologist, Mark Williams, with the University of Leicester, since humans “didn’t deliberately engineer this situation.” “Rather we have to recognise that our impact is game-changing on this planet, that we are all responsible, and that we have to become stewards of nature – as a part of it, rather than behaving like children rampaging through a sweetshop,” Williams noted. The impacts of a still-avoidable sixth mass extinction would likely be so massive they’d be best described as science fiction. It would be catastrophic, widespread and, of course, irreversible. In the past, it has taken life ten to thirty million years to recover after such an extinction, 40 to 120 times as long as modern-looking humans have been telling tales by firelight. Moreover, Williams and his team argue that future changes driven by humanity may go so far as to create not just a new epoch in geologic history – such as the widely-touted Anthropocene – but a fundamental reshaping of Earth on par with the rise of microbes or the later shift from microbes to multicellular organisms.  “Fundamental changes on a planetary system scale have already begun,” said co-author Peter Haff, a geologist and engineer with Duke University. “The very considerable uncertainty is how long these will last – whether they will simply be a brief, unique excursion in Earth history, or whether they will persist and evolve into a new, geologically long-lasting, planetary state.” But what are these “fundamental changes” that would makes this mass extinction different from the previous five?  “Episodes of global warming, ocean acidification and mass extinction have all happened before, well before humans arrived on the planet,” co-author Jan Zaleasiewicz, a paleobiologist with the University of Leicester, said. “We wanted to see if there was something different about what is happening now.” Turns out there is.  The team of geologists and biologists say that our current extinction crisis is unique in Earth’s history due to four characteristics: the spread of non-native species around the world; a single species (us) taking over a significant percentage of the world’s primary production; human actions increasingly directing evolution; and the rise of something called the technosphere.  The first real change is what the authors of the study call the “global homogenisation of flora and fauna.” Basically what this means is that you can eat tomatoes in Italy, hunt oryx in Texas, ride horses in Chile, curse cane toads in Australia, dig earthworms in eastern North America and catch rats in the Galapagos. None of these things would have been possible without human intervention: our penchant for globetrotting has brought innumerable species to new habitats, often wreaking havoc on existing ecological communities and sometimes leading to extinctions.  Secondly, over the last few centuries, humans have essentially become the top predator not only on land, but also across the sea. No other species in the past can claim such a distinction. In doing so, humanity has begun using 25 to 40% of the planet’s net primary production for its own purposes. Moreover, we have added to this the use of fossil fuels for energy, essentially mining primary production from the past.  “It’s not hubris to say this,” Williams contended. “Never before have animal and plants (and other organisms for that matter) been translocated on a global scale around the planet. Never before has one species dominated primary production in the manner that we do. Never before has one species remodelled the terrestrial biosphere so dramatically to serve its own ends – the huge amount of biomass in the animals we eat.” Thirdly, humanity has become a massive force in directing evolution. This is most apparent, of course, in the domestication of animals and the cultivation of crops over thousands of years. But humans are directing evolution in numerous other ways, as well.  “We are directly manipulating genomes by artificial selection and molecular techniques, and indirectly by managing ecosystems and populations to conserve them,” said co-author Erle Ellis, an expert on the Anthropocene with the University of Maryland. He added that even conservation is impacting evolution.  “As human management of ecosystems and populations increases, even when aimed at conservation, evolutionary processes are altered. To sustain processes of evolution that are not guided by human societies intentionally and unintentionally will require a sea change in management approaches.” Finally, the current extinction crisis is being amplified by what the researchers call the technosphere.  Peter Haff coined the term technosphere just last year. He defines the technosphere as “the global, energy consuming techno-social system that is comprised of humans, technological artifacts, and technological systems, together with the links, protocols and information that bind all these parts together.”  Basically, the technosphere is the vast, sprawling combination of humanity and its technology. Haff argues that in our thousands of years of harnessing technology – including the first technologies like stone tools, wheels and crops – the technology itself has basically begun to act practically independently, creating a new sphere (i.e., like the biosphere or atmosphere or lithosphere), but like nothing the planet has ever seen before.  “I would argue that domesticated animals and plants, as well as humans, are parts of the technosphere,” said Haff. “These are in effect manufactured by the technosphere for its own use on the basis of genetic blueprints appropriated from the biosphere.” We’ve reached a point, according to Haff, where we can’t just shut technology off. As such, the technosphere as a whole is elevated above humanity. “In this sense, the technosphere already generates its own living tissue, thus integrating with biology,” noted Haff.  Although, humans were the original progenitors of this technology, we have, in effect, lost control. Like Doctor Frankenstein from Mary Shelley’s great novel, not only has our creation asserted its own agency, but it now wields its power over us.  Although the paper relies heavily on the idea of the technosphere as a primary driver of both the extinction crisis and current geological changes, not every researcher in the study agreed with the idea.  “I am a dissenter on the use of this term...I would have eliminated it if it were up to me alone. I find the term ‘technosphere’ neither appropriate nor accurate...It makes it appear that technology is the defining element of human alteration of the Earth system,” Ellis said, adding that “humans and societies create and sustain technologies, not the other way around – though of course there is a tight coupling of societies with technologies.” Ellis called such an idea not only “inaccurate,” but defeatist.  “[The concept of the technosphere] is politically and socially disenfranchising and alienating people and societies - and their potential to guide, at least to some degree, this global human force behind the anthropocene.” To Ellis the key is not the rise of technology, but rather humanity’s incredibly rich social life. He maintains that our “ultrasocialness” is the major driving force behind the changes on the planet we are witnessing today.  “It was behaviorally modern humans, with their ultrasocial behaviors and complex societies that spread across the Earth, became increasingly larger scale societies, ultimately gaining the capacity to transform the entire Earth. Technology is not the driver of Earth system change – social change is the cause of this.” But Haff insists that technology, not modern humans, is the “new and enabling ingredient” for global transformation – including the potential for mass extinction.  “The technosphere is not meant as a stand in or short hand for a supposed ‘novel human force’ in the earth system,” he explained. “The name ‘technosphere’ arose in part to discourage such an idea. There exists no such human force. What is present, and novel, is the collective system of many people and much technology.” Regardless of whether scientists stress the role of humans or technology in transforming the planet, the researchers all agree that the arrival of modern Homo sapiens has transformed the planet. But how much?  “If humans were to go extinct tomorrow, then our impact on the biosphere would be recognisable as an epoch boundary – like the boundary between the Pleistocene and Holocene,” Williams pointed out. “After us, a few tens to hundreds of thousands of years in the future, the biosphere would find a new equilibrium without us, and probably with its biodiversity largely intact.” Or as the paper puts it: “if the technosphere were to collapse what would remain is physical evidence of its history, as a preserved stratigraphic signal in the rocks. This will include a short-lived event bed of ‘urban strata’ and related deposits, recording rapid technospheric evolution and deep roots via preserved tunnels, mines and boreholes; a climate perturbation that might last [100-200,000 years] and a permanent reconfiguration of the biosphere...resulting from the effect of trans-global species invasions and a moderate- to large-scale mass extinction event.” Okay, but what if we don’t go extinct anytime soon?  “If the changes made to the biosphere by humans continue to accelerate and are sustainable, and if our interaction with the technosphere becomes a major component of Earth’s future trajectory, then the changes can be argued to be really fundamental,” Williams added.  The scientists argue then that the changes would be so extreme, and so unlike anything that the Earth has ever seen before, that it could represent a geological shift as big as the rise of microbes on the planet or the rise of multicellular organisms. For example, imagine a world where humans and their technology effectively control the global temperature through geo-engineering or a world where humans wholeheartedly and deliberately manipulate evolution for their own (or the technosphere’s) ends.  Zaleasiewicz said that while some researchers argue that such changes could turn out all right, most argue the still-developing Anthropocene “will mostly be a very bumpy ride for humanity, and for life in general, as it evolves,” adding that “previous perturbations of the Earth system have seen both winners and losers, so perhaps that is a more realistic scenario.”  The researchers are clear: we can’t go back in time, to some pre-human, arguably pristine environment.  “There is no ‘ending’: the challenges of the Anthropocene are permanent,” said Ellis. “Humanity and nature are inextricably coupled for the foreseeable future.” Moreover, according to Zaleasiewicz, the momentum is not on our side.  “There’s clearly a rapidly moving – and accelerating – dynamic involved, and it can be argued that this is needed and inevitable to feed, clothe and shelter and extra two to three billion people over the next few decades.” However, even with all that, the scientists say it’s not too late to avoid a total mass extinction and ecological meltdown.  “We are not in a mass extinction event yet, and it’s very important to emphasise that, because it means we can still make changes,” said Williams.  The scientists agree that to avoid mass extinction – and tackle the current environmental crisis – is possible but will require large-scale changes not only in how society operates but how humans view their relation to the natural world.  “It’s about recognising that we are stewards of nature and that every action we make will have an effect on the biosphere somewhere,” said Williams. “If at a very basic level we could get people to make that connection then we would have fundamentally changed human behavior.”  But how do we do this? “I think there are parallels with getting people to recognize that ‘drunk driving’ is a mistake or ‘wearing a seatbelt is a good thing,’” Williams went on. “I remember the campaigns from the 1970s and though this might sound glib, it’s fundamental to the problem. Humans are the problem, but they are also the solution.” Ellis agreed that humans must move on from the view that we are somehow separate from nature (or that nature somehow exists separate from us) and, instead, embrace our role as “permanent shapers and stewards of the biosphere and the species within it.”  He also sees several positive trends underway, including urbanisation, rising awareness of the plight of biodiversity, the increasing potential for societies to create change at large scales and the possibility of decoupling of the global economy from ecosystem destruction.  “Still, the large scale of modern societies is daunting,” Ellis cautioned, “and for these trends to reach their full potential will require far greater strategic effort – just letting things happen will not yield a better future.” According to him practical solutions “will require a combination of conservation, restoration, rewilding, engineering, emergence, and design.” “We must recognize that there is no option to ‘leave the Earth alone,’ “ Ellis added. “The responsibility for the future of the planet is ours now.” It’s a big responsibility – bigger than any other species on Earth has ever faced – and so far we’ve hardly proved ourselves up to it. But there is still time. And time means hope – but not without action. "
"This year is the 150th anniversary of the conquest of the Alps’ last major peaks, including the Grandes Jorasses and the Matterhorn – the culmination of a five-year flurry of Alpine first ascents. While these feats are being celebrated throughout the winter in a number of fascinating exhibitions, particularly in the Chamonix valley, it perhaps sounds odd now to talk of “conquests” in relation to nature. We have – sadly – effectively conquered her, and are awaiting the blowback of climate change: mountains are crumbling at alarming rates, glaciers are receding, whole valleys are being cut off by landslides. But a new, gentle approach to the high mountains is in evidence in a range of recent buildings that give both expert climbers and the general public the chance to understand these changes without leaving a heavy footprint. Some are remote, cutting-edge, autonomous, space-age pods accessed only by risky ascents in technical gear; others you can go and see in your flip-flops.  In the frenzied early period of Alpine exploration (and exploitation) the biggest target of all was the mighty Mont Blanc, an inhospitable wilderness in the heart of Europe culminating at 4,808 metres, which was conquered in 1786. The mountain shrugged off early attempts at development. Gustave Eiffel, not content with looming over Paris, attempted to dig the foundations for a lodge and observatory right at the summit. Scientist Joseph Vallot had more luck 500 metres lower down and installed – as you do – a lush oriental salon in his shelter (you can see it reconstituted in the Chamonix Alpine Museum). The magnificent new Refuge du Gouter, opened last year, stands in sharp contrast to this peak-bagging, colonial attitude: it is space-age eco-architecture, a uniquely beautiful and intelligent building, inside and out. The former refuge – sealed shut awaiting its fate – is a pock-marked metal shed sitting on shifting ice. In use, it was sub-par and often terribly overcrowded. The new refuge is built further along the precipice of the Aiguille du Gouter (the crumbling rock face that kills many climbers every year). It is a steel-clad wooden egg perched over the void on steel piles drilled six metres into the mountain, turning its nose to the prevailing wind and plastered in photovoltaic panels. Inside it is warm and minimalist, its chunky wooden frame complemented by pine benches, bunks and floors. The climbers’ bunk rooms – with wooden screens between the beds – are a vast improvement on the old refuge’s haphazard heap of bodies; food is also good and hearty, and the common areas are light and panoramic. Its heart is a submarine-like plant room regulating meltwater for consumption, storing electricity in huge batteries and compacting excrement for helicopter evacuation. • Half-board stay in dorm bed €93pp, refugedugouter.ffcam.fr. Getting to the refuge involves an exposed scramble up the Aiguille du Gouter, including the notorious Grand Couloir, which is subject to frequent rockfall; a guide is necessary. The Refuge is open June-late September or early October, and can close when the ascent becomes dangerous (sometimes for weeks). Check the website before travelling; reservations are essential. A spartan emergency bivouac adjacent to the old refuge is open all year round The challenge of designing responsibly for the mountains has attracted superstar Tate Modern architects Herzog and de Meuron to the relatively modest job of renovating a cable car station. Inaugurated in June this year and open all year round (with some inter-season closure), the Chässerug lift station sits on a plateau above the 2,000-metre precipice bordering the north side of the Walensee, about an hour from Zurich by car or train and bus. It offers a superb panorama over six countries and gives access to extensive summer and winter hiking and winter skiing.  Replacing a jerry-built canteen formerly on the site, the new building is sober, rugged and sensual, made entirely of locally sourced and crafted spruce – a far cry from the fake chalets that offer overpriced, mass-produced meals to hordes of skiers. The food here is well-executed local fare made with fresh, responsibly sourced ingredients (three courses from about £20). Building on such a remote site required great ingenuity – here the timbers we brought in using the existing cable car instead of by not-so-eco helicopters. • Adult ticket £33 return, including lunch, chaeserrugg.ch. Restaurant open all year except weekdays in October-November (weekend opening dependent on weather, winter opening according to snowfall, check the website). The lower lift station in Unterwasser is open 8.30am-5pm (winter hours).  If you don’t want to brave the climate change-accelerated rockfall on the Aiguille du Gouter, ponder the projecting egg of the new refuge from the place where early climbers would eye up the normal route up Mont Blanc. On the site of a stone-built 1868 establishment of the same name, the new Hotel Bellevue is another piece of pioneering eco-architecture from the great Austrian architect Hermann Kaufmann. Made from robot-milled wood, the building uses 10% of the energy of a conventional building thanks to geothermal energy, and high-spec insulation. The only hitch is that this exemplary building has been shut for the three years since it was finished because of a stand-off between the government and the owner, which is now trundling through the courts. It may open with some modifications: until them, enjoy looking at it from nearby Hotel Le Prarion. • Projected rate from €210 half-board for two, bellevuemontblanc.com. The hotel is accessible from the Bellevue ski lift from Les Houches or the nearby Tramway du Mont Blanc from Saint Gervais les Bains station. (This is a rack-and -pinion train rather than a tram, and runs to the start of the Aiguille du Gouter ascent at the Nid d’Aigle viewpoint). The Italian side of Mont Blanc is more spectacular than the Chamonix one: the mountain cascades right down to the valley in a series of forbidding crags and needles. The geography means the site is also much less developed, although it does see heavy traffic from the tunnel under the mountain. A new, wonderful piece of civic infrastructure, Skyway Monte Bianco could open up the mountain’s southern side to mass tourism, whisking visitors to Punta Helbronner at 3,452 metres on the French border in a few minutes. The Skyway, inaugurated in June this year by Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi (“We’re not invading France,” he declared at the time) replaces the old La Palud cable car. This resembled a 1950s Paris Metro carriage, and trembled as it climbed, its door secured only with a brass latch. The Skyway’s bulbous panoramic cars are glazed right to the floor, and revolve as they ascend. Easy to access directly from the tunnel road, the Skyway is a destination in itself for those who don’t want to strap on crampons. A mid-station features one of Europe’s highest Alpine gardens, a gift shop selling local produce, and a 150-seat conference room, a restaurant and even a winery, using grapes from the valley below. Some local guides grumble that such fripperies have no place in the high mountains, and the decor is more shopping mall than eco-lodge: I felt out of place here, sweaty and bedraggled after a long schlepp from the Grand Capucin, a mythical granite spire the other side of the Glacier du Géant. The vertiginous summit station is topped with a panoramic platform which gives a thrilling proximity to Mont Blanc’s mighty Brenva face, the spiny Dent du Géant and the vast bowl of the Vallée Blanche. The top station is bravura engineering: a jagged glass -and-steel carapace (with a very decent cafeteria), rooted in an 80-metre spine through the rock. The spine contains a lift shaft conveying more adventurous visitors to a chilly tunnel leading out on to the glacier and to the restored Torino Hut (where, from spring 2016, visitors will be able to spend a comfy night and watch a spectacular dawn over the Aosta valley). The Glacier du Géant is perfect for non-vertiginous trekking in a spectacular setting (a guide is necessary, as are crampons and ropes); it’s also an easier start than the precipitous Aiguille du Midi for the 13km Vallée Blanche ski run. Things can be deceptive, though: on 27 August, a 40,000-tonne chunk of the Tour Ronde collapsed suddenly, obliterating the path I had sauntered along a few weeks previously. It’s perhaps important that – thanks to the Skyway – tourists in flip-flops can directly witness such harbingers of climate change.• Skyway: return to Punta Hellbronner €43pp, montebianco.com, open all year round 8.30am-4.35pm in winter. Torino Hut: €70pp full-board, rifugiotorino.com. Check website for opening and booking details: hut managers tend to be independent-minded. National borders wiggle invisibly over summits and precipices: trudging breathlessly up Mont Blanc’s final arête, you won’t care that your right foot is in Italy and your left in France. But if you thought such an extreme environment would reduce architecture to a survivalist standardisation, you’d be wrong: even the remotest places, it seems, reflect national character. In Italy, burly, swarthy bergamaschi builders romp fearlessly across the snow as they work on the Torino Hut, whereas over the hill, French workers are diligently, carefully decommissioning the asbestos-infested old Refuge du Gouter. There’s even been some Alpine umbrage regarding the generous European funding of the Skyway: the French have yet to build their part of the path leading up to the spectacular exit at the top station, effectively closing the Schengen border between caffè ristretto and café allongé. Trust the Swiss, then, to be the smartypants with the deepest pockets in this mountain brinksmanship. The new Monte Rosa Hutte, stranded like a crashed UFO on a rock in the middle of the vast Gorner glacier, is an emblem of Helvetic pride, having been conceived with the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, and rather more lavishly funded (for the same capacity) than the Gouter hut. Open since 2010, 1,000 metres lower than its cousin on Mont Blanc, it uses some of the same approaches to eco-building (wood frame, tight volume, metal skin, abundant photovoltaics), with extras including a vast grotto blasted into the rock to store meltwater. It is the most complex wooden building ever made in Switzerland, and throws some demonstrative Daniel Libeskindian shapes, with its jagged stair glazing, where the French hut remains impassively rational in its eggy geometry. The location is different, too: the Monte Rosa Hutte sits at a hub of many climbs rather than on a highway with one destination, and can be accessed with relatively little danger (albeit with some ladders and a glacier crossing, which may require ropes and crampons). Where the Gouter hut keeper has to get used to his guests leaving en masse at 3am – with absolutely no desire for a return trip – the Monte Rosa Hutte incites a relaxing, contemplative stay in an utterly extraordinary setting.• Dorm bed £64pp half-board, including take-away hikers’ tea, section-monte-rosa.ch. Reservation essential. Open June-October, depending on weather conditions. Accommodation was provided by the Office de Tourisme de Chamonix and the Club Alpin Français provided guiding to Refuge du Gouter"

"Pacific island nations have pleaded with wealthy countries to help their people migrate and find work if they are forced to flee their homelands because of the consequences of climate change.  A coalition of low-lying island nations said moving people because of rising sea levels, storms and ruined agriculture was a last resort, but the “calamity” of climate change required industrialised countries to devise a plan. In a joint statement after a summit in Kiribati the Pacific nations – Fiji, Kiribati, Tuvalu and Tokelau – said they were “gravely concerned over the lack of effective international response to climate change” that posed “major existential challenges” to their populations and cultures. They repeated calls for an international body to be set up to coordinate population movement caused by climate change. The creation of such a body was included in an early draft of a UN agreement to be negotiated at climate talks in Paris in December but the idea was dropped last week. Australia opposed it, although countries including Britain, the US and France were open to the concept. The countries called for funding for health and education programs, and aid to raise buildings above predicted sea level increases and safeguard water supplies from saltwater intrusion. Wealthy nations should “prepare our people for ‘migration with dignity’, capable of contributing to other nations’ economies and development processes as skilled migrant workers”, the Pacific leaders said. Developing nations have access to the UN-administered green climate fund to help adapt to or mitigate climate change. In 2009 nations agreed at Copenhagen to provide $100bn in “climate finance” although this target has not been met and will be debated again at the Paris talks. There is no body that oversees the orderly movement of people because of climate change impacts. The UN refugee convention applies only to those fleeing persecution, with little appetite among the richest nations to expand its definition to include “climate refugees” – amid predictions that up to 250 million people may be displaced worldwide by 2050. People living on coral atolls in the Pacific are considered particularly vulnerable to a sea level that is rising by 1.2cm a year, four times faster than the global average. Coastal erosion, tainted water supplies and failing crops have prompted communities to move inland or to other islands.  Pacific leaders have taken an increasingly strident tone in calling for action, with Anote Tong, the president of Kiribati, recently calling Australia “very selfish” for its continued commitment to coalmining.  Peter Christian, the president of Micronesia, told a UN gathering in New York earlier this month: “I speak as an islander who has walked the shores of many atoll islands, where there was once sandy beaches and coconut trees. “Now there are none. I am told this will continue. We must become more cohesive in our actions to bring a useful conclusion to help mitigate the threat of sinking islands and prevent the potential genocide of Oceanic peoples and cultures.” The chief executive of Greenpeace Australia, David Ritter, said Australia should do more given its clout in the region. “Australia is the richest, largest country in the region, so to sit back and say we are doing enough is pathetic really,” said Ritter, who attended the Kiribati summit. “People in the Pacific are very polite but privately the view of Australia is very clear: this is a country not doing enough. There’s a view that Australia is putting coal ahead of people. “At the moment, if you are forced out of your home due to inundation you simply become stateless. There’s no mechanism to ensure that these people won’t fall through the cracks. When you go to Kiribati and see people trying to repair sandbagged seawalls, you can see why this is a live issue for them.”"

"A UN conference on climate in Paris this year will also be a “conference for peace”, given that global warming threatens the world’s security, a top French official said on Wednesday.  Government officials from several African and island nations gathered in Paris on Wednesday to discuss the implications of climate change for defense issues.   “Climate and international security are closely linked,” French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said. Major droughts, floods and famines force people to migrate and “increase the risk of conflicts”, he said.  In addition, making the transition to renewable energy sources will help ease power struggles over the control of oil and natural gas resources, Fabius added.  Defence ministers of neighbouring Chad and Niger described the growing desertification of Africa’s Sahel region as a multiplier of threats especially in the troubled Lake Chad region, which is facing frequent attacks by the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram.  Mahamadou Karidjo, Niger’s defence minister, said his government’s main concern was “to ensure that Nigerian people don’t starve to death” amid climate changes. Haitian defence minister, Lener Renauld, stressed the importance of curbing global warming. His Caribbean island is particularly vulnerable to climatic-related events. “I’m convinced that for this planet, there’s no plan B,” he said.  France is host a major UN climate change conference from 30 November to 11 December. "

"Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe have plunged to the lowest level ever recorded after the EU’s member states reported an estimated 23% drop in emissions between 1990 and 2014.  The bloc has now overshot its target for 2020 of cutting emissions by one-fifth – at the same time that its economy grew by 46%, according to the EU’s climate chief, Miguel Arias Canete.   “We have shown consistently that climate protection and economic growth go hand-in-hand,” he said. “This is a strong signal ahead of the Paris climate conference.” Diplomats are currently meeting in Bonn to try to thrash out a negotiating text for the Paris summit, amid concern that a slimmed-down 20-page proposal has crept back up to 34 pages, following objections from developing countries.   Negotiators in Bonn are likely to note that the pace at which Europe is greening its economy is stalling, according to the European Environment Agency (EEA), which collated the report. It projects that on current trends, EU emissions cuts will slow to 24% in 2020 and 27% in 2030.  This is substantially below a 40% emissions cut that EU states signed up to last October. Further measures planned by EU countries could add up to 3% to those figures, but new policies will also be needed before 2030, the report says.  “To achieve our longer-term goals for 2030 and 2050, a fundamental change is needed in the way we produce and use energy in Europe,” said the EEA’s director Hans Bruyninckx.  The new figures show that eight countries are on track to miss their binding renewable energy targets for 2020 – including the UK, Ireland and Spain.  The same number of states looks set to botch a 20% improvement in energy efficiency performance, with Germany, France and the Netherlands all underperforming.  France, the host of next month’s climate summit, is predicted to miss both targets. Austria, Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg are also predicted to flunk the 2020 emissions target. Britain, however has cut emissions 35% since 1990, according to the EEA figures, which may be revised pending official data submissions to the UN in 2016. Eastern European countries registered even steeper falls, due to the post-Soviet Union collapse of their heavy industries. Romania’s emissions fell by 56% and Lithuania’s by almost 60%. The EEA attributes the overall emissions drop to a combination of factors - economic recession, climate policies, measures to tackle fluorinated gases and a warm 2014, in which emissions dropped 4% overall. The study says that it will be “challenging” for the EU to achieve its 2030 goals of a 27% share of renewables in its energy mix, and 27% energy efficiency improvement.  Even if this is achieved, European countries will still have to double or even triple their emissions cutting efforts after 2030 to get onto a path that could limit global warming to 2C by mid-century.  Environmentalists called for a review of the EU’s Paris pledge.  “The news that the EU is on track to significantly overachieve its 2020 climate target means Europe can afford to move beyond its cautious offer for 2030, which doesn’t factor in this higher starting point,” said Louisa Casson, a spokesperson for the green thinktank E3G.

"Democratic contenders promised repeatedly to take forceful action against climate change in their first presidential debate on Tuesday night – even before they were asked.  Much to the disappointment of campaigners, CNN allocated just one question to climate change, outsourced to a member of the public, and relegated to the final segment of the two-hour encounter. But four of the five Democratic contenders – with Jim Webb, the former Virginia Senate the sole hold-out – grabbed every chance that came their way to inject climate change into the event. Bernie Sanders ranked climate change as the single biggest threat to America’s national security. “The scientific community is telling us: if we do not address the global crisis of climate change, transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to sustainable energy, the planet that we’re going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren may well not be inhabitable,” Sanders said. “That is a major crisis.” Martin O’Malley touted his plan to purge fossil fuels from America’s energy supply within the next few decades.  Hillary Clinton recounted the time she roamed the hallways of a cavernous conference hall in Copenhagen looking for Chinese leaders who could make a deal to cut carbon pollution, and defended her position on the Keystone XL pipeline. “I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone,” Clinton said. Clinton went on to say she had been committed to fighting climate change since 2009, when she and Barack Obama hunted down the Chinese leadership at the Copenhagen climate conference to try to reach a deal to cut carbon pollution.  “I have been on the forefront of fighting climate change, starting in 2009, when President Obama and I crashed a meeting on the Chinese and got them to sign up for the first international agreement to combat climate change that they’d ever joined,” she said. “We marched up, we broke in, we said, ‘we’ve been looking all over for you, let’s sit down and talk about what we need to do,’ and we did come up with the first international agreement China has signed.” Lincoln Chaffee proudly claimed to be on the coal industry’s enemies list.  The candidates’ attention to the topic, in sharp contrast to CNN, reinforced the importance of climate change for Democratic primary voters.  Environmental groups had been looking to candidates to provide concrete details of their plans to fight climate change. “One question simply isn’t enough time to discuss our greatest challenge,” Tom Steyer, the billionaire climate activist, said in a statement. “We must add a debate exclusively focused on climate change solutions and clean energy.” The candidates mentioned climate change a dozen times during the two-hour encounter – far more than during five hours of Republican debates. The encounter confirmed that Democratic contenders feel under strong pressure from party activists to demonstrate their climate change credentials.  To date, Sanders and O’Malley have been the most forceful when calling for action to fight climate change, and describing the threat posed by climate change.  Clinton used the debate to play catch-up, putting to rest concerns about her position on Keystone XL during her time as secretary of state. Clinton came out in opposition to the project in September. In 2010, as Secretary of State, she had said she was inclined to support the pipeline."
"Apart from the federal cabinet itself, Australia’s defence planners are a relatively small group – no more than two dozen decision-makers – and after Tony Abbott abolished the office of the National Security Adviser held by Dr Margot McCarthy, they are almost exclusively white, middle-aged, Anglo-European males. Many have a military background; all have been initiated into the operations of the intelligence agencies; all are respectful of the American alliance. While some have had diplomatic experience in the region – notably in Indonesia and China – almost all view the world through the reassuring prism of our “Five Eyes” intelligence relationship with the US. They are not altogether homogenous. There are variations of age, background, education and personality. There are traditionalists to whom the communist menace lives on. There are rock-ribbed racists who conceal their atavism behind a clubby politesse. There are warriors to whom the resort to arms is the only credible response to international disagreements. Happily, they are balanced by a well-read, highly intelligent and perceptive brigade who abhor human combat except in the last degree.   As the 21st century gathered momentum through its second decade, they were confronted by the defence planner’s ultimate nightmare: international disorder caused by climate change. For despite the views held by former prime minister Tony Abbott and a motley combination of rightwing extremists, greedy miners and professional controversialists, the ice is melting, the seas will rise, tornadoes are becoming more powerful, droughts longer and more intense, bushfires ever more destructive, and adequate food and water supply ever more problematic. An Australian Strategic Policy Institute report published in March 2013 warned that global warming “has generated little interest in either the ADF or the Defence Department, [yet] climate change is transforming the conventional roles of security forces. As a threat multiplier, it has the potential to generate and exacerbate destabilising conditions that could reshape the regional security environment”. The report confined itself to generalities. But it was plain to the planners and environmental scientists alike that no one could tell exactly how the Australian mainland will fare. As tropical conditions move south, for example, they might well bring higher rainfall to some marginal areas, while other more settled country crumbles to dust.  But Australia is so big that in all likelihood it will be able to sustain itself almost indefinitely. The threat will come from those countries thrown into chaos around the globe with hundreds of millions of refugees in search of a place to live. Australian sovereignty will be under continuous hazard. Indeed, nationalism itself will be disputed in a world where the ravages of climate ignore all man-made borders. In such a world, Australia’s security – as descendants of an invading force that dispossessed its original owners, with barely a backward glance a mere two centuries ago – is less manifest and incontestable than we might have hoped. This means that we must secure our coastline with a substantial and well-equipped navy and air force. But even more important, it seems, are international alliances with the great powers who would underwrite – with force if necessary – the right of nations such as Australia to decide (in John Howard’s immortal phrase) “who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come”.  The first of those great forces would, of course, be the US, but unfortunately the words of President Barack Obama in a frank interview with the New York Times in August 2014 were already looking prophetic. “Our politics are dysfunctional,” he said. Gerrymandering, the Balkanisation (ie fragmentation) of the news media and uncontrolled money in politics – the guts of his country’s political system – were sapping America’s ability to take big decisions. Clearly, Australia must seek alternatives, and they must be as close to home as possible. The big three in the planners’ focus are China, Indonesia and India. But there are obvious impediments to Australia seeking the firm alliances required. Most are historical rather than practical. China is decidedly at the wrong end of the Five Eyes telescopes. But as the two economies become ever more complementary, the momentum for change might well become difficult to resist. During his first journey there as prime minister, Tony Abbott promised a new urgency in negotiations for a free trade agreement. It is a complex document but among the most serious sticking points was China’s call for an investment regime comparable to that applied by Australia to the US. Americans could invest up to $1bn without referral to the Foreign Investment Review Board (Firb), whereas most Chinese investments were subject to Firb disapproval. While the effect is more symbolic than real – since the board waved through almost all investment proposals – it was an important issue of face to the Chinese. Similar problems needed to be overcome in the developing relationship with Indonesia. Though good progress had been made behind the intelligence curtains, and a new “understanding” negotiated, SBY had departed. No doubt he warned his successor, Joko Widodo, a foreign policy tyro, that their southern neighbour was at best politically unreliable.  This was reflected in Jokowi’s refusal to bow to Australia’s plea for the commutation of the death sentences on reformed drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran carried out in April. And the subsequent revelation of Australian payments to people smugglers to return their human cargo to Indonesia only confirmed it. But at least the Americans would favour a closer relationship with a newly democratised country that to date had kept its Muslim extremists in check. India was an unknown quantity; work had begun to remedy the situation but, in any major climate change disruption, the populous subcontinent might well provide a source of Australia’s unwanted immigrants rather than an official bulwark against their unregulated intrusions. The Aspi report highlighted the 250 million people living in the river deltas of Asia, a large proportion in the Ganges–Brahmaputra deltas where they were at “extreme risk” from rising sea levels. Dr David Brewster, a visiting fellow at the ANU’s College of Asia and the Pacific, says, “Australia recognises India as an important new security partner in the Indo-Pacific, but India is only beginning to see Australia as a useful partner. For India, in some ways, Australia represents a difficult case. India has no direct security interests in our immediate area and Australia’s close relationship with the United States sometimes creates political unease in New Delhi”.  Both countries, he says, have “concerns” about China. But these “should not be elevated as the moving cause of the relationship ... in short, if Australia wishes to enhance its security and defence relationship with India it must be prepared to act outside its comfort zone”. Should we face an existential crisis, the experience of the second world war has taught us that the old Anglophone ties are tenuous at best, and at worst a serious impediment to our territorial integrity. It would be foolish indeed to rely solely on the US to guarantee our national security at a time of unbridled global turbulence.  But that requires an intense reassessment of our national priorities. It involves a profound reordering of our self-perception, from an Anglophile colonial regime to a more realistic and enduring Asia-Pacific nationality blessed with a firm institutional foundation and an adventurous cosmopolitan population. At the same time, the convergence between the special forces pillars has continued. Duncan Lewis’s appointment as director general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) marks the first time since the legendary Colonel Spry that a military careerist steeped in the special forces ethos has headed Australia’s top intelligence agency. Within the ADF the movement towards a greater role for special forces is gaining traction. General Angus Campbell’s elevation to the command of Operation Sovereign Borders had opened the way for the special operations commander Gus Gilmore to be appointed deputy chief of army. He immediately took the opportunity to engage with Peter Jennings at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.  The result was one of the more significant documents in the evolution of Australia’s armed forces. Published in April 2014, it recognised that the traditional “Big Army” was not well suited to a security environment where the great set battles of the 20th century had been replaced by smaller and more concentrated global operations in disparate terrain: Over the past decade the Australian special operations capability has proven to be a major asset for the Australian government. Its specific skill set, developed over the years, is likely to become more, not less, important to the new strategic environment. Looking to the future, special operations capability could be further upgraded relative to the regular Army, which might be cut as part of a ‘peace dividend’. It recommended that Special Operations Command (SOCOMD) be given control of much of its own budget, “In the same way that other specialist organisations, such as the Australian Signals Directorate, have a capability development budget that’s managed in house”. It also recommended the creation of a joint capability manager within the ADF – preferably the vice-chief of the defence force – to ensure that major ADF projects, such as the future submarines and amphibious equipment purchases, be coordinated with the needs of special operations. The regular army should retain control of conventional combat operations, it said, but:  Special Forces offer the best value in unconventional operations and in so-called Phase Zero missions which focus on building and shaping defence relationships with key partners in a pre-crisis environment. SOCOMD has a lot to offer in Defence’s regional engagement strategy ... Augmentation of its capacity to contribute to regional and (limited) global defence engagement would be a valuable investment. It needs to have knowledge of allied and friendly country practices. This would require a SOCOMD presence in selected headquarters in Australia’s near region. “That’s where our security interests are most closely engaged,” the report said, “and proximity would make it easier for other ADF elements to provide support for operations as required.” It recommended establishing special forces liaison officers in selected Australian embassies in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, “of which Indonesia is the most important”. In the South Pacific, fostering special forces cooperation with Papua New Guinea and Fiji should be a priority. Increased special forces engagement with South-East Asian nations could lead to the establishment of a special forces regional training centre in Australia. “The centre could also link to existing training centres beyond the Asia-Pacific region, such as Nato’s Special Operations Headquarters.” And in a groundbreaking recommendation it advocated “an intensification” of cooperation with Chinese special forces. “Defence should promote cooperation between SOCOMD and its Chinese counterpart,” the report said.  “This would be a confidence-building measure in Australia–China military-to-military relations as well as a burden-sharing contribution to the US alliance. Exercises related to counterterrorism and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief would be well suited for this purpose.” Nevertheless, it said, “maintaining and strengthening special forces cooperation with our US ally is vital ... while an agreement was recently signed for a SOCOMD liaison post at US Pacific command, similar arrangements could be considered with US central command and US Africa command to facilitate Australian special operations in the Middle East and Africa.” It was a powerful contribution, generally well received within the establishment, except by the usual “Big Army” traditionalists with their obvious self-interest.  However, mention of Africa raised the vexed issue of the “secret” SAS 4 Squadron with its longstanding African focus. The paper neatly avoided confirming their existence by implying that such missions “might be needed in the future”.  “Clandestine operations which involve military personnel in ways other than uniformed and declared military operations could become important for Australia’s special forces,” it said. “If the government decides to use SOCOMD in this way, we need an unambiguous legislative framework and robust oversight mechanisms.” Ironically, it is America’s global rival, China, with no declared special forces operatives on the African continent, whose economic initiatives might well become a more effective weapon against the prophets of disorder.  However, growth among the various economies is uneven. Inequality is rising in many areas and violence continues to simmer in the Central African Republic, South Sudan and elsewhere. In Kenya, where Australian special forces have long enjoyed a close association, economic advances have been patchy and violence is increasing. The scourge of Aids has taken a terrible toll across the continent; outbreaks of Ebola and other killer diseases have ravaged communities and set back tentative economic advances. And nowhere is climate change more obvious, as the Sahara advances south at frightening speed. Clearly, Africa will become a battlespace in the war against a loosely allied grouping of terrorists fired by the zeal of Islamist fundamentalism and simmering resentment against Western colonial exploitation. While it will be hard fought – and Australia’s contribution will be strictly limited – it is by no means a lost cause.  It is only one of the fronts on which the battle will be joined. Already, the US has been drawn back into Iraq to confront the vicious Isis advances, with Australia once again in full-throated support from the government if not the people. In China, the Uighurs have begun armed attacks in their native Xinjiang Province, while terrorist teams have conducted knife-wielding outrages as far south as Yunnan. Yang Shu, the director of the Institute for Central Asian Studies at Lanzhou University, says more attacks can be expected. “For Islamist extremists in China,” he says, “there’s also this issue of ethnic identity and that adds to extremist hatred.” In Indonesia, returning fighters from Syria and Iraq are already organising terrorist cells in West Java and Northern Sumatra.  Australia’s defenders will themselves have to become as nimble and adaptable as their enemy. The stakes can hardly be overstated. It is a task that will demand nothing less than the best of us. And the most perceptive of the planners have already reached the view that the most effective response lies within the pillars of our special forces.  They draw their inspiration from the critical nature of the battle itself. But they are sustained by the knowledge of all those who went before, from the independent companies such as Sparrow Force who struggled against the Japanese tide when all contact with the home base was lost; to the jungle fighters of Borneo and Vietnam and East Timor; and to the troopers in the hellfire of ambush in the dusty mountain passes of Oruzgan. All served Australia well. They did what was asked of them and more. Now they, the warrior elite, stand on those broad shoulders as they face the longest, toughest fight of all."

"A commercial fisherman who admitted to once pillaging the oceans has won the 2015 Fuller Challenge, one of the most important prizes in sustainability. Bren Smith, executive director of nonprofit GreenWave, took home $100,000 for his 3D ocean farming model, designed to address overfishing, mitigate climate change, restore marine ecosystems and provide jobs for fishermen.  Announced today by the Buckminster Fuller Institute, the prize is reserved for designers, scientists and students developing whole systems solutions to humanity’s most pressing problems. “We have a very rigorous selection process,” said Elizabeth Thompson, executive director of the Buckminster Fuller Institute, which was founded in 1983 by the daughter and grandson of visionary architect and systems theorist “Bucky” Fuller. This year, however, the winner doesn’t come from an environmental or scientific background. A high school dropout, Smith went to work various commercial fishing jobs, from Bristol Bay, Alaska, to Lynn, Massachusetts. By the time he was 19, he had already begun to realize the need to address overfishing, but it would be several years before he developed a model that would not have a detrimental environmental impact. “GreenWave is a real example of what Fuller meant when he talked about what one person can do on behalf of humanity,” Thompson said. “We’re looking for ideas that are replicable and verifiable. You have to prove that what you’re proposing is achievable”. Smith, based in New Haven, Connecticut, has now perfected a vertical ocean farming system that only grows restorative crops, such as seaweed and shellfish, to produce food, fertilizer, animal feed, cosmetics and biofuel. Each species is carefully selected to address a certain environmental challenge, such as fixing excess nitrogen, in the case of oysters, or seaweed that soaks up carbon dioxide. Requiring zero input, such as fertilizer, these farms are designed to have a negative carbon footprint. They are also working to train a new generation of farmers whose production model will have a restorative environmental impact. GreenWave has created an open source model that anyone in the world is free to replicate. GreenWave is in the process of developing eight farms from southern new England to New York. The group also has a hatchery and is currently building a food truck, which Smith says will be the ambassador of a new cuisine inspired by these farms. They are also developing what they’re calling a seafood hub in Fair Haven, Connecticut, to package and distribute crops from new and existing farms. Thompson said GreenWave hits all of the Institute’s core criteria. She called it an incredible model of how we can respond to the die-off of commercial fisheries, a solution for the livelihood of fishermen and their families, while growing nutritious food at scale. She added: “Humanity-centered design solutions are successful if they inspire spontaneous cooperation, convey a sense of urgency, and are implemented without ecological harm or the disadvantage of others.” GreenWave was selected from a pool of 400 entries representing work being done in 136 countries. Smith said he intends to use the $100,000 to shift from applied concept to actual replication. Prior to starting GreenWave, Smith worked a variety of commercial fishing jobs “all over the globe”, including long lining for McDonald’s in the Bering Sea and “sliming” in Alaska canneries. In his work, he admits “ripping up entire ecosystems”, fishing illegally in protected water and throwing “thousands of pounds of dead by-catch back into the sea”.  He then turned to aquaculture farming in Canada as a more sustainable occupation. “Aquaculture was supposed to be the great answer to overfishing, ” Smith said during a TEDx Talk in Bermuda. “It turned out to be just as destructive, using new technologies, chocking fish full of medicine, antibiotics, polluting local waterways – just for a terrible tasting, low-quality food.” He told the Guardian it wasn’t until hurricanes Irene and Sandy that he really started to think of new ways to address some of the problems we face, including overfishing and climate change, growing new sources of fuel and capturing carbon and nitrogen. “When two hurricanes in a row wiped out my oysters and dragged my gear out to sea, it was clear to me this is the new normal,” he said. “So, I really had to adapt.” Each of Smith’s model farms includes hurricane-proof anchors on the edges. Within its boundaries, seaweed, mussels and scallops hang from floating ropes. Oysters grow in cages below the ropes, and cages of clams hang beneath them. GreenWave farms also harvest salt. Kelp soaks up five times as much carbon as land-based plants while oysters filter 50 gallons of water a day, pulling out nitrogen, according to Smith. He also said GreenWave is capable of producing 30 times more biofuel than soybeans and five times more biofuel than corn – without polluting the food chain. “I think it allows us to take the crisis of climate change and flip it into an opportunity to really innovate in sustainable ways,” he said. “Anybody with 20 acres, a boat and $30,000 can start a farm and be up and running within a year.” GreenWave provides new farmers with grants, low-cost seed, free outdoor gear from Patagonia and training for two years. And they guarantee to purchase 80% of crops over five years at triple the market rate. The crops are then sold to restaurants around the country. “It’s a stunning, relatively simple, fully-integrated strategy,” Thompson said. “Implemented at scale, it will have an enormous impact.” "
"International Energy Agency (IEA) projections that show the world will continue its heavy reliance on fossil fuels deep into this century are uncertain and being used to mislead governments and shareholders, according to a new report. The fossil fuel industry commonly cites modelling by the IEA, an intergovernmental organisation considered to be an authoritative source of information on energy, which finds demand for their products increasing until at least 2040.  But analysts at the London-based Carbon Tracker thinktank found IEA models were based on high-end assumptions about global population and economic growth. In additon, the agency has failed to track the exponential growth of the renewable energy industry. An IEA spokesman defended the agency’s modelling: “We stand by our analysis. We also think that the world’s climate goals should not rely on a hope that there are fewer people in the world or that they are all poorer.” But he said that the IEA’s reports were not predictions of the future, instead they were a guide to inform policy makers, shareholders and industry of the consequences of certain courses of action. “These are projections and are not forecasts,” he said. “Of course, other paths are possible.” Yet these projections are often stated as fact by companies and industry advocates. “Energy demand will be significant. The IEA says it will be up by almost 40% by 2040,” Shell CEO Ben van Beurden told an Opec seminar in June. Shell often cited this demand as the justification for their now-failed Arctic drilling venture. In December, governments from more than 190 countries are expected to meet in Paris and sign a deal that pledges to limit global warming to at least 2C. Last week the bosses of 10 major oil and gas companies signed a statement urging governments to meet this goal.  But in shareholder reports, the same companies refer to the IEA’s baseline scenario, which accounts for existing policies and the broad commitments made by nations toward carbon emissions reduction and which the agency says will lead to a devastating 4C increase in global temperature. In its most recent company report, Shell told shareholders the IEA “central scenario” predicted fossil fuels’ share of the energy mix would drop just 6% to 75% over the next 25 years, while total energy demand continues to rise. In 2040, said Shell, investors would live in a world in which demand for oil and gas was 14% and 55% greater than today. Shell did not respond to a request for comment. ExxonMobil’s in-house energy demand estimates are slightly lower than the IEA’s own, yet its CEO, Rex Tillerson, has warned that expansion of the oil industry was vital or else “everybody’s lights would be going off before not too long”. Australia’s energy minister also quoted the IEA last week while putting forward what he called the “moral case” for coal. Carbon Tracker’s research director James Leaton said shareholders in fossil fuel companies were having their money spent on projects that relied on high demand and high prices long into the future. “Shareholders may never see the returns they were promised,” he said. Rather than being a “central scenario” as Shell called it in their reporting to shareholders, Leaton said “the scenarios presented by the companies are at the high end of the range of potential outcomes – so for investors this only leaves a potential downside with demand destruction”. “This is true,” said senior modelling analyst at Thompson Reuters Point Carbon, Yan Qin. “IEA provides three policy scenarios to provide more flexibility regarding the assumptions. But this is not sufficient and IEA should be more transparent regarding the sensitivities of its key assumptions.” The Carbon Tracker report found that the cumulative impact of a world of low population and economic growth and a continued renewable energy boom would cut energy demand even lower than the IEA’s low emissions scenario, which keeps the world within 2C of warming. In this scenario, fossil fuels account for just 60% of energy mix in 2040. The IEA was seperately criticised on Friday for a “deeply misleading” report which highlights the socioeconomic benefits of coal, published under its auspice but written by the coal industry. The IEA (along with almost all energy analysts) has consistently failed to grasp the disruptive potential of renewable energy and new technologies to rapidly change the energy landscape. Even Shell estimates far more electricity will be generated by solar and wind in 2040 than predicted by the IEA’s central scenario.  “There has often been a certain lack of sophistication when it comes to forecasting future energy demand,” America’s chief of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, Ethan Zindler, told the Guardian. “As Yogi Berra once said, making predictions is hard, particularly when you’re talking about the future. But no question about it, IEA clearly was behind the curve in some of its projections for clean energy.” “In modelling, one should also consider the paradigm shift or non-linear changes in the trends,” said Qin. The closest any group has gone to accurately forecasting the rise and rise of green energy is Greenpeace, however they recently told Vox they did not make long term predictions, but decided on the future they desired and created scenarios to fit. This is similar to the fossil fuel industry choosing the IEA’s baseline, which closer aligns to their interests. The IEA’s spokesman said: “The differences that have occurred between actual levels of renewables generation and projected levels in [our past reports] really just serve to reinforce the point that the IEA has made for a long time: that policies do matter.”"

"Twenty-four states have filed lawsuits against Barack Obama’s rules for cutting carbon pollution from power plants, the first wave of a much-anticipated legal and political onslaught against his climate change plan. The challenge filed on Friday asked a federal court in Washington DC, to strike down the power plant rules, thus gutting the heart of Obama’s climate plan.  John Hoeven, a Republican Senator from North Dakota, said on Friday he would introduce two separate resolutions challenging the rules for new and existing power plants. He said in a statement that the rules would make it virtually impossible to build new plants in his state. Administration officials have said repeatedly they believe they are in a strong position to beat back both sets of challenges. But the lawsuits and the initiatives in Congress send a powerful message to the international community ahead of the Paris climate conference next month that Obama faces significant opposition to his efforts to cut America’s carbon pollution and sign on to a global deal to fight climate change. Obama is leaning heavily on the power plant rules as evidence of his efforts to fight climate change in the US – and so help lead other countries to an international agreement. In addition to their efforts against the EPA rules, Republicans in Congress are trying to block Obama from joining an international climate agreement without first securing Senate approval. The EPA rules under attack on Friday would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants by 32% by 2030 on 2005 levels, delivering the biggest single cut in America’s carbon pollution. In the first wave of lawsuits, filed in the US court of appeals for the DC circuit, the states and Murray Energy Corp, a coalmining company, accuse the Environmental Protection Agency of exceeding its authority by requiring states to lower their carbon pollution, a standard which will compel power companies to shutter coal-fired power plants and source more of their electricity from cleaner forms of energy. “The Clean Power Plan is one of the most far-reaching energy regulations in this nation’s history,” Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia’s attorney general, said in a statement. He called the rules a “blatant and unprecedented attack on coal”. Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin, Wyoming, the Arizona corporations commission, and the North Carolina department of environmental quality have also joined the lawsuit. The National Mining Association, a leading coal lobbying group, also sued the EPA on Friday. Gina McCarthy, the EPA administrator, said the agency was on solid legal ground.  “The Clean Power Plan has strong scientific and legal foundations, provides states with broad flexibilities to design and implement plans, and is clearly within EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act,” McCarthy said in a statement.  “We are confident we will again prevail against these challenges and will be able to work with states to successfully implement these first-ever national standards to limit carbon pollution, the largest source of carbon emissions in the United States.” Obama launched his climate change plan in mid-2013, and the EPA rules were issued in early August. But the lawsuits could not go ahead until Friday, when the rules were finally published. In addition to the legal challenges, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has said he will invoke a little-used piece of legislation that enables members of Congress to vote down new rules by a simple majority. The White House has said it would veto any effort in Congress to overturn the EPA rules. Republicans are also trying to block the US from signing on to a climate deal in Paris by requiring Obama to submit any agreement to approval by the Senate.  “I believe we, as the Senate, should support basic oversight responsibilities,” Jim Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, said this week. “President Obama and his administrative officials are going out of their way to circumvent the role of the US Senate in this negotiating process.”"
"It was a sun-drenched afternoon, with another autumnal heatwave cooking the concrete of Los Angeles, but Joanne Pilecki hugged her green fleece close as she stepped into a cinema foyer. “I don’t take the cold too well,” said the 61-year-old, adjusting to the abrupt drop in temperature. “I have a sweater with me all the time.” Without it she would feel like an icicle by the end of The Intern, even though it was supposedly a heartwarming comedy. “I’m always cold. On planes I bring my own blankets.”   Other cinema-goers, in contrast, came precisely because it was cool, said Cerise Cobbs, who was manning the ticket booth at the Third Street Promenade shopping centre in Santa Monica. “Folks who don’t have good air con at home come, especially at weekends – they say they’ve got to get out of the house.” Too hot, too cold, just right – Americans may differ over where to set the dial but they agree air conditioning is integral to modern life. It is ubiquitous, whirring in homes, offices, stores, schools, elevators, factories, cars, trains, gyms, stadiums, tunnels, a communion of cool stretching from California to New York.  “It’s made its way into American life,” said Salvatore Basile, author of Cool: How Air Conditioning Changed Everything. “This idea for millennia that God made hot weather so you should put up with it – that attitude has relaxed.” But with the vertiginous rise of the “cold economy” – and the energy it demands – becoming more and more visible, there is finally a growing awareness of the problem in the US.  New York City recently passed a law that will oblige nearly all shops and restaurants to keep front doors and windows shut while air conditioners are on, a response to the practice of wooing sweaty passers-by with the promise of chilled respite. Innovators are promising more efficient devices in the next decade, including one that makes and stores ice cheaply at night to cool buildings during the day, from a California firm called Ice Energy. Only now is the US waking up to the environmental cost of such massive energy consumption – and to the chilling prospect that the rest of the world may follow its example. The proportion of homes in Chinese cities with air conditioning rocketed from 8% to 70% between 1995 and 2004.  US statistics are bracing. A nation with 318 million people accounting for just 4.5% of world population consumes more energy for air conditioning than the rest of the world combined. It uses more electricity for cooling than Africa, population 1.1 billion, uses for everything.  Vehicle air conditioners in the US use 7bn to 10bn gallons of petrol annually. Each home with an air conditioner emits about two tonnes of carbon dioxide into the air each year, according to the US department of energy.  Air conditioners employ the same operating principles as refrigerators: transfer heat from the cool interior, be it a fridge, room or building, to the relative warmth outside.  This can contribute to an urban heat island effect. A study found that AC units in Phoenix, Arizona, heat the night-time air temperature outside by up to 2C which, of course, encourages residents to blast even more air conditioning to compensate. New York’s subway stations bake in summer at more than 48C, partly because air-conditioned trains are pumping out heat. Freakishly hot weather across the US increases the temptation to ratchet up air conditioning, especially in California, which has endured record heat along with massive wildfires and a drought. During the summer, energy providers often implore people to reduce their use of air conditioners and other devices to avoid crashing the grid.  Silicon Valley is another guzzler. The water used to cool California’s estimated 800 data centres each year could fill approximately 158,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.  Reducing energy consumption can be tricky, according to Aaron James, a professor of philosophy and ethics at the University of California, Irvine. “People often feel a sense of entitlement about what they have become accustomed to. So even if it wouldn’t be asking much – a small behavioural change in the face of a severe problem – it can make us feel morally defensive.” Filling a recycling bag that neighbours may see, for instance, can feel more important and virtuous than lowering the AC. “In the US there’s not an established awareness of air conditioning as a climate change problem,” said James, the author of Assholes: A Theory. Air conditioning, it should be stressed, is an important economic and social technology. It saves lives. An average of 618 people in the US die each year from exposure to excessive natural heat, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a far cry from a century ago when heat killed thousands. It also cuts absenteeism and raises productivity. In a 1957 survey, 90% of US firms named cooled air as the single biggest boost to their productivity. Nelson Polsby, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who died in 2007, suggested air conditioning also reshaped American politics by enabling Republican pensioners to migrate to southern and western states, paving Reagan’s way to the White House. “Air conditioning probably did foster migration in the Sun Belt,” said Jack Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College. “How many people want to endure Orlando in mid-August without air conditioning? Without it, Disney World would be more like Devil’s Island.” The technology also influenced the Hollywood blockbuster. In the early 20th century few braved sweltering cinemas in summer. That changed once they installed air conditioning – an innovation advertised with letters dripping with icicles. It remains a selling point to this day. AMC Theatres, the US’s second largest cinema chain, keeps the temperature at 21C in winter and 23C in summer. Bar Armageddon, the technology is here to to stay, said Basile. “It’s not possible to go back once you’ve been going forward. From a philosophical standpoint I, an air-conditioning junkie, can’t tell someone they can’t have it.” He feels, however, that the US overuses the technology. “I noticed that cooled spaces in the UK were comfortable, but nowhere near as icy-frigid as their American counterparts.” With billions of people in warm climates wanting “bearable lives”, the race for efficiency is rather urgent, according to Basile. He is optimistic. “We will get more bang for our buck.”"
"Keskin, yanık ve metali hatırlatan çok çok güçlü bir koku. Yıldırım Biçici “işte bu kömür kokusu” diyor. Kahvehanecilikle geçimini sağlayan Biçici’nin evi kırmızı-beyaz bacalarından pis dumanlar çıkaran, orta Anadolu’nun büyük, yaşlı kömür santraline sadece bir kaç yüz metre uzakta. On yıllardır bu dumanın ortasında yaşayan Biçici şimdi de kendisini ülkenin yeni kömüre hücum dalgasının tam ortasında buldu: Afşin-Elbistan kömür santralinin dünyanın en büyük kömür santrali olmak üzere büyütülmesi planlanıyor. Goğulhan köyünün eski meydanında ahşap taburelerde oturup konuşurken Biçici şunlar söylüyor: “Sigara kutularının üzerinde bile sigara içmeyin uyarısı olduğu halde bize burada hiç bir seçenek bırakılmadı.” Keskin kokulu havayı dağıtmak ister gibi elini sallayarak sözlerini şöyle sürdürüyor Biçici: “Biz burada sigara içmek zorundayız.” Biçici’nin annesi akciğer kanserinden hayatını kaybetmiş- “bunun nedeninin hava kirliliği olduğunu biliyoruz” diyen Biçici’nin dört yaşındaki kızı Gülbeyaz da kronik bronşit hastası. Biçici “havanın güzel olduğu zamanlarda bile çocuğumuzu dışarı çıkaramamak bizi çok üzüyor” demekte. Türkiye’nin kömür bağlantılı çok büyük projeleri var. Bu projeler bir boru hattı ile birbirine bağlı 80’den fazla yeni santralden oluşmakta ve Birleşik Krallığın bütün enerji sektörünün toplam kapasitesine eşit bir üretim hacmine sahip. Bu kömüre hücum hareketinin ölçeği yeryüzünde Çin ve Hindistan’dan başka hiçbir ülkeyle kıyaslanamayacak kadar büyük. Bu proje, dünya ülkelerinin iklim değişikliğiyle mücadele için Paris’te Aralık ayında yapılacak kritik zirvede anlaşmaya varmak zorunda oldukları ve bilim insanlarının bilinen kömür rezervlerinin %80’inin yerin altında bırakılması gerektiği konusunda uyarıda bulundukları bir yılda ilerlemeyi sürdürüyor. Türkiye hızlı gelişen ekonomisini canlı tutmak ve Rusya’dan büyük miktarda ithal ettiği doğal gaza olan bağımlılığından kurtulmak için her şeyi göze almış durumda. Ancak bu gelişmelere karşı çıkan çevreler kömürün şimdiden Türkiye’ye bir yılda bir kaç milyar euro tutarında sağlık harcamasına malolduğu uyarısını yapmakta ve böylesi güneşli bir ülkede güneş enerjisinden neredeyse hiç yararlanılmadığına işaret etmekteler. Hüseyin Alp Aslan Goğulhan’dan kısa bir yolculukla ulaşılan 20km. uzunluğundaki açık maden işletmesine bakıyor; bu maden ocağı Afşin-Elbistan santraline düşük kaliteli, yüksek kirlilik oranına sahip linyit kömürü sağlamaktadır. İçin için yanan ateşlerin, maden damarlarını devasa böcekler gibi parçalayan makinelerin toprak rengi ile grilerden oluşan yamalı görüntüsü yalçın dağların ve mavi gökyüzünün oluşturduğu manzaranın altında uzanıyor.  Komşu şehir Elbistan’daki devlet hastanesinin başhekim yardımcısı Aslan “kendimi cehennemdeymişim gibi hissediyorum” diyor. “Sorunlar neler mi? Birincisi sağlık, ikincisi sağlık, üçüncüsü sağlık” diyen Aslan bir dizi solunum yolu hastalığını ve kanserleri bu hastalıklar arasında sayıyor. Cehennemde gibi hissediyorum Aslan “Yirmi dokuz yıl önce [ilk santral açıldığı zaman] insanlar çok mutluydu” açıklamasını yaparak şöyle devam ediyor: “İnsanlar zengin olacaklarını düşündüler. Ancak bilmedikleri bir şey vardı o da kazandıkları parayı tıbbi tedavilere harcamak zorunda kalacakları. Hayata yoksul olarak başladılar, kısa bir süre varsıl oldular ve sonra yine yoksul olarak öldüler.”  Aslan’ın Türkiye’nin gelecekteki enerji gereksiniminin nasıl karşılanacağı konusundaki görüşü gayet net: “Türkiye güneşli bir ülke ve bu bölgede yüzlerce rüzgar türbini inşa edebiliriz. Rüzgar türbinlerinin en güzel yanı hiç kimsenin gitmediği yalıtılmış alanlara yapılıyor olması. Kömür en son seçenek olmalıdır.” Ama Afşin-Elbistan Türkiye’nin en büyük kömür yatağının üzerinde bulunuyor ve var olan santraller ile maden yaklaşık 2.800 kişiye iş olanağı sağlıyor. Zonguldak yaklaşık 700 km. kuzeyde, Karadeniz kıyısında bulunuyor. Burada aralarında 70 yıl önce açılan ülkenin ilk santralinin de yer aldığı üç kömür santralinin bacaları dik, ormanlık bir vadi boyunca yılan gibi kavisli bir biçimde uzanmaktadır. Burası tartışmasız bir kömür kenti. Kentin futbol takımı Kömür Spor, okulu Kara Elmas adını taşır ve kentte Çinli yatırımcıların desteğiyle 1 milyar dolarlık yeni bir kömür santralinin yapımı planlanmaktadır. Zonguldak Türkiye’nin birkaç maden kömürü rezervinden birine ev sahipliği yapmaktadır ve bu rezerve vadinin dışındaki yola uzanan derin kıvrımlı virajlardan birinin hemen yakınındaki zifiri karanlık bir tünelden ulaşılır. Madenci Murat Şahin “Bu işi seviyorum-bir tür ayrıcalık bu. Biz kömürün evleri ısıtması ve elektrik üretmesi faaliyetlerinde kullanılmasından çok memnunuz. Kendimizi üretken hissediyoruz,” diyor. Sahin’e göre kömürün kendisi sorun değil, sorun olan onun kullanım şekli. “Hava kirliliği konusunda gösterilen hassasiyete katılıyorum fakat kömür santrallerine filtre takarak gereken önlemi almak zorunda oldukları halde bunu yerine getirmiyorlar” diyor Şahin ve sözlerini şöyle sürdürüyor: “Yerel kaynakları kullanmak zorundayız. Burada nükleer enerji kullanmayı mı tercih ederdiniz? Çernobil’e bakın, bu çok daha kirli bir enerji.” Kendi sağlığıyla ilgili endişelere gülüp geçerken kömür tozunun örtemediği çizgiler görünüyor gözlerinin çevresinde: “Bu mesleğin avantajı madencilerin asla yaşlanmaması.” Musa Demir günde 600 ton üretim yapan, 4 km.’lik tüneli olan küçük bir madenin sahibi. Hükümete göre kömürün geleceği hakkında çok daha az umutlu olan Demir 630 işçisinin yarısını işten çıkarmak zorunda kaldığını söylüyor. 311 işçinin ölmesiyle ülkeyi şoke eden, dünyanın en ölümcül maden güvenliği siciline sahip 2014 Soma maden felaketinin arkasından yapılan düzenlemeler nedeniyle maden sahiplerinin harcamaları artmıştır. Demir ailesinde kömür madenciliği işinde çalışan son neslin kendisi olabileceğinden söz ediyor ve şöyle sürdürüyor konuşmasını: “Üç çocuğumun kömür madenciliği işinde çalışmasını istemiyorum. Artık madencilik karlı bir iş olmaktan çıktı ve bir erkek kardeşimi kömür madeni kazasında kaybettim. Çocuklarımın da başına böyle bir felaketin gelmesini istemem.”  Türk hükümeti kömüre hücum hareketini teşvik ederken yerel kaynakların kullanılmasına önem veriyor, ancak son beş yıl içinde yapılan santrallerde kullanılan yakıtın %95’i yurt dışından getirilmiş. Kömür ithalatına muhalefet etmek Zonguldak’taki yeni santrale karşı kampanya düzenleyen gruplarla kömür madencilerini birleştiren bir konu. Zonguldak’ta yapılması planlanan yeni santralin yer alacağı bölgenin kıyısındaki yeşil dağlık alanın ağaçları liman genişletme inşaatı için kesiliyor. Afşin-Elbistan’ın aksine burada küçük ama kararlı bir muhalefet git gide büyüyor; santralin eski çalışanlarından Kadir Orhan da yakın geçmişte muhalif sesler arasına katıldı. Türkiye'nin 2023 yılına kadar güneşten elektrik üretme hedefi sadece yüzde 5 Zonguldak’ta günde 400 ton soluk renkli külün boşaltıldığı dev çukurlardan birine bakan Orhan, kentin kömür santrallerinden birinde 26 yıl çalıştığını ve bu santrallerin kirliliğe neden olduğunu ifade ederek şöyle devam ediyor: “Bununla bağlantılı olarak bazı zorluklarla karşılaştım. İlk elden neler olduğunu gördüm.” Sekiz ay önce santral özelleştirildiğinde işten çıkarılmış ve şimdi kentte kendi evinde güneş enerjili fotovoltaik panel kullanan ilk kişi olmuş. Arkasından beyaz küller saçan büyük sarı bir kamyon yanından geçerken Orhan “bir şeyler yapılabileceğini göstermeye çalışıyorum” diyor. Ancak Türkiye’de onun gerçekleştirdiği bu öncü girişimle çok az kişi ilgileniyor. Güneş enerjisiyle çalışan su ısıtıcıları neredeyse her çatıda bulunmasına karşın elektrik üreten fotovoltaik panaller ender görülüyor. 10 kat daha fazla talep olmasına rağmen hükümetin güneş panelleri için verdiği izin çok sınırlı. Türkiye 2023 yılına kadar güneşten elde edilecek elektriği sadece %5 olarak hedeflemektedir. İstanbul’daki Ekonomi ve Dış Politikalar Merkezi’nde görevli bir ekonomist olan Pelin Yenigün Dilek “Bu oran Türkiye gibi bir ülke için çok düşük” diyor. Yenigün Dilek sözlerini şöyle sürdürmekte “Hükümet kısa vadede ekonomik büyümenin kömürle daha hızlı gerçekleşeceğini düşünüyor. Ancak bu geçici ve çok hızlı tükenecek bir refah doğuruyor; sonuç da yaşam kalitesinde düşüş olacaktır. Elinizde güneş enerjisi potansiyeli varsa, bundan katma değeri olan istihdam ve üretim yaratabiliyorsanız niçin kömüre odaklanıyorsunuz?” Rüzgar ve güneş seçenekleri var, hükümet önce bunları desteklemeli Kısa bir süre önce WWF-Türkiye tarafından hazırlatılan Bloomberg Yeni Enerji Finans raporuna göre Türkiye rüzgar, güneş ve hidroelektrikten elde edeceği enerjiyi arttırarak kömüre hücum dalgasıyla aynı maliyette ve miktarda enerji üretebilecek, karbon salınım düzeylerini de sabit tutabilecektir. Eğer Türkiye’deki kömüre hücum dalgasının önü kesilecekse bunun gerçekleşeceği yerlerden biri Amasya olacaktır. Zonguldak’ın 100 km. doğusundaki bu tarihi balıkçı kasabası gözde bir turistik mekandır. Yapılması planlanan dört büyük enerji santralinden birinin Amasra’da bölgenin ilk santrali olarak inşa edilmesine kömür madencileri de karşı çıkmaktadır. Bu güzel deniz kasabasından yürüyerek 20 dakika uzaklıktaki bir yeraltı madeninde çalışan Engin Pazar “Biz bu kasabada yaşıyoruz ve santral yapıldığında hava kirliliğinden etkileneceğiz” açıklamasını yapıyor ve sözlerini şöyle sürdürüyor: “Kömür madenciliği bizim işimiz ama bunun karşısındayız. Rüzgar ve güneş enerjisi var, hükümet önceliği bunlara vermelidir.” Burası tarihi 2400 yıl gerilere uzanan Karadeniz bölgesinin en eski anıtlarının bulunduğu Tios yakınlarında. Profesör Erdoğan Atmış gücü dalga dalga yayılan protesto hareketinin önderlerinden biri. Gösterilerde 7 km.’lik insan zinciri oluşturuldu ve bölge nüfusunun dörtte birinin katıldığı 42.000 adet protesto mektubu yazıldı. Profesör Atmış “Bacalar ne kadar uzun olursa olsun tıpkı 1950’lerde Londra’da olduğu gibi insanlar bu faaliyetten zarar göreceklerdir” diyor. Yerel bir üniversitede ormancılık uzmanı olan Atmış Aralık ayında bölgenin ünlü ormanlarının 36 km.’lik kuşağının güç hattı döşemek amacıyla kesileceğine işaret ediyor. Amasya’daki yeni kömür madeninde olduğu gibi bu ağaç kesme işinin de güç santrallerinin onay sürecini oldu-bittiye getirmek için düşünüldüğünü söylüyor. Çevre kampanyalarını yürütenler 2012’de mahkemenin onların lehine karar vermesinin ardından kazandıklarını düşünmüşler. Fakat çevre bakanı Erdoğan Bayraktar, kendisinden beklenildiği gibi mahkeme kararını beğenmemiş. 2013 yılında polisi inşaat projelerine rüşvet karıştırıldığı iddialarını araştırmaya yönelten dev yolsuzluk skandalı sırasında Bayraktar istifa etmek zorunda bırakılmıştır.  Kömür santrallerinin yarattığı tehdit yerli yerinde duruyor ve çevre köylerden biri olan Tarlaağzı sakinleri derin kül çukurları kazılmasından ve hava kirliliğinden endişe ediyorlar. Yöre sakini Hatice Erfidan “Bu sinirlerimi o kadar bozuyor ki uyku dahi uyuyamıyorum. Yapacaklarsa güneş enerjisi santralleri yapmalılar. Saarbrücken (Almanya)‘de 40 yıl yaşadım ve oralarda her yerde güneş panelleri de rügar santralleri de vardı” diyor. Köyün muhtarı Şakir Karabacak’ın ateşli sözleri kampanya yürütücülerinin kararlılığını yansıtıyor: “Yeni santrallerin köylerin sonunu getireceğinden endişe ediyoruz. Kendi isteğimizle gitmeyeceğimiz için bizi buradan zor kullanarak göç ettirmeye çalışabilirler. Ama ya onlar bizi öldürmek zorunda kalacaklar ya da biz onları.” Amasra kampanyasını yürütenler oradan 300 km. uzakta Karadeniz kıyısındaki Gerze halkının başarısından ilham alıyorlar. 2013 yılında Gerze’de inşaat alanlarında 24 saatlik nöbetler ve diğer protestoların ardından protestocular yasal mücadeleyi kazandılar ve büyük bir kömür santrali projesini durdurdular. Fakat öyle görünüyor ki Türkiye çapında diğer kömür santrallerinin yapımına devam edilecek. The Guardian enerji bakanlığı, çevre bakanlığı ve çeşitli projeleri yürüten şirketlerden röportaj talebinde bulunmuş ama bu mercilerin hiç biri bu talebi kabul etmemiştir. Hükümet önemli miktarda devlet yardımları da dahil olmak üzere kömüre güçlü bir şekilde destek olmaktadır ama yeni özelleştirilen bu endüstrinin geliştirdiği projelerin finans gereksinimi devam etmektedir. Garanti Bankası merkezinin 16. katında, cam duvarların arkadasından dev şehrin panoramasına karşı bankanın başkan yardımcısı Ebru Dildar Edin bankasının bu konuya yaklaşımını açıklıyor. Garanti Bankası Türkiye’deki yeni kömür santrallerine en büyük fon sağlayan kurum. Edin kömür fiyatlarının düşük olmasının onlara karlı gözüktüğü için kendilerinin de cazip kredi projeleri sunduklarını söylüyor. Ancak Edin kirlilik ve iklim değişikliği konusundaki endişeleri haklı bulduğunu ifade ederek sözlerini sürdüyor: “Gaz santrallerinin yerini kömür santrallerinin alması iyi bir gelişme değildir.”  Edin Garanti Bankası’nın vereceği kredilerin karşılığında sıkı çevresel ve sosyal şartlar öne sürdüğünü ve koşullarında mutabık olmadıkları bir kömür santrali projesi için kredi talebini geri çevirdiklerini söylemektedir. Bununla birlikte kendilerinin kredi talebini geri çevirdiği bir kömür santrali projesinin talep ettiği kredi bir başka banka tarafından karşılanmıştır. Edin aynı zamanda bankasının verdiği enerji kredilerinin yarısının kömüre gitmediğinin, hidroelektrik ve rüzgar enerjisi projeleri arasında bölüştürüldüğünün de altını çizmektedir. İngiltere’nin halihazırda sahip olduğu 13 GW’lık rüzgar enerjisine karşılık Türkiye’nin yalnızca 3,5 GW’lık bir rüzgar enerji üretimi vardır, bu enerji üretiminin üçte birinin finansmanı Garanti bankası tarafından temin edilmektedir. Edin yeşil kampya yürütücüleriyle aynı fikirleri paylaştığını ve güneş enerjisinin ülkede hızlı bir şekilde geliştirilmesi gerektiğini ifade etmektedir.  Kasım ayında dünyanın gözü Türkiye’nin ev sahipliğini yapacağı G20 zirvesine odaklanacak. Bu zirveden yalnızca bir kaç hafta sonra kritik BM iklim zirvesi Paris’te yapılacak.Bu zirvedeki konulardan biri ithal yakıta dayalı büyük kömür santrali projeleri olabilir diyen Edin, bu projelerin olasılıkla yabancı finansmana gereksinim duyacağını söylemekte ve şöyle devam etmektedir: “Türk bankalarının bu projelere karşı büyük bir heves duyacaklarını tahmin etmiyorum.” Ancak bu durum kendi linyit rezervlerine sahip olan Afşin-Elbistan tesisinin 12 milyar dolarlık finansman talebinin önünde bir engel teşkil etmemiştir. Santralden bir taş atımı uzaklıkta bulunan Göğülhan köyünün buruk havasında Biçici dünyanın en büyük kömür santralinin gölgesinde bir yaşam sürdürmeyi istemiyor. “Toprağımızı zaten yitirdik. Küçük bir evimiz vardı o da elimizden gitti” diyen Biçici, üzerinde ayçiceği ve buğday yetiştirdiği 7,5 hektarlık tarlasını yetkililerin zorlamasıyla maden işletmesine 2011 yılında çok düşük bir fiyata satmak zorunda kaldığını anlatıyor. Bu köyde 47 yıllık ömrünün tümünü geçiren Biçici “gitmeyi düşünüyorum ama gidecek param yok” diyor. • Translation: Sehnaz Tahir/Voxeurop"
"Almost completely surrounded by water, the little-known Danish town of Sønderborg is no stranger to flooding from both seawater rising along its coastline and heavy rainfall. With climate change ensuring more of both, Sønderborg is learning to tackle the immediate problems of adapting to a warming world while becoming part of the broader solution. The ProjectZero plan, launched in 2007 as a joint venture between the people, politicians and businesses of the municipality of Sønderborg (an area including the towns of Nordborg, Broager and Sydals, as well as Sønderborg town itself) , aims to enable the region of approximately 77,000 to become zero carbon by 2029. In practice, this means an aggressive shift (pdf) to renewable energy and energy efficiency measures through initiatives including the establishment of new on- and off-shore wind turbines and the introduction of biogas in transport and manufacturing processes to replace oil and natural gas. However, in keeping with the norms of setting carbon targets in the international climate negotiations, it has not yet included the emissions “embedded” in goods imported to the area. Sønderborg municipality is already the global home of green technology companies like Danfoss, a big player in solar power, and Linak, which makes key components for wind turbines and solar PV installations that track the sun. There is, however, also a large number of pig producers in the area (an estimated 2m pigs in total) and a small regional airport. Neither air transport nor methane and nitrous oxide emissions from farms are part of the zero carbon master plan, although there are plans to increase installation of biogas to take pig waste. More than 50 companies have become part of ProjectZero to date, which requires them to produce provable plans to reduce their emissions by at least 10% in the first year of operation. Some have already exceeded this target, reaching reductions of more than 45%. In return, the companies are insulated from energy price volatility and make savings through associated efficiency measures.  “When countries and cities commit to targets backed by plans and scenarios it gives businesses certainty and an indicator of where their investments will be safest and most able to thrive,” says Isabel Bottoms, an author of Who’s Getting Ready for Zero?, a new report from the Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT) and Track0. “Those on the wrong side of that direction of travel can then also clearly see the need for them to change direction.” For Sønderborg itself there is also a range of benefits, adds Paul Allen, project coordinator of the Zero Carbon Britain project, such as a better, more stable economic system, greater equity, increased health and wellbeing, strengthened communities and improved relationships with nature.    Zero Carbon Sønderborg is just one of more than a hundred examples of scenarios of cities, regions and countries making the transition to low or zero carbon included in the CAT report. According to the report, around 36 cities internationally are known to have decarbonisation targets that range from achieving net zero greenhouse gases to generating 100% energy from renewables by 2022.   Adelaide in Australia, for example, recently said it was joining the race to become the world’s first carbon neutral city. The Australian thinktank Beyond Zero Emissions warns that if the country continues its coal dependence and ignores the clean energy shift it has a 50% chance of systemic economic decline, meaning high unemployment, high debt and deep recession.  Germany’s Federal Environment Agency, meanwhile, produced a plan demonstrating that by building on its renewable energy strategy Europe’s powerhouse economy could go carbon neutral by 2050. Already, Germany’s positive approach has allowed districts like Rhein-Hunsrück in the South West to go 100% renewable in terms of electricity generation, and it aims to have net zero emissions from heat and transport by 2020. Over in the US, the Solutions Project, a not-for-profit co-founded in 2011 by banker Marco Krapels, filmmaker Josh Fox and Stanford scientist Mark Jacobson, has developed transition scenarios for all 50 states based on renewables and excluding both nuclear and carbon capture for fossil fuels. Under these scenarios, all new energy sources would be renewable by 2020 with 80-85% substitution of fossil fuels by 2030 rising to 100% by 2050. The Solutions Project calculates that building and operating these green power systems would create 2.8m new jobs. “The momentum is shifting in the right direction when it comes to zero carbon,” says James Goodman, director of futures at Forum for the Future. “There are, of course, key questions to be raised about how quickly this transition can happen, how we are going to fund it and which vested interests might pose potential barriers to change, but overall we are at a phase shift where one system is making way for another.” Goodman reiterates, however, that the shift is still fragile. As an example he cites recent changes in UK government policy which, he says, threaten to pull the rug from beneath the UK’s nascent clean energy sector.      "
"Isoprene: it’s a gas that helps aerosols form in the atmosphere. It’s relevant to climate change because aerosols help clouds form, which can have cooling (by reflecting sunlight) or warming (by trapping heat) effects, depending on the type of cloud. Aerosols also cause cooling by directly scattering sunlight. Past field measurements indicated that the oceans were releasing less isoprene than climate model simulations suggested they should. A new study found that previously unidentified reactions in the sea surface microlayer might represent a significant source of isoprene that could reconcile the discrepancy between measurements and models. In fact, climate models may even be underestimating the amount of isoprene released from the oceans.  What are the implications of this study for recent global temperature changes? As co-author Dr. Christian George told Carbon Brief,  Our study is a new brick that should help understanding our complex world, by providing new knowledge on air-sea exchanges, but it definitively does not question climate change, it just helps us understand its impact. There is no question that the global climate will become warmer. The question is just how much, how fast and how the effects will change our lives. Professor Piers Forster explained why suggestions that this study have significant climate change implications are wrong for several reasons. The primary reason is that changes in global temperature would only be caused by changes in natural isoprene emissions. As Forster noted, The natural aerosol cooling could be 100 times bigger than our current estimate, but it would make no difference to climate change as it would stay more-or-less constant with time. Marine isoprene releases could only cause global warming or cooling if the level of the emissions were to change. However, this paper merely suggests that the overall level of isoprene emissions is higher than previously thought, not that the levels are changing. And in fact the study indicates that climate model simulations might be more accurate on ocean isoprene emissions than previously believed. However, several conservative media outlets falsely claimed that the study had uncovered a “global cooling process.” Writing for Breitbart, James Delingpole claimed that the paper “may pose a serious threat to man-made global warming theory.” The Register and Express both claimed that temperatures have been stable for 15 years (they’ve actually risen by about 0.2°C during that time), and that this paper could explain that fictional temperature stability. The problem lies in the fact that unlike Carbon Brief, whose reporters discussed the study and its implications with two climate scientists including one of the study authors, these conservative media outlets tried to interpret its meaning on their own. This led to mischaracterizations of the paper that Professor Forster described as “quite crazy.” All of these conservative media pieces misrepresenting the paper shared another characteristic. Each revealed its bias by wishfully suggesting the international climate negotiations that will soon be held in Paris could be undermined by the study’s findings. Rather than contact the study’s authors or any other climate scientists, the Express and Breitbart quoted Benny Peiser, a social anthropologist, climate fake expert, and director of the anti-climate policy Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). The UK government’s Charity Commission ruled last year that the GWPF was blurring fact and comment on climate change, lacked neutrality, and promoted a contrarian position on the subject. In essence, The Register, Express, and Breitbart seemed more interested in promoting a specific political cause – undermining efforts to implement climate policies – than in getting the facts right. And presenting misleading information to promote a political agenda is the very definition of propaganda. Ironically, Delingpole accused Carbon Brief of being an “eco-propaganda website,” even though it was Carbon Brief that ensured factual accuracy by discussing the study and its implications with one of the study’s authors and a second climate scientist. Worse yet, Delingpole implied that Professor Forster is “stupid, dishonest, and semi-literate,” among other insults, for having the temerity to point out the factual inaccuracies in the Breitbart propaganda piece. This is the same James Delingpole who told Sir Paul Nurse in a climate conversation on BBC (a conversation in which Delingpole complained he was “intellectually raped”), It is not my job to sit down and read peer-reviewed papers, because I simply haven’t got the time, I haven’t got scientific expertise. What I rely on is people who have got the time and expertise to do it … I am an interpreter of interpretations. Despite admittedly lacking the scientific expertise to read peer-reviewed papers like this one, and interpreting the interpretations of a man who likewise lacks climate science expertise and who has a clear policy agenda, Delingpole decided to insult the intelligence of the climate expert who called out his misinformation. Fortunately the influence of this sort of propaganda seems to be dwindling. Delingpole no longer writes for The Telegraph, which now only publishes regular climate propaganda from Christopher Booker. The sort of misinformation that we saw with this isoprene paper is generally limited to media outlets with known conservative ideological biases, and hence they’re only misinforming those who are already in denial about the scientific realities and threats of human-caused climate change. Meanwhile, with climate policy commitments from 140 countries, including China’s announcement of a national carbon cap and trade system, the Paris climate negotiations they so fear seem to be on the path toward a successful agreement."
"World leaders will meet in Paris next month for the latest climate summit, where they will discuss a possible new global agreement to tackle global warming. But what, if anything, are ordinary people doing about their own carbon emissions? Current commitments on greenhouse gas emissions run out in 2020, so in Paris governments from more than 190 nations will need to decide what happens for the decade after that at least, and potentially beyond. The Guardian and five other European newspapers – Le Monde, El País, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Gazeta Wyborcza and La Stampa – are asking readers for their views about global warming, and what action they are taking.  Fill in the form below – you do not need to answer every question – and we’ll use a selection of responses in our reporting. "

"How well can the new head of the IPCC, Hoesung Lee, manage the huge reforms that you and others have publicly asked for?  We’ve put forward suggestions for a feasible programme of reform, but we will see how Hoesung Lee will make this his own. There’s little room for manoeuvre. In a meeting in February in Nairobi, governments decided that they’d prefer to see the status quo upheld. Lee has to be very fast and vigorous if he wants reforms. However he is very dependent upon the IPCC panel agreeing, since only the governments are entitled to a vote and thus get to have a say.  What needs changing at the IPCC? The chief aim of the IPCC must be to shed light on the total range of solutions offered by climate policy. Decision makers have to be able to understand how they can adapt to unavoidable climate change and how they can avoid dangerous climate change. For that reason, working groups two and three of the IPCC [dealing with adaptation and mitigation respectively] must work together more closely. If Hoesung Lee [the new chair of the IPCC] wants to make this happen then he has a tough managerial task ahead of him. The second big task consists of evaluating the climate policies proposed to date by governments. To do this, Lee will have to engage in intensive dialogues with governments, since up to now they have always signalled their unwillingness to let this happen. What might the big topic for next year be? We currently have a proposal for a special report on carbon taxes and emissions trading systems on the table. That’s its main focus. Other topics include food security and climate change, also the role of the oceans. We will decide which special reports to carry out in February of next year, since even special reports need a lot of time. You are calling for a stronger political role for the IPCC. Why should governments be given more weight, given that the Council is actually a scientific institution? No, I am not calling for a politicised IPCC. However, I am calling for the IPCC to make knowledge available that is relevant for decision making by national governments. But that is only possible if, on the one hand, the science stays independent and, on the other, if governments do not demand that the science justifies decisions they see as having no alternative. Normally scientists and governments come together at the beginning and end of a reporting cycle. Informal meetings could help to encourage mutual understanding. But science cannot avoid saying uncomfortable truths to governments. They are obliged to do so even though governments can sometimes kick up a real fuss when undesirable information is included in the final report. Is that not an admission that politics has become an ever stronger disruptive force in serious, neutral analysis? For governments the IPCC reports are the basis for climate negotiations. In fact many governments become nervous when their polities are examined. And much more nervous when we talk about the future. The future is so far off. If we explain to governments that we are in the middle of a coal renaissance, because they are on average subsidising CO2 emissions by $150 per tonne, we receive a load of objections. There’s uproar if the IPCC says that emissions would go down if subsidies were abolished. In spite of this opposition, these statements have found their way into the fifth report. The taboo has now finally been broken – that’s something that Lee can build on. After the number of national emissions pledges in the build-up to Paris, are you optimistic that there will be a new climate agreement? The best would be if states could negotiate a minimum CO2 price. Poor countries, who can’t accept a high minimum price, should receive transfers from the Green Climate Fund. That’s how we could come to an agreement on a minimum CO2 price. It would strengthen international cooperation. I am increasingly unsettled by how many diplomats believe we can solve the climate crisis even without a binding agreement. That is a big mistake. In spite of the many previous failures of governments to come to come to an agreement on climate protection, are you then still lacking real political will? I’ll give you only one figure: at the moment a thousand gigawatts of energy capacity from coal power stations are planned worldwide. If only a third of that gets built, it would still lead to some 110 gigatonnes of CO2 emitted, factoring in a operational life of forty years for a power station. The infrastructure already built would alone emit 730 gigatonnes if there was no move to adapt it. That would almost entirely use up our carbon budget if we want to stay under the two degree limit.  This is why we urgently need to get started with carbon pricing. Only a price for CO2 will simultaneously make low carbon technologies profitable and the use of fossil fuels unviable. Low carbon technologies include renewable energy sources, but also capturing carbon from coal, gas or biomass power stations and storing it underground to render it harmless. An ambitious climate protection agreement would also make CCS [Carbon Capture and Storage] necessary for industrial emissions from the steel and iron industry. Unfortunately to date we have seen negative CO2 prices, because in many countries governments massively subsidise carbon. It is no wonder that we are not making progress to protect the climate."

"Another day, another set of climate promises from big business. At the White House on Monday, the chief executives of five companies – Johnson & Johnson, Intel, Hershey’s, PG&E and Berkshire Hathaway Energy – expressed support for government action to curb climate change, joining dozens of big firms that pledged to curb their own greenhouse gas emissions.  Six major US banks, including Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo, recently pledged “significant resources toward financing climate solutions” and called for the world’s governments to reach a global climate agreement. Last month, at Climate Week in New York, it was Goldman Sachs, Nike, Procter & Gamble and six other companies that joined RE100, committing to become 100% funded by renewable energy. Each set of announcements sends press releases flying. Some folks get creative: P&G and utility company EDF installed a “mini wind farm” made of thousands of spinning pinwheels on the lawn in front of the US Capitol, to celebrate a Texas wind farm that will supply energy to P&G. But do the climate commitments add up to meaningful change? They may. But so far, they haven’t.  Big companies have been making promises for more than a decade. General Electric launched Ecomagination in 2005. That was the year that Walmart announced an aspirational goal of being powered by 100% renewable energy. Many others companies followed.  Many of the promises, though, are haphazard and incoherent. This latest batch of commitments, which are listed on a White House fact sheet about 81 companies that have signed a statement called the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, are no different. Companies get to pick the baseline year from which they will make reductions, and decide for themselves whether they will cut 5%, 10%, 20% or 50%, and by when. It’s a game where all the players get to set their own rules.  Many companies, including Alcoa, Best Buy, Coca-Cola, GE, General Mills, Facebook, Google, Hershey’s, Johnson & Johnson, Mars, Microsoft, Nike, P&G, Walt Disney and Xerox have promised to go carbon neutral or to make absolute greenhouse gas reductions. Others, including Berkshire Hathaway, Cargill, General Motors, McDonald’s, Monsanto, Pepsico, UPS and Walmart made no firm commitments, or have promised only to reduce their carbon intensity (that is, their emissions per unit of sales). That means their absolute emissions – the only thing that matters to the planet – can continue to grow. Given the inconsistency of corporate promises, which are, of course, unenforceable, it should come as no surprise that global and US greenhouse gas emissions have grown nearly every year since 2000. (The years 2009 and 2014 were recent exceptions.) Meanwhile, greenhouse gas emissions from the world’s 500 largest businesses are up as well, according to Thomson Reuters. Even Walmart, which has made great strides around waste, renewable energy and packaging, has seen its absolute emissions continue to grow. Scientists say carbon emissions need to fall sharply to stabilize the climate.  The bottom line is this: a decade or so of voluntary corporate climate promises have been insufficient to drive emissions down to where they need to go to stabilize the climate. There’s no reason to believe that these new sets of commitments will do better. Still, the corporate pledges could make a difference if they help to shift the debate about climate change in the US. The White House announcement says only that these companies are “voicing support for a strong Paris outcome”. Many go further, saying they support specific regulatory actions, including a carbon price, that most economists say is needed to curb climate change. Few expend much effort lobbying for climate action. If nothing else, though, the company pledges should help explode the myth – perpetuated by the US Chamber of Commerce and much of the Republican Party – that government regulation of carbon emissions will harm the economy and destroy jobs. The companies at the White House confab operate across an array of industries. According to the White House, the 81 companies that have signed the pledge have operations in all 50 states, employ over 9 million people, represent more than $3tn in annual revenue and have a combined market capitalization of over $5tn. That’s clout. The true test will come when they are asked to use that clout – by dropping out of trade associations that undermine climate action, or declining to support political candidates who don’t take the threat of global warming seriously. Pinwheels on the Capitol lawn won’t cut it."
"Ever since the Spanish landed in Peru in the fifteenth century the magnitude of each El Niño event has increased, according to Lizardo Seiner Lizarraga. The northern coasts are especially in danger, said the history lecturer at the university of Lima, and specialist in the social and environmental history of risk.  Lizarraga’s scientific research begins in 1925, one of the three worst years hit by the weather pattern. 1983 is classed as the worst, but the phenomenon goes back way back. As he said in the following historical extract from one of his articles, “The El Niño phenomenon in Peru: reflections in history”: “In 1579 Alonso de Lucio, defendor of the Indians in the Viceroyalty of Peru, filed a suit before the Royal Audiencia and Chancery of Lima, a superior court in colonial Spain. He made the case that different owners (“encomederos”) of Trujillo, a city on the north-western coast, continued to tax the native population despite the harsh situation people were in. Torrential rainfall had lashed the northern coast in 1578, destroying crops (including cotton, wheat and corn), and homes in the lowlands. People could not meet their fiscal obligations”.  We look set to have a repeat of these torrential rains by the end of the year, and they will probably continue right into 2016. The El Niño weather pattern tends to occur at Christmas, which is why the Peruvians named the phenomenon “the Christ’s child”. Peru’s lack of adequate preparations in advance of such an event proves we haven’t learned the lessons from El Niño, even from centuries ago, said Lizarraga. El Comercio: Lizardo, not many know that Peru was the first place where El Niño struck.  Lizarraga: The story is only now becoming interesting for historians and investigators, and is being told from its colonial beginnings in the context of the current impact on us. How else do you understand a major climate event with so many characteristics, except to delve into its history? El Comercio: Shortly after El Niño first happened, the Spanish colonised Peru. How has the phenomenon changed in the five centuries since?  Lizarraga: We know that in 1578 there was a plague of rats - although we don’t know in detail what kind of epidemics this caused. It had a huge impact on the population. Historically, humans and the environment have always had a difficult relationship. El Comercio: Yet historically the authorities were not well prepared to handle such a weather pattern either. Lizarraga: It’s important to know about the phenomenon from a historical perspective especially since it minimises that vulnerability. A society learns and can be more prepared for the next time, which is the situation we are currently in. One problem has been that El Niño in this country has become associated primarly with the north-western region of Piura, which was most affected by it - people must know that the event will have repercussions on the whole country.  El Comercio: So will we able to handle El Niño when it comes around again this year? Lizarraga: Unfortunately we haven’t learnt our lesson. People keep settling where there were once the riverbeds of ravines and gorges. One of the most common expressions you’ll hear people saying is that “the river escaped from its mother”. Of course, they mean that the river changed course. They know perfectly well that rising water levels will have something to do with people who have settled where an ancient riverbed once stood. The local authorities are also complicit in this knowledge. Not only are the mayors responsible for allowing this to happen in zones which are risky to live in, but they are actually standardising the process. The authorities need to lay down a set of technical standards which would serve as a foundation for new territorial laws. El Comercio: Around 25,000 families will need to be relocated. Is there some hope in preventing future such cases? Lizarraga: The state’s response service has definitely improved. Today they work with simulations of future phenomenons. There was even a warship, the HNLMS Amsterdam (which became known as the BAP Tacna), which carried material for humanitarian aid. We can monitor events far more carefully these days; that wasn’t even possible in 1982.  El Comercio: In terms of planning, would you argue that much more needs to be done? Lizarraga: Yes, El Niño is a recurring phenomenon. Peru should be on a par with Japan in terms of how the latter prepares for any seismic activity. We still have enough time to handle whatever will come next. Other facts and figures 80 ... stormy events were officially caused by El Niño between 1567 and 1998. In this period a quarter of those were recorded as very intense. 95% ... of a chance that El Niño will continue into 2016. According to Peru’s national El Niño research agency (Enfen), there is also a 55% chance that this year’s phenomenon will be bigger than the last. According to the latest reports, the average anomalies of sea surface temperatures in August was 1.8 degrees Celsius on the northern and central coast. In Paita (in the north-west) and Chimbote (in the north), it rose to 2.2 degrees Celsius above average. Minimum air temperatures registered an anomaly of 1.3 degree Celsius, with the maximum at 1.8 degrees. This summer was most similar to that of 1998 (1997 was the strongest El Niño on record). Víctor Eguiguren A historian from the raveged region of Piura, north-western Peru, who pioneered scientific studies on El Niño between 1791 and 1890, tracking the ever-increasing severity of the storms. Later, engineer Pedro Abel Labarthe followed up on the events of El Niño in the colonial and republican period, until 1914."
"At least 80 world leaders, including Barack Obama, Xi Jinping, David Cameron and Narendra Modi, will attend a summit tasked with agreeing a global climate pact in Paris in December.  Diplomats endorsed the outlines of the proposed deal in Bonn on Friday after five days of fraught negotiation that highlighted just how much work remains to be done in Paris.   The aim is to unite all the world’s nations in a single agreement on tackling climate change, with the goal of capping warming at 2C over pre-Industrial Revolution levels.  For the opening day on 30 November, “we have already received 80 confirmations, including from the presidents of the United States and China, and the Indian prime minister,” French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, told journalists in Paris on Tuesday.  The leaders of Germany, South Africa, Brazil and Canada have also accepted, he said.  The last attempt at sealing a global climate pact, in 2009, saw about 110 world leaders descend on a UN summit in Copenhagen for the two final days, only to leave frustrated when the negotiations collapsed.  “Together with president Francois Hollande, we decided to invite heads of state to attend the first day and not the end as in Copenhagen,” said Fabius.  This had been partly to blame for the failure, he said, “as the negotiators were waiting for heads of state to negotiate, and the heads of state failed to resolve anything.”  This time, “the idea is to provide a political impetus at the beginning” of the conference - which will see the leaders take turn to make statements.  The French government has undertaken a global diplomatic effort to prepare the ground for the crucial talks and ensure they are a success. The Bonn round of talks last week signed off on a much-expanded, 55-page draft for the deal. While negotiators were satisfied it reflected everyone’s views, they admitted it was unwieldy.  The document will be given to ministers and heads of state for the difficult political compromises needed to unlock an ambitious, universal climate agreement. “In Bonn there were detailed discussions, and we now have a base of negotiations for Paris,” said Fabius.  The next step is a meeting of ministers from some 100 nations in Paris from 8-10 November. “It will be an important occasion,” said Fabius, to “advance along the road to compromise.”  The right to alter text is reserved for bureaucrats at official negotiating sessions, which this will not be, but it is hoped the ministers will be able to start bartering on the key sticking points - and divisions run deep.  Developing countries insist rich nations should lead the way in slashing climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions, arguing they started polluting earlier, and should bear a heavier duty for fixing the problem.  They also want assurances of financing to help decarbonise their economies and shore up defences against climate-induced impacts - superstorms, drought, flood and sea-level rise.  But industrialised nations balk at being saddled with a higher burden of responsibility.  They point the finger at rising carbon emissions from emerging giants such as China and India as they burn coal to power expanding populations and economies.  The much-anticipated final deal would be the first to include all the world’s nations into a single arena for climate action.  The pact will be supported by a roster of national pledges for curbing greenhouse gases, but over 150 commitments submitted to date still put Earth on track for warming of 3C, scientists say. "

"Oil and gas industry leaders on Friday launched a final charm offensive to highlight the sector’s relevance in the global fight against climate change before a key summit in Paris later this year.  In an unprecedented show of unity, the bosses of Europe’s top oil companies will be joined at a press conference by the heads of the national oil companies of Saudi Arabia and Mexico, who will lend their support to the initiative.   The leaders of 10 gas and oil companies issued a statement calling for an “effective” agreement at the United Nations climate change summit in December, recognising that current greenhouse emissions were inconsistent with the goal of limiting global warming to 2C.  The companies vowed to collaborate to limit gas flaring from refineries but stopped short of outlining clear goals to limit emissions, which critics have called for.  The joint stance, at a time when all companies are struggling with a sharp drop in oil prices, also highlights a deep rift with US oil companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron, who stayed away from the initiative.  The chief executives of Total, Britain’s BP and BG Group, Italy’s Eni, Norway’s Statoil, Spain’s Repsol, Saudi Aramco and Pemex will again call for a global pricing system on carbon, which they say will give an economic incentive for the private sector to use cleaner sources of energy and to develop new technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS).  They will again urge governments to ditch coal in favour of less polluting natural gas in power plants and heavy industry.  For many of the companies, this is a fight for the future of the oil and gas sector in the public debate as a rising number of organisations and politicians call to minimise the use of fossil fuels in favour of renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, while seeking to ostracise oil companies among investors.  “Sometimes in all these discussions you have the impression that all fossil fuels are the bad guys. But the bad guys are part of the solution,” Total’s CEO Patrick Pouyanné told a gas and electricity summit in Paris on Thursday.  “Whatever people think, we still need fossil fuels. We need to make advocacy for gas. We need to explain to our policy makers that gas has to be encouraged,” Pouyanné said.  “Policy makers are not convinced in many countries that gas is part of the solution for climate change, we in the industry need to speak up.”  The meeting comes shortly before diplomats gather in Bonn from Monday for the last formal session ahead of the Paris climate talks, where negotiators from almost 200 nations will meet to try to forge a global climate change agreement, designed to curb rising greenhouse gas emissions.  The International Energy Agency forecasts oil will remain the largest energy source by 2040, although its share will decline, while renewable sources of energy will grow.  All major emitting countries have now submitted plans to the UN detailing how much they plan to curb their emissions.    "
"The right wing of the Coalition is forcing Australians to “pledge loyalty” to coal and in the process missing out on investment opportunities in renewable energy, the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said. Shorten addressed reporters on Tuesday, explaining the constraints that the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was facing from the right of his own party.  “I think the right of Australian politics is taking the debate about our energy future down fairly sort of draconian paths where we’re demanding we’ve got to pledge loyalty to one form of energy hand over heart,” he said.  “I don’t understand what happened to the Malcolm Turnbull of 2009 who was willing to stake all on the principle of lowering carbon emissions, on having policies which were sensible on climate change.” In an open letter, 61 prominent Australians called on world leaders to discuss halting of new coalmine projects and blocking the expansion of existing ones when they meet for a United Nations climate conference in Paris later this year. Turnbull on Tuesday morning rejected the unilateral banning of coal exports, saying that prospective buyers would simply look further afield for their energy requirements. Shorten warned that the ideological commitment to coal was impacting on the economy. “I’m worried, as we have these left-right arguments about are you for coal or against coal, that we’re missing the investment opportunity,” he said. But he would not commit to Labor abandoning non-renewables altogether. “I don’t think it’s up to government to pick the winner and say that coal is bad,” Shorten said. “Labor doesn’t think that.” Speaking in Canberra, Turnbull said a moratorium on Australian coal exports “would make not the blindest bit of difference to global emissions” because importers would buy it from elsewhere. Turnbull said coal remained a significant part of the global energy mix and would be “an absolutely critical ingredient” in alleviating hunger and promoting prosperity around the world. This appeared to be an extension of the “moral case” for coal exports advocated by the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, and by the coal industry in support of increasing supply to developing markets such as India. But the prime minister undercut that argument by conceding many people in developing countries were not on an electricity grid, and renewable energy sources such as solar could become more cost-effective in those circumstances. “I don’t agree with the idea of a moratorium on exporting coal. With great respect to the people who advocated it, it would make not the blindest bit of difference to global emissions,” Turnbull said. “If Australia stopped exporting coal, the countries to which we export it would buy it from somewhere else. So there is absolutely quite a lot of coal around ... so if Australia were to stop all of its coal exports it would not reduce global emissions one iota. In fact, arguably it would increase them because our coal, by and large, is cleaner than the coal in many other countries. “With great respect to the motivations and the big hearts and the idealism of the people that advocate that, that is actually not a sensible policy from an economic point of view, a jobs point of view or frankly from a global warming or global emissions point of view.” The Australian Conservation Foundation accused Turnbull of “resorting to the drug dealer’s defence” by arguing that someone else would supply the coal. “Australia has a moral responsibility to help our developing neighbours leapfrog over dirty coal, straight to clean renewable energy,” said the foundation’s chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy. The Australia Institute, which helped organise Tuesday’s open letter, suggested Turnbull had ignored the substance of the proposal by focusing on Australian exports. The open letter called for world leaders to negotiate a moratorium on new coalmines and coalmine expansions, and referred to a similar call by the president of Kiribati, Anote Tong. “Malcolm Turnbull should take the time to read the letter from President Tong – it is not a call for an export ban, but a considered call for a global moratorium on new coalmines,” said Ben Oquist, the executive director of the Australia Institute. “This is an entirely sensible move both environmentally and economically. Now is the time to pick up the phone to President Tong to discuss how Australia can be a leader in the climate debate.” Greens deputy leader Larissa Waters said Turnbull was “using rhetoric to juggle the wishes of the climate dinosaurs in his party against the overwhelming community support for climate action”. “Australians deserve more than a prime minister who sidesteps questions about our future and that of our children and our Pacific neighbours,” she said. “Coal must not be treated as the elephant in the room at the climate talks.” Turnbull was addressing the media as he confirmed the appointment of Dr Alan Finkel, the outgoing chancellor of Monash University, as Australia’s next chief scientist. Finkel, an engineer, has previously called for a debate about nuclear electricity generation in Australia as part of efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions. The media conference was dominated by questions about Australia’s response to climate change as world leaders prepare to meet in Paris to discuss post-2020 emission reduction targets. Finkel said his vision was “for a country, society, a world where we don’t use any coal, oil or natural gas because we have zero-emissions electricity in huge abundance and we use that for transport, for heating and for all the things we ordinary use electricity”. “But you can’t get there overnight, so what we need to do is optimise the technology so that with we can cost-effectively introduce alternatives,” Finkel said. “The best way to get rid of coal is to introduce alternatives that deliver value at a reasonable price rather than just arbitrarily turning it off.” Turnbull said coal was likely to remain a very large part of the global energy mix “for a very long time” and he cited “energy poverty” as a major limit on achieving the development goals of alleviating hunger and promoting prosperity around the world. “Coal is going to play a big part in that,” he said. “Having said that, the pace of technological development in the renewable space has been extraordinary.” Turnbull singled out the improvement in battery storage for solar power as “a big game-changer” and described the energy field as “very disruptive, very disrupted”. “Solar panels and batteries in an Australian household context at the moment are probably not in most cases competitive with the price of grid-delivered power,” he said. “However, if you are in a remote community, or if you are in a community in a developing country where there is no electricity grid, and the alternative is generating power by burning diesel, then solar panels and some batteries, if the efficiency of the panels is improved and the price and efficiency of the batteries has come down could actually be and very often is much more cost-effective. “So it’s horses for courses. It is important to take the ideology out of this and just approach it in a very clear-eyed, cool-headed rational way.” Supporters of Adani’s $16bn Carmichael coalmine and rail proposal for central Queensland, which was re-approved by the federal government this month, have argued it would help lift millions of Indians out of energy poverty. But analysts have disputed the claimed benefits on the basis that many remote villages are beyond the reach of the electricity grid. Finkel, whose appointment begins in January upon the expiry of Professor Ian Chubb’s five-year term, would not give an opinion about the adequacy of the government’s 2030 target of reducing Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions to 26%-28% below 2005 levels. He said he would “need time to engage on that”. But Finkel vowed to provide the government with evidence-based advice and was “absolutely confident” that he would have a receptive audience. In broader remarks, Turnbull and the science minister, Christopher Pyne, praised Finkel for his personal experience as an entrepreneur translating research into commercial products, saying he was well-suited to improve collaboration between universities, research centres and business. Turnbull, who lost the Liberal leadership in 2009 after an internal backlash against his support for an emissions trading scheme, has promised his colleagues that he will stick with the Coalition’s “Direct Action” climate policies, although he has left the door open to considering changes in 2017 when a review of the safeguards mechanism is due. Turnbull is planning to attend the climate talks in Paris in December."
"The anti-climate policy ‘fact blurring’ advocacy group Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) recently published a report on ‘the good news’ about rising carbon dioxide, written by Indur Goklany. Goklany has a background in electrical engineering and has been a US delegate to the IPCC. He has also in the past received $1,000 per month from the Heartland Institute and had two books published by the Cato Institute, among other affiliations with fossil fuel-funded think tanks. Goklany’s affiliation with and funding from these think tanks is relevant due to the nature of the GWPF report, which essentially argues that carbon pollution is the best thing since sliced bread.  Professor Colin Prentice, expert in climate change impacts on the biosphere at Imperial College London, put together a nice summary of what the report gets right and wrong. While the GWPF report is correct that there are some benefits from rising carbon dioxide levels, as Prentice notes, The good news should not blind us to the negative implications of continued unabated climate change, and the multidecadal lead times required for policies to have any discernible effect on CO2 and climate. These are the reasons propelling international pressure for long-term carbon neutrality, and nothing that Goklany says in his report invalidates them. In short, the report selectively considers only the evidence that supports its argument that carbon pollution is terrific. The report also argues against a strawman, portraying its opponents as claiming that there are no benefits associated with global warming. In reality, climate scientists and economists consider all climate change impacts, both good and bad, in their overall assessments. Unfortunately the bad consequences will outweigh the good, as even the GWPF’s own economic advisor Richard Tol has concluded. As climate scientist Richard Betts noted, Assessments of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and crops do include CO2 effects as well as physical climate effects, and while there are uncertainties in both, current understanding suggests that CO2 effects on photosynthesis will tail off while the impacts of climate change itself continue. The harms may well outweigh the benefits, especially when we remember that sea level rise is an inevitable consequence of a warming world. There are no good reasons to assume that that the effect of CO2 on plants is some sort of “get out of jail free” card. The GWPF report mostly focuses on what’s sometimes called ‘global greening,’ associated with carbon dioxide fertilization of plants. It’s essentially the ‘CO2 is plant food’ oversimplification, tackled by Professor Sarah Green in the Denial101x lecture below. In short, if all else is equal, higher carbon dioxide is generally better for plant growth. The problem is that when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise in the real world, we can’t hold everything else constant the way we can in a greenhouse. Temperatures rise, and the resulting extreme heat can have severely detrimental impacts on plant growth, particularly for certain crops like maize. That rise in temperatures also amplifies droughts, the increase of water vapor in the atmosphere intensifies floods, and so on.  To evaluate the impact of rising carbon dioxide and the associated climate changes on crop yields, all these factors need to be considered. While rising carbon dioxide may have benefited agricultural productivity so far, most studies project a decline in crop yields starting in 2030, and climate change poses many other dangerous risks, as summarized in the latest IPCC report. The Times and The Australian published a commentary on the GWPF report written by Matt Ridley, who is an advisor to the GWPF. Ridley touted the report as having been “thoroughly peer-reviewed, as was almost all of the voluminous literature it cited,” although when pressed, it was revealed that the report was reviewed by individuals hand-picked by the GWPF. Moreover, many of the key references cited in the report were not peer-reviewed. Graham Readfearn contacted one scientist whose research had been referenced to support the report’s claims of ‘global greening,’ Professor Ranga Myneni of Boston University. Professor Myneni noted that the referenced presentation had not yet been peer-reviewed, and said, If one were to interpret the greening of the Earth as a good or a positive development then one must also accept that the accompanying climate changes (global warming, for example) and its physical (sea level rise) and biotic impacts (polar bears) as bad or negative developments. Again, in my opinion, this benefit of greening is not worth price of all the negative changes. Two examples of the sorts of negative changes noted by Professor Myneni recently made news. A new study published in Nature Geoscience by Francisco Estrada, W. J. Botzen, and GWPF advisor Richard Tol found that we can already identify the amplified damages and costs from hurricane landfalls due to human-caused global warming. The authors estimated in the year that Hurricane Katrina struck, in 2005, US$2 to US$14 billion of the recorded annual losses could be attributable to climate change, 2 to 12% of that year’s normalized losses. This study contradicts previous papers published by Roger Pielke Jr., which claimed that rising costs of hurricane damages could be accounted for by increased property values along the coast. However, that argument had been criticized by climate scientists like Kevin Trenberth and GWPF contributor Judith Curry, who noted that Pielke’s research did not account for the costs and avoided damages associated with technological improvements like improved building codes and hurricane path forecasting. As lead author of this new paper Francisco Estrada noted, we can now conclude the climate change signal in hurricane damages “is already there.” The Los Angeles Times also recently published an article whose headline claimed that California Governor Jerry Brown was wrong to link climate change and wildfires. However, as Kevin Drum at Mother Jones noted, virtually everyone quoted in this article either (a) says nothing about climate change or (b) says climate change is an important factor in the rise of wildfires in California and the West. And yet, somehow all of this is written in a way that makes it sound as if climate change has nothing to do with wildfires, and it’s topped by a headline that says in no uncertain terms, “Gov. Brown’s link between climate change and wildfires is unsupported, fire experts say.” Very peculiar. The aforementioned Roger Pielke was one of the individuals quoted in the LA Times accusing Governor Brown of playing politics. In reality, the connection between human-caused climate change and California wildfires is quite clear. Global warming causes temperatures to rise, which has amplified the current California mega-drought – the state’s worst in over 1,200 years. Human-caused climate change is helping turn the Golden State brown, creating conditions that are ripe for worse wildfires, with longer fire seasons.  One study estimated that the record heat intensified the current California drought by about 36%, while another put the value most likely at about 15–20%. While other factors have contributed to the growth in California wildfires, human-caused climate change has certainly played a role, and research shows California wildfires will only get worse as the planet continues to warm. The GWPF report predictably comes at a time when there is growing support and momentum behind the impending international climate negotiations in Paris. 140 countries have submitted plans to cut their carbon pollution. China recently announced a national carbon cap and trade system. The World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and many heads of state have joined forces to call for a price on carbon pollution. President Obama forged an American Business Act on Climate pledge with 81 companies including Coca Cola, Google, and Walmart. Even oil company CEOs are calling for a Paris climate deal. Prime ministers opposing climate policies in Australia and Canada have both recently been replaced with leaders who are far more realistic about climate change. Amid this backdrop, the GWPF’s efforts to paint an unrealistically rosy picture about the effects of carbon pollution are unlikely to have any success in undermining the Paris climate negotiations. • This article was amended on 10 February 2016. An earlier version said the bad consequences of climate change “far outweigh the good”, as even Richard Tol has concluded. This has been amended to replace the word “far” with “will”."
"The £2.9bn UK’s Environment Agency pension fund (EAFP) has become the first in the world to change its investment choices to help meet the internationally-agreed target of limiting global warming to 2C.  The move will include divestment of 90% of its coal assets and 50% of its oil and gas stocks by 2020.  The EAPF will also invest 15% of the fund in low-carbon energy, energy efficiency and other businesses that help tackle climate change by 2020 and has already moved its £280m of global share investments to a low-carbon index. Mark Mansley, EAPF’s chief investment officer, said the new policy was not a “knee-jerk reaction” but followed over a decade’s analysis of the financial risks posed by climate change.  Mansley said the policy aimed to protect and grow the fund: “We believe it will help address the risks and opportunities as the impacts of climate change materialise and is entirely consistent with securing the long-term investment returns of the fund and our fiduciary duty.” Christiana Figueres, the UN’s top climate change official, said the EAPF move was “more positive financial news ahead” of a crunch UN summit in Paris in December at which a global climate deal could be agreed. Investors responsible for $2.6tn have now committed to selling off their fossil fuel investments. A recent analysis showed local government pension funds in the UK, which have 4.6 million members, have lost hundreds of millions of pounds in the last 18 months due to the sharply falling value of coal investments.  Scientists have shown that most existing fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground to avoid the catastrophic global warming expected beyond 2C. Institutions including the World Bank, the G20 and city analysts are concerned that, if the world’s nations crack down on carbon emissions to halt climate change, those reserves will lose their value.  This analysis indicates that fossil fuel investments are a threat to both the climate and the value of investment funds. Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned recently that the losses were “potentially huge”. The EAPF statement said it had already reduced the fund’s carbon footprint by 44% since 2008 and that fossil fuels currently made up about 2.5% of the fund. It said the financial risks and opportunities of climate change come from the physical impacts of extreme weather, changes in regulation to cut carbon emissions and the increased competition faced by fossil fuels from clean energy.  The EAPF said it would “support progress towards an orderly transition to a low carbon economy through actively working with asset owners, fund managers, companies, academia, policy makers and others in the investment industry”."

"David Attenborough, presenter Even though I was 84, being at the poles wasn’t too hard. It’s not as if I ever had to walk far or pull a sledge. If you wear the right clothes, you can tolerate low temperatures – though if something goes wrong and you lose a glove, you might equally lose a hand.  Trips to the north pole are a commercial operation run by the Russians: they put up a tented camp there every year. It’s quite a populated place. There were 50 or 60 people: us, scientists and adventurers who want to say they’ve been to the north pole. But if you told me I was at the south pole when I was actually at the north, I wouldn’t know. They are almost exactly the same. There’s nothing there, just this wide, flat landscape. When we made Life in the Freezer, we spent a lot of time on South Georgia, just north of the Antarctic circle. It was thick with life: elephant seals, king penguins, whales, albatrosses – absolutely throbbing and very exciting. But the poles were odd, or not odd so much as boring. I think there have only been only one or two birds recorded at the south pole in the last 10 years. One may have ended up there after following the smell of aeroplane fuel. Regarding the episode about climate change, if you’ve seen how complex, exciting and beautiful the natural world is, yet you know that every year there’s less of it because of what humans are doing, it would have been irresponsible not to say something about it. Climate change’s effect is overwhelming, and programmes like this can raise awareness. Alastair Fothergill, executive producer The scenery in the polar regions is unmatched anywhere else on our planet. In the north, the polar bear is the star: the largest land predator there is. Until Frozen Planet, a lot of its hunting hadn’t been filmed. Meanwhile, in the south, the stars are the penguins. We knew we could get lots of funny shots of them. When the males build their nests, they steal each other’s stones – because a big nest impresses the females. We captured other things that had never been filmed before: killer whales cooperating to create waves that wash seals off the ice; and the brinicle, which is a kind of icicle that drops from the ice to the sea floor. As it spreads out, it freezes all the invertebrates to death. We shot it in timelapse and it looked like something from Harry Potter. We were working in wind chill of -50C. If you took a glass of boiling water outside, it would explode instantly. And you can’t touch metal with exposed fingers. Since a lot of animals feed in the ocean, we had to work at the edge of the ice, too. You can only film at the north pole for about a month: the sun doesn’t rise until March, and from mid-April the ice is breaking up. In fact, the ice split between our tent and the runway. We had to jump to get across. And polar bears are extremely dangerous. They’re unique in that they’re the one animal that actually likes to eat human beings. We learned how to shoot rifles and used flare guns a lot to frighten them away. Mount Erebus in Antarctica was amazing: an active volcano in a world of ice. We used a helicopter to get up there and then had to do an emergency landing in a very bad storm – that was certainly a moment. But you have to take risks to get something genuinely fresh. Natural history, done well, is a vital tool for conservation. Hardly anyone had seen a snow leopard before Planet Earth. Now the World Wildlife Fund gives away cuddly toys of them. The Hunt, David Attenborough and Alastair Fothergill’s new series, starts on BBC1 on 1 November."
"Malcolm Turnbull says the need for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation remains an “open question” and has dismissed emissions trading schemes as simply another “piece of economic plumbing”, as Labor attacked the credibility of the Coalition’s climate policies.  Turnbull lost the Liberal leadership in 2009 over his backing for the former Rudd government’s emissions trading scheme, and was forced to pledge to retain the current Direct Action climate plan in order to win support from conservative and climate-sceptic colleagues before becoming prime minister, despite having once described it as “bullshit” and a “recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale.” Under Tony Abbott, the coalition unsuccessfully tried to abolish the corporation, which the former prime minister derided as the “Bob Brown bank”. The CEFC lends to clean energy projects on commercial terms and has so far lent $1.4bn, which will reduce emissions by 4.2m tonnes annually and also achieve a positive return on the commonwealth’s investments. Under Turnbull the CEFC has been transferred to the environment department and the government has apparently dropped plans to hobble its mandate by banning investments in wind farms and small scale solar and has suggested it plays an important role in its climate plans. But despite this, during question time on Tuesday, Turnbull refused to say he backed the institution – instead hedging his answer and pointing out the government had been unable to get the Senate to agree to the CEFC’s abolition.  “The CEFC certainly has been making some investments in this area and in that respect has been assisting in supporting the reduction in emissions, but it is a fair question to ask whether it is necessary as an institution, and indeed it was the government’s policy to abolish it,” Turnbull said. “We do not support government banks performing roles that can be performed by the private sector ... yes it has done some good work, the question is whether it is an appropriate use of government money,” he said, refusing to concede it played a “crucial” part in Australia’s emissions reduction. Turnbull also insisted the Coalition’s Direct Action plan could meet the target Australia will take to the United Nations conference in Paris in December – to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% of 2005 levels by 2030. He said an ETS “used to be Coalition policy but it is not any more”, saying an ETS was “no more than one mechanism to reduce emissions, it is a means to an end ... a piece of economic plumbing.” Turnbull said he was sure Direct Action could meet the 2030 target. The coalition envisages a range of policies to meet the target – including buying abatement through the emissions reduction fund and as-yet vague plans to regulate vehicle emissions standards and improve energy efficiency.  The environment minister, Greg Hunt, has said his so-called “safeguards mechanism” will reduce emissions by 200m tonnes by 2030, even though it is currently not designed to force any emission reductions from industrial emitters. “We will review our measures in 2017 and if they need adjustment, they will be adjusted ... [Labor] needs to get used to the fact that we are committed to cutting emissions,” Turnbull said."
"Malcolm Turnbull has declared a moratorium on Australian coal exports “would make not the blindest bit of difference to global emissions” because importers would buy it from elsewhere.  The prime minister dismissed the idea of a unilateral ban of such exports after 61 prominent Australians signed an open letter calling on world leaders to discuss a global ban on new coal mines and coal mine expansions at the United Nations climate meeting in Paris in December. Turnbull said coal remained a significant part of the global energy mix and would be “an absolutely critical ingredient” in alleviating hunger and promoting prosperity around the world. This appeared to be an extension of the “moral case” for coal exports advocated by the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, and by the coal industry in support of increasing supply to developing markets such as India. But the prime minister undercut that argument by conceding many people in developing countries were not on an electricity grid, and renewable energy sources such as solar could become more cost effective in those circumstances. “I don’t agree with the idea of a moratorium on exporting coal. With great respect to the people who advocated it, it would make not the blindest bit of difference to global emissions,” Turnbull said in Canberra on Tuesday. “If Australia stopped exporting coal, the countries to which we export it would buy it from somewhere else. So there is absolutely quite a lot of coal around ... so if Australia were to stop all of its coal exports it would not reduce global emissions one iota. In fact, arguably it would increase them because our coal, by and large, is cleaner than the coal in many other countries. “With great respect to the motivations and the big hearts and the idealism of the people that advocate that, that is actually not a sensible policy from an economic point of view, a jobs point of view or frankly from a global warming or global emissions point of view.” The Australian Conservation Foundation accused Turnbull of “resorting to the drug dealer’s defence” by arguing that someone else would supply the coal. “Australia has a moral responsibility to help our developing neighbours leapfrog over dirty coal, straight to clean renewable energy,” said the foundation’s chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy. The Australia Institute, which helped organise Tuesday’s open letter, suggested Turnbull had ignored the substance of the proposal by focusing on Australian exports. The open letter called for world leaders to negotiate a moratorium on new coalmines and coalmine expansions, and referred to a similar call by the president of Kiribati, Anote Tong. “Malcolm Turnbull should take the time to read the letter from President Tong – it is not a call for an export ban, but a considered call for a global moratorium on new coalmines,” said Ben Oquist, the executive director of the Australia Institute. “This is an entirely sensible move both environmentally and economically. Now is the time to pick up the phone to President Tong to discuss how Australia can be a leader in the climate debate.” Greens deputy leader Larissa Waters said Turnbull was “using rhetoric to juggle the wishes of the climate dinosaurs in his party against the overwhelming community support for climate action”. “Australians deserve more than a prime minister who sidesteps questions about our future and that of our children and our Pacific neighbours,” she said. “Coal must not be treated as the elephant in the room at the climate talks.” Turnbull was addressing the media as he confirmed the appointment of Dr Alan Finkel, the outgoing chancellor of Monash University, as Australia’s next chief scientist. Finkel, an engineer, has previously called for a debate about nuclear electricity generation in Australia as part of efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions. The media conference was dominated by questions about Australia’s response to climate change as world leaders prepare to meet in Paris to discuss post-2020 emission reduction targets. Finkel said his vision was “for a country, society, a world where we don’t use any coal, oil or natural gas because we have zero-emissions electricity in huge abundance and we use that for transport, for heating and for all the things we ordinary use electricity”. “But you can’t get there overnight, so what we need to do is optimise the technology so that with we can cost-effectively introduce alternatives,” Finkel said. “The best way to get rid of coal is to introduce alternatives that deliver value at a reasonable price rather than just arbitrarily turning it off.” Turnbull said coal was likely to remain a very large part of the global energy mix “for a very long time” and he cited “energy poverty” as a major limit on achieving the development goals of alleviating hunger and promoting prosperity around the world. “Coal is going to play a big part in that,” he said. “Having said that, the pace of technological development in the renewable space has been extraordinary.” Turnbull singled out the improvement in battery storage for solar power as “a big game-changer” and described the energy field as “very disruptive, very disrupted”. “Solar panels and batteries in an Australian household context at the moment are probably not in most cases competitive with the price of grid-delivered power,” he said. “However, if you are in a remote community, or if you are in a community in a developing country where there is no electricity grid, and the alternative is generating power by burning diesel, then solar panels and some batteries, if the efficiency of the panels is improved and the price and efficiency of the batteries has come down could actually be and very often is much more cost effective.  “So it’s horses for courses. It is important to take the ideology out of this and just approach it in a very clear-eyed, cool-headed rational way.” Supporters of Adani’s $16bn Carmichael coal mine and rail proposal for central Queensland, which was re-approved by the federal government this month, have argued it would help lift millions of Indians out of energy poverty. But analysts have disputed the claimed benefits on the basis that many remote villages are beyond the reach of the electricity grid. Finkel, whose appointment begins in January upon the expiry of Professor Ian Chubb’s five-year term, would not give an opinion about the adequacy of the government’s 2030 target of reducing Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions to 26% to 28% below 2005 levels. He said he would “need time to engage on that”. But Finkel vowed to provide the government with evidence-based advice and was “absolutely confident” that he would have a receptive audience. In broader remarks, Turnbull and the science minister, Christopher Pyne, praised Finkel for his personal experience as an entrepreneur translating research into commercial products, saying he was well-suited to improve collaboration between universities, research centres and business. Turnbull, who lost the Liberal leadership in 2009 after an internal backlash against his support for an emissions trading scheme, has promised his colleagues that he will stick with the Coalition’s “Direct Action” climate policies, although he has left the door open to considering changes in 2017 when a review of the safeguards mechanism is due. Turnbull is planning to attend the climate talks in Paris in December."

"Labor has welcomed the announcement that Malcolm Turnbull will attend climate change talks in Paris this year but says the government is selling Australia short by taking global warming “sceptic” policies to the key meeting.  The prime minister revealed to Guardian Australia on Friday that it was his “intention” to attend the UN climate change meeting, which his predecessor, Tony Abbott, had decided to shun. The government has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas pollution by at least 26% of 2005 levels by 2030, with the possibility of reducing it even further to 28% if the target does not adversely impact the economy. Other developed nations will take more ambitious targets to December’s UN meeting, including the US, which has pledged a reduction of 26% to 28% by 2025, and the EU, which has pledged a reduction of 40% of 1990 levels by 2030. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, has labelled Australia’s goal as “climate-sceptic targets”. “The Australian government is selling Australia short with their low targets and low aspirations, their knee-high ambitions for tackling climate change in Australia,” Shorten said on Sunday. “I’m glad that Malcolm Turnbull is going to Paris, I just wish he was taking policies other that Tony Abbott’s discredited Direct Action policy.” He addded: “Whether or not Malcolm Turnbull goes to Paris or not is not going to stop global warming. The issue is what policies you adopt to defeat climate change.  “It’s not a question of what places you visit, or what selfies you take when you visit places, it’s a question of your actions. Unfortunately, Australia is not leading, we’re following other parts of the world.” Shorten and his deputy, Tanya Plibersek, will visit low-lying Pacific nations for a four-day visit this week. They will discuss climate change with the governments of Papua New Guinea, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands. The Greens have warned that Labor will face intense questioning from leaders in neighbouring countries over its support for big coal projects. “Low-lying Pacific nations, including nations Mr Shorten is visiting, are urging a moratorium on new Australian coalmines,” said the deputy Greens leader, Larissa Waters. “Saying you want action on climate change and then ignoring coal exports is like taking one step forward and a giant leap backwards.”"

"Guardian Australia: We’d like to ask some specific policy questions first, and then some more general ones. Starting with asylum, if New Zealand is still willing to resettle 150 refugees a year from our offshore detention centres why wouldn’t we do that? Malcolm Turnbull: The challenge with all of this as you know is to ensure that we don’t give the people smugglers incentive to get back into business.  And you think that would? Well, it certainly … I think an outcome like that could. But I really, I’m sorry, I just don’t want to go into any more detail about that. So how long can we then, in all conscience, keep people on Nauru without a resettlement path? We are doing everything in our power, everything we can to resettle them, but resettle them in a way that is not going to result in creating incentives for people smugglers to get back into business. So if the bipartisan consensus in Australia is that what’s happening to people on Nauru is just the price we have to pay for the boats to stop, if that’s what both major parties think, surely we have a moral obligation for there to be some transparency about the conditions they are in. But we know only one journalist has been allowed in in 18 months, we know the Border Force Act means people can be imprisoned, health workers and the like, if they talk about the conditions there, shouldn’t we be more transparent if that’s the price we believe we have to pay? Lenore, I really appreciate and understand your deep interest in this and the deep interest of many Australians. I understand the concerns. We do everything we can to ensure people are safe, that they have the medical services they need, and there are many people in Manus or Nauru who are able if they choose to return safely from whence they came, as you know, but as you know there are many Iranians, whose asylum claims have been rejected, who do not want to go back to Iran, but we cannot return them. But the one thing we have to be absolutely clear about is that people who seek to get to Australia via a people smuggling operation will not settle in Australia. But the question doesn’t really go to that, it goes to – given that we are holding people in these conditions, don’t we have a responsibility to be transparent about, to make sure journalists can go and report, to provide actual functional oversight. Well I hear what you say but we are not going to make any changes at the present time. On climate policy you’ve said the important thing is to get emission reductions and that there are lots of ways to get there. Greg Hunt says the safeguard mechanism will achieve around 200m tonnes of the abatement you need to achieve your 2030 target. At the moment the safeguards mechanism is explicitly designed to stop rogue emitters going crazy. Surely that means you are going to have to change it when you do your review in 2017 or maybe sooner, and if that’s the case why not say so now? Well, we’ll review the policy in 2017 and if changes need to be made to meet the emission cuts we have promised, then changes will be made.  But we know changes need to be made … You say you do. But your policy says quite explicitly this safeguard mechanism is not designed to force anyone to reduce their emissions and on the other hand your minister says that policy will achieve 200m of emission reductions, it’s not me saying it, it’s a discrepancy in your own policy. Well, Lenore, I hate to be unhelpful, but the work that has been done by Greg, that I have been through with him, has certainly persuaded me, that on the assumptions that he has got, we will meet that 26% to 28% cut in emissions. Now, if it turns out we are not able to do that then we are going to have to make changes and that is the purpose of the 2017 review. Just to try one more time, I am not questioning the assumptions he is making, I am questioning why he is assuming part of the policy will do something it doesn’t currently appear to be designed to do. Well I just can’t agree with you on that contention. If you want to drill into the details of Greg’s policy, obviously take it up with him, but it is very clear we have to deliver our commitment. And go beyond that probably? Sure, one assumes, arguably, that depends on the rest of the world. If we get a global commitment, then Australia and Australians will expect us to live up to them. And you’ll go to Paris? That is my intention. I’ll go to CHOGM [the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Malta] and then I’ll go to Paris [for the UN climate change conference]. Two quick questions on media. Given your longstanding support for scrapping platform specific ownership rules, can we expect you to move quickly on this reform? How quickly? The answer is this issue of media law changes, and in particular, some of the ownership law changes is being looked at by the minister, my esteemed successor, Senator [Mitch] Fifield. I think it’s very likely these matters will be considered by cabinet in the future. It’s an issue for cabinet and it is also an issue for other parties in the parliament. There’s no point proposing changes that have no prospect of being passed. We have plenty of things to do. The reach rule in particular is certainly a matter of great concern to regional broadcasters as you know. The two-out-of-three rule is of concern to some players but the reach rule is the one of greatest urgency by people in the industry. So you are likely to move on the reach rule before you move on ownership? I didn’t say that. But I can interpret that from what you said. You may say that, I couldn’t possibly comment. Players in the media landscape have all got somewhat different views. There are some people strongly in favour of removing the reach rule. At least one player is against it. There are other players that say if you do reach you have got to do two out of three. Mitch has got the unenviable task of circling the wagons again. I think he’s done that and he’ll come back with some recommendations. It may be leave things as they are. It may be to propose change. But I don’t want to get ahead of where the cabinet is. The previous occupant of this office [Tony Abbott] was waiting for an industry consensus. I’ve never detected you have been waiting for an industry consensus. I’ve known this industry for nearly 40 years. Have you seen a consensus? The only consensus has been on broadcasting licence fees. You’re not waiting for a consensus then? … a complete consensus, there might have been a consensus. I’ve seen this film before (Laughs). And given your support for press freedom, can we expect you to look at section 35P of the Asio Act which imposes the most significant restrictions on publication since World War Two? I can’t ... I haven’t sat down with George [Brandis, the attorney general] and discussed that provision since I’ve been here. I can’t give you an update. I’m interested in the starting point for your thinking about the economy. How quickly can you start to reduce the deficit and do you set yourself any benchmarks? Does tax reform have to contribute to the bottom line or is it only aimed at improving growth and productivity? And what lessons have you learned from the first Abbott budget about spending cuts? Well, starting from the last question, umm, I guess an important lesson is you can’t legislate without the support of the Senate. You’ve seen last week the changes to family tax benefits recut to greater prospective success. Were you trying to make that fairer? Ah, we should always, we should never cease trying to make changes in the social welfare area fairer. Fairer is what is it all about. Fairness has got to be the key priority. So has affordability and of course people have different views about what is fair. In terms of revenue, well, we think we are already raising a very high percentage, a high percentage of GDP as tax. Tax revenues are high. Expenditure is higher though. A more efficient tax system, even if it only raises the same amount of money, would likely increase revenues over time because you would get stronger GDP growth. Depending on the circumstances, it may not be the quickest way to get back to surplus but an important contributor to getting back to budget balance is to constrain expenditure growth as fairly as you can, and work to make sure the economy grows at a faster rate. Is that what you’ve got in mind generally? It’s the old story. It’s a bit of a cliche but it’s true enough for that. The Labor party and parties of the left generally are very focused on redistributive, or distributive justice and how do you share the cake up. That’s not irrelevant. We do it, too. That’s why means testing is so important. The answer is actually growing the cake. The answer is growth. That way, everything is better. That’s why whenever I talk about a high wage, generous social welfare net, first world economy and it’s important to understand, I’m not just talking about high wages, but there is a social welfare net, and it’s got to be generous and affordable. If you are looking at budget repair though, don’t you have to look at tax concessions as well as spending? Of course you do. Of course. In that package you put out this week for instance, the spending cuts to benefits are hypothecated towards childcare payments. There’s a big increase in the payments to families earning more than $185,000. So you are giving childcare payments to the quite wealthy and you are funding that by making cuts to people on quite low incomes. Is that fair? I don’t want to argue with you about the specifics. I’m not sure I accept your premise. This is, as Christian Porter [the social services minister] acknowledged in the House this week, this is a very complex area and we have already made changes in light of critiques. You know, Christian has offered to sit down with Jenny Macklin [shadow minister for disability reform] and discuss it. So you might make more changes? Well Christian’s flagged that. I’m not micromanaging his portfolio, I assure you. I’m not in charge of it but he’s stood up and presented that, and when Jenny, you know, criticised it, or raised some issues about grandparent carers – 3,700 of them he calculated – he said “Let’s sit down”. He offered to buy her a cup of tea. The kindness! [Laughs]. The tax reform process, the discussions with the states, is it a starting point that the process has to work out how to make up the funding shortfall for hospitals? The [money] has to come from somewhere? One of the things is very clear is the states have got to be part of this. The reform agenda, if that’s the right way to describe it, and I’m wary of the term because reform is not an end in itself. You can pat yourself on the back at least in the columns of the Australian Financial Review for being an economic reformer but the real issue is are we creating are opportunities, more jobs, better jobs, a more secure future. That’s what it is all about. You can’t lose sight of that. It’s a means to an end. The answer is what the states do is a big part of it. What they do with their own tax bases. They have substantial tax bases of their own and the answer to the states – it’s easy for the states to say just jack up the GST … Do you think they could make up that shortfall from their own tax bases? Well, they’ve got considerable ability with their own tax bases. What I’m saying is, states have got to address the productivity of their own services, are they getting value for their own expenditure in health and education and so forth? How are they managing their own tax bases. It’s not good enough for a state government to say – and I’m not saying that they are – various premiers have shown they are looking at their own circumstances, but a state government can’t say: “Nothing to see here, give us more money.” But you don’t see it as the federal government’s responsibility to fix that problem, largely, because the state governments haven’t got the capacity through their own budgets? I think it’s a national problem. I mean you can’t sit here in Canberra and say we are not going to help, we’ve got nothing to do with issues in public hospitals. The federation is a work of collaboration. But that means both sides have got to do some heavy lifting. On Thursday the foreign minister [Julie Bishop] left open the prospect that Canada’s withdrawal from operations could see Australia step into the breach. She didn’t say “would see”, she said “could see”. How realistic a prospect is that? Our position vis-a-vis Syria is unchanged and in the event of us making a change it will be announced following a careful consideration of the issues in the NSC [national security committee]. But given over the last couple of weeks, quite obviously there has been a shift in the conversation around Syria from military intervention to political solution. I wouldn’t necessarily agree with that, Katharine, I think that there has never been a military solution in Syria, there has only been a political solution. There are military measures. There can only be a political solution there and the question is how is it going to come about. What the Russians have done is, I assume they wanted to keep their friend, Mr Assad, they wanted to keep him in the game, prevent him from being knocked out of the ring, and so they provided support to do that, and they are now getting caught up in the situation, and they could get caught up very deeply. They may live to regret this intervention, but one way or another the only solution is a political one. But that changes the game for all the players? Yep, it certainly does change the landscape, that is for sure. So how does it change it for us? Well our activities are solely directed against Isil or Daesh [Islamic State], we are staying well away from the Syrian government forces and certainly staying well away from other Syrian forces, the Free Syrian Army and so forth, the rebel forces that are opposed to Assad. They are solely focussed on Daesh. But there will need to be a political settlement there, just as there will need to be in Iraq, too. Having said there needs to be, achieving it is another challenge. A slightly lighter question. We understand you’re a fan of both Danish noir and House of Cards – so who’s the most effective national leader: Birgitte Nyborg in Borgen or Frank Underwood?  Birgitte undoubtedly. Frank Underwood, he’s a sort of latter-day Iago isn’t he? I mean that’s what it’s modelled on really, if you go back to the English House of Cards and all the direct peices to the audience when he talks about how villianous he is. Frank Underwood is an absolutely classic villain, in fact he’s actually just one step away from Snidely Whiplash, but Birgitte Nyborg – I think that is a very interesting role because it shows all of the stresses between family life, political life, the compromises that have to be made. It’s a very raw, real political drama, whereas House of Cards, which we all love, is more of a melodrama. So speaking of oversize characters, what kind of president do you think Donald Trump would make? [Laughs] Hmmm. Well he’s the frontrunner. I, er, I think I won’t make any comments on respective American candidates. OK, well let’s go to the vision question then. What kind of a prime minister do you want to be? If you are elected next year and we have four years of a Turnbull government how will the country be different? What’s the top of your to do list? Well, my objectives are very much the ones I set out five weeks ago. To be much more innovative, much more competitive, Much more productive. Why? Not because they are great goals in themselves, but because that is the way we will ensure our prosperity. One of the interesting things about being prime minister, which I have just picked up, is that when you say things you have been saying for the last five or 10 years, people take more notice of you. I’ve been making this point about competitiveness and the things we need to do and it is all about innovation, technology and being more competitive. This point about agility. It is not just a word it is almost a cultural shift. You have got to say, forget about future proofing, you can’t proof yourself against the future, you have to recognise we are living in rapidly disruptive economic times, times of considerable volatility. But in that lies enormous opportunity for Australia. That’s the theoretical framework, but when you translate that into a policy “to do” list, what are the priorities? Oh, well the priority to do list is … the federal government has got a lot of big levers, right. We should spend more, better, on infrastructure, big agenda. You’ve seen what I have been saying about mass transit. You published a piece by Peter Newman about value capture. Peter and I are old friends, we have been corresponding about these issues for a long time. I have learned a lot from him over the years. That is very important. Innovation policy, is our tax system working in a way that incentivises, or disincentivises innovation.  Labor’s changes to employee share schemes positively disincentivised it. It is as though they sat down and said, “how can we discourage start up companies?” and passed a law that did exactly that. I am sure that wasn’t what they planned, at least I hope not anyway, but that was the consequence. So the aim is to make sure everything you are doing is calculated to get to that goal and if something isn’t working as well as you want, chuck it out. I’m not afraid of people saying, it’s a backdown, or a backflip, an agile government is prepared to abandon policies that don’t work. So of the policies that are incomplete, what do you want to have done by the next election? Lenore, it’s your job to predict the future. We will have an innovation package out before Christmas.  And higher education? You will see. I am not going to lay out the timing of a lot of things which are all work in progress. Simon [Birmingham] is reviewing again the higher education reforms that were unsuccessful in the senate. He hasn’t abandoned them, by the way, but obviously they couldn’t start on 1 January 2016. We have to recognise that in order to govern we need to get things through the Senate, so we reached agreement on the Chafta, we are aiming to reach agreement on the family tax benefit changes. Parliament is working. The government is governing. That’s the goal. And will you run full term? I am certainly assuming the next election will be in September or October 2016. "

"Oak leaves in Britain are still mostly green. The oak is one of the last trees to change colour in autumn, although many have already dropped their acorns. But the days of finding lots of big acorns may be drawing to a close since they are falling victim to climate change. A study of acorns has revealed that the warmer the weather the smaller the crop of acorns. Tim Sparks, a professor at Coventry University, has examined more than 160,000 observations of oaks and found that the more the first dates of flowering vary in springtime the poorer the acorn crop. In warmer springs the oak trees flower in a less synchronised fashion over a longer period and this gives a smaller crop of acorns in autumn, a drop of about 20%.  In cooler springs the oak flowers within a shorter period and the blooming is more synchronised, allowing more successful cross-pollination. These days acorns are ripening about 13 days earlier than they did 10 years ago, a phenomenon that matches a widespread earlier shift in fruit and nuts ripening on British trees. Another sign of the changes is autumn tree-leaf colours tending to appear later in the year and leaves staying on the trees longer; oak leaves now seem to lose their leaves about a week later than was the case 30 years ago. The observations of the oaks and other trees came from a yearly survey of spring and autumn called Nature’s Calendar, run by the Woodland Trust. Each year the public is asked to record signs of those seasons in the natural world. It has built up into an invaluable, and timed, record."
"The Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is used to big productions. On the edge of the Sahara desert and the centre of the north African country’s “Ouallywood” film industry it has played host to big-budget location shots in Lawrence of Arabia, The Mummy, The Living Daylights and even Game of Thrones. Now the trading city, nicknamed the “door of the desert”, is the centre for another blockbuster – a complex of four linked solar mega-plants that, alongside hydro and wind, will help provide nearly half of Morocco’s electricity from renewables by 2020 with, it is hoped, some spare to export to Europe. The project is a key plank in Morocco’s ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower.  When the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power (CSP) plant in the world, and the first phase, called Noor 1, will go live next month. The mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that are now familiar on roofs the world over, but it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down. The potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades. In the days after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 the German particle physicist Gerhard Knies, calculated that the world’s deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide for humanity’s power needs for a whole year. The challenge though, has been capturing that energy and transporting it to the population centres where it is required. As engineers put the finishing touches to Noor 1, its 500,000 crescent-shaped solar mirrors glitter across the desert skyline. The 800 rows follow the sun as it tracks across the heavens, whirring quietly every few minutes as their shadows slip further east.  When they are finished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as Morocco’s capital city, Rabat, and generate 580MW of electricity, enough to power a million homes. Noor 1 itself has a generating capacity of 160MW. Morocco’s environment minister, Hakima el-Haite, believes that solar energy could have the same impact on the region this century that oil production had in the last. But the $9bn (£6bn) project to make her country’s deserts boom was triggered by more immediate concerns, she said. “We are not an oil producer. We import 94% of our energy as fossil fuels from abroad and that has big consequences for our state budget,” el-Haite told the Guardian. “We also used to subsidise fossil fuels which have a heavy cost, so when we heard about the potential of solar energy, we thought; why not?”  Solar energy will make up a third of Morocco’s renewable energy supply by 2020, with wind and hydro taking the same share each.  “We are very proud of this project,” el-Haite said. “I think it is the most important solar plant in the world.” Each parabolic mirror is 12 metres high and focussed on a steel pipeline carrying a ‘heat transfer solution’ (HTF) that is warmed to 393C as it snakes along the trough before coiling into a heat engine. There, it is mixed with water to create steam that turns energy-generating turbines. The HTF is made up of a synthetic thermal oil solution that is pumped towards a heat tank containing molten salts that can store heat energy for three hours, allowing the plant to power homes into the night. The mirrors are spaced in tier formations, to minimise damage from sand blown up by desert winds. Technicians say that the Noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017 will store energy for up to eight hours – opening the prospect of 24/7 solar energy in the Sahara, and the surrounding region. “The biggest challenge we faced was being able to finish the project on time with the performance [level] we needed to achieve,” said Rashid al-Bayad, the project director. But even as the first phase of the project nears completion, Morocco is eyeing grander international ambitions. “We are already involved in high tension transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania as a first step,” says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of Société d’Investissements Energétiques, the national renewable energy investment firm. But he says the project’s ultimate impact will go far wider – even as far as the Middle East. “The [ultimate] objective given by his majesty the king is Mecca.” Whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilising effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen). Talks are ongoing with Tunisia, and energy exports northwards across the Mediterranean remain a key goal, despite the collapse in 2013 of the Desertec project, a German plan to source 15% of Europe’s energy from North African desert solar by 2050. “We believe that it’s possible to export energy to Europe but first we would have to build the interconnectors which don’t yet exist,” said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman. “Specifically, we would have to build interconnections, which would not go through the existing one in Spain, and then start exporting.” Spain has itself prohibited new solar projects because of a lack of interconnectors to transmit the energy to France. The EU has set a target of ensuring that 10% of each member country’s power can be transported abroad by cable by 2020. In the meantime, Morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs for resource independence. This could one day include water desalination, in a country that is increasingly being hit by drought as the climate warms. Officials are keenly aware of the running they are making in what is the most advanced renewable energy programme in the Middle East and North African region. “We are at the avante-garde of solar,” el-Kadiri says.  About $9bn has been invested in the Noor complex, much of it from international institutions such as the European Investment Bank and World Bank and backed by Moroccan government guarantees. Undisclosed energy subsidies from Morocco’s unelected ruler, King Mohammed VI, have prevented the cost from being transferred to energy consumers. One month before launch, over a thousand mostly Moroccan workers are still racing to fix electric wires, take down scaffolding and wrap rockwool insulation around steel pipelines. They bustle past in yellow and orange bibs, working 12-hour shifts against a backdrop of the Atlas mountains. Harnesses with hammers and gloves strapped to their belts swing by their sides. Ubiquitous hard hats, safety shoes and ear plugs give the scene an air of theatrical camp.  For Hajar Lakhael, a 25-year-old environment and security manager from Meknes, rehearsals are almost over and the blockbuster production is nearly ready for action. “We’ve done the construction and now we will see how these projects look when they start,” she says. “It is exactly like the preparation for a grand performance.” A global audience will be watching with interest.

"The federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, has said Australians “should be proud” of the government’s effort in tackling climate change despite his rubber-stamping of one of the world’s largest coalmines. On Thursday, Hunt approved Adani’s $16.5bn Carmichael mine and rail project, which will extract up to 60m tonnes of coal a year from the Galilee Basin region of central Queensland. It is the second time Hunt has approved the mine after his previous decision was invalidated because he had not considered its impact on two vulnerable reptile species. The decision to approve the mine has been labelled “grossly irresponsible” by environmentalists who claim its coal will accelerate climate change, threaten groundwater supplies and endanger the Great Barrier Reef through increased shipping and exacerbated ocean acidification and warming. But Hunt has defended his approval, saying a rejection of the project due to climate concerns would have been reversed by the courts.  “The advice was clear, categorical and absolute from the department of environment,” he said. “That on the matters of national environmental significance (NES), this project, which is 300km inland, remote outback, dry, dusty, clearly meets the matters of NES. “The law describes and absolutely sets out the terms I’m entitled and allowed to assess. Any other decision would have been invalidated by a court. The federal environment act works like a judge’s court list, you don’t get to choose what comes before you.” Hunt dismissed the suggestion that Australia’s backing of a mine that will cause 128m tonnes of carbon dioxide to be emitted – more than the entire emissions of New Zealand and nearly three times the emissions abated by the Coalition’s Direct Action auction in April – would cause consternation overseas. Anote Tong, the president of Kiribati, a low-lying Pacific nation vulnerable to sea-level rises, has called Australia’s embrace of coal “selfish”. Meanwhile, the powerful G7 group of nations has committed to phasing out fossil fuels by the end of the century and BP’s chief economist admitted this week that most of the world’s oil would have to stay in the ground to avoid dangerous climate change. Hunt would not commit to a similar phase-out and said other countries have been pleased by Australia’s efforts, including its recent pledge to cut greenhouse gases by 26%-28% by 2030, based on 2005 levels. “All the planet knows is the total volume of emissions, it doesn’t know the source of it, the type of it,” he said. “I’ve had many frank discussions with colleagues in this space, I think they have been delighted and pleasantly surprised by the ... 26 to 28% reduction which is the highest per capita reduction in the world.  “Australians should be proud. Some of those who want to denounce our own country might want to reflect that we are one of the few countries to have met our Kyoto 1 targets. We will meet and beat our Kyoto 2 targets despite many pundits on the left having said that will never happen.  “We now take a third round of targets that are the best in the G20, the best of any comparable developed country on a per capita basis. That’s something that Australians should be proud of and the world has been pleasantly surprised and delighted by.” Hunt said the government still backed restrictions on groups mounting legal challenges to mining projects – a practice denounced as “lawfare” under Tony Abbott’s prime ministership – but that he was “realistic that it’s unlikely to pass the Senate”. Aboriginal leaders still plan a separate challenge to the Carmichael mine.  A total of 36 conditions have been placed upon the project, including restrictions on water-level loss and compensatory habitat for the razed homes of the yakka skink and ornamental snake.  The largest of these habitat offsets is 31,000 hectares that must be found for the threatened black-throated finch, which faces losing one of its two remaining major areas of habitat.  April Reside, part of the government’s black-throated finch recovery team, said the mine was likely to push the bird towards extinction. “Losing this rich habitat would be a major blow to the chances of this species persisting,” she said. “The offset habitat proposed by the Indian owner, Adani, is of poorer quality and cannot reliably be enhanced to provide the special food and habitat the birds require to survive.” Hunt also announced that the government would provide $30m to the City of Melbourne to make street lights more energy efficient. About 16,000 lights will be replaced by longer-lasting, more efficient LED bulbs. The lighting upgrade will help central Melbourne save 110,000 tones of carbon dioxide emissions over 10 years – about 0.08% of the Carmichael mine’s emissions from a single year at capacity.  Hunt said the lighting initiative was the “right thing by the planet and right thing by the residents of Melbourne”. The funding for the lights will be provided by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, a body the government wishes to scrap. But Hunt said that due to opposition to the abolition in the Senate, the CEFC would “be with us for a long while”."
"Australia’s coal industry is on borrowed time. In general, renewables are becoming more efficient and major coal projects are being cancelled and scaled back. This is perhaps why have heard so much from the Coalition recently about the superior moral qualities of the “little black rock”.   Around this time last year, former prime minister Tony Abbott (Remember him? The one who used to pal around with Stephen Harper?) gave us the memorable line “coal is good for humanity”. He was speaking in support of the Caval Ridge mine in Queensland. This week, the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, responded to critics of the recently-approved Carmichael mine: There is a strong moral case here. Over a billion people don’t have access to electricity. That means that more 2 billion people today are using wood and dung for their cooking. It may seem odd to hear a politician, in 2015, arguing not only that burning coal will lead to cleaner air, but that it helps the global poor – the same group who are likely to be most affected by the climate change being driven by fossil fuel emissions. We’ve reached this point because mines can no longer be easily defended on the basis of their creation of jobs or broad economic benefits. So they have to be sold as a species of foreign aid. This is on the basis of the dubious proposition that coal will provide the best and cheapest way of generating energy to “lift the poor out of poverty”, with particular reference to India. Given the advantages of new generation renewables, this is in serious doubt.  But rushing in to debunk the “moral case for coal” is largely fruitless, because it’s a snowjob. The main game, as always, is to shield the industry from the criticisms of environmentalists and others who might be wondering why Australia is squandering its natural amenities on a dying industry. Even as spin, though, it’s pretty lame. The electorate doesn’t place much faith in the coal industry and (less creditably) is leery of foreign aid. It’s also a regression from an earlier mining industry campaign, It’s Our Story, which situated the industry’s moral good in the contribution it makes to the diverse lives of its workers. That didn’t wash, so now it’s about the wonderful black stuff itself. The reason the big extractors have been reduced to this is that Australia’s rightwing intellectual milieu is a collection of branch office mediocrities. The arguments that Abbott and Frydenberg have tried to make about the goodness of fossil fuels have been transposed directly from the US, without much thought as to whether they’re particularly adaptable to local conditions. The main vector for this line of argument is a book-length piece of sophistry, The Moral Case For Fossil Fuels, authored by Alex Epstein. Epstein is a full-time advocate for burning of oil, coal, and petroleum gas. He’s sponsored by the now-infamous petrochemical billionaires the Koch brothers. He claims to be an energy policy expert, but his pedigree is that of an ideologue. After graduating in philosophy, Epstein spent 7 years at the Ayn Rand Insitute in California, before founding his own Center for Industrial Progress (CIP), which provides a superficially appealing spin on the beliefs of the most regressive quarters of the energy industry. He has placed plenty of op-eds arguing for the civilisational benefits of fossil fuels, and apart from his book he hosts a lively Facebook page, I Love Fossil Fuels. Last year, he offered a free lump of coal to Facebook followers who bought his book. Abbott and Frydenberg echo Epstein’s core argument: not only have fossil fuels historically transformed humanity’s capacity to grow, but we must allow them to do so in the future so more can be lifted out of poverty – a “new industrial revolution”. Environmentalists elevate nature over human flourishing; fossil fuel use has become more efficient over time, and will continue to do so, they say. With carbon capture and storage – so-called clean coal – it could even be environmentally sustainable (except it probably won’t). Unfortunately for everyone concerned, the “moral case for coal” doesn’t track with what trained climate scientists and reputable energy experts tell us. If we continue to emit carbon, the climate change which is already in train will become catastrophically worse, and the only way out is to transition as quickly as possible to renewables. It’s perfectly possible to recognise the technological progress that fossil fuels have allowed and also the looming costs of reckless consumption of those fuels. Again: the cost burden will fall disproportionately on the world’s poor, those least able to insulate themselves from the consequences of climate change.  Epstein’s work has been popular and influential on the right because it is a particularly fluent, elaborate form of climate denialism. The CIP prides itself on being able to train corporate leaders to “successfully out­message ‘environmentalists’.” As a testimonial for their consulting services claims: It would be an understatement to say that Alex Epstein has completely and absolutely changed how I think about energy. No longer do I feel guilt for enjoying the use of products powered by fossil fuels, in fact, I now embrace them. The vacuity of the “moral case for coal” have not prevented the third-division hacks at local thinktanks producing copycat work. Take another example: the plastic bag. Epstein’s centre published a blog post “In defence of plastic bags” back in 2013. “I believe that it’s moral for human beings to use our minds to create new things like plastic bags, which promote human life, health, comfort, convenience, efficiency, wealth and productivity,” its author wrote. Reason magazine, the house journal of the libertarian right, has a cover story on the same issue this month that celebrates the plastic bag as “a miracle of materials science”. Simon Breheny and others at the Institute of Public Affairs have returned to this talking point for a few years now, making the plastic bag an organising issue.  In a blog post last week, “In defence of the plastic bag”, Breheny congratulates WA Liberal MLC and IPA member Peter Katsambanis for helping to knock over a City of Fremantle local law banning non-biodegradable single-use plastic bags. Breheny applauds those “who stood firm on polyethylene polymer”, which, he choruses, is “actually good for us”. But in the same way as the moral case for coal, the arguments really collapse down into something very simple, as Katsambanis said in WA parliament: [W]e do not want to create a society in which retailers fear reprisals from powerful local government – or any other form of government for that matter – for supposedly not toeing the line or following through with the politically correct line of the day.  As the 2013 Centre for Industrial Progress blogpost complained, “local government is making the store experience worse for everyone”. Essentially, they’re devoted to a last-ditch defence of any and every toxic industry, and have no qualms about poisoning public debate in the process. There’s no doubt that the left is also attracted to contrarianism and lost causes. But underneath the sombre “moral case” observations about poverty, you’ve got phenomena like NSW MLC Peter Phelps’s brainchild: the Friends of Coal group. You quickly realise that overgrown Young Liberals are a far more pressing concern. This behaviour amounts to adolescent nihilism, reminiscent of the shallow end of student politics, where the main aim is to advocate what you’re sure your opponents will hate. The Liberal party, and the broader right, is lousy with thinking like this. When it comes to the most pressing moral, ecological, and economic issue of the century, they can say what they like but don’t deserve a hearing. For the sake of the planet, and humanity, we must work cooperatively to ensure that as much coal as possible is left in the ground."

"Australian MPs and senators have been attending briefings in Canberra this week by some of our country’s world-leading climate scientists. The timing to bring our elected representatives up to speed is apt, given the UN climate change talks in Paris are less than six weeks away.  Relevant too because, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the world has just had its hottest September on record – a record that covers 136 years. Last month the University of Queensland’s Global Change Institute made the offer to brief representatives from all parties on climate science. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, Labor’s environment spokesman, Mark Butler, and the Greens senator Larissa Waters all backed the effort. @Mark_Butler_MP & I met w/ climate experts today. Read Labor's plan to tackle climate change https://t.co/ihcPiyuCiD pic.twitter.com/Vsk6lmDaau From reports, all the briefings were well received. All except one, that is. On Monday evening, three of the scientists also provided a briefing to the Coalition’s backbench committee on the environment. The way this briefing was received and essentially ambushed tells us a lot about the ideologically driven anti-science that infects elements of Australia’s Liberal party. The story is worth telling. The Liberal MP for Hughes, Craig Kelly, the chair of the committee, had accepted the invitation to host some scientists. In attendance would be the Global Change Institute director and marine biologist and coral reef expert Prof Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, Dr John Church, a world-leading scientist on sea level rise from the CSIRO and Prof Mark Howden, a chief research scientist at CSIRO and also the director of the Climate Change Institute at Australian National University. But on the Friday, the scientists were told that Kelly had also invited three representatives from the “free market” thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs to also make presentations. This was, apparently, to provide “balance”. Dr Bob Carter, the IPA’s science policy adviser, is associated with about 10 conservative thinktanks and climate denialist groups around the world. One of those is the Heartland Institute in the US, famed for its billboard campaign that tried to equate the acceptance of global warming with the beliefs of a terrorist mass murderer. Carter rejects the science showing human emissions of carbon dioxide are driving dangerous climate change. Another climate science denialist invited by Kelly was Dr Jennifer Marohasy, a “senior research fellow” at the IPA. In recent months Marohasy has been claiming repeatedly that Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology has been part of a conspiracy to deliberately doctor historic temperature data for the express purposes of making the record show more warming. The third invited IPA associate, Brett Hogan, wrote a report about the “life saving potential of coal”. In my view, neither Carter nor Marohasy have any credibility as experts in climate science. They have almost no relevant peer-reviewed publications on the issue and they work for an ideologically blinkered thinktank with a long record of promoting fringe views on climate science.  But the fact that elements of the Liberal party think they are the equivalent of respected scientists with long and distinguished publishing records is embarrassing but telling of the antipathy and paranoia towards climate science held by some Liberals. On Wednesday Marohasy was interviewed about the Monday-night briefing by the ever-angry radio personality Alan Jones, who thinks that human-caused climate change is a hoax. Jones relayed to his listeners the claims of British climate science denialist Lord Christopher Monckton that the UN had plotted to remove from office both the Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper and the Australian prime minister Tony Abbott. Apparently, the “Turnbull faction had worked in conjunction with the UN” to unseat Abbott. It’s a conspiracy.  Jones accused one named scientist that because he had received funding from the government he would simply “tell them what they want to hear”.  Defamatory statements such as this directed at respected scientists are so commonplace among climate science denialists that they go almost unnoticed. I asked Hoegh-Guldberg, Church and Howden about the briefing session, where about 15 Coalition MPs and senators were in attendance. Church told me:  The details of the briefing were changed after we agreed to do it – at no time were we advised this was to be a debate. But it was not what I would call a debate – that is a contest of ideas. Rather the loudest and shrillest voice was what prevailed and playing the person – particularly people who were absent – seemed more important than the quality of the facts. The tone was very different the following day when the audience was there to learn more and to explore the issues further. Howden, who was speaking about climate change and food security, said the briefings he had attended on Tuesday were “very positive” with people from all parties asking “questions that were sensible”. Monday evening was a very different attitude. It was a bunch of people you would categorise as climate change deniers but some did have a slightly more inclusive view. Predominantly the questions reflected the perspectives of the other three participants [Marohasy, Carter and Hogan]. Bob’s presentation was gentlemanly but not consistent with the data and current understanding of the science. Hoegh-Guldberg said the response to the briefings on the Tuesday had been “fantastic”. There was no debate as far as I could tell at all about the realities of climate change. The questions were about the appropriate level of cuts, about what we should do and how to adapt to the inevitable aspects of climate change. Quite different actually from a few years ago when I was part of similar briefings. The issue has matured to a point where effectively they now understand what’s science and what’s bogus. With the change of leadership [to Malcolm Turnbull] the issue has advanced rather smartly. It has moved from anti-science to something more like a competition between the three parties as to who can be the most responsive to the issue. The Monday evening, though, was unpleasant. We had people shouting. We have heard all of the old arguments before a million times – ‘CO2 is plant food’ … ‘climate change isn’t happening’ … that sort of thing. It was disappointingly uninformed. The scientists were from premier institutions taking time to address the committee. Then we had three people from the IPA – clearly lobbyists. What they were saying was not based in reality or science – it was an anti-intellectual environment. Kelly, who was joined by fellow MP Dennis Jensen at the meeting, did take to his Facebook page to post some details about Monday’s briefing, which he described as “informative and vigorous”. In another Facebook post, Kelly seemed unhappy that “supporters of the Warmist gravy train” didn’t want to “debate the facts”. He also has a thing about climate change “totalitarians”.  Kelly has reposted material from Monckton claiming that global warming has stopped. It hasn’t. The Queensland Greens senator Larissa Waters told me she was “honoured” to support the science briefings (she had a one-on-one briefing herself) but was “disappointed” more Labor and Liberal MPs hadn’t turned up.  But commenting on the events of Monday evening, she said:  Despite the vast scientific consensus on climate change, climate denialism runs rife in the Coalition. It’s a special type of delusion that comes with accepting massive political donations from fossil fuel companies. We’re lucky to have eminent climate scientists in Australia and insulting them with some warped view of reality that sees a belief contrary to the scientific consensus placed on an even platform is whacky in the extreme. The Turnbull government will take its much-criticised targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions to Paris next month.  The presence of outright denial of climate science among elements of his party will stay at home. But how much damage will it do to his credibility while his representatives are away? "
"More than a third of the snow leopard’s mountain habitat could become uninhabitable for the endangered big cat because of climate change, conservationists have warned. Warming temperatures could cause the tree line to shift up the mountains and cause farmers to plant crops and graze livestock at higher altitudes, squeezing the snow leopards into smaller ranges where they are more likely to come into conflict with humans.  Conflict with communities in the high mountains of central Asia, who see the leopards as a threat to livestock and human lives, along with poaching, habitat loss and a reduction in numbers of prey have seen numbers of the “ghost of the mountains” fall 20% in 16 years. In a report released on International Snow Leopard Day, conservation charity WWF warned that with numbers as low as 4,000, snow leopards would face increasing pressure from climate change, which could reduce them to unsustainable numbers in many populations. The impacts of climate change would not only be felt by wildlife in the region, WWF warned. About 330 million people live within 10km (six miles) of rivers that start in snow leopard territory, and directly depend on those rivers for their water supplies. Increasing temperatures could drastically alter the flow of water down from the mountains and threaten the livelihoods of people across the continent, according to the report, published ahead of crucial UN talks on a new global climate deal in Paris. To raise awareness of snow leopards, WWF has released rare, never-seen-before, camera trap footage of the cats in Nepal and Mongolia. Rebecca May, WWF-UK’s snow leopard programme lead, said: “The Himalayas region will face a major crisis if we choose to ignore climate change. “Not only do we risk losing majestic species such as the snow leopard, but hundreds of millions of people who rely on water flowing from these mountains may be affected. “To avoid these potentially devastating impacts, WWF is campaigning for a strong and effective deal at the UN climate change conference in Paris in December.” Rishi Kumar Sharma, WWF global snow leopard leader, said: “Reversing the downward trend in snow leopard numbers and conserving their fragile habitat require conservation efforts on an unparalleled scale. “It will be difficult to achieve but the momentum and political will exists: governments must now translate this into action by swiftly scaling up their efforts to save the ghost of the mountains.”"
