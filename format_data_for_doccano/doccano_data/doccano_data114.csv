"I can hear you muttering already: he’s completely lost it this time. He’s written a 2,000-word article on whale poo. I admit that at first it might be hard to see the relevance to your life. But I hope that by the time you have finished this article you will have become as obsessed with marine faecal plumes as I am. What greater incentive could there be to read on? In truth it’s not just about whale poo, though that’s an important component. It’s about the remarkable connectivity, on this small and spherical planet, of living processes. Nothing human beings do, and nothing that takes place in the natural world, occurs in isolation.  When I was a student, back in the days when mammoths roamed the earth, ecologists tended to believe that the character of living systems was largely determined by abiotic factors. This means influences such as local climate, geology or the availability of nutrients. But it now seems that this belief arose from the study of depleted ecosystems. The rules they derived now appear to have described not the world in its natural state, but the world of our creation. We now know that living systems which retain their large carnivores and large herbivores often behave in radically different ways from those which have lost them. Large carnivores can transform both the populations and the behaviour of large herbivores. In turn this can change the nature and structure of the plant community, which in turn affects processes such as soil erosion, river movements and carbon storage. The availability of nutrients, the physical geography of the land, even the composition of the atmosphere: all now turn out to be affected by animals. Living systems exert far more powerful impacts on the planet and its processes than we suspected. I’m talking about trophic cascades: ecological processes that tumble from the top of an ecosystem to the bottom. (Trophic means relating to food and feeding.) It turns out that many living processes work from the top down, rather than the bottom up. Trophic cascades have often been detected in places in which large carnivores still exist or have been reintroduced. But what has been discovered so far is likely to underestimate their natural prevalence. For what we now describe as top predators are often – from the perspective of palaeoecology, nothing of the kind. Species such as wolves and lynx, for example, would be more accurately described as mesopredators: belonging to the second rank. They would once have had to contend with lions, hyaenas, scimitar cats, sabretooths, bear dogs and other such monsters, throughout their ranges. Even the giant lions and giant sabretooths that lived in North America until the first humans arrived could not unequivocally be considered the kings of the jungle. The short-faced bear, which stood 13 feet in its hind socks, appears to have been a specialist scavenger: specialising in driving giant lions and giant sabretooths off their prey. One hypothesis which might help to explain the sudden disappearance from many parts of the world of the megafauna, following the first arrival of human beings, is that we triggered trophic cascades of destruction. For example, before humans reached Australia, the continent teemed with great beasts. There was a spiny anteater the size of a pig; a giant herbivore a bit like a wombat, which weighed two tonnes; a marsupial tapir as big as a horse; a 10-foot kangaroo; a marsupial lion with opposable thumbs and a stronger bite than any other known mammal, which I believe was a specialist carnivore of giant kangaroos; a horned tortoise eight feet long; a monitor lizard bigger than the Nile crocodile. Most of them, and many other marvellous creatures, disappeared between 40,000 and 50,000 years ago. At roughly the same time, the dense rainforests which covered much of that continent began to be replaced by the grass and scrubby trees which populate much of the outback today. One paper suggests that the first humans in Australia hunted some of the large animals to extinction, and that this caused the destruction of the rainforests, which in turn wiped out much of the remaining fauna. How? It postulates that when the giant herbivores disappeared, the leaves and twigs that would otherwise have been browsed began to build up on the forest floor, creating a fuel supply that allowed wildfires to rage unhindered through the rainforests. This catalysed the shift to grass and scrub. In Europe, ecologists are beginning to wake up to the fact that our ecosystems were and remain shaped by elephants, rhinos, hippos and the other great beasts that lived here during the last interglacial period, when the climate was similar to today’s. You can still see evidence of co-evolution with elephants and rhinos in the way that our deciduous trees respond to attack. In other words, the natural world is even more fascinating and complex than we had imagined. And we are only just beginning to understand just how rich and strange ecological processes might be. I promised whale poo, and whale poo you shall have. Studies in the 1970s proposed that the great reduction in the large whales of the southern oceans would lead to an increase in the population of krill, their major prey. It never materialised. Instead there has been a long-term decline. How could that be true? It now turns out that whales maintain the populations of their prey. They often feed at depth, but they seldom defecate there, because when they dive the stress this exerts on the body requires the shutdown of some of its functions. So they perform their ablutions when they come up to breathe. What they are doing, in other words, is transporting nutrients from the depths, including waters too dark for photosynthesis to occur, into the photic zone, where plants can live. In the southern oceans, iron is a limiting nutrient, without which the plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain cannot reproduce and grow. By producing their poonamis – sorry, faecal plumes – in the surface waters, the whales fertilise the plant plankton on which the krill and fish depend. This effect, known as the “whale pump” has been hypothesised for several years. But now there is some experimental evidence to support it. A team of scientists at the University of Tasmania collected some pygmy blue whale poo (who knew that marine biology was so rich with possibility?) and grew plankton in water containing varying concentrations of it. They found that the richer the mix, the greater the productivity. No surprises there. Separate research, in the Gulf of Maine, estimates that whales and seals, by defecating at the surface and recycling nutrients there, would, before their numbers were reduced by hunting, have been responsible for releasing three times as much nitrogen into those waters as the sea absorbed directly from the atmosphere. The volume of plant plankton has declined across much of the world over the past century, probably as a result of rising global temperatures. But the decline appears to have been been steepest where whales and seals have been most heavily hunted. The fishermen who have insisted that predators such as seals should be killed might have been reducing, not enhancing, their catch. But it doesn’t end there. Plant plankton, when they die, slowly descend into the abyss, taking with them the carbon they have absorbed from the atmosphere. It is hard to quantify, but when they were at their historical populations, whales are likely to have made a small but significant contribution to the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The recovery of the great whales, which were reduced by between two-thirds and 90%, but whose numbers are slowly climbing again in some parts of the oceans, could be seen as a benign form of geoengineering. This should not be the only, or even the main, reason why we should wish them to return, but the way in which whales change the composition of the atmosphere provides yet another refutation of the idea that we can manipulate the living world with simple, predictable results. With the Sustainable Human team, I’ve just produced a second trophic cascades video, about the whale pump. The first – about the unexpected impact of wolves in Yellowstone national park – has been watched 13m times. The belief that people cannot handle complexity is a myth. There is a tremendous public appetite to understand the world in all its fascinating detail.  Another paper proposes that as the great whales declined, killer whales, some of which would have specialised in feeding on them, switched their diet to animals such as seals and sea lions. This is likely to have had major effects on fish populations. But now, in the Aleutian archipelago, the reduction of seals by human hunters appears to have caused the killer whales to switch their diet again, in this case to sea otters. A large part of the diet of sea otters consists of sea urchins. As the otters have declined, the number of urchins has risen, to the point that in some places they have grazed the vast kelp forests that once thronged the coastal waters of the western seaboard of the Americas until almost nothing remains. Not only has this caused the collapse of the coastal ecosystem, but it has also caused the release of more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, as the carbon stored in the kelp has been oxidised. And even that is not the end of the story. It now seems that whaling may have been a leading cause of the decline of the Californian condor. Condors appear to have specialised in scavenging the carcasses of stranded whales. As whales were destroyed, the condors were deprived of a major food source, and were forced to feed on dead terrestrial animals. Some of these carcasses are of animals that die after being shot and then lost by human hunters. The ingestion of lead from bullets and shot has been one of the reasons for the fragility of the condors’ grip on existence. Who would have guessed that the impacts of whaling would cascade through so many living systems? (Incidentally, until humans arrived in the Americas, the condor was one of the smaller scavenging birds. The North American roc (Aiolornis incredibilis), had a wingspan of 16 feet and a hooked bill the length of a man’s foot. No skull of another predatory bird, the Argentine roc (Argentavis magnificens) has yet been found, but the available bones suggest that its wings were 26 feet across and that it weighed 12 stone.) And it’s not just whales. When plant plankton are attacked by the small animals that eat them, some of them release a chemical called dimethyl sulphide. This compound attracts predators, that feed on the animals eating the plants. It appears that the tube-nosed birds, such as albatrosses, fulmars, shearwaters and petrels, which have a highly developed sense of smell, can detect dimethyl sulphide, and use its presence to find their prey. Not only might this help to protect the plant plankton from some of the animals grazing on them, but by defecating in the feeding zone, the birds help to fertilise the plants that brought them there. There’s one more twist. Dimethyl sulphide seems to have a powerful role in the formation of clouds at sea. Because the sea has a dark surface, and clouds are white, the greater the cloud cover, the more sunlight is reflected back into space. So as plant plankton are attacked, they might help to cool the planet. There are similar effects on land. Before serious conservation efforts began in the 1960s, wildebeest numbers in the Serengeti fell from about 1.2 million to 300,000. The result was similar to the hypothesised mechanism for the destruction of much of the Australian rainforest. As dry grass and other vegetation that the wildebeest would otherwise have eaten accumulated, wildfires ravaged around 80% of the Serengeti every year. As wildebeest numbers have recovered, the frequency of fires has fallen and more dung is incorporated into the soil. The Serengeti has been transformed from a net carbon source to a net carbon sink: a shift equivalent to the entire current emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels in east Africa. But it’s important not to generalise from one example. In other parts of the world, grazing animals can increase the production of greenhouse gases. Domestic livestock are a major cause of global warming. So are some wild herbivores. As moose numbers in Canada have risen, partly due to the destruction of their predators by people, through a series of complicated impacts on both vegetation and soil they have sharply reduced the storage of carbon in the boreal forests. One estimate suggests that the difference in carbon storage between high and low moose numbers is the equivalent of between 42 and 95% of the carbon dioxide Canada produces through the burning of fossil fuels. Allowing wolves to return to their historical levels could make a massive difference to Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions. Nor should we imagine that wolves and whales and wildebeest and plant plankton and sea otters alone can prevent the climate breakdown that the unchecked consumption of fossil fuels will cause. Annual plant growth cannot match the burning of fossil fuels, which mobilises the stored remains of many centuries of accumulated plant carbon every year. But these first inklings of the unexpected impacts of our destruction should provide yet another reason for treating the living planet gently. Everything is connected. I would hate to see the protection of wildlife reduced to a calculation about greenhouse gases. For me, there are powerful intrinsic reasons for defending the natural world: because it is wonderful; because it enriches and enchants our lives; because to understand how these magnificent and complex systems work is to pass through a portal to an enchanted kingdom. But the little we now know of trophic cascades and the unexpected complexities they reveal, which doubtless presages a much deeper and richer understanding in the years to come, enhances for me the awe with which I contemplate our world of wonders. It makes me all the more determined to protect it from destruction. Monbiot.com"
"People who live near fracking operations should be monitored for chemical contaminants and health problems, according to researchers who surveyed the risks posed by substances used in the process. Scientists in the US found that many of the 750 or so chemicals that are pumped into the ground at high pressure to fracture shale rock were associated with fertility and developmental problems.  But while the chemicals have been linked to various health effects, ranging from poor semen quality and endocrine problems to miscarriages and low birth weight, very little is known about the levels of chemicals that people are actually exposed to from fracking operations, making it impossible to assess the real risk. The scientists’ study drew on published scientific reports into the health impacts of chemicals such as benzene and toluene, and elements including cadmium and arsenic that are released from rocks in the drilling process.  The team, led by Susan Nagel at the University of Missouri, fear that fracking chemicals could contaminate air, water and soil, and expose workers and local communities to the substances. “We desperately need biomonitoring data from these people. What are people actually exposed to? What are the blood levels of people living in these areas? What are the levels in the workers?” said Nagel.  “It is absolutely in the realm of possibility that at current human exposure levels, we might expect to see some of these effects, and at the very least, we should be looking for them,” she added. The rapid rise of what are called unconventional oil and natural gas (UOG) operations, that combine horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing of rock, increases the risk of air and water pollution, the scientists write in Reviews on Environmental Health. In the US, more than 15m people live within 1.5km (one mile) of UOG operations. Sheila Bushkin-Bedient, a co-author on the study, said that another major unknown was how low level, but long-term, exposure from multiple chemicals might effect peoples’ health. In light of the potential harms, she argues that the industry should be kept from expanding until the risks are better understood.  Professor Richard Sharpe, who leads a research team on male reproductive health at the MRC Centre for Reproductive Health at Edinburgh University, agreed that good data from people living near fracking sites was needed. “It’s impossible to say how much of a potential issue this is. I certainly wouldn’t dismiss it lightly, but I think we will have to wait for detailed prospective data from well-organised studies to get that,” he said.  “The one thing that is certain in all of this is that there should be a voice asking that the necessary surveillance and monitoring should be automatically put in place with such novel developments, in order that we can be reassured that we are not going to recreate another DDT scenario some way down the line,” he added."
"The department of foreign affairs has established a dedicated taskforce to ensure the Great Barrier Reef isn’t listed as ‘in danger’ by the UN, with officials and ministers dispatched around the world to lobby key countries over the issue. In an escalation of efforts to ensure the reef’s world heritage status isn’t downgraded, a special unit called the Great Barrier Reef taskforce is coordinating efforts to raise Australia’s case with World Heritage Committee delegates.  A total of 21 countries provide representatives to Unesco’s World Heritage Committee, and the group is set to gather in the German city of Bonn in June to decide, among other things, whether the reef should be put on the endangered list. Guardian Australia understands that Dfat officials will be travelling to as many of these countries as possible, with foreign minister Julie Bishop and environment minister Greg Hunt raising it with WHC delegates on an “opportunistic basis”. The 21 countries include India, Jamaica, Japan, Portugal and Germany. Dfat was unable to confirm how many of the 21 countries would be visited before the June meeting nor the total cost of flying officials around the world for lobbying efforts. The Great Barrier Reef taskforce is headed by Tiffany McDonald, who was previously the director of the Pakistan and central Asia section of Dfat. Bishop and Andrew Robb, the trade minister, have been in Lima this week at climate change talks and have used the opportunity to talk to other countries about the reef. “The Great Barrier Reef is a national icon and Australia attaches enormous importance to meeting our obligations under the World Heritage Convention,” a Dfat spokesman said. “We understand the reef is under pressure and we are determined to protect it for future generations.” A spokeswoman for Hunt said the government was “working hard on taking environmental action to protect the reef and ensuring that information is conveyed to the World Heritage Committee. “The WHC has asked Australia to respond to its concerns that were first raised in 2011 about the reef,” she said. “We have listened to their request and are responding. This is an important part of the WHC process and Minister Hunt is working with Minister Bishop on conveying the details of the major achievements we have made.” The government has been ratcheting up its diplomatic efforts over recent months to avoid the in danger listing. In September it emerged that Hunt and Andrew Powell, Queensland environment minister, travelled to Europe to lobby delegates.  A Labor source said the opposition was broadly supportive of the lobbying efforts because of the negative implications of an in danger listing. Earlier this week, Bishop said there was “no justification” for the reef to be downgraded by the World Heritage Committee. The foreign minister said any in danger listing would have negative international repercussions. “Every country that has an environmental icon that activists seize upon would be at risk,” she said. “It would send a message around the world that even if you meet all of the criteria set out by the world heritage committee, there is still a risk that they will place an area on the in danger list.”  “It would have significant implications for Australia but it would also set a very dangerous precedent for countries who don’t have the opportunity to take the action that Australia has.” There are a total of 46 world heritage sites listed as being in danger, mostly situated in developing countries. The Everglades in Florida is a notable exception to this. Endangered sites are provided some UN funding to help restore their fortunes. The Australian government is keen to avoid the embarrassment of being put on the list. There is also a concern over the potential impact upon a $6bn tourism industry that relies upon a healthy flow of visitors to the Great Barrier Reef. The reef is under pressure due to a number of factors, primarily climate change, pollution and a plague of coral-eating starfish. A recent government scientific report warned that the reef is in poor condition and is getting worse, a position that Bishop appeared to contradict recently when she claimed the ecosystem was not at risk."

" Annual household energy bills have risen by £490 on average in the past decade with most of the increase due to the hike in wholesale gas prices, according to a report from the government’s climate change advisers.  This puts the cost of government measures to support low-carbon policies at around £100 a year on domestic bills but the average household is also around £165 better off thanks to those policies – due to people installing new boilers, insulation and more efficient electrical appliances.  Lord Deben, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory advisers on low-carbon policies, compared the spending on renewable energy and efficiency to an insurance policy against climate change. “We take out insurance on our houses – it makes sense to insure against climate change,” he explained. “Last year, as energy consumers we all helped hundreds of thousands of poorer people to have warmer homes and contributed to real reductions in our emissions in the fight against climate change – all for around £100 a year on the average bill,” he said.  Deben argued that the government’s main policy on energy efficiency – the Green Deal, by which householders can take out a loan to pay for improvements including insulation and boilers – should be improved to give more people access to these money-saving measures. The report, called Energy prices and bills: impacts of meeting carbon budgets, found that £55 a year of the average £1,140 household energy bill is spent on subsidising home efficiency improvements, while a further £45 went to renewables and other low-carbon electricity. Annual bills for consumers are forecast to rise by a further £55 or so by 2020 to pay for further low-carbon investments. For commercial and industrial companies the rise will be much steeper: between 9% and 17% from 2013-20, and a further 12% to 25% by 2030.  “The report lays bare the potential impact of climate change policy on industrial energy prices, estimating that it could add 100% to electricity bills by 2030, which would place serious competitive pressures on heavy industry. It is vital that government starts to take a long term approach to minimising these costs for energy intensive industry,” said Gareth Stace, head of climate and environment policy of the EEF manufacturers’ organisation. The committee reported that energy represented a small fraction of costs, at about 0.5% for companies in the commercial sector and 2% for those in industry. Carbon reductions arising from climate change policies were the equivalent of taking 10m cars off the road, the committee said.  Green campaigners said the report showed that low-carbon measures were good value for money, and reduced the UK’s dependence on expensive fossil-fuel imports. Simon Bullock, a senior climate change campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “There is a clear message for politicians: if they are serious about cutting the cost of punishing energy bills and tackling climate change, making the UK’s heat-leaking housing stock energy efficient must rise rapidly up their to-do list.” Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate Group of businesses, which support the move to a low-carbon economy, said: “This report clearly shows that we can meet our carbon targets affordably.” He called for the next government to “show its support for the clean energy sector well beyond the end of this decade”, as cutting carbon could generate jobs and economic growth. "
"A proposal to turn up to 500,000 hectares of Australia’s largest woodland into farmland would release up to 40m tonnes of stored carbon dioxide and contradict the federal government’s Direct Action policy, green groups say. The Great Western Woodlands spans 16m hectares in south-eastern Western Australia, ranging from the wheatbelt west of Kalgoorlie to Esperance and stretching toward the Nullarbor.  It is the largest remaining area of temperate woodland in the world, but just 12% is protected in conservation reserves. About 60% of the woodland is made up of unallocated crown land. Emails from shire chief executive Matthew Scott, obtained under freedom of information by the Wilderness Society, identified 500,000 hectares of that land that might be suitable for farming.  Wilderness Society WA campaigner Peter Robertson said the environmental cost would be much greater than any economic benefit and might result in 40m tonnes of carbon being released into the atmosphere.  “It would undermine any effort that Direct Action has in terms of net greenhouse gas deficit,” he said. Dr Heather Keith from ANU’s Fenner School of Environment and Society, who co-wrote a 2009 study on the woodland’s carbon value, said it would be “reasonable to say that most of the carbon in the vegetation would be lost”. “If an area has been ploughed for agriculture, getting back that stored carbon takes many, many decades.” Robertson said the woodland boasted 20% of all Australian plant species and 25% of all eucalypt species. “The south-west of WA has lost thousands of hectares of woodland … the bits that are left are too valuable now and contain too many rare and vulnerable species that are even more vulnerable because other areas were cleared,” he said. The West Australian government was briefed on the proposal when the cabinet visited Esperance in June. In a letter to Scott dated 12 September, released as part of the FOI documents, premier Colin Barnett said he looked forward to “exploring” the “agricultural land opportunity” presented in the briefing. “As you suggest, a whole-of-government effort is needed to undertake such an agricultural land release feasibility study and to that end I have sought the support of the minister for regional development in coordinating a number of portfolios,” Barnett wrote. Barnett said local government should seek to get “industry and traditional owners” involved in the endeavour. But Esperance shire president Malcolm Heasman told Guardian Australia traditional owners had not yet been consulted because the governing body of the area’s Indigenous Land Use Agreement was not formally established. “At this stage we can’t speak with anybody because the body that manages it has not been incorporated,” he said. Esperance’s unallocated crown land is covered by native title, which would be nullified if it was converted to freehold land.  In emails from July, the Department of Regional Development said it was “definitely interested” in the proposals and asked the shire to put forward 10,000 to 20,000 hectare lots for a “trial” program.  Most of the lots the shire subsequently put forward were in the Cascade region, on the north-west edge of the shire, and have previously been surveyed for release. Heasman said every 100,000 hectares of crown land could potentially host 25 viable farms. He said the cost of existing agricultural land meant young farmers could not afford to buy into the area, and the town needed to do something to preserve its population. “We need to keep our young farmers on these farms. It’s getting to the point where they can’t afford to come back to the community at all.” A spokesman for the WA regional development minister, Terry Redman, said the government had received no formal request to convert any areas of the Greater Western Woodlands into farmland."
"Morocco and Mexico have both received over half a billion in finance (mostly in loans) from some of the world’s major climate funds, according to a new report by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI).  The report analysed a decade of money going into nine national and two international funds set up to tackle climate change. Of the $7.6bn in funding that the ODI looked at, half of it was going to just ten countries. The chart below shows how much each country received in financing and how much of that was for mitigating the effects of climate change.  However, the figures also shows that many countries that are particularly vulnerable to climate change are missing out on financing. Countries such as Namibia, El Salvador and Guatemala all received less than $5m each (fewer than 1/100th of what the top countries get).  Some of the projects benefitting from the funds included a massive increase in Mexico’s renewable energy capacity in a system previously powered by fossil fuels; the development of Morocco’s solar energy resources and Brazil reforesting 3,000 hectares of land.  Of the funds that they looked at, the UK pledged the most contributions of any country at $2.5bn, with the US giving $2.4bn.  ODI research fellow and report author, Smita Nakhooda said:  These start-up climate funds were pioneering in their approach, and a huge amount has been learnt from their experience. There are now too many small climate funding ‘pots’ with substantial overlap and finance is spread too thinly between them, creating an urgent need to learn from experience and improve the system. The lives of millions of people in poor countries affected by climate change depend on getting this right. Next year will see the roll out of a new green climate fund, which has already raised almost $10bn in seven months. This is more than these other schemes raised in a decade. "

"Australia’s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has just delivered a speech to the United Nations climate talks here in Lima. On a day when more than 10,000 people took to the city’s streets calling for rapid cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, Bishop moved to defend Australia’s reputation as a “good international citizen” on climate change.  So here’s some excerpts from Bishop’s speech, annotated by me. Call it a service. Let’s dive in. Australia has a strong track record of playing a constructive role in the global response to global climate change. Like that time in Kyoto in 1997 when Australia managed to slip out with a target that allowed us to actually increase our emissions while, at the same time, securing a clause that would mean we would need to do almost nothing to meet it? We take on commitments and we deliver against them. We don’t take lightly our commitments. Climate change is a challenge to us all with serious environmental, social and economic consequences. Do these “commitments” include the massive expansion of coal and gas export projects that make Australia a world leader in fossil fuel exports? Because after all, our prime minister thinks “coal is good for humanity”. Good job these “serious environmental” consequences from climate change don’t, in the eyes of the foreign minister, include the Great Barrier Reef (even though her own scientists say it does). Individually and collectively we must deliberate carefully and determine the best course of action to reduce emissions. This action must deliver real cuts in emissions and not put countries at a competitive disadvantage and it must work alongside countries plans for strong economic growth, jobs and development. Just before Julie Bishop rose to speak, we heard from Leonard Balogun Koroma, the designated minister from the government of Sierra Leone. He said climate change was undermining development in Africa and getting in the way of efforts to overcome poverty. “The time to act is now,” he said. “Our survival depends on it.”  If “not surviving” could be considered a “competitive disadvantage” then Minister Bishop might be onto something. Australia joined the first commitment period of the Kyoto protocol and we took on a legally binding target – we met it, indeed exceeded it. Indeed we did exceed it. Our initial target was 108% – we got down to 103%. It was just so easy, thanks to the Australia clause. Australia has an ambitious 2020 target. We will reduce emissions by five per cent based on 2000 levels by 2020. This is a significant cut – minus 19% from business as usual. Our target is comparable to those taken by other developed countries. Yes. Our target is so “ambitious” that the government’s own Climate Change Authority says it is “not credible” and should be trebled. No wonder the government wants to axe that. At home we have put in place policies to ensure that we deliver on our international targets. In 2001 Australia set the world’s first Mandatory Renewable Energy Target. This was expanded and extended in 2009.  It means we will generate at least 20% of our electricity from renewables in 2020. Oh my! This from the government that appointed a climate science sceptic to review the target, has been thinking about scrapping it and is currently trying to negotiate to cut it. This is a move the renewable energy industry says will cost thousands of jobs.  Investment in large-scale renewables in Australia has already come to a standstill. This will please our treasurer, Joe Hockey, who thinks windfarms are “appalling”. We are taking further direct action. At the heart of our direct action policy is a $2.55 billion emissions reduction fund. This fund will create opportunities and incentives for Australian business to take practical climate action. It will deliver real and measurable results for the environment while improving business competitiveness. Here’s what else it will do. Most analysts think this new policy will fall a long way short of Australia’s “ambitious” target to cut emissions. The $2.55 billion fund is paid for by the taxpayer and is what came after Australia became the first country in the world to scrap carbon pricing laws – a victory for ideologues and the fossil fuel industry. This replaced “polluter pays” with “taxpaper pays”. It is a comprehensive approach to climate change that benefits the environment and the community. Looking to the future, Australia will work to secure an agreement in Paris that is strong, effective and ensures countries live up to their commitments. This “comprehensive approach” is an entirely voluntary scheme and few people beyond the offices of the cabinet ministers think it is in any way scalable if any increase in future ambition did materialise. In other words, if Australia did take the advice of its own Climate Change Authority, it would need another policy.  At the climate finance ministerial meeting yesterday, I announced Australia’s contribution of $200m over four years to the Green Climate Fund. And what a surprise that was, especially after Tony Abbott had said he would never contribute to a scheme like that because it was ... what was the quote again … oh yes, “socialism masquerading as environmentalism”. By the way, we just stripped that $200m right out of our foreign aid budget.  Allow me to focus for a moment on research and development of new technologies. Sure, but given my suggestion before the Lima climate talks that Australia might be defending coal while it’s here, I bet you that focus isn’t on clean energy. Australia has a long history of driving and supporting innovative and smart climate change solutions both in Australia and other countries. Carbon Capture and Storage is a concrete example of where we have committed over $300m to low emissions coal technology research and development. The Gorgon LNG facility in my home state of Western Australia is one of the world’s largest natural gas projects and the single largest resource development in Australia’s history. It is using best practice in emissions management including capture and storage. Told you. While we’re talking about “supporting” CCS, is this when we mention that the government actually cut $459m from the budget of the Carbon Capture and Storage Program in the previous budget? Yes, let’s mention that. As solar industry leader Jeremy Leggett told an earlier press conference in Lima today: “The oil and gas industry has been deploying the prospects of [CCS] as a smokescreen, knowing it will never get to industrial scale, just to buy time.” I should also ponder if “supporting smart solutions” means also cutting millions from the budget of the government science agency tasked with innovating? An estimated one in five jobs are to go as a result. These examples highlight the good story Australia has to tell on climate change We are taking action, we are delivering on our commitments and we are more than playing our part. This is what Australia does. That’s who we are. A reliable partner. A good international citizen. We are such a good citizen on this climate change business, that we are currently ranked last of all industrialised countries for our performance on climate change."
"Human emissions of greenhouse gases cause the Earth to warm. We’ve known that for decades – actually for over 100 years. But how do we measure warming? How fast is the planet heating? Turns out, this is conceptually easy to answer, even though it is difficult to implement the required measurements. In order to measure how fast the planet is heating, we can measure the difference in incoming and outgoing energy at the top of the atmosphere (just like keeping track of a bank account by comparing deposits to withdrawals). Another way to measure a warming planet is to simply to measure how much energy is stored within the planet’s climate (like watching the balance of a bank account). Both methods should give the same answer. If you have more deposits than withdrawals to a bank account, you will see your balance increase. Fortunately both of these methods, when used by climate scientists, tell the same story. The Earth is out of balance; we are gaining 0.5 – 1 Watts per square meter of area. Okay, so what are the impacts of this heat? What should we experience? The answers to these questions were addressed in a recent paper (Abraham, Fasullo and Laden) published by the National Center for Science Education. This paper, which is geared toward an informed but not expert audience, focuses on the current energy imbalance, the recent trends in atmospheric temperatures, and the issue of the so-called “pause” of global warming. As a spoiler, we show that the “pause” is not really a thing.  First, there has been no pause or even slowdown in the warming of the planet. We provide updated information from NOAA which clearly shows a continued heating of the world’s oceans – the reservoir where most heat ends up. We compare energy contained in different layers and discuss the transfer of energy from the surface regions to the lower regions. When you look at the oceans, the so-called pause is simply a redistribution, a burying of heat to deeper waters. So, why is more heat being stored in the deep oceans? The leading idea is that changes to Pacific winds have created a temporary condition which resembles a La Niña event. The conditions are characterized by a cool pool of water in the Pacific as winds push water from the coast of South America toward Australia. This trend in Pacific water temperatures is alternatively called the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).  The important thing is, this oscillation is partly (perhaps mainly) natural and it doesn’t last forever. At some point, it will end and heat which was being buried in Pacific waters will end up elsewhere. People who are interested in this are also watching patterns of atmospheric pressure and flow in the Pacific. Of particular importance is sea-surface winds which are updated daily here. If the winds switch and begin flowing from west to east, we will see a pickup in Pacific temperatures and a potential El Niño. If that occurs, we can expect 2015 to likely be the hottest year in recorded history.  Another thing to watch is the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Daily values are located here. The SOI is a measure of the difference in pressure anomalies between Tahiti and Darwin, Australia. According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology,  the SOI gives an indication of the development and intensity of El Niño events. The SOI is calculated using the pressure differences between Tahiti and Darwin. Sustained negative values of the SOI below −8 often indicate El Niño episodes. These negative values are usually accompanied by sustained warming of the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, a decrease in the strength of the Pacific Trade Winds. Now, I am not saying that El Niño/La Niña cycles are also identified as PDO or IPO cycles. The point I am trying to make is these wind patterns in the Pacific and surface water temperatures in the same region help dictate short-term and multi-year temperature fluctuations worldwide.  Over the past few years, there has been a predominance of cold conditions which has influenced Earth surface temperatures. Some people have interpreted this, incorrectly, as a cessation of global warming. But, when you look at the oceans or you gather heat flow information from satellites, you see that this “pause” is not a thing. Our paper shows this to be a fact and tries to describe some of the factors which influence short term temperature fluctuations and confuse the contrarians. Even with the short-term ups and downs of the Earth’s climate, we are reaching new heights in terms of surface temperatures. Much was made of recent reports that 2014 may become the hottest year ever recorded by some institutions such as NOAA. While we will have to wait to see how the last two months shape up, it is clear that this year (without an El Niño) could not be as hot as it is without human emissions.  The fact that a non-El Niño year (so far) may break the all-time temperature record should give pause to all the contrarians who tried to tell you global warming has halted. The data proves they were wrong."

"The author Bill McKibben, who founded a new generation of environmental activism in the Keystone XL pipeline and divestment campaigns, is stepping down from the daily leadership of his 350.org organisation. McKibben’s departure, announced in a post on 350.org, caps an extraordinary seven -year run for the organisation.  “I’m stepping down as chair of the board at 350.org to become what we’re calling a ‘senior sdvisor’,” McKibben wrote. “I will stay on as an active member of the board, and 90% of my daily work will stay the same, since it’s always involved the external work of campaigning, not the internal work of budgets and flow charts. I’m not standing down from that work, or stepping back, or walking away.” In an email to The Guardian, McKibben added: “I’ve had enough years of reviewing budgets etc, which is really not my forte, and I’d rather be causing more trouble more directly, as well as doing some writing. So 350 is still my home, just in an easier chair.” KC Golden, a climate activist from the Northwest who helps lead Climate Solutions, will take over as interim chair, Jamie Henn, a spokesman for 350.org said. McKibben founded 350.org at a time when the mainstream environmental groups in the US – known collectively as Big Green – were convinced that the route to getting governments and businesses to act on climate change was through corporate boardrooms and professional lobbying campaigns. McKibben believed those leaders would not act unless they were pushed by a grassroots movement. The group takes its names for the upper limits for the safe levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere – 350 parts per million. It started with just seven paid staff. The group now operates in 14 countries, Henn said. Under McKibben, 350.org turned the Keystone XL pipeline project, seen by the industry as a sure thing, into a potent symbol of the climate threats of unlocking tar sands fuel. 350.org activists demonstrated at the White House, joining hands over a giant inflatable pipeline, or risking arrest to protest the project – in the process turning Keystone into one of the most difficult decisions of Barack Obama’s presidency. The group was instrumental in pushing universities to divest from fossil fuels – in America and increasingly around the world. 350.org was also a main organiser of September’s climate march, which brought around 400,000 people into the streets of New York City. But with 350.org increasingly a global organisation – and McKibben honoured this week with an alternative Nobel in Sweden – the author said it was time to get on with the rest of his life. “No one should run a board forever, and so I think it’s time someone else should be engaged in that particular task, leaving me more energy and opportunity for figuring out strategies and organizing campaigns,” he wrote. “The constant travel of the last seven years has helped a little, I hope, to build this movement, but I’m ready for a bit more order in my life. Don’t worry—I’ll still be there when the time comes to go to jail, or to march in the streets, or to celebrate the next big win on divestment. But I’d like to see more of my wife.”"
"Global pressure will force Australia to do more on climate change, Britain’s prime minister, David Cameron, has predicted. Cameron told a committee of British MPs in London he sensed the Australian government recognised it did not want to be the international “back marker” on the issue.  “Look, it’s a sovereign country. It has to make its own decisions. There has obviously been a very big debate in Australia about carbon taxes and prices and all the rest of it,” Cameron said as he gave evidence to a House of Commons committee. “But my sense is that they recognise they don’t want to be the back marker – nor should they. It’s a great country. It’s clearly affected by climate change and I believe they will do more.” A Liberal Democrat MP, Malcolm Bruce, responded by telling the prime minister the US used to be the “back marker” on climate change policy, but “the truth is that Australia is the back marker at the moment”. Cameron replied: “I don’t think they will want to be and I think they will feel pressure and want to do more.” “We should try to encourage them to do it in their own way rather than say there is some pre-ordained route they have to follow.” He said the US had managed to cut its carbon emissions thanks to the “unexpected bonus” of the “shale revolution” – widely known as fracking – which meant it was burning less coal. “That’s enabled [Barack Obama] to, I think, make some quite interesting commitments on climate change which is being delivered through all sorts of executive motions rather than Congress,” Cameron said. Bruce earlier quoted a European Union official who described the G20 climate discussions in Brisbane last month as “trench warfare”. Cameron had joined calls at the G20 for Tony Abbott to do more on climate change, saying “countries that have so far done the least have to think about what more they can do”. Obama had dramatically forced climate onto the summit agenda – against the wishes of Australia – with a hard-hitting speech urging the world to rally behind a new global agreement, pledging $3bn to the Green Climate Fund and pointing out that countries such as Australia had the most to lose from global warming."
"International negotiators at the Lima climate change talks have agreed on a plan to fight global warming that would for the first time commit all countries to cutting their greenhouse gas emissions. The plan, agreed at United Nations talks on Sunday, was hailed as an important first step towards a climate change deal due to be finalised in Paris next year. The proposals call on countries to reveal how they will cut carbon pollution, ideally by March next year. “As a text it’s not perfect, but it includes the positions of the parties,” said Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the Peruvian environment minister, who presided over the talks. However, negotiators acknowledged they had put off the most difficult decisions for later. And with 2014 on course to be the hottest year on record, campaigners warned the plan was far too weak to limit warming to the internationally agreed limit of 2C above pre-industrial levels, or to protect poor countries from climate change. “It’s definitely watered down from what we expected,” said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists. They also warned negotiators had left too many contentious issues unresolved before the deadline for reaching a deal in Paris. “The countdown clock to Paris is now ticking. Countries had the chance to give themselves a head start on the road to Paris but instead have missed the gun and now need to play catch up,” said Mohammed Adow, Christian Aid’s senior climate change advisor. But after a difficult negotiation – which over-ran by two days– officials said they were satisfied with the outcome. “It was contentious along the way but it fundamentally accomplished what we wanted it to,” Todd Stern, the US State Department’s climate change envoy, said. The five-page text agreed on Sunday – now officially known as the Lima Call for Climate Action – represents the embryonic phase of the deal due to be delivered in Paris. As sketched out in Lima, all countries, rising economies as well as rich countries would pledge action on climate change. Wealthy countries would help developing countries fight climate change, by investing in clean energy technology or offering climate aid. Countries already threatened by climate change – such as small island states which face being swallowed up by rising seas – were promised a “loss and damage” programme of financial aid. The all-inclusive nature of the emissions cuts constitutes a break with one of the defining principles of the last 20 years of climate talks – that wealthy countries should carry the burden of cutting carbon dioxide emissions. “I think for the first time ever the world can contemplate a global deal applicable to all and Lima has helped that process,” the UK’s energy and climate change secretary, Ed Davey, said. If all goes well, China, whose emissions have overtaken the US, will as part of the agreement formally pledge to cut its greenhouse gas emissions, as will India, Brazil and other rising economies. But much remains uncertain about the prospects of a strong deal emerging from Paris – not least because of the problems that arose during the negotiations in Lima. The Lima negotiations had opened on 1 December amid a spirit of optimism following an agreement last month between the US and China to cut carbon pollution. But it soon became apparent that the US-China deal on its own would have no effect on bridging the perennial dividing line of climate negotiations – the responsibility for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The talks over-ran by two days because of clashes over which countries should carry the burden of fighting climate change. There were also disputes over climate finance. Wealthy countries were accused of failing to live up to their earlier promises of mobilising billions to help developing countries fight climate change. But after a day of brinkmanship on Saturday – with Stern warning of a “major breakdown” - the deal was done. “We got what we wanted,” Prakash Javadekar, India’s environment minister, said. But much now remains to be done if the broad outlines agreed at Lima are to materialise in a full-fledged climate deal. The US, China, and the European Union have already come forward with pledges for cutting greenhouse gas emissions after 2020. Under the plan, countries are due to come forward by March 2015 with their proposed emissions reductions targets. The United Nations would then weigh up those pledges and determine whether the collective action was enough to limit warming to 2C. But much remains vague or poorly defined. The countries put off decisions about the legal structure of the agreement, and deferred decisions about ensuring a flow of finance to developing countries. The biggest issue left unresolved for Paris is the burden for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The draft text retains language of “common but differentiated responsibilities” that has over the years given developing countries a pass on cutting emissions. That language remains in the text although with a rider “in light of different national circumstances”. Stern acknowledged to reporters the issue was likely to come up again at Paris. And the text adopted on Sunday no longer makes it mandatory for countries to provide detailed information about their prospect reductions targets. Campaigners said that would make it increasingly difficult to be sure the deal would manage to keep warming within the 2 degree threshold."

"Another round in the UN climate change negotiations ended in Lima early on Sunday morning. It took a fortnight and two extra days of intense negotiation to achieve one small step towards the outline of an agreement for next year's all-important Paris talks. That is where, if catastrophic global warming is to be averted, a new generation of emissions targets must be agreed. The Peru gathering was the 20th meeting of the parties to the UN climate change convention, or Cop 20 in the UN's tiresomely obfuscating language. Its ambition was deceptively modest: to start to pick a route through the jungle of conflicting interests towards perhaps the most intractable problem of global climate equity, a transparent system of measuring emissions. It followed a now familiar trajectory: optimism, then stalemate, then overrun and at the end a frantic last-minute scramble before, finally, a deal. The relief on the faces of the delegates indicated how close they had come to complete failure. If they are to succeed in a year's time, there must be a revival of the old sense of urgency that delivered the flawed but ground-breaking Kyoto treaty in 1997.  The prospects for Lima looked particularly bright in the wake of the agreement between the US and China on carbon emissions that was announced by Presidents Obama and Xi in November. Once, the reluctance of China – now the world's biggest polluter – to accept emissions targets gave Congress an excuse not to sign up to Kyoto. Without them both engaged, there could never be a real global agreement. So it was a cause for optimism that, in the November deal, China abandoned its argument that emissions should be estimated on the basis of population – a system that favoured developing countries – and accepted it should be on the basis of national aggregates. In turn, President Obama committed the US to tougher reductions in emissions, bringing it closer to the EU target. Neither obligation was a huge advance. China expected emissions to peak around 2030 anyway, and faces growing domestic protests about pollution. The US has benefited from the recent exploitation of less-polluting shale gas instead of coal, and a Republican Congress may yet block the Obama pledge. Nonetheless the joint declaration was a recognition of their role in making the Paris negotiations a success. So much for the optimism. In Lima, it was detail that counted. Trying to convert headline objectives into a practical plan of action soon undid any sense that victory was at hand. Yet in the end, there was progress on each. In the context of the complexity of negotiations involving more than 190 countries, the relatively easy bit was boosting the value of the adaptation fund for small island states facing existential threat from rising sea levels and extreme weather events. Less successful was the attempt to prepare the ground for some kind of continuing ""climate aid"" levy on rich countries. Perhaps the most significant progress for the developed world was the acceptance by the developing countries of their responsibility for limiting future emissions. There are no longer two categories of nations, the developed countries, which must cut emissions, and the developing countries, which need not. What the negotiators called the firewall between the two has been breached. But the biggest, most difficult and ultimately most important challenge is devising an acceptable, transparent route to measuring emissions, in order to facilitate some kind of global monitoring of targets. And that remains a work in progress. These negotiations will only get more demanding in the coming year. Europe and the US continue to wrestle with troubled economies, reluctant to risk recovery by increasing costs for business and industry, or to burden consumers by demanding more for adaptation. The fall in the price of oil removes one big incentive for the developed world to invest in renewables and greater energy efficiency. Yet, in its latest synthesis of climate change science, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found the evidence of human influence on the climate system is clear and that warming is increasingly likely to be irreversible. It is not too late to make a difference, but this is no time to lose heart."
"Adapting to a warmer world will cost hundreds of billions of dollars and up to three times as much as previous estimates, even if global climate talks manage to keep temperature rises below dangerous levels, warns a report by the UN. The first United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) ‘Adaptation Gap Report’ shows a significant funding gap after 2020 unless more funds from rich countries are pumped in to helping developing nations adapt to the droughts, flooding and heatwaves expected to accompany climate change.  “The report provides a powerful reminder that the potential cost of inaction carries a real price tag. Debating the economics of our response to climate change must become more honest,” said Achim Steiner, Unep’s executive director, as ministers from nearly 200 countries prepare to join the high level segment of UN climate talks in Lima, Peru, next week.  “We owe it to ourselves but also to the next generation, as it is they who will have to foot the bill.” Without further action on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the report warns, the cost of adaptation will soar even further as wider and more expensive action is needed to protect communities from the extreme weather brought about by climate change. Delegates from the Alliance of Small Islands States at the UN climate conference in Lima, which opened on Monday, are already feeling those impacts. They have appealed for adaptation funds for “loss and damage” as their homelands’ very existence is threatened by rising sea levels. “We’re keen to see the implementation of the Green Climate Fund - we’re still waiting,” Netatua Pelesikoti, director of the climate change office at the Secretariat of the Pacific Environment Programme, referring to a fund set up to hope poorer countries cope with global warming. “The trickle down to each government in the Pacific is very slow but we can’t abandon the process at this stage,” said the Tongan delegate. Rich countries have pledged $9.7bn to the Green Climate Fund but the figure is well short of the minimum target of $100bn each year by 2020.  The Adaptation Gap Report said adaptation costs could climb to $150bn by 2025/2030 and $250-500bn per year by 2050, even based on the assumption that emissions are cut to keep temperature rises below rises of 2C above pre-industrial levels, as governments have previously agreed.  However, if emissions continue rising at their current rate – which would lead to temperature rises well above 2C – adaptation costs could hit double the worst-case figures, the report warned. “This startling report opens up a window on to a nightmarish future, where the global economy is crippled and the most vulnerable countries are even further disadvantaged,” said Sandeep Chamling Rai, WWF’s senior global adaptation policy advisor. “This is not a gap, it’s an abyss. We can avoid falling into it, but we’re running out of time.” “The report leaves no doubt, adaptation must be at the heart of a long-term agreement developed here in Lima. Communities around the world are drastically unprepared for the costly impacts of climate change, which is already destroying lives and livelihoods every day,” said Jan Kowalzig, policy advisor for Oxfam, urging negotiators to scale up funding to meet the $100bn annual commitment. David Waskow, director of the International Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute, said the $9.7bn raised by the Green Climate Fund was a “key threshold” but added that developed nations’ funding should extend beyond the fund, engaging “large international companies and even small and medium-sized companies.” “On adaptation there hasn’t been enough funding and most estimates show that less than 20% of climate finance has gone to help countries adapt to climate change,” he added. Su Wei, the head of China’s climate delegation, said the Green Climate Fund pledges were far from adequate and told Reuters that he was critical of Australia’s refusal to contribute to the fund, saying contributing should be a “legal obligation for all developed country parties”.  Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, last month ruled out contributing to the fund, saying his government was giving aid through other channels. Figures on global financial flows relating to climate action were published for the first time on Wednesday. They stood at between $340 and $650bn in 2011-2012, the UN said.  "
"The world is on course for the hottest year ever in 2014, the United Nations weather agency said on Wednesday, heightening the sense of urgency around climate change negotiations underway in Lima.  Preliminary estimates from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) found global average land and sea surface temperatures for the first 10 months of 2014 had soared higher than ever recorded. The findings – broadly in line with those of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and other scientific agencies – indicate that by year-end 2014 will break all previous high temperature records. The steady escalation of greenhouse gas emissions, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, have seen a succession of record-breaking years for temperature since the dawning of the 21st century and 2014 promises to be no exception, the WMO said. “Fourteen of the 15 warmest years on record have all occurred in the 21st century,” said the WMO’s secretary-general Michel Jarraud. “What we saw in 2014 is consistent with what we expect from a changing climate.  “Record-breaking heat combined with torrential rainfall and floods destroyed livelihoods and ruined lives. What is particularly unusual and alarming this year are the high temperatures of vast areas of the ocean surface, including in the northern hemisphere,” he said. The new evidence provided by the WMO report of the gathering risks of climate change undercut the optimism expressed by negotiators from industrialised countries at the opening of the Lima talks. Christiana Figueres, the UN’s top climate official, said the findings drove home the urgency of reaching a deal. Negotiations have been grinding on for more than 20 years. “Our climate is changing and every year the risks of extreme weather events and impacts on humanity rise,” she said. Ed Davey, the UK climate secretary, said the UN climate talks were critical to stop temperatures rising to dangerous levels. “More record warm temperatures in the UK and across the world are yet more evidence that we need to act urgently to prevent dangerous climate change,” he said. Officials from nearly 200 countries will spend the next two weeks in Lima working to agree on a plan to cut global greenhouse gas emissions fast enough and deeply enough to limit warming to 2C above pre-industrial times, the official objective of the UN talks. But even that goal – which scientists say may not go far enough to prevent low-lying island states from drowning in rising seas – may be moving beyond reach. “When confronted with numbers like these, the challenge to stablise global warming below dangerous levels can seem daunting indeed,” Michael Mann, the climate scientist, said. “The globe is warming, ice is melting, and our climate is changing, as a result. And the damage is being felt – in the forms of more destructive weather extremes, more devastating wildfires, and unprecedented threats to the survival of endangered animal species.” He said the Lima climate talks – and a summit scheduled for Paris at the end of next year – were “perhaps our last real opportunity to stave off truly dangerous and irreversible world-wide changes in our climate.” Bill McKibben, leader of the 350.org campaign group, saw the findings as a call to arms to climate activists. “If you thought 2014 was hot, wait ‘til you see 2015. This means we need to turn up the flame even higher under the fossil fuel companies that are frying our planet,” he said. The WMO report found the global average air temperature over land and sea surface for January to October was about 0.57C above the average of 14C for the 1961-1990 reference period, and 0.09C above the average for the past 10 years (2004-2013). The most striking evidence of warming was probably in the oceans, however. Most of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gas emissions ends up in the oceans. The WMO said global sea surface temperatures were 0.45C higher than the average over the last 50 years. If November and December continue on the same course, then 2014 will edge out 2010, 2005 and 1998 as the hottest years ever known – but only by a few hundredths of a degree. Different data sets also show slightly different rankings, the WMO said. In any event, the trend line is clear. The world is getting warmer, especially the oceans. Those higher temperatures were already exacting a toll, in terms of heavy rainfall and flooding in some countries, and extreme drought in others, the WMO said. The agency dismissed outright the notion posed by some climate deniers of a pause in the warming trend. “There is no standstill in global warming,” Jarraud said. The world’s big three emitters – the US, China, and the EU – have pledged new targets for cutting their use of fossil fuels, injecting optimism into the Lima talks. But scientists say even those targets are not enough to limit warming to 2C, and other big carbon polluters such as India, Russia, and Australia have yet to come on board. Meanwhile, there were early signs of tension between the US and EU over the legal structure of the agreement that is due to be adopted in Paris next year. Campaign groups monitoring the talks called on negotiators to take the new WMO findings to heart. “The fact that we’re tracking towards the hottest year on record should send chills through anyone who says they care about climate change – especially negotiators at the UN climate talks here in Lima,” said Samantha Smith, who heads WWF’s climate and energy initiative. “This is more scientific evidence of the real impact climate change is having on our world. The changes will be felt the most by the most vulnerable people, whose lives and livelihoods are already being affected.” The WMO found western North America, Europe, eastern Eurasia, much of Africa, large areas of South America and southern and western Australia were especially warm. South Africa, Australia, and Argentina started the year with blistering heat waves. However, the US and Canada ushered in 2014 with the chill Arctic winds of the polar vortex. Central Russia also recorded cooler than average conditions for the year. Europe also experienced extreme weather, with the UK buffetted by storms. A separate temperature data set, the world’s longest continuous record, showed England was on track for the hottest year in over three centuries. Higher temperatures cause more evaporation and more rain, and 2014 began with England’s wettest winter in over 250 years, leading to widespread flooding.  In Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, more than two million people were caught up in severe flooding. Parts of Turkey saw five times the normal amount of rain, and France experienced its wettest summer since 1959. South Asia also experienced heavy rains, with severe flooding in northern Bangladesh, northern Pakistan and India, affecting millions of people in August and September. For other parts of the world, however, 2014 brought drought. Rainfall in parts of the Yellow River basin in China were less than half of the summer average. A large swathe of the western US continued under drought. New South Wales and southeast Queensland in Australia also went without rain."

"Eight Latin American countries have pledged to combat deforestation and restore an area of land twice the size of Britain by 2020. The move is part of a global plan to plant hundreds of millions of trees and save over 1bn tonnes of CO2 a year. Much of the land to be replanted and improved in Peru, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, Ecuador, Chile, Argentina and Costa Rica, has been deforested in the past 15 years and is now used for subsistence farming or is unusable after being intensively farmed. But it will be restored either as natural forests, or as “agro-forestry” which mixes trees with crop lands and “silvo-pasture” which combines trees with animals.  According to the World Resources Institute (WRI), one of five research groups working with business and government on the ‘Initiative 20x20’, of the 4.2 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases emitted by Latin American and Caribbean countries in 2012, nearly half were from agriculture and the loss of forests. Between 2001 and 2012, the region lost 36m hectares of forest and grassland to agricultural expansion. Cutting down forests to make way for ranches releases carbon. The project, announced on Monday in Lima at the UN climate summit, hopes to restore about 20m hectares of degraded land — an area larger than Uruguay. A separate, ambitious plan to restore tens of millions of hectares of degraded land in Brazil, the largest Latin American country, is expected to be announced next year. Latin America is estimated to have over 200m hectares of degraded land.  About 13m hectares of forests are lost each year but restoring degraded forest lands around the world is now regarded as one of the surest ways to reduce climate change emissions as well as to improve farming and eliminate poverty. The global initiative, known as the Bonn Challenge, started in 2011 as a German plan which was extended at UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon’s New York climate summit in September 2014.  There, governments, companies and civil society groups together pledged to restore over 30m hectares of degraded land. Taken together, the intention is to eventually replant and restore about 350m hectares of deforested landscapes by 2030 – an area the size of India. Until now, Africa has taken the lead to restore degraded land. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has committed to restoring 8m hectares and Ethiopia 22m hectares or about 22% of its land mass. Mexico, which has over 40m hectares of degraded land, has pledged to restore 8.5m hectares, mainly in the south of the country. The new Latin American project involves governments as well as companies offering “impact” funds. Five companies, which have together pledged $365m (£233m), will work with local communities and landowners on agro-forestry schemes. The money is seperate from any carbon markets which may be established following a global climate deal.  “It is ambitious. But it would be very foolish to go into areas which have existing land tenure problem. This is a market-based, bottom-up approach. If it is done right it will be with the backing of local communities,” said Walter Vergara, former leader of the Climate Global Expert Group (GET) at the World Bank who has helped mastermind the project with WRI. “We think around one-third of the land will be reforested and the rest used for agro-forestry.  “This is just the beginning for restoration in Latin America and the Caribbean. This initial goal helps to establish the importance of addressing the dynamics of land degradation in the region, and hopefully, will lead to larger, more ambitious targets in coming years,” he said. “Degraded land can be restored by adding trees to properties that are currently used for farming or raising livestock,” said Clement Chenost, technical director of the Moringa Fund, a French buiness group that is has pledged to invest $49m in agro-forestry projects in Latin America and Africa. “As the world prepares to deliver a binding climate agreement in Paris by 2015, restoration will be absolutely essential for countries to hit their emissions targets, while also delivering huge benefits for the rural poor. Through their leadership in Initiative 20x20, these countries will have a tremendous head start,” said Andrew Steer, chief executive of the WRI. Ecuador, which has agreed to restore 500,000 hectares, has said it will offer farmers grants to replant and protect forests on their degraded lands. “Planting new trees and allowing trees to regrow naturally can sequester carbon dioxide, while more effectively using already degraded landscapes for agriculture can avoid further deforestation,” said a spokesman."
"As the Lima climate talks enter their second week, today MPs gather for the second reading of a rather important bill. As is usual, it’s written as if to lull one into a lengthy stupor. But the contents of the infrastructure bill should snap you wide awake. It raises some awkward questions.  Take air pollution – now the world’s chief killer. In 2012, it was the source of about 7 million premature deaths. Every year in the world’s most advanced economies it costs about US$3.5 trillion in lives lost and ill health. In our own backyard, it’s reached illegal highs – and takes the lives of 29,000 people every year. Today, a new report from the environmental audit committee (of which I’m a member) dubs air pollution “a public health imperative”, and concludes that – to save lives – “urgent change is needed”. But the infrastructure bill doesn’t mention clean air targets. Instead, it emphasises big road investment – to the tune, boasts our government, of a headline-baiting £15bn and 1,300 miles in new lanes. That £15bn would buy roughly 30 state-of-the-art hospitals. Which could come in handy, given all the air pollution. Labour was outraged. Not from any climate or health concern – it simply sulked that the government was all talk, and chastised it for failing to invest sooner – not just for roads but for airport expansion too. Road traffic is the primary contributor to air pollution in most parts of the UK. And new roads don’t cut congestion. Even government studies show that. They simply lead to more jams, exacerbate emissions and erode our countryside. Whereas, earlier this month, Department for Transport figures showed local sustainable transport schemes returned £5 for every £1 spent. So our £15bn would be far better used repairing existing roads and on initiatives to boost public transport, walking and cycling. Our main parties have their priorities backwards. And nowhere is that clearer than in the infrastructure bill. Which is why today I’ve tabled a reasoned amendment to it. This year, David Cameron dubbed climate change one of “the greatest threats” we faced. Just yesterday Ed Miliband proclaimed tackling climate change was “the most important thing” he could do in politics. But the infrastructure bill doesn’t mention climate change. And, aside from some tinkering around the details, the bill’s big climate picture – or lack of – is backed by all main parties. It includes a new duty to maximise the recovery of oil and gas – just when we’re duty-bound to reduce it. Science is clear on that: to avoid catastrophic climate change, about 80% of our existing fossil fuel reserves must stay good and unburned. But the government’s on a shale crusade. And the infrastructure bill paves the way for a whole new fossil fuel industry. And what fracking firms want, they get. The bill awards them sweeping new powers to run pipelines under private land – without the consent of owners. It’s opposed by 75% of us, but what does public opinion matter? Meanwhile, the UK’s renewables (we’ve some of the best in Europe) struggle to get a word in edgeways. The bill rightly talks a lot about jobs creation – the Department of Energy and Climate Change predicts fracking could generate up to 32,000 of them. Except – despite the government’s cuts – the renewables industry already supports more than 100,000 jobs. And a nationwide energy efficiency programme could create an additional 108,000 jobs every year between 2020 and 2030. To be fair, the bill does give a nod to community energy ownership rights – a small step in the right direction. But we should be taking giant leaps. Fracking has a limited lifespan – the writing’s already on the wall. We’d receive a far richer return on our billions, economically and in energy security, by going all out for homegrown renewables and efficiency. It would create jobs, slash emissions and cut fuel bills. And fuel poverty is a grossly neglected national scandal. Cold homes cost lives – and cost our NHS about £1.3bn every year. The UK has some of Europe’s least energy-efficient housing – we know energy efficiency should be our number one infrastructure priority. It’s an issue hundreds of my own constituents have lobbied me on. But the infrastructure bill doesn’t mention energy efficiency. Our energy policies are plagued by contradiction; substance too often sidelined for political posturing. As it stands, this bill is little different. But we have a chance to change that. It boils down to a simple choice. We’re either willing to legislate for the common good or we’re not. This parliament has a historic responsibility. We can work together to make this bill one our children will thank us for. Or we can leave them a world that’s beyond their control. Miliband is quite right – this is the most important thing we can do in politics."
"The increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is not making trees in tropical forests grow faster, say scientists who have analysed over 1,100 individual trees from forests in Bolivia, Thailand and Cameroon.  Researchers had expected higher CO2 levels to act as a tree fertiliser so boosting growth. The finding could indicate that such forests are not helping mitigate the effects of climate change by removing excess CO2 from the atmosphere. The results contradict previous studies that made inventories of the total number of trees in particular regions of tropical forests and found the numbers increasing. So it may be that tropical forests are becoming more dense rather than individual trees growing faster. CO2 is essential to trees. It is absorbed from the air and turned into sugar using energy from light during photosynthesis. The sugar is then transported around the tree allowing it to grow. Each year, a tree lays down a new tree ring. Its width indicates how fast the tree has put on weight during that growing season. Over the past 150 years, the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has increased by 30% to 35%. This should drive more photosynthesis meaning more growth and fatter tree rings. However, Peter van der Sleen at Wageningen University, The Netherlands and his colleagues found no such increase in the 1109 trees from 12 species they studied. “It was very surprising. The results call into question whether tropical forests are carbon sinks,” said van der Sleen. The tropical forests contain a quarter of all the carbon found in living things on Earth. They have been suggested as a major carbon sink, removing carbon dioxide from the air. If left in the atmosphere, that carbon dioxide would help retain more heat in the atmosphere and have more of an impact on climate change. But the new findings, published in Nature Geoscience, run contrary to older experimental conclusions. A network of 50-metre-high towers in some tropical forests measure the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere above the canopy of trees. These towers show that CO2 does appear to be pulled from the air by the forests. So where is it going? Studies known as forest inventories may have the answer. In these studies, forest plots are singled out and inventoried at regular intervals. Over the past several decades, these have shown that the density of trees is increasing as more carbon is used up. This would increase the biomass of the forest by adding more trees rather than accelerating the growth of older ones. Either way, it would scrub carbon out of the atmosphere as a result. But it does not explain why the established trees do not grow faster. “The experiments that predicted accelerated tree growth with increases in carbon dioxide are elegant and convincing,” said van der Sleen. “Why tree density would be enhanced but not existing tree growth is very difficult to answer.” New experiments in Brazil will investigate. Called free-air CO2 enrichment (Face), the experiments will bathe patches of the tropical forest in high levels of CO2 and measure what happens to the growth rate of established trees versus saplings."

"China’s largest coal-fired power plant has been violating national emission standards for chemicals that cause dangerous fine particulate matter pollution, official figures show. The Waigaoqiao coal-fired power plant located in Shanghai has been violating China’s national standards for nitrogen oxides every week since new standards came into force in July, according to analysis of publicly available government data by researchers at Greenpeace East Asia.  The data shows that phase two of the Waigaoqiao plant, which has a capacity of 1,800MW, has been emitting nitrogen oxides in excess of emission standards used by the local environmental protection bureau 18% of the time.  Research by Greenpeace also shows that the local regulator is not yet using the national standards on nitrogen oxides. If the new standards were being used, the group said the plant would be in violation almost all of the time. Waigaoqiao is often praised as the cleanest coal-powered plant in China and is seen as a showcase for other plants in the country. However such a large violation of emissions standards at this plant shows that China is still struggling with enforcing its environmental protection laws and regulations. “The gap in enforcement is still there,” said Ma Jun, the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing, which also monitors pollution levels throughout China. The case shows that even in the well-developed coastal regions of China “there is still an enforcement gap, but the gap is bigger in the mid and western parts of China,” he said.  Lauri Myllyvirta, a senior global coal campaigner with Greenpeace, said: “the systematic violations, in a mega power plant in the middle of China’s most important economic centre and the failure by the regulator to effectively intervene illustrate the challenge that China faces in controlling emissions from its massive coal industry”. Greenpeace also looked at figures for the neighbouring province of Jiangsu and found that in July, half of the coal-fired plants were violating the regulations on nitrogen oxides. “This is not a single case but maybe in the whole country the power plants have the same problem,” said Fang Lifeng, a coal expert with Greenpeace, based in Beijing. Nitrogen oxides are one of the main contributors to fine particulate pollution known as PM2.5 which is considered dangerous because it penetrates deep into the lungs. PM2.5 pollution was linked to 670,000 premature deaths in 2012, according to a study released in November.  While China has made progress in dealing with other components of air pollution including sulphur dioxide, it has only recently started to deal with the issue of nitrogen oxides. China is still facing many issues in terms of enforcement of its environmental regulations but there has been a lot of progress made on transparency of data and it is now publishing real-time data from a huge number of power and industrial plants. “With this I think China has made some remarkable progress and we need to recognise that. The real-time disclosure of the online monitoring data on such a massive scale, China is probably the first country to do that,” said Ma Jun. “It demonstrates that in China there has been some real political will to try to deal with the problems.”"
"This year has seen a huge number of development challenges arise or worsen. The Ebola outbreak in west Africa still defies attempts at containment. A new climate agreement is still in question while global greenhouse gas emissions rise largely unchecked. Millions of people are facing a food crisis as funding dries up and extreme weather events disrupt farming. The global economy is languishing, inequality is putting pressure on social and political systems, and ecosystems are under threat. Human activity has come to dominate many of the Earth’s life-support systems, but are societies prepared to address these challenges? Are we even able to assess the risks they pose to our wellbeing? Science can play an important role, but research programmes must become more interconnected if we are to address today’s most pressing developing challenges – from improving health, food security and access to clean energy and water, to understanding how demographic shifts affect our production and consumption patterns.  While much of the attention on Ebola has been on containment and treating those affected, other research is trying to understand the root causes of the outbreak. The majority of known human infectious diseases are zoonotic – they are shared with animals. Human activities such as deforestation, agricultural expansion, and hunting and trade of wildlife can lead to increased opportunities for existing diseases to spread and for people to come into contact with novel diseases not yet spread to humans.  The ecoHEALTH project is researching the links between health, global change and socioecological systems, which can inform the fight against Ebola. By improving knowledge about the human drivers of disease emergence, researchers are focusing on proactive approaches to halt the spread of novel diseases to humans. They are also considering the economic impact of disease emergence, and the consequences for how we value biodiversity, so that we are better prepared to handle future outbreaks. The optimism surrounding UN climate talks that began this week is a positive sign, but progress has been limited largely because climate change is perceived as far-off, fiercely contested and highly inequitable in its effects and burdens. Science has an important role in bringing the risks into focus, reducing uncertainty and identifying who will be the winners and the losers.  Science also has a vital role in bringing timely data about the state of the climate into the public domain. The Global Carbon Project works to develop a complete picture of carbon emissions and fixation. Every year, its researchers publish the latest thinking on carbon emissions in the Global Carbon Budget. The 2014 budget projects that carbon emissions will grow 2.5% this year, with China contributing 28% of emissions last year. Global emissions are on track to warm the planet by 3.2C-5.4°C by the end of the century; clear evidence for why policymakers need to take action quickly. We know that increasingly frequent extreme weather can wreak devastation when it occurs in socially and economically marginalised areas, where people’s livelihoods cannot withstand the disruption. Recent studies by the Cgiar research programme on climate change, agriculture and food security (CCAFS) look at the interconnectedness of climate change and food production systems, combining climate modelling with social research techniques to better understand how the world’s farmers can react to climate change. For example, in India, CCAFS South Asia is supporting a study that will equip genebanks with seeds that are “climate-ready”. This means they have genetic resources that are resilient to climatic stresses such as severe heat or scarce water. Farmers in the drylands who depend on crops such as millet, chickpea and sorghum for their food and livelihoods will need seeds that can thrive in a harsher climate. Work like this shows how adapting to climate change and ensuring food security can be two sides of the same coin.  The new Future Earth programme, which on Thursday launches a report about research priorities for sustainable development, aims to coordinate research leading to actionable knowledge. Funders must be prepared to commit not only financially but also conceptually to a strategy for development in which evidence and engagement play a central role. • Frans Berkhout is director of Future Earth"

"The current UN climate talks will be the first to neutralise all the greenhouse gas pollution they generate, offset by host country Peru’s protection of forest reserves, organisers say. The bad news: the Lima conference is expected to have the biggest carbon footprint of any UN climate meeting measured to date. At more than 50,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide, the negotiations’ burden on global warming will be about one and a half times the norm, said Jorge Alvarez, project coordinator for the UN Development Programme.  The venue is one big reason. It had to be built. Eleven football fields of temporary structures arose for the 13-day negotiations from what three months ago was an empty field behind Peru’s army’s headquarters. Concrete was laid, plumbing installed, components flown in from as far as France and Brazil. Standing in the midday sun here can get downright uncomfortable, but the Lima sun is not reliable. That’s one reason solar panels were not used. For electricity, the talks are relying exclusively on diesel generators. Organisers had planned to draw power from Peru’s grid, which is about 52% fed by non-polluting hydroelectric power. “We worked to upgrade transformers and generators but for some reason it didn’t work,” said Alvarez. Peru’s hydroelectric power could be in danger by mid-century, anyway. Much of that water comes from glaciers that are melting at an accelerated pace. Peru is hardly on a green trajectory. Though it emits in a year the greenhouse gases that China spews in three days, it has doubled its carbon output in the past decade. Nor is there a guarantee that the 580 square miles (1,500 square kilometers) of forest, whose conservation Alvarez said would offset the talks’ carbon pollution, won’t someday be gone. The Houston, Texas-sized area — in four different forest preserves — must lie unperturbed for a half century in order to neutralise carbon emitted at the conference, Alvarez said. Environmental economist John M Reilly of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called that accounting peculiar.  “If this forest is cut down in 50 or 100 years, all of the saved carbon will end up back in the atmosphere,” he said. Reilly called the “wasted efforts” to build makeshift quarters disturbing — unless the talks “were actually successful in halting future emissions.” This is the 20th round of talks and so far there is little sign of serious progress. Alvarez itemised the talks’ carbon footprint: — Construction, nearly 20% of the footprint. — Jet fuel burned by the estimated 11,000 delegates and observers who flew in from abroad, about 30%. — Local transportation. Organisers hired more than 300 buses since there are no public transit services to the venue. All burn fossil fuels. About 15-20%. — Electricity, solid waste treatment, water, paper, food, disposable plates and cups, keeping 40,000 police on high alert, for the balance. The 50,000 tons the conference emits is what China as a country emits in three minutes, the US does in five minutes and Peru does in six hours and 40 minutes. It is more than eight times as much carbon as the 2009 Copenhagen talks and twice that of the 2010 conference in Cancun, Mexico, according to the UN. A more accurate carbon footprint will be published after the conference and certified by the Spanish company Aenor, organizers say. UN volunteers have been polling delegates on their air travel in search of precision. The conference’s green components are meagre. Peruvian Environment Minister Manuel Pulgar-Vidal asked for a bicycle parking lot. He got it, but only about 40 people use it daily. Most delegates spend about an hour in traffic traveling less than 6 miles (10 kilometers) from their hotels. Blame that, in part, on the army. It initially balked on letting in bikes, even though only the credentialed can enter the base known as “El Pentagonito.” “It took them three days to sort it out,” said Andrew Marquard, an adviser to the South Africa delegation and an avid cyclist who was interviewed after arriving at the talks on two wheels, skin shiny with sweat. Blame the dearth of bikes also on Lima, one of the world’s least friendly cities for cyclists. The city’s few cyclists so fear drivers that they tend to prefer to compete with pedestrians for sidewalk space. “There are quiet (leafy) areas around the convention centre for riding bikes,” said Alvarez. “But getting here is a problem.” No hybrid or electric vehicles have been seen at the event. Japan donated 121 electric and hybrid vehicles, chiefly for dignitaries. “Unfortunately, most didn’t arrive,” Alvarez said. He blamed shipping bureaucracy. Some energy savings were applied inside the white temporary structures where delegates wrangle, journalists toil and testy closed-door sessions take place. “We did not put in strong air conditioning. It is (designed) only to fight the heat in the structures,” said Maxime Rosenwald of GL Events, the Lyon, France-based company that built and runs the physical plant. The air conditioning is often losing that fight as the sun regularly burns away Lima’s low coastal clouds, the Southern Hemisphere summer being nigh. On Monday, UN organisers announced that “in view of the high temperatures expected to continue and intensify,” delegates were invited to adjust “by wearing business casual attire” to most events."

"John Kerry, the US secretary of state, called on world leaders to reach for an ambitious deal to fight climate change in a visit to UN negotiations on Thursday. The appearance of a high-profile official such as Kerry at a critical stage of the talks will send a powerful signal of Barack Obama’s continued commitment to climate action, US officials say.  Kerry did not make any new announcements and US officials say he will not be jumping in to take a hands-on role in the talks. “I do not actually expect Senator Kerry to get involved in the negotiations,” said Todd Stern, the State Department climate change envoy. But the officials said Kerry’s decision to speak to the meeting would help keep up the momentum around the talks. “I think this is going to demonstrate to the world yet again the US commitment to addressing climate change,” the official said. In an attempt to get the talks moving Kerry called on negotiators to set aside the old divisions between rich and poor countries and recognise that it would take a global effort to fight climate change. “No single country including the United States can solve this problem or foot this bill alone,” he said. “If we somehow eliminated all of our carbon pollution, guess what? That still wouldn’t be enough.” Nor would it be enough if China or India cut all their emissions, Kerry went on. “If even one or two major economies fail to respond to the threat, it will counter-act much of the good work that the rest of the world does.” In a slight at countries such as Australia and Canada, which have backtracked on climate promises, Kerry said industralised countries in particular had to step up. “If you are a big developed nation and you are not helping to lead then you are part of the problem,” he said. The secretary of state, who made only a brief visit to the talks on Thursday, said countries should be heartened by the example set by the US and China which jointly agreed last month to cut carbon pollution. “That is a historic milestone and it should send a message to all of us that the road blocks we have had for decades can be removed from our path,” Kerry said. Kerry, a climate champion since his days in the Senate, adopted climate change and ocean conservation as his key priorities since becoming secretary of state. A few years ago it would have been unthinkable to suggest a visit by a US secretary of state would boost the prospects for UN climate talks. But Ed Davey, the UK’s energy and climate change secretary, said the atmospherics had changed. “John Kerry’s leadership, along with that of President Obama, has been critical in getting the world to the point where we are at,” said Davey. “The US, China and others have been a brake on progress in climate change talks. Now we see America working with the European Union and others to try to get successful climate change talks.”"
"The world’s beaches are being washed away as coastal developments increase in size and engineers build ever higher sea walls to defend against fierce winter storms and rising sea levels, according to two of the worlds’ leading marine geologists.  The warning comes as violent Atlantic and Pacific storms this week sent massive 50ft waves crashing over sea defences, washed away beaches and destroyed concrete walls in Europe, north America and the Philippines.  “Most natural sand beaches are disappearing, due partly to rising sea levels and increased storm action, but also to massive erosion caused by the human development of the shore,” said Andrew Cooper, professor of coastal studies at the University of Ulster.  “The widespread damage on western Europe’s storm-battered shores, the devastation caused by hurricane Sandy along the northeastern US seaboard, the deaths brought on by typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines all exemplify the total inadequacy of [coastal] infrastructure and the vulnerability of cities built on the edge of coastlines”, said Orrin Pilkey, professor of earth and ocean sciences at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.  Pilkey and Cooper say in a new book, The Last Beach, that sea walls, which are widely believed by many local authorities to protect developments from erosion and sea level rise, in fact lead to the destruction of beaches and sea defences and require constant rebuilding at increasing cost.  Dunes and wide beaches protect buildings from storms far better than sea walls, say the authors. “The beach is a wonderful, free natural defence against the forces of the ocean. Beaches absorb the power of the ocean waves reducing them to a gentle swash that laps on the shoreline. Storms do not destroy beaches. They change their shape and location, moving sand around to maximise the absorption of wave energy and then recover in the days, months and years to follow,” said Pilkey .  Beaches in nature are almost indestructible, but seawall construction disrupts the natural movement of sand and waves, hindering the process of sand deposition along the shorelines, said Cooper.  “The wall itself is the problem. If you build a sea wall to protect the shore, the inevitable consequence is that the beach will disappear. The wall cannot absorb the energy of the sea. All beaches with defences ... are in danger. When you build the sea wall, that is the end of the beach,” he said. “Beaches have become long, narrow engineering projects sustained only by constant maintenance and ongoing expenditures. Ugly seawalls have removed beaches altogether. Trying to hold the shoreline in position makes a flexible response to sea level rise more difficult,” said Pilkey.  Many of the world’s most famous beaches are now ecologically dead and dependent for their survival on being replenished with sand or gravel, they say. “The death knell has already sounded for large stretches of beaches along densely developed shorelines like those in Florida, Spain’s Costa del Sol, Australia’s Gold Coast and Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro,” says Pilkey.  Driven by tourism and trade, coastlines have become home to a growing proportion of the world’s population, but no country will be able to prevent its beaches being washed away and its defences destroyed, the authors warn.  As sea level rise adds to the damage done by the increasingly frequent storms expected with climate change, retreat from the shoreline will become imperative - but next to impossible. “We will have to retreat [from the shoreline]. There is no choice. In economic terms alone, it will be impossible to defend everything. Defending cities like London or Rotterdam in Europe mean there will be no money for all the other smaller seaside towns,” says Cooper. Sea level rise will mean that cities will have to build much higher sea walls to survive and this will cause beaches to disappear. “A world without beaches is a distinct possibility. [Coastal cities] will end up with massively high sea walls. In years to come you may not be able to see the sea from many developments [in places like Florida] except from second or third floors. By building high rise developments along coastlines we have made it impossible to retreat,” he says. The authors accuse engineering consultancies and government agencies of promoting a hard-engineering, anti-ecological, short-term response to beach erosion. “The US army corps of engineers, the Dutch institute for Delta Technologies in Holland and HR Wallingford in UK are major movers in shoreline engineering, whose whole raison d’etre is to make money by building defences,” said Pilkey.  But their work often proves misguided, he said. “After Hurricane Sandy hit the US east coast in 2011,the Corps pumped 200,000 cubic metres of sand on to Atlantic Beach, New Jersey. Within five months it had disappeared, leaving a 9m-high cliff cut into the shoreline, and an estimated bill of $4m to deal with it”. “Rising seas around the world will multiply these bills by millions because of such misguided, short-term schemes, with beaches needing to be replaced every few years”, he said. But Jonathan Simm, technical director for flood management at HR Wallingford defended engineers. “We are but servants. There are some very difficult social and political decisions that have to be made about which frontages should be defended. Engineers get struck in the middle between different… political and technical arguments.  “The reality is that major urban conurbations are going to want to sustain their existing defences. But a lot of beaches are under stress so the engineering is going to become much more expensive.”  Sea level rise, which is expected to raise levels significantly over the next 100 years, will affect beaches in different ways, said Pilkey. “Although the sea has only risen a foot (0.3 meters) over the last 100 years or so, that amount can have a real impact on shoreline retreat on very gently sloping coasts. In theory, a one-foot sea-level rise should push the shoreline back 2,000 feet.”  As beaches disappear, countries are turning to increasingly expensive sand replenishment programmes which dump thousands of tonnes of dredged sand on existing, eroded beaches.  But these artificial beaches usually erode at least twice as fast as natural beaches and can only ever be a temporary solution, said Cooper. “As time goes on and as the sea level rises, the interval of re-replenishment will get shorter because the beach becomes less stable. Beach replenishment is only a plaster that must be applied again and again at great cost. It doesn’t remove the problem, it treats the symptoms. Eventually and inevitably beach replenishment will stop either as sand or money runs out”.  It also smothers all life on the beach. “The near shore food chain that originates with the tiny organisms living between grains of sands and surviving on occasional influxes of seaweed is now gone. The whole ecosystem is out of whack. Habitats for turtle and bird nesting are being destroyed,” said Cooper.  “We have a mentality to just rebuild everything after a storm. The simplest solution would be to move the infrastructure back. The problem is the obsession with building and defending property right next to the beach and to hold the beach in place. This process just destroys the beach.”  "
"2014 is set to be England’s hottest year in over 350 years, according to the world’s longest continuous record, with climate change at least partly to blame. The whole world has had a warm year and global data, released later on Wednesday, is likely to indicate a new record. Higher temperatures cause more evaporation and more rain, and 2014 began with England’s wettest winter in over 250 years, leading to widespread flooding. Unless December turns unusually cold, 2014 will beat 1995, 2006, 1990 and 2011 as the warmest year on record. The average temperature in 2014 so far is almost 11.5C, about 1.5C higher than the long-term average.  “Looking at the averages for central England between January and November, 2014 is far and away the warmest on record so far,” said Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading. “Unless there is a relatively cool December, 2014 will be the warmest, as well as one of the wettest.” He said there was only a 25% chance that 2014 would not be the hottest year. The world’s nations are currently meeting in Lima, Peru, at UN negotiations to seal a deal to cut carbon emissions and tackle climate change. The likely record warmth in 2014 would end a period of relatively slow rises in global surface temperatures.  This has been portrayed by climate sceptics as a halt in global warming, but greenhouse gases have continued to trap heat with over 90% of it being absorbed by the oceans. After the warmth of 2014, surface temperatures may now accelerate again.  “2014 has been a warm year so far for much of Europe and the globe, and may end up being the warmest year on record globally. The long-term trend, especially since 1950, is at least partly due to human activity,” said Hawkins. “The signal of a warming climate is clearly visible even at the local [UK] scale where changes in climate are actually experienced, and this in one of the most climatically variable parts of the world.” Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said: “This news totally disproves false claims by UK climate change ‘sceptics’ that global warming has stopped. We are still seeing global and national records set all over the world. For instance, the UK’s seven warmest years and four of the five wettest years, have all occurred from 2000 onwards. This means an increasing risk of heatwaves and flooding, as we have seen this year. There can be no excuses for anyone, including politicians, to deny the risks that climate change is creating for people in the UK and across the world.” The Central England Temperature data set, which covers the region between London, Bristol and Lancashire, is the longest continuous instrumental record in the world. It began recording monthly averages in 1659 and added daily averages in 1772."
"This year is on track to be the warmest ever recorded in Europe, and greenhouse gas emissions played a major role, according to new research. Scientists have analysed centuries of temperature records to conclude that this year’s warmth was made at least 35 times more likely because of climate change. In the UK, this year’s weather included an unusually warm beginning to autumn, with hot sunny days continuing into late October. A team of researchers at Oxford found that the odds of such a warm year in this country had increased by a factor of 10.  Scientists from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), the University of Melbourne and the Australian National University found that the likelihood of such warm temperatures across Europe was 35 to 80 times greater because of climate change. Myles Allen, professor at Oxford University, told the Guardian that his group was working on much smaller areas than the other researchers, and was still able to detect a clear signal of climate change. “We are using regional climate models to zoom in on smaller areas than the other groups, and it is interesting that even on the scale of the UK, we are seeing a substantial impact of human influence on climate on the odds of such a warm year,” he said. The new work, which has yet to be peer-reviewed or published in full, adds to the increasing science of global warming attribution. While the science of global warming has been understood for many years – the comprehensive 2007 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) set out the certainty that climate change was occurring and caused in the main by human activity - it has always been difficult to tie specific events, such as heatwaves, storms or floods, to climate change. That is because such events also happen naturally, though less frequently than they would under a warming climate. Ongoing work by teams of researchers around the world, including the Met Office and Oxford University in the UK, is changing that, enabling specific weather events or trends to be linked to global warming on a probability scale. Previous research has shown, for instance, that the record warm November of 2011 was at least 60 times more likely to have happened because of climate change, according to the Met Office.  Global efforts to combat climate change are continuing. Last week, governments meeting at the UN’s annual climate change conference, held in Lima, agreed a framework for curbing the growth in greenhouse gas emissions, prior to a new global climate agreement that is supposed to be signed at another major conference next year in Paris. There are encouraging signs that emissions may be moderating at the global level. Last year, global greenhouse gas emissions increased at a slower rate than the average of the past decade. Carbon output was 2% higher than the previous year, which is much lower than the average of 3.8% a year that has been normal since 2003, if the short-lived effects of the financial crisis on emissions are stripped out, according to data from the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. A slowdown in the pace of China’s economic growth was to some extent responsible, along with increasing use of renewable energy. But amidst the decrease in emissions growth, there have been opposing signs: in the US, where the shale gas boom has driven down carbon emissions for several years, a swing back to coal – as gas prices have risen – pushed up emissions growth to 2.5% in 2013. Europe’s greenhouse gases fell by 1.4%."
"Climate talks in Lima ran into extra time amid rising frustration from developing countries at the “ridiculously low” commitments from rich countries to help pay for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. The talks – originally scheduled to wrap up at 12pm after 10 days – are now expected to run well into Saturday , as negotiators huddle over a new draft text many glimpsed for the first time only morning. The Lima negotiations began on a buoyant note after the US, China and the EU came forward with new commitments to cut carbon pollution. But they were soon brought back down to earth over the perennial divide between rich and poor countries in the negotiations: how should countries share the burden for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and who should pay? The talks were designed to draft a blueprint for a global deal to fight climate change, due to be adopted in Paris late next year. But developing countries argued that before signing on they needed to see greater commitments that the industrialised countries would keep to their end of a bargain to provide the money needed to fight climate change. After 10 days of talks, developing countries argued that those assurances were not strong enough. By midweek, a little over $10bn had been raised for a green climate fund, intended to help poor countries invest in clean energy technology. That was below the initial target of $15bn and many of those funds will be distributed over several years. It was also unclear how industrialised countries could be held to an earlier promise to mobilise $100bn a year for climate finance by 2020, negotiators from developing countries said. “We are disappointed,” said India’s Prakash Javadekar. “It is ridiculous. It is ridiculously low.” Javadekar said the pledges to the green climate fund amounted to backsliding. “We are upset that 2011, 2012, 2013 – three consecutive years – the developed world provided $10bn each year for climate action support to the developing world, but now they have reduced it. Now they are saying $10bn is for four years, so it is $2.5bn,” he said. The frustration – with the lack of climate finance as well as other aspects of the draft text – was widespread among developing countries, especially those in the gravest danger from climate change. There have been more than 20 years of Conference of the Parties (CoP) meetings, such as those at Lima, with little in the way of concrete outcomes, said Ahmed Sareer, the Maldivian negotiator who is about to take over the leadership of the Alliance of Small Island States. “How many CoPs will it take for us to really see any tangible results? We have been going from CoP to CoP and every time we are given so many assurances, and expectations are raised, but the gaps are getting wider,” he said. “There has been a clear commitment of $100bn a year but how are we really being offered? Even when they make those pledges how do we know how much is going to materialise? There is no point of knowing that behind the wall there is a big source of funds available unless we can reach it,” he said. “We are told it is there in a nice show case, but we don’t get to meet it. We don’t get to access it. These are difficult issues for us.” The seven-page draft text under discussion so far remains in a very raw state, with negotiators asked to choose between three options on virtually every major issue of contention. But the multiple-choice format makes it evident that the old fault lines between rich and poor countries remain. In addition to finance, one of the biggest areas of contentious is “differentiation” in UN parlance – which countries should bear the burden of cutting emissions that cause climate change. The US and other industrialised countries require all countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions. That would be a departure from the original UN classification of the 1990s – which absolved China, India and other developing countries which are now major carbon polluters – of cutting their emissions. Developing countries are suspicious that the text being developed in Lima is an attempt to rewrite those old guidelines. “I am certain that developing countries the majority of them will have a problem with the way they framed responsibility. Most developing countries will be concerned about that,” said Tasneem Essop, head of strategy for WWF. Countries are also divided over the initial commitments countries are expected to make on fighting climate change – known as “intended nationally determined contributions”. Rich countries, including the US, only want to commit to carbon cuts. Developing countries want those commitments to include finance for climate adaptation. The rich-poor divide also holds over the issue of monitoring the scale of those commitments – with China, India and other countries opposed to outside review."

"Over the past two decades, Brazil has developed a tradition for helping move international climate negotiations forward at critical moments. However, in the face of climate emergency, lack of ambition and a set of shy measures towards carbon emission reductions can neutralise the best ideas and great diplomatic role played by the country. At the time of the Kyoto protocol, Brazil came up with the idea of a clean development fund, now the clean development mechanism, for helping developing countries engage in cutting emissions . It has also put on the table a bold, if controversial, proposal for burden-sharing based on historical responsibilities for the warming we’ve seen so far.  At the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, Brazil showcased a significant voluntary target that delivered real CO2 reductions from controlling deforestation. In Durban, Brazilian diplomats used a smart twist of phrase to break a deadlock over the legal form of the 2015 climate agreement. Brazil’s newest diplomatic contraption was submitted to the UN shortly before the Lima climate conference, which opened on Monday. It is a mechanism called “concentric differentiation”, which allows for every country to collaborate in the effort towards the target of limiting temperature rises to 2C above pre-industrial levels.  Its graphic representation consists of a series of three circles, the innermost of which should be occupied by developed countries with absolute, economy-wide targets; the middle one, by emerging economies, with intensity, per capita or relative reduction targets; and the outer circle, by other developing countries, with non-economy-wide targets. Every country should move towards the centre in time, according to its respective capabilities. While the proposal is certainly interesting for differentiating among developing countries, it still may leave major emitters such as Brazil and China off the hook, by allowing them to set targets that are not measured in absolute reductions for the post-2020 period. That would be a tragedy for the climate and also detrimental to the Brazilian economy. Brazil is far from being an innocent bystander of climate change – even by its own metric of historical responsibility. According to a recent peer-reviewed study, thanks to deforestation in the latter 20th century, the Latin American country is probably the  fourth top contributor to the observed global warming, responding for about 7% of the total temperature change. Therefore, while still a developing country, it is among the nations that should deliver ambitious emissions pledges (‘nationally determined contributions’ in the UN jargon) for a post-2020 climate agreement. There are reasons to believe that the emission cuts the country has achieved over the past decade may now be waning. According to data released by the Climate Observatory, a coalition formed by Brazilian civil society organisations, Brazil’s greenhouse gas emissions have grown 7.8% in 2013 in spite of a very low economic growth, with major contributions coming from land use and energy. Deforestation control is no longer taken for granted. Last year there was a 29% increase in the rate of forest clearing in the Amazon, and the 2015 data is pointing towards another increase. The country’s energy mix is also getting dirtier: 70% of the planned investments on energy will go to fossil fuel in the next 10 years. After swearing off coal a few years back, the Brazilian government has helped it stage a comeback last month, by awarding a contract for its first new coal power plant in nine years. If Brazil is serious about the 2C goal, then it must revert to its former pathway on coal. The Climate Observatory’s assessment for an equity-based 2030 climate target suggests that Brazilian non-land use emissions should peak well before 2025, and overall emissions should decline to significantly less than 1bn tons of CO2 equivalent per year by 2030. Achieving that would not be too hard for the country and can even be done while the economy grows – in fact, it can help set Brazil’s struggling economy back to a growth trajectory. In 2008, the country committed itself to zero net deforestation by 2015. It could increase its planted forests area from 7m to 17m hectares by 2025. Just by implementing measures that are already in place, it could also cut emissions in the agricultural sector by one-third in 2020 – or even reach zero emissions from farming and cattle ranching if the Low Carbon Agriculture plan could be expanded to the whole set of yearly investments in agriculture. Brazil could also double its ethanol production by 2020 just by providing clear policies for the sector while reviewing its current policy of gasoline subsidies. With solar photovoltaic energy faring nearly as cheap as coal in the latest bids, and wind energy much cheaper than any fossil fuel, there is no reason for Brazil not to become again a renewables superpower. It actually might be helped in such quest by the current oil supply shock, which drove prices down and made Brazilian ultra-deep-water oil unattractive. While other big emitters, such as the EU, China and the US, start showing their cards on the climate table and betting big on renewables, Brazil seems to be holding itself back.

"I applaud the Guardian for taking the lead in covering the UN's climate change conference in Lima, and for tackling some of its inherent contradictions. For example, your article Lima climate talks on track for record carbon footprint (theguardian.com, 10 December) highlights the conference of the parties' (Cop) surprisingly negative environmental impact this year. Cop 20's carbon footprint is interesting as a symbol of its one step forward, two steps back modus operandi. Sadly, failure to meet any real consensus at even this superficial level means that Cop 20's carbon footprint may be its most significant contribution to the Earth's atmosphere.  There is a danger in following the Guardian's line of thinking, however, in that focusing too much on individual consumption mistakes means missing the rainforest for the trees. I spoke with a number of climate justice advocates at the people's summit on climate change in Lima, across town from its more governmental counterpart. When I asked what individual Americans could do to help out, they did not say things like ride a bicycle to work more, or buy solar panels. Their message was consistent: organise, organise, organise. The environmental crisis is too deep for us to address with anything less than system change. Moreover, it is too easy for a wily market logic to misappropriate efforts to buy greener products. Capitalist consumerism was built on an ethos of dog-eat-dog competition, and the villainisation of collective action. To address climate change at its roots, we need to look past the kind of individualistic thinking that got us in trouble in the first place. Shawn Van ValkenburghLong Beach, CA, USA • However well-intentioned and based on real needs of our planet, Greenpeace's action very close to the hummingbird at the Nazca lines (Greenpeace apologises over Nazca stunt, December), an extremely fragile archaeological site, was not only absurd but also showed contempt for Peru and the way this country protects its legacy. Roberto UgasLima, Peru • It is with real dismay that we received the news of proposed elimination of valuable legislation by the European commission to improve air quality and to boost recycling and wiser resource use in Europe and develop a circular economy (EU air quality and recycling goals face axe, 12 December). In their bid to play to the growing tide of Euro-scepticism across Europe, the EU's president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and, vice-president, Frans Timmermans, fundamentally misjudge the mood and appetite of many in industry and civil society. There are persuasive arguments that legislation to improve air quality and boost reuse and recycling not only save lives but create jobs and protect increasingly fragile resource supply chains. We understand that European institutions may be feeling fragile and that reform from within is necessary, but this response from the commission picks on the wrong legislation at the wrong time. It is a short-sighted and miserable decision that risks slowing green growth, ensuring many more premature deaths from respiratory illnesses, and increases resource supply risks for European manufacturers. Please think again.Ray GeorgesonChief executive, Resource Association • As stated in last week's report by the environmental audit committee (8 December), air pollution has become a public health crisis. It is therefore vital that the UK calls for tough new limits on air pollution at EU level. Many of the pollutants that end up in the air we breathe originate from the continent. We need stricter, clearer national limits in order for all European governments to take coordinated action that will curb pollution and clean up Europe's air. The UK must use its influence to strengthen EU air quality targets, not weaken them, so that we can tackle the sources of pollution both at home and abroad.Catherine Bearder MEP (Liberal Democrat), Seb Dance MEP (Labour), Julie Girling MEP (Conservative) • European commission plans to scrap programmes to clean up our air and tackle waste are deeply disturbing. Protecting the health of its citizens and safeguarding our precious resources should be at the heart of EU policy-making. These are powerful economic moves, as well as environmental and social ones. Sacrificing these aims to benefit a few powerful, unenlightened business interests would be shameful. Friends of the Earth has given strong support to the EU in the past because of the critical role European legislation has played in defending our planet and well-being. But that could change if the EU stops championing the environment and views its protection as a barrier to economic development.Andy AtkinsExecutive director, Friends of the Earth"
"Britain’s energy and climate change secretary, Ed Davey, has said companies should be required to disclose their investments in fossil fuels, bringing firmly into the mainstream the idea that climate risk will affect the value of such holdings. The minister’s call for changes in the financial rules came on the sidelines of UN negotiations in Lima where leaders are working to draft a deal on fight climate change. Davey said it was time to recognise that as economies moved away from fossil fuels as part of that deal, coal, oil and gas were no longer presumed to be a safe financial bet.  “We are seeing a move from carbon capitalism to climate capitalism,” he said. “We know with climate change we have got to move out to a low-carbon agenda and we are already seeing the signs that the market is going to be helping to drive this,” he said. Companies – including big pension funds – had an obligation to tell investors about the risks in the long-term value of fossil fuel holdings, Davey argued. Campaigners and green business groups have for some years promoted the idea of “stranded assets” – fossil fuels that will never be burned because of regulations cutting carbon emissions – to try to make the business case for climate action. Davey said investors deserved to know whether their holdings were at risk. “I think we need to look again at rules of disclosure for big companies who have large investments in fossil fuels,” Davey said. “I think there is a case for making that mandatory is what I am saying.” Acknowledging those risks would lead to changes in regulations governing banking, the stock exchange and other financial institutions, he said.  Davey released a letter he wrote to Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, earlier on Wednesday on managing such changes. Campaigners and green business groups have long been urging companies to disclose their fossil fuel holdings to investors but with very limited success. The divestment and disclosure campaigns got an important boost in September when the heirs to the fabled Rockefeller oil fortune announced they were pulling out of all of their fossil fuel holdings in their US$862m portfolio. Alison Doig, senior climate adviser for ChristianAid, said Davey’s support for mandatory disclosure was critical to bringing the idea into the mainstream. “Even a year ago there was no holding a discussion around risks to these assets,” she said. “It really is moving into a mainstream decision rather than a coffee.”"
"Don’t blame man-made global warming for the devastating California drought, a new federal report says. A report issued on Monday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said natural variations – mostly a La Niña weather oscillation – were the primary drivers behind the drought that has now stretched to three years.  The study’s lead author, Richard Seager of Columbia University, said the paper has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. He and NOAA’s Martin Hoerling said 160 runs of computer models show heat-trapping gases should slightly increase winter rain in parts of California, not decrease. “The conditions of the last three winters are not the conditions that climate change models say would happen,” Hoerling said. But he said La Niña, which is the cooler flip side of the warming of the central Pacific ocean, can only be blamed for about one-third of the drought. The rest of the causes can be from just random variation, he said. Some climate scientists who didn’t participate in the report criticised it, saying it did not take into effect how record warmth worsened the drought. California is having its hottest year on record, based on the first 11 months of the year and is 4.1 degrees warmer than the 20th-century average, according to the National Climatic Data Center. “This study completely fails to consider what climate change is doing to water in California,” wrote Kevin Trenberth, head of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. He said the work “completely misses” how hotter air increases drying by evaporating more moisture from the ground. In droughts, extra heat from global warming enhances the drying in a feedback effect, Trenberth and others said. But Hoerling said that is less of a factor in California because it is so near the ocean and its rain comes in storms coming off the Pacific. Peer-reviewed studies are divided on whether the drought can be blamed on climate change. Others published earlier this year point more directly to changes in pressure of the Pacific that blocked rain from coming into California, but Hoerling and Seager dismissed them as not adequate. Deke Arndt, climate monitoring chief for NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center, said by some drought measures, the current California drought “is slightly more intense than, but still comparable to, the late 1970s episode. I’d put them at 1a and 1b on the list of historical multi-year drought episodes affecting California in modern times.”"

"Frustrated climate campaigners have claimed that the world was on course for an unsustainable four-degree rise in temperatures, as two weeks of negotiations for a climate change agreement headed for an unsatisfying conclusion. The proposals, still under discussion on Saturday, a day after the talks were scheduled to end, were too weak to keep global warming to the agreed limit of two degrees above preindustrial levels, setting the world on course to a climate disaster, according to developing countries at the summit.  “We are on a path to three or four degrees with this outcome,” said Tasneem Essop, international climate strategist for WWF. She said the final draft text, a five-page document put forward for approval on Saturday, offered little assurance of cutting emissions fast enough and deeply enough to curb warming. “We are really unhappy about the weakening of the text. This gives us no level of comfort that we will be able to close the emissions gap to get emissions to peak before 2020,” she said. Saleemul Huq, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development, put it even more succinctly: “It sucks. It is taking us backwards.” The disappointment with the progress of the Lima negotiations was widespread – and hugely at odds with the mood of optimism that prevailed at the opening of the talks following a historic deal between the US and China to curb carbon pollution. The deal between the world’s two biggest carbon polluters – followed just days later by a US pledge to contribute $3bn to a fund to help poor countries deal with climate change – had created a sense of momentum at the opening of the talks. By Saturday, with exhausted negotiators forced to cancel flights and continue the talks into extra time, those upbeat sentiments were gone. “None of us is really happy,” a figure in Switzerland’s delegation told the negotiating session. “At this moment, we have to make sure we are not striving towards the lowest common denominator.” The Malaysian delegate said the proposed deal would not hold the major polluters to account. The Democratic Republic of the Congo representative said: “This crosses all our red lines.” Sudan flatly said the proposals were unacceptable. The talks at Lima had been charged with producing the blueprint for a climate change agreement due to be finalised in Paris at the end of next year. “Let me be frank. There are parts of this text that make me very uncomfortable and parts that are very thin,” said Tony deBrum, foreign minister of the Marshall Islands. It was initially hoped the agreement would push the world’s large economies into making ambitious commitments to cut carbon pollution while also contributing funds and technology to protect the world’s poorest countries from climate change. But those hopes were frustrated by the divide over whether rising economies should be under similar obligation to cut emissions as America and Europe. India – though quickly emerging as one of the world’s biggest carbon polluters – says it should not be held to similar standards as the US and EU. By the time the final draft text appeared, it had been stripped of language that would have required the emissions cuts offered by countries to keep warming below the two-degree target. It was even unclear whether those targets would be subjected to a serious review. In an even bigger blow to small island countries, the draft made no mention of industrialised countries’ responsibility towards the small island states which are under threat of being drowned by rising seas. The accountability gap was a big disappointment for the US and the EU – which had pushed for a strong review process of such commitments – as well as the small islands. The proposals also takes the pressure off industrialised countries to make good on promises to provide up to $100bn a year in climate finance to poor countries by 2020. “We are shocked that some of our colleagues would want to avoid a process to hold their proposed targets up to the light,” DeBrum said. “There should be nothing to hide.” Mark Maslin, professor of climatology at University College London, said: “Though the weak text emerging from Lima is extremely disappointing, there are still 12 months for the negotiators to up their game before the critical Paris COP [UN climate talks]. Essential to this is for the negotiators to understand that the world’s public expect a global legally binding treaty. Not because it is enforceable, as we know they are not, but it shows commitment to a safe, better and hopefully more equitable world.”"
"It’s a rare thing when you can point to paragraphs in a United Nations climate negotiating text and feel they more or less match what most of the science says should become a reality.  Yet in Lima on Monday, it happened.  Our little revolutionary moment comes in a document with the memorable title “ADP 2-7 agenda item 3 Elements for a draft negotiating text” with its climate-busting section D (paragraph 13.2) outlining several possible long-term goals for a new climate change agreement. Here’s a taster from the document, as it was at 6.30am in Lima, on 8 December 2014. Parties’ efforts to take the form of: a. A long-term zero emissions sustainable development pathway:  Consistent with emissions peaking for developed countries in 2015, with an aim of zero net emissions by 2050; in the context of equitable access to sustainable development … Consistent with carbon neutrality/net zero emissions by 2050, or full decarbonization by 2050 and/or negative emissions by 2100;.... In this context “Parties” refers to countries which are signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Here in Lima, we are at a “Conference of the Parties” or COP. The document in question is what’s known as a negotiating text, and in this case it contains a whole grab bag of aspirational long-term goals.  Those I’ve picked out are just a few of the more ambitious ones. I understand these were pushed into the document by countries, including Norway, the Marshall Islands, Sweden and a grouping of countries consisting of Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Peru and Panama. It is a very early version of what, over the course of the next 12 months, will morph into a new global deal to be signed in Paris. While a year seems like a long time, it’s not in the world of UN climate talks.  As one Australian observer pointed out, there are only six weeks of negotiating time on the UN’s schedule between now and Paris.  But if language such as “full decarbonization by 2050” were to become a reality, it basically defines an end point for the fossil fuel energy industry as we know it.  During a media briefing, I asked Ruth Davis, of Greenpeace UK, how likely it was that a decarbonisation goal could survive.  I think we have to say to ourselves that the chances of this stuff staying in the text are down to all of our collective efforts in demanding that this stays in the text. This is not only civil society but also progressive businesses who have to make their voices heard in keeping this in the text.  The chances of this stuff surviving are dependent on the efforts that we collectively make to influence politicians to do the right thing.  What is in this “elements” document isn’t likely to be challenged or negotiated this week – that will be thrashed out next year.  As veteran climate negotiations watcher Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, explained: This text won’t be settled here. It is an options text that then needs to be translated into a legal text and it won’t be decided until the last night at Paris. So which long-term goal survives the end of the day we won’t know until a year from now. But there was incredible political momentum coming out of the climate summit in New York where about 60 national leaders endorsed the need for a long-term goal as part of the Paris agreement and that number is continuing to grow. We have more and more businesses, faith groups and unions speaking out – there is a momentum building around this and I think by Paris next year the chances of a strong goal staying in the agreement are probably much greater than they are right now. In an early evening briefing, climate scientist Dr Malte Meinshausen explained the 2050 decarbonisation date was derived from statements in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports. He said that from 2011, the world could afford to emit no more than 1000bn tonnes (Gt) of CO2 to have a good chance of staying below 2C of global warming (some poorer countries and low-lying states say the aim should be 1.5C). Meinshausen said:  At current rates we churn through 33Gt a year – 1000Gt divided by 33 means we have about 30 years left from 2011 onwards. Then the carbon budget will be exhausted.  At some point emissions have to go to zero, no matter what. There is no way around zero CO2 emissions. As long as we continue to emit CO2, the climate will continue to warm.  Not only does the decarbonisation proposal broadly match the kind of efforts climate change scientists say would be needed to avoid dangerous climate change, it also matches the level of ambition climate campaigners have been asking for.  The campaign group AVAAZ has a petition with more than two million signatories that also asks for decarbonisation by 2050. The campaign director of Avaaz, Iain Keith, told me: This isn’t a target that’s been dreamt up in Lima. All over the world, millions of people have backed the call for 100% clean energy, with grassroots campaigns rolling out in towns and cities everywhere to get emissions to zero. The world is waking up to the fact that a renewables revolution isn’t just possible, it’s inevitable. The options on the table for world leaders seem simpler in the context of a long-term goal such as decarbonisation by 2050. Either the goal survives or the world moves to a riskier and more dangerous future.  Whether or not some countries want to be responsible for facilitating that risk by killing a long-term goal to decarbonise, only time and many more late-night negotiations will tell."
"The creation of a world that exists only between two covers was not an entirely natural act for me. To tell the truth, I was driven to it by sheer necessity. In 2010, I was appointed Australia’s first, and probably only, climate commissioner. I never imagined a job that involved nothing more than informing people about the facts of climate change could be so contentious. Along with my fellow commissioners, I wrote reports and travelled the country, meeting ordinary citizens and answering their questions about climate science. Yet doing our jobs resulted in threats, abuse and real danger.  I knew I had to continue the work but, as things got nastier, what I really needed was a refuge. When even the location of my home became public, and my home life came under potential threat, it became clear that to find one, I’d need to invent it. So I started to create an imaginary world I could enter at will.  My first novel, The Mystery of the Venus Island Fetish, is set in a museum. Even in the real world, museums can be strange places. So strange that it’s almost impossible to embroider upon them. Bits of rocks, animals and people are arrayed there for purposes often only dimly understood by the public. But in times past they were even stranger – perhaps never more so than in the 1930s. Back then, Sydney’s Australian Museum found itself stranded on the edge of the badlands that were depression-era Woolloomooloo and Darlinghurst. How could a museum director (and I had been one for seven years) possibly keep such an extravagance as a museum going, while the streets surrounding it were filled with starving people? The 1930s exert an irresistible attraction for me, perhaps because I am fortunate enough to have family members who were children at the time, and whose childhood memories remain razor sharp. My dear Uncle Lou grew up as a street urchin in Darlinghurst, his Italian immigrant mother having died when he was eight. Through his eyes, and those of my other relatives, I found I could experience the sounds, sights and smells of the depression with exceptional vividness. My own life experience played a role in the development of my story. I am a member of the last generation of explorers and researchers who could really launch themselves into another world, right here on Earth. In the 1980s you could still cross that invisible line between the global civilisation of which we are part, and societies all but untouched by the outside world.  There were no GPS systems, no mobile phones. Just topographic maps of places like New Guinea made by aerial survey with extensive blanks and great areas marked “uncontrolled territory”. Back then, you set out on foot with 50 or so carriers and slogged through jungle for days until you reached a distant village or mountain, knowing that your contact with the outside world was well and truly severed. In the 1930s, of course, that “other world” was much closer. Uncontacted Aboriginal tribes still roamed Australia’s inland, and cannibals and head-hunters could be found in the Pacific. What, I wondered, would long immersion in such a society do, at a formative time in a young researcher’s development? Writing fiction felt very different in ways I cannot fully explain – like exercising a new set of muscles after long use of a different set. It didn’t feel like work, and nothing like writing non-fiction. My world of fictitious characters proved all-consuming, and I would return from it refreshed and revitalised, ready to fight on for a better climate outcome for future generations. So I suppose I should thank all those climate deniers, media goons and trolls for giving me a new string to my bow. Why write a comedy, mystery and judgment on my country all rolled into one? Simply because that’s how life is, at least to me. And why set my story in a museum? I have been a museum man all my life, from volunteering as a teenager through to my first job and finally as a director. I love the places and those who work in them. They are infinitely strange and full of paradox, eccentricity and mystery. Nowhere does there exist a greater chance of making an amazing discovery than in a museum collection. In Australia, treasures have been accumulating in some museums for nearly 200 years, and those who work in them live by a dictum: never throw anything away. I started out writing my novel with a sense of control. As I went on, however, I found my characters needed to do things. Things I did not always agree with. And in letting them lead I discovered a richer tapestry was being woven than I could ever have contemplated at the outset. I also discovered layers of meaning in museum curation I had previously ignored or skated over.  But the biggest surprise of all: things can be said more directly and powerfully in fiction than in non-fiction. A novel is a very good place to start a revolution. • The Mystery of the Venus Island Fetish by Tim Flannery is published by Text"
"Japan’s weather bureau said on Wednesday that an El Niño weather pattern, which can trigger drought in some parts of the world while causing flooding in others, had emerged during the summer for the first time in five years and was likely to continue into winter.  That marks the first declaration by a major meteorological bureau of the much-feared El Niño phenomenon, which had been widely expected to emerge this year.  El Niño - a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific - can prompt drought in south-east Asia and Australia and heavy rains in South America, hitting production of food such as rice, wheat and sugar. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) forecast last month that the possibility of an El Niño pattern forming this winter was higher than the 50% it had projected in its previous monthly prediction.  But on Wednesday it said that an El Niño had emerged between June and August, continuing into November.  “We can’t tell whether or not El Niño will continue until spring, but we can say that there is a higher chance of it continuing in the winter,” said Ikuo Yoshikawa, a JMA forecaster.  The Japanese weather bureau does not classify or predict the size of El Niño, he said.  Last week, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology said that climate models suggest El Niño weather conditions would occur over the next three months, although related weather patterns are already being witnessed.  The US weather forecaster also projected last week a 65% chance of El Niño conditions during the Northern Hemisphere winter and into spring, up from a 58% chance predicted early in November."

Greetings to all of you.   Now Lima was intended to be a stepping stone to the talks in Paris next year but it’s now hoped it will be the place where countries can put flesh on the bones of the vague plans that we currently have for a climate deal. Covering those talks for The Guardian is our US environment correspondent, Suzanne Goldenberg, and this is her view on the challenges and hopes for Cop20.   SG There are some pretty big obstacles all around. One, we have seen some encouraging signs ahead of the talks. The big three emitters, that would be the US, China and the EU have all pledged emissions cuts. These aren’t enough to keep us on a course for the 2C target, but they’ve made those pledges. However the other big carbon polluters, such as Russia and India and Australia, haven’t come forward with their commitments. So there’s that aspect of everybody has to get on board with this.   Another big potentially stumbling block is what is the shape going to be of this agreement? The US is pretty adamant that it cannot agree to legally binding targets because that would make any kind of agreement a treaty and the US knows from past experience it cannot get a treaty through congress; not least because [the] congress that’s going to be charge from January onwards when it’s seated is going to be a congress that’s dominated by Republicans who will not be in a frame of mind to back any action on climate change.   Well I have to say, you know I’ve covered a number of these and routinely in the last few days before the talks get under way there’s a downplaying of expectations. It’s like “Oh I don’t really think anything’s going to come out of this. Don’t hold your breath, we won’t get a deal.” And certainly that’s been the case because there’s been 20 years of these talks. But this time I do detect some optimism that there is a sense that things are moving quite well. And there’s a number of reasons for that. One, there was a UN meeting in September where you had all the leaders gathering to make pledges about climate action without actually being specific about those pledges. But that sort of created some sort of positive feelings surrounding the talks. Even more so you had those leaders seeing the spectacle of up to 400,000 people in the streets of New York City demanding action on climate change. So those leaders sort of got the hint that there is popular support for doing something on climate. And I think that has fed into a sense of momentum. Of course the US-China agreement just a couple of weeks ago has been another big boost.   And behind the scenes diplomats tell me that they also get a feeling that people are working more, they’re more prepared than they have been going into previous UN climate negotiations so they do get a sense that things are moving quite well, the level of preparation is quite good going into Lima and further down the line laying the groundwork for a final agreement in Paris.  LM That was our US environment correspondent, Suzanne Goldenberg, speaking earlier. Saleemul, way back in 2011 you came on to this programme, how has the mood changed since then?   SH I think the mood has changed quite positively as Suzanne has mentioned. Back then, particularly in Copenhagen when we tried to arrange a new deal, China and the US were the dissenting parties that hid behind each other and said they weren’t going to take action if the other doesn’t. That’s completely different now. The recent agreement between the two presidents to take action together from the two biggest polluters to me is a game-changer.   The momentum that we’ve had from the UN secretary general’s meeting in New York I think is also very positive and, as Suzanne says, the march in New York with 400,000 people, I was on that march myself, in the frontline of it, representing the Bangladeshi community who are the frontlines of climate change tackling, and there is a momentum, a positive momentum and that’s what we need to be building on in Lima to raise the level of ambition. Unfortunately, the pledges that we have both on the money front as well as on the mitigation or reducing greenhouse gas emissions front isn’t enough. They’re all in the right direction but they’re, neither of them are enough. And so the trick now is to up the ante in the level of ambition that everybody is willing to take here in Lima.   And I must say the first couple of days it is a very positive atmosphere here.   HM John, one doesn’t often use the word “optimistic” in relation to these matters, how optimistic do you feel?   JV I’m going to be the old misery guts because I fear that it’s not going to be as easy as they think. There’s a lot of official optimism especially among the rich countries, I mean they really are pretty gung-ho that there will be a deal done. They can’t really brook any obstacle, they’re pretty sure that they’re going to get everybody on board almost by the end of this meeting here. And then Paris in 2016 will be a relatively simple celebration of a deal. The reality is though the bar has been set so low that it’ll be very difficult for anybody not to sign up to it. And I just think that it’s all … a slight arrogance of countries to think that they can just push through something which perhaps is very unjust and unfair and go over the heads of some of the poorer countries, [which] may come back to bite them very, very hard later on.   HM I suppose we can always rely on you to pour cold water. Smita, we’ve had lots of headlines from the US with the agreement with China and the launch of the Green Climate Fund. Is there a sense that even there they want a deal done before we get to Paris next year?  SN I do think that these are all hugely encouraging signals. And John is right to point out that we’re getting these signals from a relatively low baseline in terms of where previous commitments to act on either mitigation or on finance have been. The commitments that we’ve seen announced have the potential to really represent step-changes in terms of the level of funding that is made available to mechanisms of the convention. Far from enough of course, but $10bn, which is the order of magnitude of pledges to the Green Climate Fund, would make it almost 10 times larger than the other financial mechanism of the convention, the Global Environment Facility. So that is a significant increase although, of course, relative to the scale of the challenge we’re trying to take on and the needs that countries have it remains a modest commitment.   I’d say similarly in terms of the indications we have around the level of impact of the sorts of commitments we’re seeing from China that you and the US announced, these do represent, if implemented properly, material increases and accelerations to the pace of mitigation that each of these entities would have to undertake. And I also think it’s worth recognising that all three of those countries in framing their mitigation pledges to date have expressed openness to wrapping up the ambition of those targets over time. And so in the spirit of continuous improvement that both Saleem has alluded to and John has made very clearly the case for being an imperative if we want to take this chattel. There are some indications that there is willingness to have that review and ramping up begin to take place.   MH John, why are you less optimistic? Is this almost a trauma from Copenhagen in 2009 because we know that ended in disaster and we lost a lot of time.   JV It did end in disaster. This has taken 22 years to achieve very, very little. Frankly, it’s a disaster in negotiations, in international negotiations that it has taken this long to get so little way down the road to anything meaningful at all. And we’ve got to understand, to me sometimes it seems that this is nothing to do with the environment, this is nothing to do with emissions, this is everything to do with global superiority, this is to do with getting advantage, of big power blocks getting advantage over others. And it’s very much obviously about the developing countries getting a fair deal. And at the moment I don’t think they are at all.  So I think it really won’t go quite as smoothly. The money is nowhere near the $10bn, $9.8bn which has been pledged so far, represents no more than the City of London bankers get in their annual bonuses every year. And this is supposed to be the start of a financial system which is going to see every developing country with a huge amount of money to spend. It’s just not there. And I think we’ll see the anger later on.   HM Saleemul Huq, is he right, is this too much about an international power play and not enough about the environment?   SH Well unfortunately that is true, I can’t disagree with John there. It is about power politics, and the rich and the powerful never, ever voluntarily give up their power and their wealth. And so it has to be extracted like teeth in a dentist chair. On the other hand let me add two other elements, maybe game-changers, which aren’t happening here in Lima but are happening in reality. Firstly, countries are realising that climate change is real. Even rich countries like the US are going to be impacted by climate change. They’re going to have to adapt to the impacts of climate change. The hurricane Sandy that hit the north-eastern coast of the US cost them $50bn. The drought in California cost them more than $50bn. These are not trivial amounts even for a rich country like the US. So climate change is a reality and they’re going to have to deal with it whether they like it or not.   JV You’re going to have to persuade the Republicans of that though aren’t you?  SH Well yes but that’s their problem, they’re going to have to deal with the reality of climate change whether the Republicans deny it or don’t deny it. And that is real. The effects of the droughts, the effects of the hurricanes are real on real people in the US. That they cannot deny. And that’s going to become ever more apparent to everybody. Even in the UK we had the floods last year, which in Bangladeshi terms was a trivial flood. You had £1bn worth of damage in the UK. These are not trivial amounts any more even for rich countries, at home the impacts of climate change. So this reality is a game-changer.  The other reality is that for many developing countries like China and India, who previously used to be reluctant to take actions, now that they’ve started taking actions they’re seeing that there are actual benefits in reducing their emissions and going on a cleaner and greener development pathway. And China is going to become the leader of this cleaner, greener development post-fossil fuel era. That’s a game-changer – where China goes, the rest of the world will go. And the US will come on board not because of climate change but to beat China; they cannot allow China to be the leaders of the post-fossil fuel global economy, which is where we are headed. So there are major actions taking place outside the arena of Lima in negotiations. So the negotiations are no longer the only game in town with respect to tackling this problem.   HM John, does that make sense to you?   JV It does. And I just notice from looking at the wires today that another huge typhoon is heading towards the Philippines and it seems to do this every year. And maybe in three days’ time much of the Philippines will be under water. At what point though does the reality of climate change actually spill over into action and that’s what we haven’t seen for 20 years. And how bad has it got to get really before countries really put their money and their politics where the reality is?   HM It’s funny you’ve mentioned the Philippines because of course you want all the major players at these kind of conferences but their chief negotiator, Yeb Saño, won’t even be there.   JV Well he was one of the moral leaders of these talks for the last couple of years and he’s put a lot of emotion in talks about how absolutely vital it is. He’s not there, we don’t know why exactly. We’ve tried to get him on to this show but he’s not answering. It seems that he’s been dropped as the chief negotiator for the Philippines and he’s sitting at home and we don’t know why, we don’t know what he’s done. Yeb has gone, we don’t know where he is and the Philippines have got a much weaker negotiating team this year.   HM Well they say transparency is the best disinfectant, so Yeb if you hear this get in touch with John and tell him what’s happening. Smita, we’ve talked a bit about Copenhagen and the fact that that ended badly. What have we learned since then that would make Cop20 be a more successful event than Copenhagen in 2009?   SN I think there’s a number of areas on which we’ve learned; and one is around really starting to do the homework at home that allows one to come to these international meetings prepared to make major commitments. Like Saleem says, at home we see an enormous amount of activity in developing countries in particular aimed at bringing climate change into the core of development trajectories. The process that needs to get under way to frame the kinds of commitments that countries can commit to internationally through INDCs [intended nationally determined contributions] as another major recognition of the need for there to be a real process of deliberation within countries that engages key stakeholders and politicians and the politics around the nature of the action that needs to be taken. My sense is that there is much more of a focus on implementation and what it will take to deliver adaptation and mitigation in practice in the lead up to this particular summit in Paris. And one sees that through the diversity of [voices] that are beginning to engage around the question of what they can do, which is reflected in some ways in the constellation of actors that engaged in the lead up to the secretary general’s summit in September. And also in this range of actors that are taking action in the context of this negotiation in the lead up to Paris.   I think the other area where we’re beginning to see some progress of course as I say is in terms of finance. Not just the financial mechanism of the convention but also this recognition that in order to achieve the overarching goals of achieving adaptation and mitigation we’re going to have to engage with the financial system as a whole and start to move overarching investment away from business as usual so that it is more compatible with low-carbon and climate-resilient approaches. And this is what some of the space and some of the new analysis that the standing committee on climate finance has done on the current state of play as investment and climate change explores in some depth, noting that it’s a challenge of greening investment as a whole, in addition to mobilising particular funding under the convention that can send the right signals and deliver the much needed support to developing countries.   HM You’re talking money there and it’s always a wise thing to follow the money, so let’s talk money. We mentioned the Green Climate Fund or GCF; America, France, Britain and Germany have all paid in but John is it enough?   JV Well it is moving in the right direction but the target was to get between $10bn and $15bn. So what they’ve got is absolutely the lowest possible bit to get on to the next step. I mean it’s reluctant. It’s as Saleem was saying this is teeth pulling nonsense frankly. It is so little money in the great scheme of things that it’s meaningless. And how they’re going to get it up to $100bn a year, which is what they’ve pledged to do by 2020, is another matter. So no formal mechanism has been out yet. And when it comes to the money that’s where the rich countries are going to squeal the most. And that’s where the developing countries are going to demand the most. And, for me, it’s a frightening signal of how little they want to give.   HM Smita, you’ve been looking at this a bit more closely, I think you’ve been working on an ODI [Oversea Development Institute] paper on how much climate funding various countries receive; what have you been finding out?   SN What we have found in looking at how iexisting climate funds work, it’s clear that in many cases they have been spending money in the places that need it on activities that can make a difference. But they have been much too small and much too constrained in their ability to take on the right kinds of risks and engage the right kinds of actors, the ones who are really making the investments that matter. And these are all spaces in which existing funds are going to need space to do more and better, and where new funds are going to have to demonstrate that they really can engage more effectively. And I think that again the signals are there, that this is moving in the right direction, but the demonstration needs to happen in order to build that political commitment to investing in these sorts of agendas and outcomes within contributor countries as well.   HM And is transparency the key? Is that how you are able to persuade those big countries that maybe they should come up with a bit more money?   SN Well I think transparency about how much money and what it’s achieving is absolutely key and having the stories around how this funding begins to help development finance institutions and developing country governments and investors do more on climate action is quite key there as well, having that evidence around what works. And what we find is there is a lot of good stuff happening but it’s just not big enough and it really needs to scale up and become more mainstream in shifting development trajectories.   HM Saleemul Huq in Lima, in addition to the Green Climate Fund you’ve proposed a kind of insurance scheme called Loss and Damage. Tell us a bit about that.   SH Well unfortunately all our efforts, as John as quite correctly pointed out over the last 20 years, has failed to solve the problem. Initially we were going to avoid the impacts of climate change by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. We agreed to do this 20 years ago with the Framework Convention on Climate Change but we didn’t do it. And then we have a certain amount of climate change locked in now; we are nearly 1C higher than pre-industrial temperatures and we are heading for around 1.5C inevitably and unavoidably. No amount of mitigation or reducing emissions is going to avoid a certain amount of impacts of climate change. And so we’ve been talking about doing adaptation; adapting to those impacts, particularly helping poorer countries who don’t have the technical and financial wherewithal to adapt on their own. And these are obligations that countries have taken on and rich countries have promised to pay but they’ve not been very good at fulfilling those promises that they’ve made to date.   But unfortunately neither mitigation nor adaptation has taken place at the requisite levels. So we now face inevitable losses and damages for which we cannot adapt. And they are primarily going to be in poor countries and so we now have to think about what happens when those damage occur. And to give you the starkest example, what are we going to do when the countries of Tuvalu and Kiribati, low-lying Pacific countries, actually go under water, which they inevitably will do over the many decades ahead in this century. It’s a brand new problem. It’s a human-induced problem not a natural-caused problem. And something we’re going to have to deal with in the climate change arena.  Last year in the Warsaw Cop we actually managed to come to an agreement on this, we created something called the Warsaw International Mechanism which we’ll try and figure out what to do. One of the options is an insurance scheme and they’re being tried in a variety of locations around the world including the Caribbean and in Africa, of paying some premiums now and then having insurance companies or reinsurance companies or conglomerates of the insurance systems then pay off when the damages actually do occur. This is just one mechanism or two but it is an issue that is now unavoidable. We are going to have to tackle it, and failure to tackle it will have unforeseen consequences for the rich for refusing to take action when they could have taken action. Then once the harm is done they really do not have any recourse from whatever reactions take place from those who are harmed by their inaction. And this is an extremely critical political decision that rich countries are going to have to make in order to avoid unforeseeable consequences in the future.   HM John Vidal, in London, you’ve been a bit sniffy about most things so far; what about this insurance scheme is this a good idea?   JV Well America and Europe hate the idea, they absolutely really, really don’t like it. It wasn’t their idea, it was Saleem’s idea, frankly. But I think as they come round it’s going to become a very, very important issue. It’s been picked up by all the developing countries, people see the wisdom in it, people understand how it could work. It needs obviously more flesh, it needs all kinds of different work done on it but the principles have been laid. And I suspect that we’re already having insurance schemes against food insecurities in Africa and things like that, it’s not a very difficult thing to do; and Saleem will know far more about this, but I suspect it will become a major issue over the next six-nine months and that America and Europe will be practically forced to set up some kind of major organisational something to handle this sort of thing.   HM Do you think they will if they hate it so much? Won’t they just find some way to undermine it or scupper it?   JV Everything’s a bargaining position and if it’s convenient for them to do it they will do it. And if they don’t have to come up with the money then they’ll do it just like that.   HM Right, OK real politic at all times. So, John, we’re hearing a lot about the deal that was hammered out between the US and China recently; just give us a flavour of what that was about?   JV Well it sounded very, very impressive. America pledged to cut its emissions between 26-28% – based on that it will be 26% – by 2025 on 2005 figures. Lots of figures there. Actually there’s not much that they’re going to have to do because their trajectory is in that direction anyway. [President Barack] Obama has agreed to that because he won’t get anything more through Congress or whatever, he knows that perfectly well. So this is the safest figure which he can get. China has agreed to peak its emissions by 2030. This is absolutely key. This is what America was pressing for, for so long, to stop China effectively just growing and growing and growing its economy over the next 20-30 years. It’s managed to get them down to 2030. Again China, they’re pretty well there anyway. My understanding is that this means that neither superpower is going to have to do very much at all. They won’t have any political problems at home and they’ll be able to get it through. It’s basically lower common denominated stuff. It sounds impressive but not actually in reality.   HM Saleem, we all heard about this deal between the US and China and not being so close to the detail it seemed like a good thing. Was it actually a good thing?   SH I think it was a good deal. It puts the two biggest polluters in the world, China and the US, together to try and solve the problem, which is moving in the right direction when they used to be moving in opposite directions to each other. That’s a good sign. So that’s putting positive momentum in the right direction. Unfortunately what they’ve promised to do is far from sufficient if we want to bend the curve of climate change, global warming, temperature rises to 2C which is where we want to go. In fact, the least developed countries want to go down to 1.5C. But even with the actions that the Chinese and Americans are promising we are still headed well above 3C, perhaps 3.5C. And so a lot more will need to be done both by China and the US as well as by everybody else. The good news is everybody wants to do things; the bad news is they’re not doing enough and they need to do a lot more.   HM Smita, it’s so complicated in the US isn’t it because whatever the Obama administration want to do in the time he has left is so complicated by the various arms of government and the Republicans. Can the US actually do any more do you think?  SN It’s a challenging scenario and the administration’s leadership on this issue is longer awaited and much needed. It is certainly going to be a challenge to convince the political actors that ultimately get to decide on these issues within the US that this is in their interests. But in many ways it’s worth coming back to some of the points Saleem raised at the outset, on the new constituencies for action that we’re seeing emerge, including in the US. I think all politicians must have taken note of the 400,000 people that were on the streets of New York advocating for ambitious action including by the US. It is, as Saleem noted earlier, the US that has been horrifically hit by a serious of very extreme climate related events starting with Katrina, most recently hurricane Sandy – all of these things making the impacts of climate change that much less deniable for policymakers and the politicians that ultimately have to represent people affected by these problems domestically.   And I think it’s also worth noting, including on finance, that the US has in the past been a substantial contributor to climate funds and if the case can be made that this money is going to really make a difference and help poor countries and engage the private sector effectively those are arguments that may help, even on that very tricky agenda, keep support for continued action.  HM John, that’s the politics that Obama will have to deal with. But in China is there any politics they have to deal with; what’s the driver there?   JV I think the driver is the direction which they are taking anyway. And they’ve seen with their air pollution, they’ve seen with the civil unrest which is coming with so many of their industrial urban centres that they need to really clean up their cities. And that actually means cleaning up the climate as well. So it’s not actually very difficult for them to promote these ideas. They’re pushing at an open door, if you like, I think there’s no problem there. They are cutting back on coal, they are ramping up, as Saleem says, the renewables, they’re well ahead on the solar – they are really showing the way, I mean globally and in production and in action themselves. So I think that they’ve chosen a politically convenient figure which America can agree with, but China will go its own way.   HM Well this is very important but it’s also really dramatic and of course every drama needs a baddie and perhaps the baddie at Cop20 will be Australia. Last month, we heard the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, try to hijack the talks. There has been talk there about what Australia will have and what it won’t put up with. What are you expecting from them?   JV Well Australia is a sort of wild card now isn’t it? Canada was as well. Russia has been. Then you’ve got some of the Latin Americans – Venezuela and Bolivia and Ecuador have their own reasonings. So these climate talks are always dramatic. There’s always a wonderful finale, there’s always drama. And that’s what makes them, that’s what grips the world – can they fail yet again? But I do think that there will be many hiccups along the way. Australia is just this week’s bad boys. Next month there’ll be another one I can guarantee.   HM Smita, what will you be looking for in terms of how the various countries behave; do you see an uber-baddie emerging, will that be Australia do you think?   SN There are a lot of countries that have some major obstacles that they need to overcome in order to be able to get us to the deal that we need to. Australia’s position has been really unhelpful of late which is a shame because I think in the past Australia has actually been a really constructive actor on climate change including on finance issues. And in the past extreme climate-related events within Australia have driven home the imperatives for action and past administrations have seen that. I think in terms of what it’s going to take to get us all to a more ambitious outcome, it does in many ways come down to confronting the reality, but embracing low-carbon and climate-resilient development means letting go of some of our old paths to development. And that means letting go of a lot of business as usual approaches which is how a lot of the most powerful countries have made their money. And that’s a big part of the new incentive regime that we need to create as one beds around low-carbon and climate-resilient approaches instead of the things that caused the problem.   HM Saleemul, how should they play it; how do the countries that really want to move forward and be positive about getting action persuade the countries that aren’t so positive and don’t seem so desperate to move forward?   SH Well I work very closely with one of the most vulnerable groups of countries, they’re called the least developed countries, nearly 50 of the poorest countries in the world, and they’re a focus group in the negotiations within the broader group of 77 and China which is the umbrella for all developing countries. And this particular group, the least developed countries group, have, by definition, the most to lose by inaction to tackle climate change because, as I’ve said, even a 1.5C temperature rise means a lot of damage and loss to these countries. And a 2C rise actually also means a lot of harm to these countries. So it’s in their interest to get a good resolution out of Lima and then Paris with everybody working together.  So what these countries have now been able to do and are doing is arguing firstly that everybody needs to take action so the old mantra that developing countries will be given a free pass is now over. And the good news is that China, India, Brazil and the large developing countries are now prepared to take actions. They need to do a lot more than they have pledged to do so far and that’s going to be the trick, to persuade them to do that in Lima.  The other side of the coin is the promised funding to the least developed countries. Now there was some years ago; at the seventh Conference of Parties in Marrakech in Morocco in 2001 the rich countries set up a fund called the least developed countries fund for these least developed countries. And they prepared the adaptation plans of action that they were required to do, went to get them funded, it takes a total of in the order of $2bn to fund all the actions that they proposed. But the rich countries have only come up with less than half a billion dollars to do that. These are trivial amounts of money as John has pointed out. But they haven’t even given that.  And so this sort of lack of delivery on pledges made has a sense of bitterness for the poorest countries in particular which makes it very difficult for them to believe pledges and actions that are taken by rich countries. Nevertheless they are pushing forward for a fair and ambitious deal, ultimately in Paris but lay the groundwork for that here in Lima. And as I said the mood is good whether or not people can be moved to take the kinds of actions and pledges that are going to be required at the levels that are required. So the mantra here, if you like, or the test is going to be are the pledges adequate to solve the problem? So far they’re not. And we hope that we move towards adequacy as we go through the next few days here in Lima.   HM OK. We’ve talked about the intricacies but I’m going to ask you all to turn soothsayer and give me some idea of what you actually think will happen. You’re all experienced hands and so you know how these things tend to play out. So I want to get from each of you just some sense of how you think things are actually going to play out. John Vidal, I’ll start with you.   JV Well cops are like herding cats. It really is very, very difficult to get any kind of agreement by the end but they will, they will. You can guarantee that the UN will pummel or pommel through some kind of stitch-up deal. It may not be exactly what the rich countries want; it may not be exactly what the LDCs want, but it will be something. Because like it or not they have got to get an agreement in Paris next year. The whole UN system, as far as I can see, will collapse if it fails again. So that’s why the bar is so low, that’s why there will be arm twisting, there will be bullying, there will be aid offered, they’ll be all manner of things to get people aboard in the right way. What we’ll get at the very end I suspect will be a deal but it may not be the deal that anyone really wants.   HM Smita, is that how you see things, we’ll get a deal but it might not be the deal that we were hoping for?   SN I’m not sure there is such a thing as a perfect deal when you’re looking at an issue as complex as climate is and the range of interests that have to be accommodated. Ultimately, what the convention process can do is send a signal that this is a hugely important policy issue. That the international community is going to rally together to help realise and I think that if a deal can send signals to that effect and offer the need for ambition to continue to be increased and further to be accountability for increased ambition and scale of action then that would be very encouraging, and I think that’s within the realm of the possible.   HM What is your prediction though; do you think that they will get that deal?   SN I think that by Paris there is a high likelihood of us getting a deal that commits to increasing ambition over time.   HM OK. And Saleemul, what do you think will happen by Paris, will there be a deal that you can, being a reasonable man, that you can be happy with?   SH Well deals are always compromises. So one of the characteristics of any kind of deal is that it should leave everybody unhappy because if somebody’s happy then it’s not a fair deal. So we will get some kind of a deal and I will be unhappy with it because it will not be sufficient. But if it’s in the right direction then that would be at least going in the right direction. And as I said actions speak much more louder than the words that we negotiated in the UNFCC. It used to be the case that this was where the action is. The action is no longer in the framework convention talks. The action is on the ground. Countries are actually doing things and I cited the case of China and India and other countries on mitigation; but I’ll cite the case of my country, Bangladesh, on adaptation; Bangladesh is putting in about a half a billion dollars of its own money into a national strategy on climate change action plans. They’re not waiting for the world to come to their rescue, they’re going ahead and tackling the problem because the problem is on their doorstep and they have to tackle it. This will be the case for all countries as we go along. Reality will overtake these talks and the talks will become redundant. The talks are good to have an agreement on where we all want to go together and hopefully they’ll be binding enough for us to be able to hold each other to account; but actions on the ground are going to speak a lot more louder than these kinds of talks that we have in Lima and in Paris.   HM So we go forward to Cop20 hopeful but realistic. My thanks to all our guests: John Vidal here in London; Saleemul Huq in Lima; and Smita Nakhooda.

"South American diplomats expect to make progress towards a global climate deal at this week’s UN talks in Lima, despite growing criticism from NGOs that governments in the region are backtracking on pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the environment. Senior officials from the host, Peru, and biggest regional emitter, Brazil, told the Guardian they aimed to help negotiators draw up a draft agreement specifying measures to prevent global warming reaching catastrophic levels.  The draft is expected be finalised and signed at at conference next year in Paris. It will be legally binding and applicable to all signatories, though levels of responsibility to reduce greenhouse gases will vary from nation to nation depending on their level of development. Before that, however, a great deal of work has to be done at the UN conference of the parties (COP) in Lima, where Latin American countries will need to play an important role. Peru as hosts and Brazil as an influential player at previous climate summits are in a strong position to bridge the differences between the major emitters – China, the United States and the European Union – and to bring on board developing countries. “The only way to succeed in Paris is by having a strong outcome here in Lima,” said Peru’s minister of environment Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, a green activist for 30 years who will chair the conference and has led his country’s outreach preparations.  “We developed a plan to have the COP to show the world that we, as Peru and as a Latin American country, can facilitate this very big and complex process.” Peru is a member of the AILAC bloc of six Latin American nations who are pushing for aggressive emission cuts not only by rich countries, but by big emerging economies such as China and Brazil. The member states – also including Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Panama – are neither very rich, nor very poor and most sit close to the equator, hence their claim to represent the “beautiful middle” in the talks, between the extremes of north and south. However, they have often been criticised for failing to match international words with domestic deeds.  Peru has come under fire as a country where some of the worst deforestation of the Amazon is taking place as a result oil drilling, gold mining, illegal logging and land clearance for farms. It has also been censured as the fourth most deadly country in the world for environmentalists. Not helping its reputation was the government’s move earlier this year to strip the environment ministry of power to name nature reserves and set air quality standards. Pulgar-Vidal denied that his ministry had lost any of its authority, but he acknowledged that one objective of the COP meeting in Lima is to raise awareness of the need to develop without emissions. “What we want to do is to leave a legacy which gives Peru the opportunity to continue growing in a very sustainable way,” he said. Latin America has taken several steps towards regional integration in the past decade, but when it comes to climate negotiations, differences are more apparent than similarities. In contrast to AILAC, the other regional bloc is the ALBA group of left-leaning countries, including Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Cuba and Nicaragua. They have been among the most vocal critics of the current process on the grounds that it puts too much pressure on poorer nations. However, ALBA’s often disruptive tactics may also be influenced by the fact that most of the members are either oil exporters or beneficiaries of heavily subsidised oil from Venezuela. During past disputes, Brazil has often stepped in as an honest broker. It has no regional affiliation in climate talks, preferring to line up with the Basic group of big emerging economies – and emitters – including China, India and South Africa. Although Brazil is an oil power, it’s abundant hydro resources greatly reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. Brazil’s climate diplomats have secured breakthroughs on severe occasions. They were the first to come up with the funding mechanism to help poorer countries deal with climate mitigation (and give them an incentive to support emission cuts). They have pushed the idea of historical responsibility and their interventions were credited as crucial in securing a positive outcome from the Durban talks in 2012. This time, they have proposed a formula of “concentric differentiation” that sets out three main bands of responsibility: rich developed nations in the centre with large mandatory emission cuts, poorer nations on the outside with zero obligations and great flexibility, and emerging economies in the middle with a basket of options for significant voluntary reductions. Brazil’s lead negotiator, Antonio Marcondes, said the proposal was drawing strong support.  “The rationale of this is to overcome stumbling blocks on differentiation by devising a dynamic system to drive ambition upwards over time,” he said. “It’s the talk of the town.”  But while Brazil remains admired for diplomatic finesse, its overall strategy and level of commitment are increasingly questioned by critics, who see President Dilma Rousseff as a leader with a shallow commitment to the environment. Under her predecessor Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil put in place effective measures to reduce the speed of Amazon clearance and set ambitious voluntary targets for deforestation. Since Rousseff – a former head of oil giant Petrobras – took power, however, the controls have been weakened, deforestation is once again on the rise, more hydropower plants are planned in the Amazon and the government has approved its first coal-fired plant in nine years.  Carlos Rittl of Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental NGOs, said Brazil was now hiding behind the gains it made in the past rather than pushing ahead with more ambitious climate policies involving greater investment in wind, solar, ethanol and biomass. “We haven’t really taken climate change as a development issue. It is seen as marginal,” he said. “It is not a priority for Dilma. She does not seem to realise the risks and opportunities for our economy.” Others point out that Brazil has yet to announce new targets to reduce emissions, making it a laggard in comparison to China, the US and EU – all of which have recently declared more ambitious goals. There are suggestions that Brazil’s commitment to a deal next year is wavering. “Unfortunately of late they have been sending mixed signals about Paris. At times they have signalled that countries shouldn’t necessarily finalise the agreement in Paris – that Paris is the beginning, not the end of the negotiation. In particular they have not been as clear on pushing for countries to propose their climate targets early next year.  “After the China announcement and the likely Indian one early next year that position puts them outside the mainstream of their emerging economy contemporaries,” said Jake Schmidt of the US-based National Resources Defence Council. Diplomats insist such criticism is unfair. Brazil, they say, is in the process of a national consultation to set revised targets, which will be announced before the internationally agreed deadline next year. Regarding deforestation, they say the recent uptick is a blip in a long term trend of decline. “What we have been achieving so far shows our unabated political will. We are right on target,” said Marcondes. “The trajectory of our voluntary commitment shows very clearly that we are reducing emissions much more than many developed countries ... We came here to positively move the process forward to ensure we come out of Paris with an enhanced climate regime.” "
"A new paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters by Griffin & Anchukaitis concludes that the 2012–2014 drought in California was its most intense in at least 1,200 years. The study used drought reconstructions from tree-ring cores, from the North American Drought Atlas (NADA) and from cores Griffin & Anchukaitis collected from blue oak trees in southern and central California. Blue oak tree ring widths are particularly sensitive to moisture changes. According to Griffin,  California’s old blue oaks are as close to nature’s rain gauges as we get The study compared today’s drought conditions in California to those reconstructed over the past 1,200 years using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), an estimate of available soil moisture. The data showed that California is experiencing its most intense drought in over a millennium, the current event is the most severe drought in the last 1200 years, with single year (2014) and accumulated moisture deficits worse than any previous continuous span of dry years … In terms of cumulative severity, it is the worst drought on record (-14.55 cumulative PDSI), more extreme than longer (4- to 9-year) droughts. What’s interesting is that the blue oak data showed that while precipitation levels in California have been low over the past 3 years, the levels haven’t been unprecedented. But at the same time as California has been getting little rain, it’s also experienced record hot temperatures. It’s the heat that’s pushed the drought into unprecedented territory. Griffin & Anchukaitis concluded, temperature could have exacerbated the 2014 drought by approximately 36% … These observations from the paleoclimate record suggest that high temperatures have combined with the low but not yet exceptional precipitation deficits to create the worst short-term drought of the last millennium for the state of California … Future severe droughts are expected to be in part driven by anthropogenic influences and temperatures outside the range of the last millennium. Another new paper also published in Geophysical Research Letters by scientists at the University of California, Irvine likewise recognizes the extreme and unprecedented nature of California’s current drought, and focuses on the risks that these events pose in the present and future. Despite the well-recognized interdependence between temperature and precipitation … little attention has been paid to risk analysis of concurrent extreme droughts and heatwaves … We argue that the global warming and the associated increase in extreme temperatures substantially increase the chance of concurrent droughts and heatwaves. As the authors note, at issue is the fact that humans are causing temperatures to rise. Thus although droughts will always happen naturally, as studies have shown, they’ll become more intense in a warmer world. The combination of dry, hot weather will create bigger risks for Californians. Climate scientist Michael Mann nicely summarized the ways that humans may have contributed to the current California drought, In fact, there are at least three different mechanisms that are potentially relevant to the connection between the 2013/2014 California drought and human-caused climate change.  There is (1) the impact of climate change on the pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) off the west coast. One recent study suggests that climate change favors an SST pattern in the North Pacific that increases the incidence of the atmospheric circulation pattern responsible for the current drought.  Then there is (2) the marked decrease in Arctic Sea Ice due to global warming. Studies going back more than a decade show that reduced Arctic sea ice may also favor such an atmospheric circulation pattern. More recent work by Jennifer Francis of Rutgers provides independent support for that mechanism.  Finally, there is (3) the effect of global warming on soil moisture. All other things being equal, warming of soils leads to greater rates of evaporation and drying. This mechanism leads to worsened drought even if rainfall patterns are unchanged. There’s been some confusion about the human influence on the drought because two studies published this year didn’t find a connection to the lack of rainfall. However, as Mann noted, those studies did not consider the three mechanisms listed above. They were incomplete. On the other hand, two other studies that considered the first factor did find a connection. A high pressure ridge sitting of California’s coast for several years (known as the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge” for its persistence) has been a primary factor contributing to the low levels of precipitation. The ridge has pushed storms north of California, leaving the state dry. A study led by Noah Diffenbaugh at Stanford used modeling and statistics to find that these sorts of persistent high-pressure ridges are more likely to sit off California’s coast in the presence of high levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Another paper published this year by Simon Wang and colleagues similarly concluded that human-caused global warming is changing conditions in the Pacific Ocean that make these high-pressure ridges off the coast stronger, thus intensifying droughts in California. In short, it appears that humans are contributing to the strength of high pressure ridges off California’s coast, which will tend to reduce the amount of precipitation in the state. High temperatures exacerbate these dry conditions by increasing evaporation, soil dryness, and water demand. According to Griffin & Anchukaitis, the record heat intensified the drought by about 36%, leading to exceptional drought conditions unprecedented in the past 1,200 years. The drought alone is anticipated to cost California over $2 billion this year. On top of that, heat and drought also create conditions ripe for wildfires; another major problem for California. As expected, California also saw an intense wildfire season in 2014, blowing well through its firefighting budget. Now that the state is finally seeing some significant rainfall in December, those wildfires created conditions conducive to flooding and mudslides. As a major agricultural producer, this extreme weather in California impacts the entire country and world. However, it’s also giving us a glimpse at the risks we all face if we fail to curb global warming. Heatwaves, droughts, floods, wildfires, and other types of extreme weather are becoming more intense due to human-caused global warming. The longer we wait to cut carbon pollution and slow global warming, the more extreme our weather and its impacts will become."

"There’s just a hint of modern-day alchemy about Emily Cole and her company, Liquid Light. Their goal is to take carbon dioxide – the abundant, odourless pollutant largely responsible for global warming – and turn it into the raw ingredients used to make plastic bottles, face cream and wood glue. Converting a pollutant into “plastic gold” may sound too good to be true, but she and her colleagues have already proved the technique works in the lab and are now scaling it to commercial size.  “We are opening up the door to a low-cost feedstock,” says Cole from her office in Monmouth, New Jersey. “Carbon dioxide is low cost relative to oil and gas. We are taking a pollutant and converting it into something that people use in everyday lives.” The technique developed by Liquid Light needs a relatively pure source of CO2. The CO2 gas pouring out of factory and power stations chimneys from the burning of fossil fuels is perfect. The process uses an electrode coated with a catalyst (a substance that causes a chemical reaction without itself being affected), electricity and a source of hydrogen such as water. The first step of Liquid Light’s process combines two CO2 molecules into a single negatively charged molecule called oxalate. The second step uses different catalysts to create ethylene glycol, an organic compound used to make polyethylene terephthalate (pet) (the stuff in plastic bottles), polyester for clothing and antifreeze. According to Cole, a tonne of CO2 could create between 10,000 to 20,000 bottles. Because Liquid Light’s process takes CO2 and locks it up in products, it can be a net reducer of carbon in the environment if electricity from the sun, wind, hydro or nuclear are used in the process. Cole will not say what catalyst her company uses, for commercial reasons. However, she says the process is cheaper than conventional methods. Liquid Light is a spin out from Princeton University where Cole worked as a postgraduate from 2005. “We see ourselves as a chemical technology company that will license technology to manufacturers,” she says. “Ethylene glycol is a really good product to develop because it can be produced with a really good cost advantage in a very large market. “But we see a great future for this technology.” Using different catalysts, Liquid Light’s process can make acetic acid – a chemical in vinegar which can be used to make PVA glues or glycolic acid used in skin care products. “We have demonstrated the production of ethylene glycol at the laboratory scale, and now we are in the process of scaling up that technology. We will be commercial in the next three to five years and we will be making our first soda bottle this year in the lab.” She adds: “Maybe to the lay audience it does sound ‘out there’ that you take pollutants and the end product from the combustion of oil and gas and convert it back into products and chemicals. But most people are excited at the idea of taking a pollutant and converting it into something of use, rather than just burying it in the ground.”"

"A new study has found that when particulates from small volcanic eruptions are properly accounted for, volcanoes may be responsible for much of the slowdown in global surface warming over the past 15 years.   Sulfur aerosol particulates pumped into the atmosphere from volcanic eruptions cause short-term cooling by blocking sunlight. Until recently, climate scientists thought that only large volcanic eruptions had a significant impact on global temperatures. There haven’t been any big eruptions since Mount Pinatubo in 1991. However, studies published over the past few years have found that even moderate volcanic eruptions can pump significant amounts of aerosol particulates into the atmosphere.   Virtually all research into the climate influence of volcanic aerosols has used satellite measurements of particulates in the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere). These satellite measurements only monitor the volcanic aerosol at heights of 15 km and above. The new paper by David Ridley and colleagues studied the amount of volcanic aerosols in portions of the stratosphere that lie below 15 km.  To do this, the researchers combined data from satellites, ground-based instruments in the AERONET program, and from instruments on weather balloons. The study was co-authored by 17 climate scientists, including some leading experts in aerosol research. By combining all of these measurements, the scientists found that there is also a significant amount of volcanic aerosol in portions of the stratosphere below 15 km They concluded that for recent eruptions, between 30 and 70% of the overall amount of volcanic aerosol in the stratosphere has come from below 15 km. Since the year 2000, the study estimates that volcanoes have had a cooling influence on global surface temperatures. The likely range of this volcanic cooling influence lies between 0.05 and 0.12°C. As the authors of the paper note, this cooling influence is not taken into account in the climate model simulations incorporated into the latest IPCC report, The climate model simulations evaluated in the IPCC fifth assessment report [Stocker et al., 2013] generally assumed zero stratospheric aerosol after about 2000, and hence neglect any cooling effect of recent volcanoes Although the global surface temperature data have been within the range of model simulations, they’ve been towards the lower end of those model runs over the past 10–15 years.  The measured surface warming has been about 0.13°C less than the average of model simulations since 2000. The estimated volcanic cooling from this new paper (0.05–0.12°C), not included in those climate models, could account for most of that discrepancy.  Combine this with the approximately 0.06°C surface cooling due to more heat being stored in the deep oceans, and the slowdown is both fully accounted for and temporary. Climate scientists believe that ocean cycles will soon switch to a state in which less heat is transferred to the deep oceans, leaving more to warm the surface. How volcanic activity will change in the future is of course unknown, but volcanic aerosols have a relatively short lifetime in the atmosphere. If there are no more large or moderate eruptions in the near future, the amount of volcanic aerosol in the stratosphere should return to background values within a few years.  Given the record global surface temperatures we’ve been seeing in 2014, the slowdown may already be ending. In any case, it appears that climate models had difficulty accounting for the slowdown because they didn’t include either the increased volcanic cooling or unprecedented deep ocean heat storage, neither of which will affect long-term global warming. In short, when accounting for these changes in volcanic aerosols and ocean heat storage, the climate is generally behaving as scientists expect. We have little reason to doubt the very concerning long-term global warming projections from climate models."

"When I was growing up we watched the 7 o’clock news every night and would talk about the news of the day over the washing up. My parents wanted my sister and I to be able to think critically, as engaged citizens.  This inevitably led to fairly heated debate. My dad often jokes that “we wanted to teach the girls to think for themselves and we’ve regretted it ever since”. This grounding in my childhood home, with the understanding that “the personal is political”, led me to believe in the responsibility of citizens to shape the world around them.  During high school, my belief in the importance of being politically engaged played out in different ways. Like many young people, I campaigned at my high school to fundraise for development projects, I set up a stall to invite people to sign petitions about the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, I got involved in discussion groups on global and political issues. By the time I reached university I was working as a youth worker – I had all the wide-eyed optimism about winning hearts and minds that any lefty university student might be expected to have. When I was 21 I met a glorious man, David Pocock, who seemed to care even more deeply than I did about the world around him. It wasn’t hard to admire both his passion and integrity. I learnt a lot from his thoughtfulness and dedication. I like to think I taught him something about the importance of community and the stories of powerless people.  When we finally decided to get married, we had a ceremony but agreed not to sign the legal documents involved until same-sex marriage was made legal. In our vows, we committed to help each other engage with, and love, the world around us. Being able to work on a range of issues – from food insecurity in rural Zimbabwe, to LGBTI rights, to climate change – alongside Dave has been a joy, but also deeply challenging and distressing. The kinds of stories we have heard from folk all over the world who struggle with these issues makes my determination to carry on all the greater, even if receiving hate mail from right-wing Christians assuring us we’re going to burn in hell becomes a little tiresome.  There aren’t too many things to celebrate in all this, but one great moment came a couple of years ago when Australia finally decided to introduce a range of policies designed to address climate change – not least of which was a big increase in investment in renewable energy.  In the past year or so I have been particularly discouraged by the retreat of the federal government from climate change action and its simultaneous spruiking of our extractive fossil fuel industries. Despite thousands of Australians showing real moral leadership on climate change, we now have a prime minister who declares that “coal is good for humanity” and wants to double our coal extraction. It’s not just locally I’ve been disappointed; consider the countless global climate summits that have produced no comprehensive action or binding targets. This left Dave and me with a troubling question: what can we do when we are rendered powerless by normal political processes? In many countries, the power of big business and mainstream media means that the voices of citizens are drowned out, and even their ability to make informed decisions is limited by the power of a small minority of wealthy, powerful people.  Our shelves at home are lined with books about people throughout history who have used civil disobedience to overcome situations of grave injustice. The actions of one my heroes, Rosa Parks, sparked a mass wave of civil disobedience across the US which ultimately led to the reform of segregation. In the face of what the UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon calls “the greatest collective challenge we face as a human family”, we decided that nonviolent direct action was the best way for us to make our voices heard.  And so we added our voices to more than 290 others who have been arrested at Maules Creek, and to countless others across the world – from the Skouries forest in Greece, to the farming village of Pungesti in Romania, to those of Canada’s First Nations who continue to protest the Alberta tar sands project. On Friday afternoon we drove for eight hours from Canberra to Narrabri to join the Leard Blockade. On Sunday, we walked onto the Maules Creek mine site and were arrested with six other Canberrans and local farmer, Rick Laird. It’s a terrible situation, with so many folk whose lives will be disastrously affected sidelined by appeals to brute economic rationalism.  My protest is fundamentally about my role as a citizen, about my commitment to engage with and love the world around me. My hope is that the action Dave and I have taken will help create a fairer future for people like Rick Laird and his kids, and for all of us who are faced with the reality of climate change and our government’s inaction. My hope is that more Australians will begin to raise their voices and realise the power they have to stand against a government so obviously on the wrong side of history."
"It was the agreement that everyone wanted, yet no-one much liked. This year’s annual UN climate change conference in Lima, Peru, finally concluded in the early hours of Sunday morning, more than 24 hours after the scheduled close, after fierce argument in the final days.  Negotiators from 196 countries patched together a compromise which keeps the show on the road towards to a new global climate agreement in Paris next year, but in doing so left almost everyone unhappy with one element or another.  Many of the critics, however, have missed the point. The Lima deal is weak in many respects. But it also represents a fundamental breakthrough in the shape of the global climate regime.  The Lima conference had two goals. The first was to agree an outline text of the 2015 Paris agreement.  This was achieved – but only by creating a huge 37-page document which includes every possible option which countries may want to see in next year’s deal. Taking to heart the old maxim “why do today what you can put off till tomorrow?”, delegates parked the text early in the conference and did not attempt to negotiate between the options. That process has been left to the five sessions of talks scheduled for 2015, starting in February. Given the divergence between the positions included, it will be a huge task to make the draft fit for conclusion in Paris in December. The second goal was to agree the rules under which countries must bring forward their national commitments – or in the jargon, ‘intended nationally determined contributions’ (INDCs) – during 2015.  Here the compromises were sharply felt. Developing countries wanted these contributions to include plans for adaptation to climate change as well as emissions cuts, and for developed countries to include financial support for poorer nations. They got no commitments to new money, and inclusion of adaptation plans will be optional, not compulsory. Developed countries wanted all countries to provide standardised information on their emissions targets and plans, to ensure transparency and comparability.  The key elements were agreed, but only in the form of guidance, not as requirements. The EU and the United States’ proposal that countries’ plans be subject to some kind of assessment was dropped from the final text. But the aggregate effect of all countries’ plans will be calculated, allowing evaluation next year of whether the world has done enough to limit average global warming to the agreed goal of under 2C. (It will almost certainly have not.)  For many of its critics, particularly in the environmental movement, these compromises have made the Lima agreement too “bottom-up” in form. It gives countries too much latitude to make whatever commitments they want, relatively unconstrained by a common set of rules imposed “top down” by the agreement. Such critics worry that this will make it harder to get countries to cut emissions further when it becomes clear that their collective efforts are not enough, and may even allow some to use irregular accounting methods.  What the Lima agreement does do, however, is end the longstanding division of the world into only two kinds of countries, developed and developing. Ever since the original UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed in 1992, countries’ obligations have been defined according to their level of development in that year. The rich so-called ‘Annex 1’ countries have had compulsory obligations, while poorer ‘non-Annex 1’ countries have simply been required to make voluntary efforts. Over the last twenty years that binary distinction has looked more and more obsolete, as the larger developing countries such as China and Brazil have emerged as economic superpowers and major emitters of greenhouse gases. For this reason, the developed world has long wanted to break down the “firewall” between the two historic groupings, and replace it with a form of differentiation between countries’ obligations more in keeping with the modern world. But the developing countries and China have insisted that it must remain.  No longer. The Lima agreement creates obligations on countries but makes no mention of the distinction between Annex 1 and non-Annex 1 groups. Rather, it uses a new phrase drawn from the recent agreement between the US and China, that countries’ responsibilities will be based on “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in light of different national circumstances.” The firewall has been breached. In theory, the Lima agreement on INDCs does not determine the shape of the long-term Paris agreement. So there will no doubt be another fierce battle next year over this issue. But the vast majority of developing countries – including China and Brazil – are happy with the new regime. So it is impossible to imagine now the simple “two groupings” model of the past being restored. And those countries which opposed it know it. That was why the final two days in Lima were so fiercely fought.  The Lima conference has shown just how hard the negotiations in Paris next year will be, despite recent optimism about global progress. But one highly significant decision has effectively now been made. It paves the way towards an agreement which all countries, including the US and China, can sign.

"The Abbott government has been accused of setting impossible requirements for Australia’s participation in any global climate change agreement clinched in Paris next year by insisting it must include legally binding emissions targets. Experts say the Paris agreement could require countries to enshrine their new post-2020 greenhouse emission reduction targets in domestic law but that any attempt to include those targets in the legally binding international treaty itself would drive away the world’s two biggest emitters – the US and China – and ensure that the process failed.  The foreign minister, Julie Bishop – who has revealed Tony Abbott knocked back her first request to attend the current preparatory meeting in Lima, Peru, and who is now to be “chaperoned” at that meeting by the trade minister, Andrew Robb – has said a Paris agreement must include binding targets. If it did not it would “amount to nothing more than aspirations”, she said. “It seems like they are trying to set impossible conditions so that they can portray a successful Paris agreement as a failure,” said Frank Jotzo, associate professor at the Australian National University’s Crawford School. “Legally binding instruments can build confidence that countries will act on the commitments they make internationally. However, the legal form of an international agreement does not determine its effectiveness. The most binding treaty will do little to address climate change if some major emitters like the US and China do not participate.” The former Labor government’s expert adviser on climate policy, Professor Ross Garnaut, said the government should “forget about” the idea of a legally binding treaty if it really wanted an effective climate outcome from Paris. “A comprehensive legally binding agreement is not possible because that is not what the US does,” he said. “It is rare for the US to bind itself on anything. Woodrow Wilson was unable to get the US Senate to support membership of the League of Nations that was the creation of the United States.  “President Obama has made it clear that he will not support US participation in a legally binding agreement, and that instead the US has made a serious domestic commitment to implementing the ambitious objectives embodied in the Xi-Obama Agreement. China will not enter a legally binding agreement if the US does not. So forget about it. “A legally binding agreement is of no value anyway, as, while it may be legally binding, such an agreement is not enforceable. Look at Canada’s walking away from its legally binding Kyoto commitments … and there is no evidence that countries are more likely to deliver on notionally legally binding than on domestic political commitments. “Kyoto” refers to the Kyoto protocol which included countries’ greenhouse reduction commitments up to 2012. The government’s own independent advisory body, the Climate Change Authority, said in a report: “One thing the Paris meeting will not deliver is a universal, prescriptive, enforcement-oriented legal agreement, similar in form to the existing Kyoto protocol. For one thing, such an outcome is not achievable in the short term.  “Insisting on it would likely be counterproductive and lead to more modest global action. The value of the Paris outcome will be its effect on emissions and efforts over time, not its particular legal form.” The government has unsuccessfully sought to abolish the Climate Change Authority. The deputy director of the Climate Institute thinktank, Erwin Jackson, said Australia’s insistence on legally binding targets was setting the process up for failure. “Any agreement signed in Paris will be binding but the individual national targets almost certainly won’t be,” he said. “It may be that countries are required to enshrine their targets in domestic laws, but to suggest the targets need to be part of an internationally binding commitment is to set up an impossible requirement because it would ensure that the United States, China and probably India would not be able to participate. “The test of a country’s commitment is whether it is prepared to pass domestic regulations to curb its own emissions. The United States and China have done that.  “Australia is going in the opposite direction. Its Direct Action policy contains no binding limits on emissions. This discussion about the need for legally binding international commitments is just a distraction and would be the worst possible thing for a successful global climate agreement.” The government is also under fire for refusing to make any contributions to the Green Climate Fund, to which President Barack Obama pledged $3bn during his trip to Brisbane for the G20 summit. The government says it already pays for climate adaptation and mitigation through its foreign aid budget. It has not provided figures for that contribution and the budget document on the aid program contains passing references to a program in Tuvalu. Australia sent no minister to last year’s international climate talks in Warsaw, Poland. It is believed that Robb’s job is to make sure Bishop does not go too far in committing Australia to climate action, and that Bishop is very unhappy at being accompanied. Australia has said it will unveil a post-2020 emissions reduction target before the Paris talks, but most observers believe the Direct Action policy would struggle to deliver deeper cuts than the 5% reduction promised by 2020.  Under the former Labor government Australia provided about $200m a year to the so-called “fast start” program for climate change assistance to developing countries but that spending has been cut."
"It is a disaster hidden from the environmental leaders gathered inside the walls of a military compound in Lima on a mission to fight climate change. Over the last few months – as Peru helped guide the United Nations climate negotiations – five separate oil spills along a main oil pipeline through the Amazon have spewed thick black clots of crude across jungle and swamp and carpeted local fishing lagoons with dead fish.  Inside the climate summit fortress – as in much of the world – the oil spills in the jungle went largely unnoticed. But for the indigenous peoples living downstream in clusters of tin-roofed and thatched houses on the banks of the Marañón river, it’s been a season of sickness and fear. The first big breach of the pipeline occurred on 30 June, near a village known as Cuninico. “I never knew what crude oil was, and then suddenly we saw it floating down the river,” said Melita Bela Celis, who lives in the village of San Pedro, a Kukama Indian community. What came next was a series of illness that struck three of her five children: headaches, nose bleeds, nausea and stomach aches. Bela blames the ailments on exposure to oil in the water and in the fish that are the main staple. “Everybody in the village got these symptoms,” she said. On 16 November, the villagers heard of another pipeline breach over the radio, one even closer to their village. A week or so later, Bela’s second-oldest son, Ever, 17, and another villager, Piero Castillo Chanchari, 22, took a canoe into the village’s customary fishing lagoon. On a good day, the villagers say they can find up to 30 species of fish in the lagoon. But what Bela and Castillo saw on that day left them shaken: a dead capybara (the world’s largest rodent), coated in crude and floating belly-up in the fishing ground that had been the villagers’ main source of food. “You could smell oil, and the leaves on the bank were black,” said Castillo. A little further upstream, the dead and dying fish were packed so closely together you could almost walk on them. “I could never imagine anything like that,” Ever said. “It was scary. I felt sad.” As host, Peru is eager for success at the climate talks now underway in Lima. Last week, the government pledged to get off oil and generate 60% of its electricity from renewable sources, such as wind and solar power, by 2025. But the Peruvian government is also aggressively promoting a rapid expansion of oil and gas operations in the Amazon – with devastating consequences for local indigenous peoples and the environment, as well as those very same global efforts to reduce carbon pollution. Illegal logging and forest clearance by oil companies now accounts for about two-thirds of Peru’s carbon pollution, according to researchers from the Carnegie Institute for Science.   Since 30 June, there have been five separate breaks associated with Petroperú’s main northern pipeline. The pipeline, the North Peruvian, runs for more than 850km from San José de Saramuro in Loreto department, cutting across Amazon jungle and the Andean mountains, before emptying into a refinery at Sechura Bay on the Pacific coast. Two of the spill sites, at Cuninico and the 20-km point on the pipeline, are only a few miles apart and are clearly visible from the air: large splotches of black amid the expanse of green trees and the brown coils of the Marañón. Nearby, the state-owned oil company has put up blue-tented camps for clean-up workers. Peruvian officials estimated the first spill at 2,000 barrels. The most recent spill was several times larger, the villagers say. The company, in a briefing paper prepared for the energy commission on 26 November, called the most recent breach an “assault”, or an act of sabotage. But indigenous peoples and campaigners reject the charge. They say the Peruvian regulators and the state-owned oil and gas company have not done enough to maintain the pipeline, which dates from the early 1970s. “The pipeline has been neglected for 40 years. It doesn’t have the capacity but they use it anyway,” said Alfonso López Tejada, leader of the Kukama development association which represents more than 60 communities. He said this stretch of the pipeline runs beneath the fast flowing waters of the Marañón, making it even more unlikely villagers could successfully attack the structure. “The company doesn’t even want to recognise that this is affecting us,” López said. Foreign oil companies have been operating – and fouling – this part of the Peruvian Amazon for more than 40 years. At times those activities have directly threatened the lives of indigenous peoples living in the Peruvian Amazon. Oil companies have cleared forests to build roads and helicopter pads. They have cut down a vast swathe of the Amazon for pipelines and other installations, and they have pumped the hot, muddy, toxic waste directly into the rivers. The Norwegian government pension fund – the world’s largest – dropped its holding in the Spanish firm, Repsol, on the grounds that the company’s operations in the Amazon posed an unacceptably high risk to isolated indigenous tribes. However, Repsol later sold its holdings in that area of the Amazon. Since 2008, oil developments have increased at a dramatic pace after Lima offered up 75% of the Peruvian rainforest to oil companies.  The state-owned Petroperú as well as Argentinian, British, Canadian and French firms have all ramped up the hunt for Amazonian oil.  “This is an area which was already devastated by the oil companies and what the Peruvian Government has done is just increase the devastation – increased the exploration, increased the production, increased the devastation in this area of the Amazon,” said Anders Krogh, chief Amazon campaigner for the Norwegian Rainforest Foundation. The campaign group works closely with the Kukama and other indigenous peoples in the Peruvian Amazon. In June, the government lowered maximum fines for environmental crimes by 50% to welcome oil and gas investors, and barred the environment ministry from sole authority over nominating nature protection areas. “These kind of changes in environmental legislation are first and foremost to protect the oil industry and ensure the oil industry can go on as they want – in the run-up to the COP [Conference of the Parties, the Lima climate summit] they do that,” Krogh said. In recent years, the Peruvian government has declared environmental emergencies in all four headwaters of the Amazon. For the people of San Pedro and other villages, however, such declarations offer little in the way of consolation. Despite the oil company’s assurances, the villagers don’t trust the fish that were once their livelihood, and they do not see how they can carry on. “We can’t go on living here,” said Melita Bela Celis. “They say the oil will last for 30 or 40 years. We can’t eat the fish any more, so what will we live on for all those years?”"
"Australia has been named the worst-performing industrial country in the world on climate change in a report released at international negotiations in Peru. The climate change performance index ranked Denmark as the best-performing country in the world, followed by Sweden and Britain. Among the world’s top 10 emitters, Germany was ranked the highest at 22. Australia was second bottom overall, above Saudi Arabia – which was not classified as industrial. The report states: “The new conservative Australian government has apparently made good on last year’s announcement and reversed the climate policies previously in effect. As a result, the country lost a further 21 positions in the policy evaluation compared to last year, thus replacing Canada as the worst-performing industrial country.” China, the world’s biggest emitter, was in 45th spot – one below the US, which is the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases that cause climate change. But in an indication of the challenge facing governments to increase their ambition, the report said if every country in the world performed as well as the highest-ranking countries global temperatures would still likely rise more than 2C – a level considered to be dangerous. For that reason the top three places in the ranking were left blank. The CCPI report, produced by the thinktank Germanwatch and Climate Action Network Europe, covers the top 58 emitters of greenhouse gases in the world and about 90% of all energy-related emissions. Jan Burck, report author at Germanwatch, told the Guardian: “It is interesting that the bottom six countries in the ranking – Russia, Iran, Canada, Kazakhstan, Australia and Saudi Arabia – all have a lot of fossil fuel resources. It is a curse.  “The fossil fuel lobbies in the countries are strong. In Australia they stopped what were some very good carbon laws.” The report was released within the confines of the UN climate talks in Lima at the start of the second week of negotiations. The talks are aiming to establish the draft text of a new international climate change agreement to be signed by all countries at the next major talks in Paris in late 2015. The index covers the performance of countries across five areas – the level of emissions, the trends in emissions, energy efficiency, renewable energy policies and the approach to climate change at national and international levels. Denmark was becoming a model country, Burck said, with the report praising the country’s “ambitious renewable energy and emissions reduction policies”.  The report said Denmark “sets an example in how industrialised countries can not only promise, but also implement effective climate policies”. Erwin Jackson, of the Australian charity the Climate Institute, told the Guardian: “Australia has been heading backwards by undertaking actions such as attempting to kneecap the renewable energy industry through regressive policy changes.  “We also should be playing our fair part in global action, not trying to free ride on the actions of others.” He said Australia was “increasingly unprepared” for an emerging global shift to clean energy. Last month a UN environment programme report named Australia alongside Canada, the US and Mexico as the only countries that were likely to miss their current 2020 targets to cut emissions. The 2014 Emissions Gap report said the scrapping of Australia’s carbon price meant the country was “no longer on track” to meet its target to cut emissions by 5% by 2020."
"Mercedes Azevedo lost her house and 17 relatives when a mudslide triggered by hurricane Mitch engulfed her village in October 1998. More than 2,500 people died in the Casita Volcano tragedy, one of the worst in Nicaragua’s recent history. Now, 51-year-old Azevedo and her fellow survivors find themselves under threat from the weather once again. This time it’s too little rain, not too much. “I lost all my crops in the first harvest: three manzanas (5.2 acres) of corn and one manzana of beans. Everything, gone … I rent my land and now have debts I can’t repay,” she says, standing on the porch of the house in Santa Maria, Chinandega province, where she was resettled after the hurricane.   She’s not alone. A severe four-month drought during this year’s “wet” season hit agricultural production in two-thirds of the country’s 153 municipalities. More than 100,000 farmers were affected, according to official figures.  At the height of the drought, thought to be the worst in Nicaragua for 44 years, the government needed to provide subsidised rice and beans to stave off a hunger crisis. At one stage, it even advised people to supplement their diet by breeding iguanas for consumption.  “It’s been tough. We’ve had to substitute beans for rice, tortillas and potatoes,” says 49-year-old Julieta Bucardo, a shopper in the central market of León. “The price of beans, for example, reached more than 37 cordovas (£0.89) recently. At the start of the year, we used to think 15 was a lot.” When the prolonged drought eventually ended in late August, it did so with such violence that the government announced an emergency to cope with the flash floods. Only with the recent arrival of the year’s second harvest has the price of staple grains begun to fall. Nicaragua’s recent weather patterns will not surprise many climate scientists. The 2013 global climate risk survey (pdf) places the Central American nation of 6 million people fourth in its list of countries most affected by climate change. “The variability of the climate is starting to become an almost normal process, with long periods of drought and then floods,” says Germán Quezada, a climate specialist at Centro Humboldt, a Managua-based NGO.  “The problem is that the usual pattern of cultivation has been thrown up in the air. People just aren’t sure when to plant or what to plant,” says Quezada. “Small farmers are the worst hit because they don’t have the resources or irrigation that the large farmers have.”  A recent study (pdf) by the International Centre of Tropical Agriculture predicts that if temperatures continue to rise, Nicaragua could see its annual corn and bean production drop by up to 34,000 tonnes and 9,000 tonnes by 2020, respectively.  Nicaragua’s coffee industry is already counting the cost. The country’s second largest agricultural export earner registered losses of up to $60m in 2012-13 due to an outbreak of coffee leaf rust, which spread to 37% of the crop.  “Coffee leaf rust only used to affect farms below around 800 metres. With the changes in climate, we’re now seeing the disease reach as high as 1,300 metres,” says Santiago Dolmos, an agronomist with Cecocafen, a major coffee exporter. “Treating these kind of losses as an emergency situation is not the answer. It has to be part of a longer-term development solution,” argues Azevedo.  For Nicaragua’s agribusiness lobby, such a solution lies in the greater use of chemicals and more advanced technological inputs. Upanic, for instance, an influential industry group, held the country’s first conference on agricultural biotechnology in October.  Environmental groups are pushing for a different approach, arguing that the best defence against climate change is a more diversified, more ecological approach to farming. Their arguments chime with Nicaragua’s strategy for food sovereignty and security (pdf), which includes a law promoting organic and agro-ecological production. “Large-scale agriculture isn’t the answer,” argues Rafael Henríquez, a spokesman for Oxfam Nicaragua. “Ironically, it’s the poorest farmers that are closest to the agro-ecological model, although it’s more through necessity than environmental conviction.” The national roundtable for risk management in Nicaragua, an alliance of 20 smallholder organisations, is working to formalise these incipient, ad hoc efforts with research and training in best practice.  Nicaragua’s commitment to small-scale, ecological agriculture is by no means secure, says Martín Cuadra, a rural development expert at Simas, a Managua-based research institute and member of the roundtable. He points to loopholes in a proposed law on the registration of seeds that could open the door to genetically modified crops. “The effects of climate change combine with global pressures from agribusiness companies to introduce GMOs,” says Cuadra, who believes such a move would ultimately imperil smallholders’ freedom. “Those who control the seeds control the stomach. And those who control the stomach, control life itself.” "
"There was one thing above all others that wealthy countries wanted out of the Lima negotiations and that was a method of accounting for emissions cuts. The issue that mattered above all to developing countries was deciding who should carry the burden of emissions cuts, and getting the money flowing for climate aid.  For small island states, acknowledgement of “loss and damage” due to climate change was critical. All three contingents got what they wanted – sort of. The deal reached on Saturday afternoon was critical in keeping the talks on track. The US and the European Union had pushed hard for a text that would require countries to offer upfront information about the nature of their pledges to cut emissions – “clarity, transparency and understanding”. Wealthy countries also wanted a review process to ensure the pledges when they all come in would be enough to keep the world on course for two degrees of warming. But China especially had balked at providing detailed accounting of its emissions reductions plans, arguing that an outside review would amount to an affront to its sovereignty. The deal that emerged early on Sunday found a solution by changing a single word – “shall” to “may” – easing China’s concerns about outside interference. However, the US and EU still had the detailed language about pledges – and claimed it as a win. In the more than 20 years of climate change negotiations, developing countries have held on hard to the idea that it was the burden of wealthy countries to deal with climate change. In the parlance of UN climate negotiations, it’s called the firewall. America in particular has been determined to break down the wall, arguing that it is time for all countries to fight climate change. “The firewall issue is the most difficult issue. It is what the history of climate change negotiations has bequeathed to us. Countries that have grown and become wealthy cleave to it because it means they don’t have to do what other countries have to do,” said Ed Davey, the UK’s energy and climate change secretary. It’s not entirely clear the firewall has gone. The text includes the phrase “common but differentiated responsibilities”, the old official UN designation, but also a new phrase “in light of different national circumstances”, which reflects the current reality of China and other giants. Michael Jacobs, who served as climate change adviser to the former British prime minister Gordon Brown, said: “There aren’t two kinds of countries any more and that’s good.” In some ways, however, it’s the small island states that can claim the biggest win – by securing the inclusion of the words “loss and damage”. The phrase was introduced into UN discussions two years ago to draw attention to the fate of those island states drowned by rising seas. However, rich countries are uncomfortable with the designation because they fear it will open up a whole new category of financial obligation. In the draft circulated earlier on Saturday, there was no mention of the words at all. “It’s like a slap in the face,” said Saleemul Huq, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development. In the final text, “loss and damage” was back in, but without any specific commitments from rich countries. Still, the leader of Tuvalu told the negotiations he could live with the deal."
"Unusually tumultuous weather has swept parts of eastern Australia over the past week, with meteorologists warning that further storms, hail and rain are likely to return in the lead-up to Christmas. A severe thunderstorm battered Sydney on Sunday, leaving more than 10,000 homes without power as large hailstones rained down on parts of the city. Flights from Sydney airport were cancelled while the Tropfest short film festival was delayed after its venue in Centennial Park was evacuated. In Melbourne, lightning lit up the sky early on Saturday morning, with a thunderstorm preceding a weekend of gloomy weather for the Victorian capital. The storms come as Brisbane residents clean up from a “supercell” storm that caused damage that could cost up to $1bn. Hail damaged nearly 2,000 homes, while fallen trees have caused a problem for many households. Last week, Darwin suffered a widespread blackout for around five hours following lightning strikes. The wild weather, at a time when many Australians would be expecting calm, sunny days, is a result of two merging fronts, according to the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). A broad area of low pressure, stretching from central Australia to the south-east of the country, has been supplemented by a surge in humidity from tropical areas. “That combination has led to an unstable environment in the atmosphere,” Craig Burke, a BoM meteorologist, told Guardian Australia. “Other local effects come to play, but the overall weather pattern is unsettled and it has been stagnant for the past week now. It’s unusual that this weather has persisted for a week.” Burke warned that while there will be a short respite, the low pressure system will return later this week, which could bring further storms. “This system isn’t going to disappear and it’s going to be reinforced by another weather system approaching from the west,” he said. “We will have a rainfall scenario for the second part of this week. If you’re expecting it to be sunny, that won’t be happening over eastern Australia.” Inland Queensland, the Northern Territory, New South Wales and eastern Victoria are expected to see the worst of the returning showers and storms. The wild weather follows what was Australia’s hottest spring on record. The average temperature of 24C exceeded the long-term average, taken from 1961 to 1990, by 1.5C, according to the BoM. The world is on course for its hottest year on record, with the World Meteorological Organisation reporting last week that 2014 will eclipse 2010, 2005 and 1998 as the warmest year if November and December maintain the trend measured so far this year. “We’ll have to wait for the figures, but we certainly had our hottest spring here in Australia,” Burke said. “There are exceptions – they had one of the best ski seasons in 30 years in NSW for example. But when you look at the whole pattern, it has certainly been a warm one.”"

"Negotiators working on a deal to fight climate change have agreed on just a single paragraph of text, casting a shadow over the prospects for a strong outcome in Lima. The talks – scheduled to end at noon local time on Friday after 10 full days – are intended to provide a clear blueprint for a global agreement to fight climate change by the end of next year.  But while negotiators descended on Lima in a positive mood, buoyed by recent commitments from the US and China, the talks have fallen into a rut. “We are going backwards,” said Alden Meyer, who monitors the climate negotiations for the Union of Concerned Scientists.  Those at the talks still have every expectation that Lima will produce some kind of agreement by Friday evening, or more likely early Saturday morning – but the paralysis is in stark contrast to the upbeat backdrop to the summit’s opening. “I am not really sure that we will see a clear outcome coming here in Lima,” said the former Mexican president, Felipe Calderón, who addressed the meeting. By Thursday morning the text, which had started at a reasonable six pages, had ballooned to about 50, with negotiators throwing in their objections to almost every single clause. Just one section, paragraph 34, on countries intensifying engagement in the years up to 2020, has been agreed by negotiators. In a successful negotiation, observers say that by this point officials would be whittling down to the final text to a manageable size. “We have seen the laggards throwing in language of all kinds into the negotiating document,” said Tony de Brum, the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands. At this late stage, it was expected the Peruvian hosts will take over from the bureaucrats and take personal charge of the negotiating texts to reach a successful conclusion by Friday or – judging by the way events have unfolded in past meetings – somewhere in the pre-dawn hours on Saturday morning. At contention in the talks are the old dividing lines on how rich and poor countries should share responsibility for climate change: should all countries be required to do their bit to cut greenhouse gas emissions or only the industrialised countries? The US and Europe have argued for years that all countries must do their bit. China, which last month reached an historic agreement with the US to cut carbon pollution, India and other countries are balking at this. “You have got this weird dynamic where China has stood up with their president and president Obama and committed to putting forward economy wide commitments but their formal negotiating position is that those kinds of commitments shouldn’t happen,” Meyer said. There is also deep division about the next critical phase of a move towards a climate deal in Paris: the March 2015 deadline for countries to announce what they will do to cut greenhouse gas emissions after 2020. Developing countries are pushing the industrialised countries to include commitments to help poor countries deal with climate change. But the US and Europe argue it is impractical to expect commitments over climate finance in such a distant timeline. An additional sticking point is monitoring of those pledges. China in particular is opposed to an official audit of its pledges. “Essentially China is saying ‘we will show you our cards but don’t read them’,” De Brum said. The United Nations climate negotiations are by default a messy process. The task of herding 196 countries – rich, poor, oil producers or clean energy pioneers – towards consensus is never easy. However, negotiators always manage to produce some kind of a deal in the end. The risk for Lima however is that the deal could be much weaker than needed to curb warming to 2C above pre-industrial levels, the agreed goal of the talks. “One of the fundamental flaws of the negotiations is the lack of a clear global goal for limiting global warming based on science,” said Lidy Nacpil of Jubilee South Asia Pacific from the Philippines. “The Lima talks are setting us up to risk crashing that physical limit,” said Nacpil. “ If countries are not required to make legal contributions on finance and technology there will be no justice - and if there’s no justice there cannot be a deal.”  However, the meeting in Lima started in a buoyant mood, helped in part by pledges of nearly $10bn (£6.4bn) – including $3bn from the US – to the Green Climate Fund, a mechanism for rich countries to give financial aid to help the world’s poorest countries to cope with climate change."

"America and India will unveil joint efforts to fight climate change when Barack Obama visits New Delhi next month, as the US tries to keep up the momentum of international negotiations. Obama’s visit – on the back of the United Nations talks in Lima – is seen as a key moment to persuade one of the world’s biggest carbon polluters to step up its efforts to fight climate change.  After China and the US, India is the world’s third largest producer of the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change – although it is responsible for only about 6% of such emissions globally. During the visit, Obama and the prime minister, Narendra Modi, are expected to unveil a number of modest initiatives to expand research and access to clean energy technologies. The announcement in the works for Obama’s visit to Delhi will be modest in scale – nowhere near last month’s milestone agreement between the US and China to cut their carbon pollution. “I am expecting a useful meeting but we don’t have anything in the works of the kind that we were involved with in China,” Todd Stern, the State Department climate change envoy, said. But the visit still represents a key moment as major economies begin to deliver on the promises made in Lima to fight climate change. Under the deal, all countries are expected to announce by 31 March emissions reductions targets and other actions to fight climate change. With China already agreeing to cut its carbon pollution, and South Korea and Latin American countries paying into a climate fund for poor countries, the new all-inclusive nature of the Lima deal has put India under a spotlight. “Are we expecting from India too much and leaving the polluters without any accountability?” the environment, forest and climate change minister, Prakash Javadekar, said. “This is a big thing that developing countries are doing.” India is already understood to be working on its targets for the United Nations, but it will not put forward those numbers until June, Javadekar said. However, he added that India would make ambitious efforts. “We are doing very aggressive actions on our own. So we would like to put them on record and on public domain,” he said. Indian newspapers reported earlier this month that Modi was working to announce an “aspirational” year for peaking emissions ahead of Obama’s visit. Javadekar pushed back on that idea – and on the entire notion that India should be required to peak its emissions at all, arguing that its emissions still represented only a fraction of China’s. But he said that India was stepping up its efforts to deal with climate change, and was increasing its targets for expanding solar power and energy efficiency. “In the next two years, there will be major changes,” he said. He said Modi would press Obama to set up a global clean energy research consortium or make funds available for licences for clean energy technologies, perhaps from international climate finance. “They can compensate from Green Climate Fund to their companies,” Javadekar said. “Why should companies profit from disaster?”"
"From the delicious pleasures of a well-turned card trick to the obfuscations of media snake-oil salesmen, Robert Kenner’s documentary explores how big businesses have used sleight-of-hand to distract public attention from scientific fact in the battle for climate-change consensus. Building upon lessons learned by the tobacco industry, those free-marketeers with a vested interest in resisting emissions legislation (or, indeed, legislation in general) have conjured “doubt” from thin air in a concerted campaign of poisonous public prestidigitation. Unravelling the myriad methods through which ideology consistently trumps evidence (we see what we believe, not vice versa), Kenner flits between the enclaves of the Magic Castle in Los Angeles and the newsrooms of the world’s media, explaining how carnival-huckster showmanship has been used to make hard-and-fast scientific evidence of man-made global warming disappear before our very eyes. Hey presto indeed."
"Melting ice from the coast of Greenland could make a much bigger contribution to rising sea levels than has previously been thought, a new study suggests. Scientists believe a previously overlooked side-effect of global warming could greatly increase the rate of melting of the vast Greenland ice sheet.  The ice covers 1.7m sq km (656,000 sq m), an area three times the size of Texas. If all the ice melted and flowed into the sea, oceans around the world would rise by as much as six metres (20ft), causing extensive damage to coastal communities. While such a disaster is not expected to happen, ice losses from Greenland are predicted to contribute 22 cm (8in) to global sea levels by 2100. But the new findings related to lakes formed from melted ice and snow indicate that this figure may be significantly too low. The study shows that as Arctic temperatures rise, Greenland will develop a rash of these “supraglacial” lakes which are expected to spread much further inland. By 2060, the amount of land they cover could be double what it is today. One key effect the lakes have, once they reach a critical size, is to drain through fractures in the ice to reach the ice sheet base. Like a lubricant, the lake water causes the melting ice to slide more rapidly into the ocean. The lakes also have a direct impact on ice sheet melting because, being darker than ice, they absorb more of the sun’s heat. Lead researcher Dr Amber Leeson, from the University of Leeds’ School of Earth and Environment, said: “Supraglacial lakes can increase the speed at which the ice sheet melts and flows, and our research shows that by 2060 the area of Greenland covered by them will double. “When you pour pancake batter into a pan, if it rushes quickly to the edges of the pan, you end up with a thin pancake. It’s similar to what happens with ice sheets: the faster it flows, the thinner it will be. “When the ice sheet is thinner, it is at a slightly lower elevation and at the mercy of warmer air temperatures than it would have been if it were thicker, increasing the size of the melt zone around the edge of the ice sheet.” The scientists based their findings on observations of the ice sheet from European Space Agency satellites and predictions of future ice melting from a climate simulation model. Until now, supraglacial lakes have been restricted to a 62-mile wide low-lying band around Greenland’s coastline. At higher elevations further inland it has been too cold for lakes to form. The new results suggest that warmer temperatures will cause the lakes to spread up to 68 miles further inland by 2060, doubling the size of the area they cover. Leeson added: “The location of these new lakes is important; they will be far enough inland so that water leaking from them will not drain into the oceans as effectively as it does from today’s lakes that are near to the coastline and connected to a network of drainage channels. “In contrast, water draining from lakes farther inland could lubricate the ice more effectively, causing it to speed up.” The research is published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Professor Andrew Shepherd, director of the multi-institution Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM), who is also from the University of Leeds, said: “Because ice losses from Greenland are a key signal of global climate change, it’s important that we consider all factors that could affect the rate at which it will lose ice as climate warms. “Our findings will help to improve the next generation of ice sheet models, so that we can have greater confidence in projections of future sea-level rise. In the meantime, we will continue to monitor changes in the ice sheet losses using satellite measurements.”"
"The Church of England has challenged BP and Shell, two of the world’s biggest oil companies, to take responsibility for their carbon footprints and limit their contribution to global warming. The church will submit a shareholder resolution calling on the energy companies, which are two of the top five investments in its £9bn investment fund, to take action to “adapt their businesses over the long term for a low carbon economy”.  The intervention comes as ministers from nearly 200 countries prepare to meet next week in Lima, Peru, for UN climate talks to lay the draft text for a carbon-cutting deal next year, and as the church itself comes under pressure to relinquish its investments in fossil fuels. Edward Mason, the head of responsible investment at the Church Commissioners for England, said in a blogpost that, as shareholders, the church had a vital opportunity to influence companies’ climate change strategy. “We have chosen to file shareholder resolutions at BP and Shell because they have the biggest carbon footprints of all the companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, and they are yet to achieve A ratings (they are both rated B) [on the Carbon Disclosure Project’s ranking]. “Of course oil and gas companies have a particular responsibility because the fuels they produce contribute to climate change when they are burned,” he wrote. He said the resolutions were supportive, but would stretch the companies. “The idea is to give all of the shareholders of both companies the opportunity to signal that, like us, they want to see BP and Shell adapt their businesses over the long term for a low carbon economy. We want the companies to be sustainably profitable.” The church has come under pressure from campaigners, including the high-profile US author and activist Bill McKibben, to divest from fossil fuels. It has about £101m invested in Shell and £91.9m in BP. McKibben told the Guardian last month that the CoE was dragging its heels on divestment, even though it has been encouraged by the retired Anglican bishop Desmond Tutu. “Their response so far has been to say that they’ll study it until late 2015, which means they will have examined it for a period slightly longer than Jesus’s public ministry. It’s not exactly what Desmond Tutu had in mind,” McKibben said. In response to the church, a BP spokesman said: “We have had constructive discussions with CCLA [church fund managers] and are aware that they intend to file a resolution for our AGM in April 2015. We will carefully consider it and respond appropriately before the meeting.” Shell said it was not commenting on the church’s move, but in an article in the Times last month, the company’s CEO, Ben van Beurden, said that rising energy demand meant a “pragmatic” look at climate change meant recognising the world would need oil and gas into the second half of this century and beyond. He added: “As chief executive of a company that believes in the value of innovation, I also know that, collectively, we must give ourselves every chance of allowing technology to help [on climate change]. “Innovation is no silver bullet but, as we navigate what will be a decades-long transition away from a fossil fuels-dependent energy system, new technologies can play a crucial and transformative role. One example is CCS [carbon capture and storage] – capturing carbon dioxide from man-made sources such as power stations and storing it safely deep underground.” The resolution to be submitted by the church calls for BP and Shell to “direct that routine annual reporting from 2016 includes further information about: ongoing operational emissions management; asset portfolio resilience to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) scenarios; low-carbon energy research and development (R&D) and investment strategies; relevant strategic key performance indicators (KPIs) and executive incentives; and public policy positions relating to climate change.” Shareholders will vote on the resolutions next spring."
"For those of us fixated on whether 2014 will be the hottest year on record, the results are in. At least, we know enough that we can make the call. According the global data from NOAA, 2014 will be the hottest year ever recorded.  I can make this pronouncement even before the end of the year because each month, I collect daily global average temperatures. So far, December is running about 0.5°C above the average. The climate and weather models predict that the next week will be about 0.75°C above average. This means, December will come in around 0.6°C above average. Are these daily values accurate? Well the last two months they have been within 0.05°C of the final official results.   What does this all mean? Well, when I combine December with the year-to-date as officially reported, I predict the annual temperature anomaly will be 0.674°C. This beats the prior record by 0.024°C. That is a big margin in terms of global temperatures. For those of us who are not fixated on whether any individual year is a record but are more concerned with trends, this year is still important. Particularly because according to those who deny the basic physics and our understanding of climate change, this year wasn’t supposed to be particularly warm.  For those who thought that climate change was “natural” and driven by ocean currents, this has been a tough year. For instance, using NOAA standards, this year didn’t even have an El Niño. NOAA defines an El Niño as 5 continuous/overlapping 3-month time periods wherein a particular region in the Pacific has temperatures elevated more than 0.5oC.  Interestingly, we are currently close to an El Niño, and if current patterns continue for a few weeks, an official El Niño will be announced. But it hasn’t been yet, and if we do get an El Niño, it will affect next year more than this year. How could the hottest year have occurred then, when the cards are not stacked in its favor? The obvious and correct answer is, because of continued emission of greenhouse gases. As I write this post, I am attending one of the premier earth sciences conference, the Fall AGU Conference which is held each December in San Francisco. Thousands of scientists, including a large number of climate scientists are meeting, presenting, and sharing the latest research about our planet.  Here, among the experts, there is little fixation on the record. On the other hand, there was little fixation on the so-called “halt” to global warming that the climate-science deniers have been trumpeting for the past few years. The latest data paint a clear picture. The Earth is warming. The oceans are warming, the land is warming, the atmosphere is warming, the ice is melting, and sea level is rising.  These climate science deniers have had a bad year. It has been shown that in many cases, their science is in error and their understanding of the Earth’s climate faulty. This record temperature, according to NOAA, has made their life even more difficult. The so-called “halt” to global warming was never true in the first place, as I wrote recently. But now, a claim that global warming has stopped cannot be made with a straight face.  Of course, the science deniers will look for something new to try to cast doubt on the concept of global warming. Whatever they pick will be shown to be wrong. It always is. But perhaps we can use 2014 as a learning opportunity. Let’s hope no one is fooled next time when fanciful claims of the demise of climate change are made."
"In the early 1950s, my husband John Mead, who has died aged 89, was working in the registrar’s office at Durham University. Feeling emotionally and psychologically fragile, he sought help and was encouraged to see the bishop of Durham, Michael Ramsey (who later became archbishop of Canterbury). John thought that he might have a calling to be a priest; Ramsey, remarkably for the times, suggested that he should go into analysis. This, to quote John, “transformed my life”. John returned to London and went into analysis with William Kraemer. In 1960 he got a job with the National Coal Board, where he met EF Schumacher, author of Small is Beautiful and founder of the Intermediate Technology Development Group (now Practical Action); this was another turning point. His next job, after he had completed a psychology course at LSE, was as a lecturer in social psychology to nurses and social workers at what was then South Bank Polytechnic. While continuing his career, and after our marriage in 1978, he started to train as a Jungian therapist; in 1986 he took early retirement and established a private practice as a therapist.  John was born in Blackheath, south-east London, the youngest of three children of Lawrence, a barrister, and Violet (nee Tennent). His brother, Lawrence, the apple of the family’s eye, would later be killed in Burma in 1943. John was sent away to prep school at seven and then went to Canford school in Dorset. His family was transfixed by the events of the 30s; Churchill became a hero to John and the Munich Agreement was anathema to them all. When John left school in 1943 he volunteered to join the Royal Engineers. He was posted to India in 1945, between VE and VJ day, and enjoyed being a junior officer in the Sappers, building Bailey bridges and constructing culverts under roads in India, Malaya and Burma. In 1947 he went to Balliol College, Oxford, to read PPE. After graduating he got a job at Durham University. John’s final 20 years were dominated by the issue of climate change. Few visitors to our home in London escaped being drawn into a discussion, often heated. John was uncompromising, relentless and direct and he sometimes made people feel uncomfortable. We moved to Highgate, north London, from Balham, south London, seven years ago and together founded the Highgate Climate Action Group to raise public awareness locally about the threat of climate change and to highlight what needs to be done. John was an extraordinarily intelligent, thoughtful and sensitive man. His memory for poetry and prose was prodigious and he could produce an apposite quote for any occasion. His last few years were difficult, as he became increasingly frail, but he will be remembered with love by those who knew him. John’s sister, Ann, died in 1991. He is survived by me and by his niece, Sarah, and nephew, Andrew."
"Warming water under Antarctica’s ice shelves risks ice melting that could lead to a “worrying” rise in global sea levels, research has shown. Loss of the Antarctic ice shelves, which extend from the southern polar land mass over the underwater continental shelf, are likely to result in the glaciers behind them flowing more rapidly into the sea. That would feed more melting ice into the oceans, pushing up sea levels. Total melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which is close to the regions known to be warming, would raise global sea levels by 4.8 metres (15.7ft) - enough to have a severe impact on coastal populations. Professor Karen Heywood, from the University of East Anglia’s Centre for Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, said: “Although many of the large ice shelves buttressing the Antarctic ice sheet are not yet melting, the source of warm water seems to be getting closer, so these ice shelves could begin to melt in future which is worrying in terms of global sea level rise.” The scientists looked at data from oceanographic records dating back to 1960 and found that temperatures in the West Antarctic Amundsen Sea and the Bellingshausen Sea have risen significantly. For example, the temperatures of the warmest waters near the sea bed in the Bellingshausen Sea have risen from about 0.8C in the 1970s to 1.2C in 2010. “This might not sound like much, but it is a large amount of extra heat available to melt the ice,” said co-author Dr Sunke Schmidtko, from the Geomar Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany. The water around Antarctica was also getting less salty, which was a sign that freshwater ice was melting. Accelerated melting made it easier for big glaciers to slide towards the sea. Higher temperatures around Antarctica could also affect ocean biodiversity, said the researchers whose findings are reported in the journal Science. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) current highest estimate for sea level rises is (0.91 meters, or 3ft) by 2100."
"Over the weekend the New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory governments released amazingly detailed modelling of how climate change is expected to affect every part of the state. They’ve modelled changes in temperature, rainfall, fire weather (the forest fire danger index, or FFDI), and the number of hot days and cold nights down to 10km grids, for the year ranges 2020-39 and 2060-79, with midpoints of 2030 and 2070, compared to a baseline of 1990-2009.  The results show one of the most detailed pictures of climate change in NSW that I’ve seen, with modelling divided into seasonal snapshots as well as annual. Here’s a summary of the findings - I’ll be looking mostly at the annual, longer term projections for 2070, but you can click through to the link above and explore the results for the early period if you’re interested. Not surprisingly, by 2070 the state will be hotter, with maximum temperatures projected to increase by 1.8 - 2.6 degrees. Areas to the east of the Great Dividing Range will still be cooler, while western parts of the state will generally be hotter. The number of hot days (days over 35C) will increase significantly for areas in the north-west, with areas near Bourke and Moree particularly affected. The report says that by 2030, parts of the west are projected to experience an average of 12 more days above 35C per year and this will continue to rise to an additional 35 days per year by 2070. This map shows the change in the average number of days that are likely to have a FFDI over 50. The FFDI combines temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and the “drought factor”, which represents the effect of recent temperatures and rainfall on fuel availability. It’s used to determine those bushfire danger ratings you see on the side of the road. The west of the state is again affected more than the cooler east. The mean fire danger index is also projected to increase generally, as well, though again the effect will be felt on the western side of the Great Dividing Range. Seasonally, while there will be slight decreases in the mean FFDI for the more populated areas on the east coast, the mean FFDI is projected to significantly increase in spring. This is consistent with previous research suggesting a lengthening of the fire season into spring. Northern parts of the state are likely to receive significantly more annual rainfall, with only a smaller southern area from Canberra to the border to receive less rainfall. However, the change in rainfall isn’t going to be evenly distributed throughout the year, with many areas receiving less rainfall in spring, and some receiving less in winter: You can see detailed results for your own area with Adapt NSW’s interactive map."
"Australia is providing $200m to the international Green Climate Fund on the condition that it can dictate where the money is spent – something that appears to contravene the fund’s rules. Tony Abbott said Australia’s funding would be “strictly invested in practical projects”. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, said Australia was providing the money “on the condition it will be spent within the region for our priorities”. Asked on Sky News whether Australia would be able to dictate exactly where the money was spent, Hunt said Julie Bishop was going through that process but was “in a very strong position”. He said Australia was “very, very confident we will achieve the outcomes we seek”, having previously been concerned the money would disappear. But experts said Australia would not be able to determine exactly where the money went under present Green Climate Fund rules. The fund – which has so far attracted more than $10bn in contributions – is governed by a board that has full responsibility for funding decisions. At a meeting in October, the board decided broad guidelines (pdf) for how it would allocate the money. They included that contributing countries would have a limited ability to request that some of their funding went either to the “private sector facility” – which allows financing of private sector projects – or to government projects to reduce greenhouse emissions and help poor countries adapt to the impact of climate change.  But the rules do not appear to provide for countries to dictate what countries or projects “their” money would fund. Felix Fallasch, an international climate finance analyst at Berlin-based Climate Analytics, said the ultimate decision-making authority over any funding was exclusively with the fund’s board.  He said: “Contributors cannot earmark their funding for specific thematic activities … or in which region the funding will be disbursed … So yes, there will be allocations to Pacific countries and to the private sector but whether these allocations come from the Australian, British or Korean contributions to the fund is not traceable.” John Connor, the executive director of the Climate Institute thinktank, said the idea that funding would be provided on conditions was controversial and not settled. “Hypothecating the money you give is a big ask and will cause disputes. Other have tried, but most have simply said the governance needs to be right … not where the money is directed,” he said. “It is very much against the spirit of it for us to try to direct where every last penny goes.” A spokesman for the department of foreign affairs said Australia’s approach to the fund was consistent with the approach the US was taking. “We will begin discussions shortly with the GCF to formalise our pledge and will enter into an agreement once discussions have been completed,” the spokesman said. The Abbott government’s announcement on Wednesday that Australia would contribute $200m over four years from its existing aid budget to the fund represents another policy reversal. The fund is a body the prime minister had previously disparaged as a “Bob Brown bank on an international scale” to which Australia would make no contribution. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, formally announced the commitment at the United Nations climate summit in Lima, and Abbott suggested Australia would have the ability to determine exactly where its money went. “The pledge to the Green Climate Fund will facilitate private sector-led economic growth in the Indo-Pacific region with a particular focus on investment in infrastructure, energy, forestry ... and emissions reduction programmes,” he said. Hunt said: “We set the terms of our engagement and those of our involvement, and those terms are very clear: support for the Asia-Pacific, a focus on rainforests, a focus on combating illegal logging.” “The difference here is that we’re able to target what we’re doing to the region. So on our terms, in our time, in a way which protects the rainforests of the area, our priorities which don’t just help reduce emissions, but they protect the iconic species.” Bishop received applause when she made her announcement in Lima – a meeting the prime minister’s office initially refused to allow her to attend. The Climate Institute welcomed the Australian contribution as “the first step towards fair and proper financial support for poor and vulnerable countries responding to the climate challenge”. the Australian Conservation Foundation said the contribution was welcome, but the money should be in addition to the existing aid budget. At the G20 meeting in November the prime minister resisted mounting global pressure to commit to the fund, which is designed to help poor countries adapt to climate change. He argued Australia was already spending $2.5bn on its domestic Direct Action fund and providing $10bn in capital to a so-called “green bank” – which he is trying to abolish. Speaking in Melbourne, Abbott admitted he had “made various comments some time ago” about the fund but said “as we’ve seen things develop over the last few months” it was now appropriate for Australia to make “a modest, prudent and proportional commitment” in the interests of being a good international citizen. Asked about the fund before last year’s UN climate meeting in Warsaw, the prime minister said: “We’re not going to be making any contributions to that.” It was reported that at one of its first cabinet meetings the Abbott government decided it would make no contributions to the fund. At the time the prime minister compared it to a domestic fund championed by the former Greens leader Bob Brown, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which Abbott wants to abolish. He told the Australian: “One thing the current government will never do is say one thing at home and a different thing abroad. We are committed to dismantling the Bob Brown bank at home so it would be impossible for us to support a Bob Brown bank on an international scale.” The government also pointedly dissented from support for the fund in a communique from last November’s Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting – a stance backed by Canada. Canada also recently announced it would now be contribute to the fund. The fund plans to start providing small amounts of cash to developing countries before the end of 2015. Bishop’s office was contacted for comment."
"Saudi Arabia is encouraging the dramatic collapse of oil prices in order to damage the surging global clean energy industry, British entrepreneur Richard Branson has claimed. “They have done it before and it hurt. They don’t just want to damage the US fracking industry, but also the clean energy business. The collapse of oil prices is going to make it much more difficult for clean energy,” he warned, speaking from the Caribbean island of Necker.  But the British entrepreneur said that now was the time for governments wanting to reduce their carbon emissions to introduce a carbon tax on fossil fuel users because the tax would be cushioned by the fall in prices.“If governments want a carbon tax [at the climate summit ] in Paris next year, then it would be the best time. What the clean energy business needs is a gap between it and coal and oil.”   According to Branson, who part-owns Virgin airlines and has invested an estimated £300m in a succession of green fuel, solar and other clean-tech energy developments, the dramatic rise of renewables over the last few years has hurt oil producing countries as much as fracking. “Before the oil price collapsed, solar was actually cheaper [than oil]. If oil goes down to $30-$40 a barrel, then it will make it much harder for clean energy. Governments are going to have to think hard how to adapt to low oil prices,” he said.  Branson was talking ahead of the merger of his not-for-profit low-carbon thinktank Carbon War Room with the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI). The latter was set up in 1982 by the west’s most celebrated energy-theorist, Amory Lovins. The two philanthropic organisations that Branson and Lovins head are unique in that they both advise businesses and governments how to reduce carbon emissions. “We both bring something. Carbon War Room is bold and agile, RMI has the rigour,” said Branson, who said he would continue to support the new operation financially. In a joint statement, the two organisations said they planned to expand into China and elsewhere to transform carbon-based economies “with a combination of science, technology and a‘let’s do it’ business spirit”.  “We are closer than ever before to transforming the world’s economy to a lower-carbon trajectory. We need to accelerate demand and financing for low-carbon solutions, and quickly. We are both market-based, independent, nonpartisan, and working with technologies that are cost-effective today. We are excited by the role we have in what could be a historic economy-wide turning point for the world’s energy challenge”, said Lovins.  “The climate challenge is no longer one of only gloom and doom, sacrifice, caps and taxes, or having less. The world has advanced considerably since the failed Copenhagen talks of 2009. Despite the economic recession, there are more and more proven, cost-effective, low-carbon solutions that are technically feasible and economically profitable today under current policy. The energy costs of wind and solar are now on parity with fossil fuels in the Caribbean, Hawaii, Alaska, and other diesel thirsty regions,” said Lovins, whose organisation helped to retrofit the Empire State building to safe energy.  According to Lovins, the energy revolution is now in full swing, but many industries have not taken advantage of it. “The unsubsidised cost of electricity from the most cost-effective new onshore wind projects beats all other forms of generation. Solar PV modules have dropped in price by about 80% since 2008, while LED lights are 85% cheaper than five years ago. The integration of various clean technologies, like electric cars, batteries and solar panels, are mutually reinforcing the drive towards competitiveness.” “We believe this alliance offers the best philanthropic return on investment today, Our role will be a catalytic one – to drive business, industry by industry, to a tipping point where choosing anything but the clean option won’t make good business sense. Together, we will multiply our efforts to drive capital flow and reduce carbon by achieving industry-changing impact and international headlines that promote the breakthroughs and the pioneers achieving them,” said Jules Kortenhorst, who will serve as chief executive officer of the new organisation.  Lovins is credited with helping to kickstart the global renewable energy revolution with a series of academic and policy papers in the 1960s and 70s. Since then, the Rocky Mountain Instistute has advised many of the world’s largest companies and dozens of countries how to reduce bills with renewables and has challenged the giant car, aviation and construction industries to rethink the way they operate. But Branson and Lovins are expected to disagree on some energy matters. The businessman is a known advocate of nuclear power, while Lovins earlier this year called Britain’s plans to build a new generation of reactors as“unbelievable”. “Nuclear prices only go up. Renewable energy prices come down. There is absolutely no business case for nuclear. The British policy has nothing to do with economic or any other rational base for decision making.”, he said. "
"Australia may be able to increase its industrial emissions by 26% by 2020 and still easily meet its Kyoto protocol targets, new analysis released at the Lima climate talks suggests. The reason for the apparent anomaly is because it has secured a succession of advantageous deals on how land use is credited in carbon accounting rules, according to the Climate Action Tracker group.  Industrial emissions are likely to be 26% above 2000 levels in 2020, or 47–59% higher since 1990, the group claims in a policy briefing. But the research shows that Australia will be technically able to meet its legal Kyoto target, a 5% cut on 2000 levels by 2020. Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics, part of the Climate Action Tracker (CAT) group, said: “It has become increasingly apparent that whenever Australia has talked of committing to reducing emissions, what it really means is that it will continue to increase emissions from fossil fuel and industry sources.” Australian negotiators in Lima have been arguing against an amendment made two years ago in Doha about the exclusion of deforestation from the definition on emissions – a technical fight which could increase the emission reductions Australia needs to make by 2020 by a 2%. A decision on the issue has been deferred to June. According to CAT, Australia uses complicated rules around the way that land-clearing is included in the greenhouse gas accounting system – known as land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) – to make it appear that cuts will be met. Dr Louise Jeffrey, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and part of the CAT team, said Australia was not being transparent in the way it calculated and showed these emissions. She said: “Fully transparent data on Australian projections and estimates of future LULUCF emissions and removals are needed in order for the CAT to revise, improve and hopefully even reverse our estimates.” The analysis said: “Australia is set to increase its energy and industry GHG emissions over the next six years by 14-20% above 2012 levels, so that by 2020 its overall energy and industry GHG emissions are likely to be 49-57% higher than in 1990. Present emission levels are approximately 31% higher than in 1990.” CAT said during the Lima talks Australia had been working on the small print of the Kyoto protocol rules that would make it even easier for it to reach targets. Hare said the country had been going to “considerable diplomatic effort” to “hide” its true levels of emissions. He added: “This is just the most recent example of Australia lobbying for rules that undermine the integrity of the emissions accounting system as a whole and/or rules that carve out special exceptions to the detriment of all, but to the benefit of a few.” The two-week UN climate talks are scheduled to close in Lima on Friday with countries working to agree on a framework upon which they can make pledges to take action on climate change. During a speech to the conference yesterday, foreign minister Julie Bishop said Australia had “an ambitious 2020 target” which she said represented a cut of 19% from business as usual. “Our target is comparable to those taken by other developed countries,” she said."
"We need to understand the conditions of earlier eras to make sense of climate change data. But past conditions were complex; the Jurassic world was, after all, not an unbroken vista of volcanoes and steamy jungle. Timothy Myers, a palaeontologist at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, collected 44 samples of ancient soils, or paleosols, from parts of the Morrison formation in the US south-west.  Researchers may assume that soil type gives a good indication of the prevailing climate. The reasoning, here, was that New Mexico, as today, would have been more arid than Wyoming and Montana further to the north. Yet when Myers did the first detailed quantitative study, he found that mean average rainfall was 76cm (30in) for New Mexico and 114cm (45in) for north Montana, while being just 51cm (20in) in northern Wyoming. There were big differences even between adjacent sites. “The apparently sudden shift from dry to relatively wet environments over such a short distance was perplexing,” said Myers. Normally this sort of pattern would only occur on opposite sides of a topographic feature, such as a mountain range. Myers suggested that precipitation could have been highly seasonal at the Wyoming site, and this could have distorted the estimate for the total rainfall. The findings indicate significant local variation in the Jurassic era climate, so we must be wary of generalising about entire areas from single sites. “Regions with broadly similar climates can have internal differences, even over short distances.”"
"The federal government has pledged $200m over four years from its existing aid budget to the international Green Climate Fund, which Tony Abbott previously disparaged as a “Bob Brown bank on an international scale”. The announcement represents another reversal by the government. At the time of the G20 meeting last month the prime minister resisted mounting global pressure to commit to the fund, designed to help poor countries adapt to climate change. He argued Australia was already spending $2.5bn on its domestic Direct Action fund and providing $10bn in capital to a so-called “green bank” – which he is trying to abolish. The change of position was announced on Tuesday, as foreign minister Julie Bishop prepared to address the United Nations conference on climate change in Lima – a meeting the prime minister’s office initially refused to allow her to attend. Abbott and Bishop made the announcement in a joint statement. “The pledge to the Green Climate Fund will facilitate private sector-led economic growth in the Indo-Pacific region with a particular focus on investment in infrastructure, energy, forestry ... and emissions reduction programmes.” The pledge brought an immediate burst of applause at the UN conference.  “We have a strong track record in delivering climate finance,” Julie Bishop told the room. Speaking to reporters in Melbourne, Abbott admitted he had “made various comments some time ago” about the fund but said “as we’ve seen things develop over the last few months” it was now appropriate for Australia to make “a modest, prudent and proportional commitment” in the interests of being a “good international citizen”. “That money will be strictly invested in practical projects in our region,” he said. Asked about the fund before last year’s UN climate meeting in Warsaw, the prime minister said: “We’re not going to be making any contributions to that.”  It was reported that at one of its first cabinet meetings the Abbott government decided it would make no contributions to the fund.

Canada also recently announced it would now be contribute to the fund. The announcement also revealed that the prime minister’s department would take over the development of any post-2020 emissions reduction targets that Australia might make before next year’s United Nations climate talks in Paris. It said the review would take into consideration action by the world’s developed economies and Australia’s major trading partners. “Any new post-2020 target would be announced in mid-2015 after the taskforce has completed its work,” it said. Campaign groups broadly welcomed the shift in position - but still said that Australia could afford to do more.  “This can only be called a first step and falls short of its fair share,” said Kelly Dent, a campaigner for Oxfam Australia. Still, she said: “Australia’s pledge, just days after reports that they would not contribute to the fund, is an important message of support and a recognition of the country’s responsibility to act.” The Climate Institute think tank welcomed the Australian contribution as “the first step towards fair and proper financial support for poor and vulnerable countries responding to the climate challenge”. It said the amount fell short of the $350m a year the institute believed was a fair contribution from Australia. “However, the government has an opportunity to demonstrate its total climate finance contribution when it submits its plan to scale up climate finance to the international community early next year. “As part of this process, the government should outline how this contribution is in addition to the existing activities it is taking through the aid program and other bilateral activities.” The Australian Conservation Foundation said the contribution was welcome, but the money should be in addition to the existing aid budget. The G20 communique urged countries to make contributions to the fund – although the language was initially resisted by Australia. "
"Julie Bishop has intensified diplomatic efforts to avoid the Great Barrier Reef being deemed “in danger”, claiming any listing would set a “very dangerous precedent” that would affect other heritage sites around the world. Bishop, who arrived in Lima for climate change talks on Tuesday, will use the trip to escalate Australia’s lobbying of other nations to avert the Great Barrier Reef being downgraded by Unesco’s world heritage committee next year.  The committee, comprised of experts from 20 countries, will decide whether the reef, which has lost half its coral cover in the past 30 years, should be listed as “in danger”. Bishop said there is “no justification” for this to happen, warning it would have negative international ramifications. “It would send a message around the world that even if you meet all of the criteria set out by the world heritage committee, there is still a risk that they will place an area on the in-danger list,” she told the Courier Mail. “It would have significant implications for Australia but it would also set a very dangerous precedent for countries who don’t have the opportunity to take the action that Australia has.” Referencing the sustained campaign by green groups to highlight the declining state of the reef, Bishop added: “Every country that has an environmental icon that activists seize upon would be at risk.” At a meeting of the world heritage committee earlier this year, delegates “noted with concern” a plan to dump five million tonnes of dredged material within the reef’s world heritage area. That plan has now been reversed, with a new proposal to place the sediment on nearby wetlands. Unesco has also questioned port expansions beside the reef, as well as water quality. The Australian government has said it is properly managing both of these issues. The reef faces many other pressures, however, with a recent Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) report warning: “The overall outlook for the Great Barrier Reef is poor, has worsened since 2009 and is expected to further deteriorate in the future. “Greater reductions of all threats at all levels, reef-wide, regional and local, are required to prevent the projected declines in the Great Barrier Reef and to improve its capacity to recover.” The GBRMPA, the government’s reef agency, said climate change was the leading threat to the coral ecosystem, with pollution and a plague of coral-eating starfish also contributing to its deterioration. The government has put together a long-term plan, called Reef 2050, to protect the reef, although the Australian Academy of Science has criticised it for being inadequate to prevent further decline. Jon Day, who was director of heritage conservation at GBRMPA until July, said Bishop was mistaken in her analysis of the reef’s condition. “What it comes down to is whether the reef’s values are being lost and the government’s own report shows that they are being lost,” Day, who was at GBRMPA for 28 years, told Guardian Australia. “In the government’s strategic report, over half of the reef’s 41 outstanding values are showing a deteriorating trend and that is what the committee will address. “The GBRMPA’s report mentions climate change as the number one issue and yet the long-term plan mentions very little about climate change. The Australian government clearly sees an in-danger listing as embarrassing. We don’t just need business as usual here, we need to go beyond that in order to protect the reef.” Day said a commitment from Greg Hunt, the environment minister, to ban the dumping of newly dredged spoil was a “furphy” because it relates to the reef’s marine park, not its larger world heritage area that includes port zones. Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, said Bishop was guilty of “wishful thinking” over the reef’s condition. “Her claims are contradicted by her own government’s reports, which couldn’t be more clear that the reef is deteriorating,” he told Guardian Australia. “On one hand the commonwealth government is saying the reef is in poor condition and getting worse and on the other they are saying it’s the best-managed coral ecosystem in the world. Well, clearly it isn’t.” The government’s lobbying efforts over the reef have gone on for several months, with Hunt and Andrew Powell, the Queensland environment minister, reportedly travelling to Europe to explain why the in-danger listing should be avoided.  Unesco chief Irina Bokova told Guardian Australia last month that Australia had started to address concerns over the reef’s health. Dermot O’Gorman, chief executive of WWF, said: “We’re concerned that rather than redoubling efforts to save the Great Barrier Reef, the government is redoubling efforts to use diplomatic muscle to feed into the world heritage process. “We have been communicating the message, from scientists, that the reef is under threat. Rather than blame green groups for talking it down, there should be a focus on how to turn it around.”"
"As evidence of climate change mounts, businesses across all sectors of the economy are developing strategies for identifying and avoiding the risks it poses. Given the important role of freshwater in powering economic development and growth, and the vulnerability of our water resources, efforts have focused on the links between climate change, water and the corporate sector. For businesses, risk assessment has always been an important part of planning and operations. The failure to honestly and comprehensively assess risk can undermine production and profitability.  Extensive work has been carried out to try to evaluate water-related risks to businesses by organisations such as the Pacific Institute’s Corporate Sustainability Program, the UN CEO Water Mandate, Ceres, BSR, and others. In the past such work focused on water scarcity, the impact of extreme events such as droughts and floods, and the threat of contamination. More recently, an emphasis on how climate change will contribute to these risks has been added. A critical driver of success in the 21st-century economy will be how companies and investors balance the competing demands for water and other resources in a changing climate. The best scientific assessments on climate threats to water resources – including those from the the IPCC and the US National Academy of Sciences – suggest rising temperatures could pose the biggest risk. As demands for water by agriculture and ecosystems increase, water quality in lakes worsens and the loss of snow and ice to mountain regions speeds up. Changing storm patterns will influence flood and drought frequency and intensity, altering runoff in major river basins. Rising sea levels are already pushing salt water into coastal ecosystems and groundwater aquifers and threatening water-related infrastructure such as wastewater treatment plants. These risks will directly affect business operations. They will impact on the availability of raw materials, the reliability of supply chains, demand for products and financial returns. Declines or disruptions in water supply can undermine manufacturing operations where water is needed for production, irrigation, material processing, cooling, or washing and cleaning. Contaminated water supply can lead to higher costs for pre-treatment and the need for new investment in infrastructure. Changes in the quantity and timing of water availability are already affecting thermal and hydropower generation. And all of these challenges make companies more susceptible to reputational, regulatory, and financial risks – particularly in developing countries where local people often lack access to safe and reliable drinking water. These risks are more than hypothetical: beverage companies in India have already lost the licence to operate in some communities due to concerns about groundwater overdraft. Oil and gas producers have suffered financial and reputational losses (pdf) after contaminating water supplies in Latin America. A growing number of companies that source products from regions short of water are publicly disclosing their concerns about water-related risks in financial documents. Taken together, all of these factors present businesses with increased uncertainty about the future of water. 1. Measure and publicly disclose information on the use of water and energy throughout company operations, including through the supply chain. These resources pose risks and, unless they are measured and key metrics shared, those risks cannot be managed and reduced. 2. Assess physical, regulatory and reputational water risks associated with climate change. Explicit attention should be paid to understanding the potential impacts of climate change on local water resources. 3. Include these risks in your business planning and operations. 4. Engage others early. Water-management planning should involve everyone from employees and investors, to customers, local communities, the public and government. This can reduce misunderstandings and help corporations anticipate and respond to emerging issues. 5. Seek opportunities for partnerships. Because water, energy and climate are connected to social, political, cultural, and environmental issues, companies can rarely achieve the best management outcomes on their own. By pooling knowledge and resources, companies can respond to water and climate change concerns more efficiently and effectively than through individual actions. An online platform for water stewardship and collective action on climate resilience and adaptation already exist and are thriving. Climate change is now unavoidable, with severe risks to water quality and supply. No matter what our politicians and governments do to address emissions, all of society – including the business community – must prepare to understand and address the water-related challenges these changes will bring.

"Esidronio Arreola never gave much thought to the well that so reliably pumped water to his traditional clapboard house in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas. But one day in March, he opened the tap and all he got was air. Through the searing summer heat, the Mexican immigrant to California’s Central Valley and his family endured a daily routine of collecting water in his pickup truck from an emergency communal tank, washing from buckets and struggling to keep their withering orchard alive while they waited for snow to return to the mountains and begin the cycle of replenishing the aquifer that provides water to almost all the homes in the region.  But as more of Arreola’s neighbours in East Porterville, a ramshackle, low-income town in sprawling Tulare County, reported their wells running dry, and state officials warned that the most severe drought in living memory may well extend into 2015 and beyond, he realised he might not have water for years to come. So Arreola, who makes his living dealing in old fridges and washing machines from his garage, bit the bullet and borrowed the lion’s share of the $11,000 it cost to drill a new well four times as deep as his old one. In mid-November, seven months after the pipes went dry, water began flowing to his taps again. Arreola just doesn’t know for how long. Yet for all the difficulties, he considers himself fortunate. “We’re among the lucky ones. It’s weird to say that, but our old well was shallow and ran dry early – so, once we decided, we only had to wait a month for them to start drilling a new one. Now the waiting list is a year and I hear the price has gone to $17,000,” he says.“There are a lot of people who cannot afford a new well. Even if you drill one, you don’t know how long it will last.” At the other end of Tulare County’s 4,800 square miles, Chris Kemper is the principal of the poorest school in California: Stone Corral Elementary. The water supply to his entire small town of about 500 people, Seville, stopped in April when its collective well ran dry. “We had sponge baths, like in the army. Doing that for a week or two isn’t bad but for months – it’s difficult. Well, it’s awful. The school found it harder and harder to function. When the kids would flush the toilet nothing would happen,” says Kemper. “If you can imagine going to an underdeveloped country, it was worse. No potable water. It was a humbling experience. You figure you’re here in California, which is a rich state in a developed country, but you turn on the water and it comes out in drips.” The only supply for Kemper and his eight children through a scorching summer was bottled water delivered by the county’s emergency office. “We used that for bathing. We used it for washing our clothes,” he said. “It really made you manage your life differently. It changed how we think about water. You appreciate just how precious water is in our lives.” Eight decades ago, the worst drought in living memory helped drive hundreds of thousands of people from Oklahoma’s Dust Bowl to central California in search of work and a future toiling on the fruit farms that fill the San valley. It’s a part of the American epic immortalised in John Steinbeck’s bitter novel, The Grapes of Wrath. In time, many of the “Okies” were replaced by Mexican migrant workers as the Central Valley farms grew to produce up to half of the US’s fruit, nuts and vegetables. But now the 400-mile long agricultural basin of four million people is facing its own life-changing drought that, like the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, is hitting hardest those with the least. California’s governor, Jerry Brown, declared an emergency in January as 2013 was the driest on record in the state, and this year is little better. The federal authorities say more than half of California is enduring “exceptional drought” – the highest category. The state’s main reservoirs are at an average of only 40% of capacity. At the beginning of the year, John Laird, the state’s secretary for natural resources, told the US Congress in a letter that “California is experiencing the worst water crisis in our modern history. We are in our third consecutive year of below-normal precipitation and this year’s snowpack – on which 25 million Californians depend as the source of their water supply – currently is only 10% of what it should be. “As you know, California’s climate is such that it is generally dry for almost half the year – and we rely on rain and snow during the winter season to carry us through the year,” he wrote. “Conditions – in terms of both supply and quality – are unprecedented and serious.” A recent study for the National Science Foundation, a US government agency, found that the drought is “very likely” linked to climate change. The immediate cause is a region of high atmospheric pressure over the Pacific, diverting storms away from California. Known to scientists as the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge”, it is blamed on rising greenhouse gases and the study described its persistence and intensity as “unrivalled”. Other studies say California is part of a “mega-drought” in the western US that could stretch for decades, even if the rains return periodically. The sharp drop in water levels in rivers, canals and dams is responsible for what a University of California report called “the greatest absolute reduction in water availability for California agriculture ever seen”. That has prompted farmers to seek alternative sources of irrigation for ever-more-demanding crops. Drought-resistant cotton has given way to more profitable but thirsty plants such as the massive almond farms which now grow 80% of the world’s supply – farmers are now drilling under their fields to tap into aquifers. But that has only added to the pressure on groundwater already depleted by lack of snow on the mountains. As agriculture drew heavily, wells serving individual houses and small communities began to suck air. The impact in Tulare County, where some of the richest agricultural areas in the US sit alongside people with the lowest incomes, is starkly on display. There are queues at communal water tanks and the irrigated fields plump with crops abruptly give way to hard-baked soil forced to sit fallow. Within Tulare County, where one-third of the population lives below the poverty line, nowhere is harder hit than East Porterville – a community of about 7,400 people. More than half of homes are now without running water and many of the remainder wonder how long their wells will last. “Back in January, the county was getting these sporadic calls: ‘Hey, my well’s gone dry,’” says Andrew Lockman, head of Tulare County’s Office of Emergency Services, who is in charge of relief efforts. “By June, there were over 800 households with dry wells. In East Porterville, we brought in three full truckloads of bottled water – 15,552 gallons of drinking water – and we got rid of all of it in about eight hours.” Lockman installed a 5,000-gallon tank in front of the fire station with a motorised pump. A steady stream of residents make the daily journey to fill buckets and drums. Houses without running water – mostly small, low-slung bungalows on plots marked out by wire fences – are often signalled by large blue storage barrels. Many of the houses are wood with corrugated iron roofs that drive people outdoors in the scorching midday heat. The sun has drained colour from their walls and paint is luxury for families struggling to pay for utilities. If there are gardens at all, and mostly there is only bone-dry dirt, they have withered for want of water. No one is going to waste it on grass, although some, like Arreola, are trying to save sources of food. He’s been using waste water to keep alive a small orchard of kiwi fruits, and lemon, apple and cherry trees. There has been no fruit this year but the vines have survived. If the drought has taken a physical toll it doesn’t seem to show on faces already weathered by years in the fields. Some seem to shrug off the added hardship as just another price of poverty. Lockman has been struck by the stoicism of people. “We’re seeing a lot of neighbour helping neighbour,” he says. “We see a lot of folks in East Porterville who say, ‘You’re out of water, hook up to mine,’ knowing full well that theirs is low and then theirs goes out. Choosing to help their neighbours to their own detriment over time is pretty refreshing to see.” For all that, some residents in low-income communities feel shunned by more affluent towns close by. The city of Porterville has for years resisted incorporating East Porterville into its municipality, and hooking it up to a reliable water system, out of a suspicion that it would drag down property values. And as grateful as residents are for the assistance they receive, there is worried talk in some low-income communities that people could lose their homes because of regulations requiring houses to have running water. Steve Worthley, a member of Tulare County’s council, the Board of Supervisors, is aware of the concern but does not entirely allay fears. “We’re not doing that and we have no desire to, but as a long-term situation, people cannot live in a home without water,” he says. With winter setting in, Lockman decided it was too much to ask people to wash in buckets, so in mid-November he moved in two articulated lorries with shower stalls. Some residents had already taken to using the showers at a camp site at a neighbouring artificial lake. Water levels have fallen so far that much of Success Lake’s 150ft-high dam is visible. A road that served as a boat ramp now ends abruptly 35ft above the water. “Have you seen the lake?” says Katherine Hampton, sitting on the doorstep of her wood cabin home on the edge of East Porterville. A large broken window is roughly patched up with a piece of board. “It’s normally so full. It’s so down right now you can walk across it.” Hampton, 32, has five children and is pregnant with her sixth. The drought has cost her husband, Johnathan, his job. “I haven’t worked in eight months,” he says. “I work in agriculture doing anything: transplanting trees, yard work, tilling ground. I was going around all the farms asking, and everyone was saying ‘no’. I thought maybe they had a problem with me. I went to four or five different farms in Tulare. Then I came across a big old sign: ‘Water shortage. No jobs for farm hands.’ So I came home.” Hampton gets no unemployment benefit because he didn’t hold a permanent job. He takes the hardships in his stride. “I do anything I can do. Cleaning people’s houses when they move out. There’s not much work. We get by because we don’t spend much,” he says. He’s a man of God and says the drought is part of the Lord’s plan. “People are small in their faith and bring this on themselves,” he said. “I’m hoping people start praying there’ll be some water.” The University of California report estimates that the drought has already cost the state’s agricultural industry $1.5bn and 17,000 jobs. But the dependence of so many people in Tulare County on agriculture for a living has largely muted any criticism of farmers for drilling deeper and pumping more. “People see farms getting water as a necessity,” said Kemper. “They’re more resentful of the water going to the cities than to the farmers.” The drought has exacerbated a less visible but widespread issue: pollutants contaminating the underground water. Nitrates from fertilisers and septic tanks have been feeding into the groundwater for decades. A University of California study found that one in 10 people in the Central Valley are exposed to unsafe drinking water. But as water levels have fallen, the nitrates – which are dangerous to young children, nursing mothers and the elderly – have become more concentrated and the drinking water even less safe. Susana de Anda, director of the Community Water Centre in Tulare County, which campaigns for access to clean water, said more than one million people in California are drinking from contaminated supplies. “More residents are getting notifications not to drink the water because they are over the legal limit of the contaminant,” she says. Tulare’s health department has issued thousands of letters to users of municipal systems warning against drinking the water, but no one knows how many individual wells are also affected because they are not tested. The situation in Seville was so bad that in 2011 it attracted the attention of a United Nations investigation into lack of access to clean water. Its report warned that what amounts to discrimination in the provision of water and sanitation in parts of the US “may intensify in the coming years with climate change and competing demands for ever scarce water resources”. Earlier this year, Seville’s school board became so alarmed at tests showing high levels of contamination that it decided to start buying bottled drinking water for students at a cost of $700 a month from Kemper’s budget. “That’s money we’re spending that could buy a laptop a month for the school,” he says. But the drought has, to some extent, proved fortuitous for Seville because one crisis has drawn action on another. The state and federal authorities did little over the polluted water, but once there was none at all, funds were rapidly found to drill a new well. It was built and on line within a week in August – a speed Lockman describes as unprecedented – at a cost of more than $250,000. “Frankly, we kind of look at that as a silver lining of the story,” says Lockman. “If we didn’t have all the other drought issues going on, we probably wouldn’t have been able to make that happen.” But Lockman says that Seville is probably not an example for a lot of other towns. For a start, it already had an established municipal water system. “There’s going to be a lot of places where there’s nothing around,” he says. “East Porterville is probably our biggest challenge. We’ve looked at putting in a new water system. It’s really not viable to do, largely because that area has nitrate contamination.” The crisis has forced California to think about long-term management of the ever-increasing demand for its limited water supplies. A state-wide conservation campaign has reduced water consumption in urban areas by about 10% over the past year, even if some of southern California’s wealthiest residents have come under fire for continuing to water the vast lawns of their sprawling mansions as if there was no crisis. Individual cities have introduced a slew of initiatives, such as San Diego’s recycling of wastewater for drinking. In October, the governor approved new laws to regulate the use of underground water supplies for the first time in the state’s history. Worthley says that should include rationing in agriculture. “There are going to be some very serious issues in agriculture about what is going to be a sustainable yield of water,” he points out. “My guess is that there’s going to be a monitoring of the wells to see how much they’ve been taking out and a limit on how much they can remove. You’re going to have to decide: how much of my land do I allow to go fallow? Do I grow a different kind of crop?” Farmers are not likely to accept further restrictions without a fight. Relief programmes are in part funded by federal money and Congress in Washington is considering its own legislation to address the crisis. But California’s leaders fear federal laws being used for political ends – particularly to weaken environmental standards at the behest of large agricultural corporations and some cities, which object to water being shifted from farms to fish conservation. While the severity of the drought in some ways matches that which created the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, the consequences so far are very different. For a start, it has not prompted a mass migration. Kemper came to Seville from LA because he was weary of the problems and violence of an inner-city school. Back then he wondered why modern day agricultural workers didn’t follow the example of the Okies in the 1930s and go somewhere else. “When I lived in Los Angeles and I’d hear about drought I used to think, ‘Why don’t those people just move?’ But living here, you see why. Where do you go? When you’re a poor family, to move is very expensive. You have to have a job and most people here work in agriculture and those jobs are hard to find elsewhere,” he said. In any case, a house without water is almost impossible to sell. But even in Seville, with its new well, there is a recognition that, with warnings of waves of drought to come, it is only a solution for so long as there is water under the town. “It’s the future we’re afraid of,” says Kemper. “What happens if this isn’t the end? Life is going to change totally in our society. When water ceases, what do you do? If we don’t have agriculture, we don’t have anything here. If water goes, it’ll turn into another wasteland.”"
"Governments took a step back from chaos in the climate change discussions in Lima and found a way forward on Sunday, albeit with some fudges and compromises, giving themselves just 12 months to finalise a crucial international agreement to avoid dangerous levels of global warming. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, Peru’s environment minister, who had skilfully presided over more than two weeks of fraught negotiations, announced that a deal had been struck by more than 190 countries.  The five pages of text, dubbed the Lima Call for Climate Action, outline a way forward on hotly contested issues, including the process for countries to set out their pledges to cut annual emissions of greenhouse gases after 2020. The overall aim remains the creation of an international agreement on climate change which is due to be settled at the next UN summit, COP21, to be held in Paris in December 2015. Without a successful outcome in Paris it is unlikely the world can avoid a rise in global average surface temperature of more than two degrees celsius, which is recognised as a threshold beyond which the risks of climate change are likely to become unacceptably large. Countries will be expected by spring 2015 to announce “intended nationally determined contributions”, including domestic targets for emissions reductions and plans to increase resilience against the impacts of climate change that cannot now be prevented. Four years ago in Cancún, Mexico, nations recognised the dangers of warming exceeding the 2C increase and more than 100 governments gave national pledges to reduce emissions, by 2020, accounting for more than 80% of the annual output of greenhouse gas pollution. Although the cuts, if delivered, would slow down the rate of increase in annual global emissions, the Cancún targets were not ambitious enough. Nevertheless they were still a significant step forward after the chaotic and inconclusive discussions in Copenhagen in 2009, which only produced an accord, though it did provide the basis for the Cancún agreements. The road to Lima began in Durban, South Africa, in December 2012, when governments decided to try again to hammer out an international deal, setting themselves a three-year deadline. Now, with just 12 months left, the talks in Lima mean that there is a draft negotiating text for the Paris summit. But there are still significant stumbling blocks on the road to success. Perhaps the biggest challenge is that governments are unlikely to outline cuts in annual emissions that will be collectively consistent with a path that gives a good chance of remaining below the 2C danger limit of two degrees. So countries must focus on increasing the ambition of their intended reductions, and show these are credible by setting out how they will be achieved through domestic policies and legislation. But they must also recognise that such increases may not be sufficient, and a mechanism must also be included in the Paris agreement which commits countries to continuous reviewing and strengthening of their emissions targets. One reason this is so difficult is the dispute over the concept of “common but differentiated responsibility” – which means each country’s action reflecting its historical contributions to raising cumulative levels of greenhouse gases, and also its wealth. Developing countries believe the rich countries have not shouldered a fair share of the burden and should lead by example, in terms of cutting emissions and also providing financial support to poorer nations. In Cancún the rich countries agreed that they should provide extra funds from public and private sources to help developing countries, a sum rising from about US$10bn to $100bn a year by 2020. But the rich countries have barely kept this promise, and have largely re-labelled parts of their overseas aid budgets to achieve progress. While the creation of the Green Climate Fund to administer parts of the funding has important symbolic value, it is in danger of distracting from the most important issue. Over the next 15 years as much as $4tn (£2.5tn) a year will be invested in the emerging and developing countries for infrastructure, such as roads and buildings. It is this investment that must be transformed. If it is, economic growth can be strong, cleaner, less congested, more efficient, more biodiverse – sustainable and much more attractive. If these investments lock countries into high-carbon economies with dirty growth, powered by fossil fuels, the world will not be able to reach its climate target of avoiding warming of more than two degrees. And the developing countries will also experience greater air pollution, which already takes millions of lives each year and damages the economies of many countries, including China and Germany. All this on top of waste, inefficiencies and energy insecurity. So while rich countries should honour the funding pledges they made in Cancún it is even more important they support and help transform the investment of that $4tn into clean, sustainable, infrastructure. The rich countries also have so much to gain domestically from such similar transformations, and in so doing will create powerful examples for themselves and others. Over the next 20 years the world has the chance to embark along a better path of economic growth that gives a much greater chance of managing climate change and overcoming poverty than the old high-carbon route. In this way, rich and developing countries can get equitable access to sustainable development, which should be the key aim that drives each country over the next 12 months on the road from Lima to Paris.

"IT’s probably the closest thing the coal industry will ever get to actually receiving the word of a god – or rather, a note from several gods as well as other various prophets, spiritual leaders and the like. Last month religious leaders representing Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews and a couple of Christian denominations published an open letter calling for world leaders to “commit to a rapid transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy” to avoid “climate-related disasters”.   Some of those religious leaders turned up at the Canberra offices of the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA), the peak lobbying group for the coal industry, to hand them the letter in person before holding a “multi-faith prayer vigil” outside.  For the purposes of a nice snappy headline, it’s sort of like a fight between Gods and coal (except Buddhists don’t really have gods… but if the Buddhists will forgive me?). But the response hasn’t been limited to prayers and firm but polite letters. Some religious leaders have also been turning up at coal mining sites. There has been civil disobedience, an arrest and, it seems, there might be more to come. The Australian Religious Response to Climate Change (ARRCC) is a “multi-faith” group that’s been helping organise this spiritual fight against coal. The group’s open letter kicked off a bit of a back and forth. In response, the MCA wrote its own letter. The coal lobby said fossil fuels were going to lift millions of people out of poverty (a constant mantra from the industry), that coal plants weren’t as dirty as they used to be and that “the Australian energy production sector does not receive ‘fossil fuel’ subsidies”. ARCC wrote back. There were some fundamental flaws in the coal lobbyists’ arguments over poverty. It was “simply not true” that fossil fuels didn’t get subsidies. The letter went on:  The fossil fuel industry has not demonstrated the required moral imagination and courage to set aside self-interest and join the wider community to address climate change for the sake of the common good. In fact it has steadfastly set itself against the direction of the tide and appears to be ignoring its responsibility for the well-being of the earth and its inhabitants. Thea Ormerod, the chair of ARRCC, says the group has been working to encourage religious groups and churches to divest their money from fossil fuel firms. She says while the coal industry claims it will be around for many decades, the religious group too is “in this for the long haul”. The group’s members and associates have also started to engage in civil disobedience, centred on the expansion of the Maules Creek coal mine in northern New South Wales. This misbehaviour continues a long tradition of faith groups getting involved in such acts, Ormerod says. If anything, our conviction has been growing that the greatest damage Australia is doing to global climate systems is through our coal and gas exports. That Australia continues with expansionary plans amounts to willful neglect of our collective moral responsibility. Thus, our resistance must continue. What is at stake is, firstly, the life chances of those in developing countries at the front line of climate impacts and secondly, humanity’s long-term survival. Other species with which we share this planet are also under threat. While “laws should be respected” Ormerod, a practicing Catholic, says “there are circumstances in which individuals may decide, in good conscience, to peacefully disobey a legal authority”. In Australia, she says this legal authority was “aligned with forces of destruction”. Options to shift to renewable sources of energy were being consistently downplayed. All the world’s religions have teachings about respecting the Earth, and about finding happiness in right relationships rather than material gain. We believe influential people in government and mining in Australia are taking our country in entirely the wrong direction.  Professor Colin Butler, of the University of Canberra’s health faculty, was arrested last month at the site of the Maules Creek mine. Chains were involved. Butler, a Buddhist and a contributor to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , was at the ARRCC-organised protest at the mine. He’s due in court in January to face charges of trespass and an offence in relation to mining equipment. He told me:  Conventional academic actions - papers, talks at conferences, editing books etc - are not enough to deeply engage with a sufficient number of the Australian community. Civil disobedience is needed, just as it was for the suffragette movement or to drive the British from India. My Buddhist belief was central. I took the bodhisattva vows almost 40 years ago, as a young man. That led to my decision to study medicine, then public health, to co-found our NGO Benevolent Organisation for Development, Health & Insight and now this. I see it as all linked. The bodhisattva vows are to try to use one’s life to help others, irrespective of their religion, caste or wealth etc.  Amen, shanti, and all that."

"Not all greenhouse gases are created equal. If we want to limit the temperature rise of the Earth, we really need to focus on the long-lasting greenhouse gases. They’re the ones that matter, according to a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Joeri Rogelj and his colleagues. Most of us already know this, but not all greenhouse gases are created equal. There are some greenhouse gases that, when emitted, only stay in the atmosphere for a short time. There are other greenhouse gases (like carbon dioxide) that stay aloft for decades to centuries. Finally, there are some that stay airborne for an intermediate duration. It has often been stated that we can “buy time” by focusing on short-lived greenhouse gases. Reducing things like black carbon or methane can give us some extra years to get our act together on carbon dioxide.  But this suggestion is challenged in the PNAS paper. There are two major issues that suggest we really need to focus on the long-lived gases. First, since short-lived gases only stay airborne for a brief period, any emissions that we make now will not impact the temperatures we can expect say in 2100. Reducing our emissions of short lived gases will affect the rate of temperature increase in the next few years, but will have very little impact on the maximum temperature that will be obtained. In fact, the present study is clear in stating, Maximum temperature increases (peak warming) is to first order determined by the cumulative emissions of the long-lived greenhouse gases until the peak and by the annual emissions of the short-lived greenhouse gases at the time of the peak.  This doesn’t mean that reducing short-lived greenhouse gases isn’t important. In fact, the short-lived gases become more important if we have already reduced carbon dioxide. As stated in the paper,  Methane mitigation measures in the latter half of the century become important if carbon dioxide emissions have already been curbed, and warming thus peaks before 2100. Early action on methane is less important for limiting warming to below 2C.  Part of the paper’s conclusions are based on simple calculations with a climate model. But another part of the study is based on the interdependence of these greenhouse gases. The gases are interdependent because they may be cogenerated – they may be emitted from the same source.  Take black carbon, for instance. Black carbon and carbon dioxide are often emitted together. So, reductions in carbon dioxide will also reduce the emitted black carbon. The opposite is not necessarily true, as black carbon can be reduced by cleaning exhaust gases of cars or switching to clean cook stoves, without fundamentally affecting the amount of carbon dioxide emissions. Methane and carbon dioxide are also more weakly linked so that reductions in one do not imply strong reductions in the other.  So, if humans were somehow to get onto a low temperature trajectory, one that limits temperature increases to 2°C or so, it means that we would have to nearly eliminate carbon dioxide emissions. Since one third to half of black carbon is strongly linked as cogenerated with carbon dioxide, it means that much less black carbon would be emitted as well. It is these links, understanding how greenhouse gases work together and are cogenerated, which makes this paper so interesting.  In the abstract, the authors warn,  Our results reinforce that short-lived climate forcer (reduction) measures are to be considered complementary rather than a substitute for early and stringent carbon dioxide mitigation. Near-term short-lived climate forcer (reduction) measures do not allow for more time for carbon dioxide mitigation. The lead author confirmed to me,  Integrated approaches to find solutions to problems such as climate change, air pollution, and energy policy are critical. The physics of the Earth system indicate that stabilizing climate at any temperature means that, at some point, global CO2 emissions have to become zero. Near-term action to reduce short-lived climate forcers, like black carbon or methane, could help reduce warming in the coming decades and also provides possibly very important other societal benefits, such as cleaner air. However, it will not buy us time for delaying the reductions in carbon dioxide emissions which are required to stabilize the climate at safe levels. Our study shows the importance of integrated approaches to such complex problems. By taking into account the linkages between sources of short-lived climate forcers and climate forcers, we find that the long-term climate benefits of controlling these air pollutants and short-lived gases in scenarios that stabilize climate change – at 2, 2.5, or 3°C – might have been overestimated in earlier studies.   While reducing short-lived climate forcers can be a valid objective in its own right, for example, for their clear public health benefits, it is important that the expectations of what this will bring for climate stabilization and for reducing climate change over the coming decades are not overly optimistic.  It is important to note, however, that there are reasons to reduce short-lived greenhouse gases like black carbon. In particular, there are human health benefits associated with respiratory illnesses that can be reduced."

"Britain’s Habitats: A Guide to the Wildlife Habitats of Britain and Ireland by Sophie Lake and Durwyn Liley [Princeton University Press, 2014; Amazon UK hardcover; Amazon US hardcover]   Publisher’s synopsis: A photographic guide to habitats, this lavishly illustrated book provides a comprehensive overview of the natural history and conservation landscape of Britain and Ireland. In essence a field guide, the book leads the reader through all the main habitat types, with information on their characteristics, extent, geographical variation, key species, cultural importance, origins and conservation. It aims to help visitors to the countryside recognize the habitats around them, understand how they have evolved and what makes them special, and imagine how they might change in the future. This book is the perfect companion for anyone travelling in Britain and Ireland, and essential reading for all wildlife enthusiasts, professional ecologists and landscape architects. My first impression: This is a stunning book in every way that a bibliophile or collector can imagine, and it’s an inspirational book in every sense that a citizen scientist or a professional ecologist can wish for. It is crammed full of informative maps that are colour-coded to describe the habitats of Britain and Ireland, as well as maps describing areas of special concern, topology, rock types, mean minimum and maximum temperatures, rainfall … the list goes on and on. It even has a timeline describing the history of Britain and Ireland from the start of the Devensian/Midlandian Glacial period. But most of the book is devoted to discussing each habitat in detail; including the flora and fauna, cultural importance, and special issues -- conservation, water quality, etc. Every page features several full-colour photographs along with species identifications and other relevant information. It even features a short “did you know?” section that shares an interesting little fact about each habitat type. Reading this book inspires me to set out on a series of exploratory hiking visits to Britain and Ireland, carrying my binoculars, cameras, toothbrush -- and this book. The only thing I could wish for that might improve this book, particularly for long-term outdoors use is … flexi-binding! The Weather Makers: Our Changing Climate and what it means for Life on Earth by Tim Flannery [Grove Press; New Ed edition, 2007; Amazon UK paperback; Amazon US paperback/kindle US/audio CD]  Publisher’s synopsis: An international bestseller embraced and endorsed by policy makers, scientists, writers and energy industry executives from around the world, Tim Flannery’s The Weather Makers contributed in bringing the topic of global warming to national prominence. For the first time, a scientist provided an accessible and comprehensive account of the history, current status, and future impact of climate change, writing what has been acclaimed by reviewers everywhere as the definitive book on global warming. With one out of every five living things on this planet committed to extinction by the levels of greenhouse gases that will accumulate in the next few decades, we are reaching a global climatic tipping point. The Weather Makers is both an urgent warning and a call to arms, outlining the history of climate change, how it will unfold over the next century, and what we can do to prevent a cataclysmic future. Originally somewhat of a global warming skeptic, Tim Flannery spent several years researching the topic and offers a connect-the-dots approach for a reading public who has received patchy or misleading information on the subject. Pulling on his expertise as a scientist to discuss climate change from a historical perspective, Flannery also explains how climate change is interconnected across the planet. This edition includes a new afterword by the author. My first impression: Before I purchased this book at the 2014 Frankfurt Book Fair, I randomly opened it and landed in chapter ten, “Peril at the Poles”. I was immediately captivated by the shining prose, by the well-chosen data, and by the coherent yet passionate argument. Although published in 2007, this book’s message is even more important, more relevant and more compelling today. An eye-opening (although chilling) must-read. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

"The Australian government’s rhetoric to its domestic audience about international climate talks is “harder line” than the positions it is taking in the actual negotiations, according to long-term observers of the process. “In many areas the actual negotiating position of the current government is much the same as the former government, the real difference is in their rhetoric and their posturing,” said the deputy director of the Climate Institute, Erwin Jackson. “Their rhetoric is definitely tougher at home.”  Before leaving for the climate talks in Lima, foreign minister Julie Bishop insisted that any targets agreed at next year’s meeting in Paris had to be “legally binding” or else the deal would “amount to nothing more than aspirations”. This was labelled an impossible demand by many experts, because a treaty imposing hard legal obligations on the United States was unlikely to pass the US congress.  By Thursday Bishop was telling a conference on the sidelines of the Lima talks that Australia’s priority was encouraging participation in the new treaty, rather than its legal form. And she told ABC radio: “The controversy is about whether or not it should be legally binding. There are some countries who will refuse to be involved if it is legally binding so we have to balance whether we would rather have those countries at the signing table or will we insist on the agreement being legally binding.” “So we’re working around the clock with other parties to secure an agreement that countries will not only sign up to in Paris but they will actually implement when they get home.”  In her formal national statement in Lima, Bishop said a Paris agreement “must establish a common playing field, moving past the developed-developing country divide that puts a brake on real action” – a line previewed in an interview with the Australian as a demand that China and India do more, and cease insisting on less onerous obligations because they were classified as “developing” countries. One veteran negotiator told Guardian Australia these comments “must be directed to a domestic audience” because international climate talks in South Africa three years ago had already agreed that the new post-2020 agreement had to include commitments and obligations for all countries. “They’re still saying some strange things here in Lima, for example questioning the long-term goal to limit global warming to two degrees, but on the whole they are being reasonably constructive. It seems like a lot of their messaging is just designed for the audience at home.” And having initially derided the announcement of new emissions targets by China last month as nothing more than “business as usual”, Bishop told the ABC on Thursday “of course China recently, even though it is still defined as a developing country, China recently made a significant announcement with the United States about its post-2020 emission reduction plans and we’re looking forward to further information on these plans when contributions are formally communicated next year.” On Wednesday the Abbott government responded to intense international pressure by reversing its previously strong opposition to the Green Climate Fund, announcing that it would contribute $200m over four years from the foreign aid budget.  The trade minister, Andrew Robb, reportedly sent along to the Lima talks to “chaperone” the foreign minister, is also talking tough from Lima. “We will make a particular effort to ensure that they are as ambitious as we will be,” he said in a recent interview. “If we are not convinced they are doing what they should, it will influence whether we sign up or not. Outcomes must be comparable. We are not going to get it in the neck and increase our costs for nothing.” The Greens leader, Christine Milne, who is also in Lima for the talks, said the government was right to resist the talks slipping back into the old fights between developed and developing nations. But she said there were many instances of the government taking a very hard line in the negotiations, including resisting a proposal by countries including Norway and Latin American countries to commit countries to reduce emissions to zero by 2050 and insisting that there would be no further contributions from Australia to the green climate fund beyond the $200m. “Australia is still being a spoiler,” she said. Australia, along with the US and the European Union, is pushing for a process to assess and review the targets national targets nominated by each country before they are enshrined in any treaty agreed in Paris next year, something China is resisting."
"So far over the course of this series, we’ve heard from a climate scientist, a community alliance leader, an urban buildings expert, and an MTA engineer. Each is a vital player in what we’ve referred to as the “stormproofing network”. They are all invested in protecting New York City in the face of natural disasters. And in our conversations, they have all repeatedly referenced one private foundation as a major player – the Rockefeller Foundation. To be honest, when I hear Rockefeller, I think of an old man with a monocle watching a train go by. I know the foundation supports important philanthropy projects … but I couldn’t name one. According to their website, “The Rockefeller Foundation maintains a portfolio of interconnected initiatives, each of which commits to specific, measurable goals.” What does that mean? How does the Rockefeller Foundation’s work tie in with disaster-risk planning?  I contacted Nancy Kete, the foundation’s managing director, who leads their global work on resilience. She sat down with me in their Manhattan office to explain how they work with the city and country to prepare for scary climate unknowns. We sat at the end of a long, formal conference table, the midtown cityscape stretched out through the window – which was also the room’s entire wall. The presence of big names and big money hung in the air. Nancy ignored it. She described how federal agencies reroute their money into better, more innovative resilience projects nationwide, with Rockefeller’s help. But first, she told me why she didn’t like the name of my series. Let’s start with how the Rockefeller Foundation’s work fits into this network of people keeping us safe from future storms. What I’d really like to start with is to see if I can push you off the idea of “stormproofing” the city, though I’m not sure I have a different catchy name for you.  But “stormproofing” provides some tangible context for all this stuff. Well, first of all, I don’t think we can stormproof New York City. Second, I think we miss a major opportunity by focusing too narrowly.  Over the past two years, everyone’s been focused on resilience in the context of Sandy-like storms, but that’s because we had a Sandy-like storm. But there are a lot of other potential and very likely things that could hit the city, and it’s equally important that the city be ready for those. For example, the natural event likely to hit New York next is a heatwave. Heat can be deadly. We need to think about this from the broader perspective of how we build our resilience overall. Part of what the Rockefeller Foundation does was described to me by the scientist Klaus Jacob as spending smart money. I wonder if you can help me simplify that concept. That’s nice of him. So the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Army Corps of Engineers are very mature organizations, and what they can do is very tightly controlled by laws and appropriations from Congress and by oversight of the Office of Management and Budget, which has a responsibility to look carefully at how taxpayer money is being spent.  These federal agencies are also big bureaucracies that have done things a certain way for a long time. And they tend to keep doing things that way, because it takes a lot of effort to do things differently. So working at a foundation like Rockefeller gives you the obligation and the luxury to step back and think, “What needs to change, and how can we catalyze that change?” And that’s my best interpretation of what Klaus means. Because our money may seem big, but the problems that need to be solved are bigger, and can only be solved if we use our money to leverage other money or other, broader authority. So what’s an example of how a little bit of the Rockefeller Foundation’s money can leverage a lot of someone else’s money? A great example is the design competition we ran after Sandy, Rebuild by Design. Here we could spend a few million dollars at the front end in a way that brought in all this creativity, that really excited HUD, and that attracted these amazing multidisciplinary teams of designers, engineers, landscape architects, sociologists, and so on. It also included community needs in the design process – we got community groups to drop any cynicism they might have had about a big government project, and put in a huge amount of effort to articulate what they needed and why. The teams could then design that in. We organized this whole coalition. So when it comes to spending recovery money, none of this is normal. And our money, along with some other foundations’, paid for that, because there’s no budget line that HUD could have used to pay for it. We had to be the smart money to catalyze it. That led us through a series of competition steps to six winning ideas, which HUD then did have the authority to fund with the billion dollars they set aside for this. The network of New York City’s stormproofers. For a larger version of this image, click here. So your money enabled the competition, and HUD’s will support the winners. Exactly. Same goes for our new national disaster competition, The National Disaster Resilience Competition, which came out of the success of Rebuild by Design. It’s a nationwide grant competition open to areas that have had a declared national disaster from 2011-2013.  When it comes to spending recovery money, none of this is normal. Again, we’ll put in a small number of millions toward training and technical assistance to help the eligible communities come up with good ideas for the competition. And HUD’s set aside another billion dollars to fund the winning ideas. This is a new approach. And through it, communities will learn a lot. Even if these places don’t get some of HUD’s money, they will be better equipped to use their own authorities and other budget lines to make themselves more resilient. So we can move our money faster, and we can spend it in ways that restricted agencies can’t. But it’s not worth doing if that’s the end of it. We try to only do that if it’s going to leverage someone else’s big pool. So, the fundamental questions I’m trying to get at is: are we safe? Are we safer? Are we getting safer? About two months ago, the Gotham Gazette and Adapt New York asked 70 residents in low-lying areas that were hit hard by Sandy, “Do you feel like you’re safer?”And the overwhelming majority said no. They also had no idea about the city’s large-scale resiliency plans, like those that came from Rebuild by Design. So I worry that millions of dollars later, people still don’t feel safer. How important is their perceived comfort? Well, plans are different than completed projects. For example, one of the Rebuild by Design winning designs is for rebuilding oyster reefs off the coast of Tottenville, in Staten Island, to reduce the strength of waves. It’s a cool design, and if it works I won’t be surprised to see the Army Corps replicate it in other places. But it’ll be quite a few years before we know if it works. So is Tottenville any safer right now because it was picked by Rebuild by Design? I don’t think so. Because the project hasn’t started yet. Tottenville might be safer because residents know to evacuate faster – the discussion alone as made them more aware. So I think it’s unfair to imagine that a lot of the built environment plans post-Sandy have done anything, because we haven’t had much time to start actually building. What questions and aspects of this network do you think are most important for people to consider?  I think you do want to ask how resilient New York was to Sandy, and whether the different parts of New York were differently resilient. And I know the answer to that last part is yes.  You just have to look around. There are people in what we call back bay communities like Jamaica Bay, where low- and middle-income people live, and these communities are still not fully functional two years after Sandy. They’re still very vulnerable to flooding, and are also vulnerable from a socioeconomic perspective, whereas in lower Manhattan, the financial district and the hospitals are back up and running. So in a city as large as New York, it’s not a fair question to say, is the city resilient or back to normal? Because a lot of it is, but it’s not fully. There are serious equity issues. That’s going to be true in cities all over the world.  I honestly think New York is pretty resilient, but it’s unevenly resilient. It just needs to do better relative to itself. "
"The world’s nations are meeting in Lima, near the equator, to pledge and promise about global warming. But the actual worth of those promises can be more accurately gauged in the far north and the far south of the planet, where real decisions in the next months will show whether the climate concern is rhetorical or real. By now most people know about the northern example: the tar sands of Alberta. Some time in the coming months the new Republican-controlled Congress will demand that Obama approve the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. If he vetoes that call and sticks to his principles, it will help keep expansion of the tar sands complex in check. That won’t make up for America’s vast expansion of oil and gas drilling in recent years, but it will send some kind of signal: there is a limit somewhere to how much fossil fuel we plan to extract.  Many fewer people have heard of Australia’s Galilee basin, but that’s about to change. Work is scheduled to start in January on turning this remote basin into the world’s biggest coal mine — a colliery so vast that this single mine, in a nation with 0.3% of the world’s population, would produce 6% of the carbon necessary to take the planet past a 2C temperature rise, the red line set by the world’s governments. It’s breathtaking to think about. In 2014, with the Arctic melting and the West Antarctic ice sheet beginning a slow but apparently irreversible collapse, with crazy weather causing ever more damage and the oceans rapidly acidifying, Australia wants to build the world’s largest coal port and open a vast new seam for mining. The country has issued permits for billions of dollars of infrastructure designed to last the century, even as delegates in Lima are conceding that the planet must be off fossil fuel entirely by 2050. The tar sands, and the Galilee, represent the most extreme cases of extreme energy—and hence they become crucial tests. By their very ludicrousness they threaten to bring down the whole global climate negotiations. In the case of Keystone, an Obama approval would mean he heads to the big climate talks in Paris next year neutered, with no one believing he or his successors will actually take any political pain to uphold their promises. When secretary Kerry arrives at the climate talks in Lima later this week, activists will be pressuring him to recommend a rejection to the president.  In the Galilee it’s a little different. Australia’s far right government loves coal — it’s pretty much all they talk about. Its approval of the project can be taken for granted (though polling shows approval of the government itself is another issue, and that Aussies are turning restive at its fanaticism). But building out the ports and railways and giant pits will require huge sums of capital, and so it tests the resolve of the world’s financial system to come to terms with climate. Any bank that backs this ludicrous plan is announcing, quite plainly, that it cares nothing about climate change. It’s also — probably worse for a bank — announcing that it’s stuck in the 19th century. Serious financial authorities (the governor of the Bank of England most recently) are warning that fossil fuel reserves risk becoming “stranded assets” as the world acts on climate change — investors in the tar sands, for instance, have already taken an enormous hit, and coal stocks have been tumbling for years. A British cabinet minister warned the other day that they were the “subprime assets of the future”, a sobering warning for everyone still recovering from the housing bust of 2008. So far the financial industry is showing relative sobriety. Goldman Sachs, for instance, has announced it won’t back the Galilee mines — and if you’ve found something too dirty for Goldman Sachs, that’s saying something. Citibank too. Deutsche Bank. HSBC. Campaigners will have to head into the hinterlands of Queensland to try and block preliminary dredging in January — just as activists stand by to put their bodies in front of Keystone across Nebraska and South Dakota should Obama give in to the Republicans. They’ll also have to keep up the pressure on any institution or bank that is investing in the fossil fuel industry – an upcoming Global Day of Divestment Action next February provides just the opportunity. For the first time, climate negotiators are talking seriously about completely phasing out fossil fuels by mid-century. If those fine words flying around Lima mean anything, then at least these two projects will be shelved. Fighting global warming is going to be hard — but for anyone who’s serious, pulling the plug on these turkeys should be easy."
"Queensland councils are seeking urgent advice from the state’s deputy premier after he forced one local government to remove references to predicted sea level rises from its draft regional plan. In a letter to Moreton Bay regional council in November, quoted by the ABC, Jeff Seeney wrote: “I direct council to amend its draft planning scheme to remove any assumption about a theoretical projected sea level rise from all and any provision of the scheme.”  The Local Government Association of Queensland (LGAQ) is seeking urgent clarification from Seeney. The LGAQ fears councils could be liable for damage if they are forced to remove references to climate change-derived sea level rises from their planning documents, and developments go ahead in vulnerable areas. It has written to Seeney about the legally binding directive to the Moreton Bay authority and what implications it might have for other councils. “Our concern has always been about councils’ legal position,” the association’s spokesman, Greg Hallam, told the ABC. In drafting its regional plan, the Moreton Bay council assumed a 0.8-metre rise in sea level by 2100, and it is understood that assumption has also been reflected in other councils’ planning documents. Environmental lawyer Justine Bell expressed concern that future developments would not be protected against changing sea levels. “As I see it we are going to have new developments going ahead under a planning scheme that does not consider the overwhelming international consensus about sea level rise,” she told ABC radio on Wednesday. “(That) means we’re going to have substantial new developments in areas that are going to be subject to these threats in the future. “We are dealing with some uncertainty but it is beyond doubt that we are going to experience some degree of sea level rise by 2100, so that is something that needs to be factored into planning decisions.” Seeney said he had intervened “to ensure residents’ rights to build and develop their properties were ... not restricted by their local council”. He said there had been complaints to the government and angry public meetings after the Moreton Bay council decided to include the 0.8-metre sea level rise in its planning scheme. “I am prepared to protect the property rights of Queenslanders in other council areas should this issue arise again,” he said."
"From the Amazon to the Andes, thousands of activists marched through the streets of Lima on Wednesday to demand a just solution to climate change. The march through the traffic-choked streets put a human face on the United Nations climate negotiations, a process largely confined to suited bureaucrats working behind the high walls of a military compound in a leafy neighbourhood of Lima.  Campaigners said the message behind the march was not just to press for action to fight climate change – but for fairness, as well as protection for environmental activists who face daily harassment from powerful corporate interests. “This is no longer an issue for governments and corporations to talk about behind locked doors,” said Oxfam International’s executive director, Winnie Byanyima. “People want solutions, and they also want those solutions to include their basic rights.” Organisers said they hoped to get 10,000 or more out into the streets – which would make this the biggest climate march Latin America has ever seen. By mid-morning, with dozens of riot police in helmets and plastic shields looking on, the crowds descending on Campo de Marte grew several thousand strong. The marchers included peasant women from the Andes in bowler hats decked with flowers and full skirts, indigenous peoples from the Amazon carrying photos of murdered environmental activists, drummers, stilt walkers, trade unionists, students, and women’s groups.  Protesters carried banners declaring: “Keep the oil in the soil,” “Protect your food” and “Change the system, not the climate.” The marchers – who came from Ecuador, Bolivia and other neighbouring countries – held up oil derricks studded with skulls, giant paper sheaves of yellow and purple corn, and oversized puppets dressed as peasants. One man came wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt, sticking a forest campaign sticker on the guerrilla’s beret. There was even a “Green Inca” in green robes adorned with a brass breastplate and crown, who jumped up on a concrete block with a Peruvian flag, striking a pose. Wednesday’s event was closely modelled on last September’s People’s Climate March when 400,000 people poured through the streets of Manhattan ahead of the UN climate summit. Campaigners believe the strong showing in Manhattan – far beyond their expectations – and the support from celebrities, Democratic members of Congress, and the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, was a turning point for climate action. Since September, there has been growing momentum behind the talks which are intended to produce a global agreement on cutting carbon pollution by the end of next year. But the message of the Lima march was even more sober. Peru is under growing risk from climate change, which is melting the glaciers that are its source of fresh water, and changing the chemistry of the Pacific, which is an important source of food supply. Despite those gathering dangers, environmental activists in Latin America regularly come under attack from powerful corporate interests on the hunt for oil, minerals and forest products in territories that are home to indigenous peoples. Earlier this week, the body of an indigenous leader who had opposed a copper and gold mining project was discovered in Ecuador. The activist had apparently been tortured before he was killed. Last week, the authorities in Ecuador confiscated a bus carrying protesters on their way to Lima to protest against their president, Rafael Correa, at the climate talks. Many indigenous people feel shut out of the negotiations. Yánez said it was also critical to send a message to negotiators that many of the local people simply do not want the pro-business solutions that are a key part of the UN process. “It is very important to say there is no homogeneous position regarding development,” she said. “A lot of the people here reject oil, reject mining. They even reject business projects that are supposed to be for forests.”"
"The august journal Nature recently published Life – a status report. It is a graphic portrayal of the vast number of species disappearing from the planet; a difficult calculation, as scientists don’t know how many species there are, with estimates ranging from two to 50 million. But for those species we know about, the picture is grim. Globally, 41% of amphibian species are facing extinction; 13% of all birds are at risk; as are 22% of flowering plants. The reasons behind this potential mass extinction are manifold, but all stem from human activity. Humans are “the ultimate invasive species” having spread from Africa to every corner of the planet (and beyond) in 100,000 years. In doing so, we have removed the habitats of other species, or affected them by moving other invasive species around, causing pollution and driving climate change. We do so at our peril, because humans depend on nature utterly for our survival.  If it is possible to stop this mass extinction, humans need to take rapid and radical action. Here are five actions that I think will be needed: Some 3% of the oceans and 15% of land are classified as “protected areas”. In practice, many of these offer no protection to nature – more protected areas are needed, and they must be properly protected. Nature is not another asset class to be traded on the world’s financial markets. Yet we see governments and businesses keen to implement biodiversity offsetting, where biodiversity lost as a result of development schemes is traded for the creation of nature sites elsewhere. Most would consider it heinous to develop a market in tradeable credits for children’s happiness – so why is it deemed acceptable to trade biodiversity? Humans have an absolute requirement for nature – for the food we eat, the oxygen we breathe, but also for the inspiration it provides, the sense of wellbeing, meaning, joy and solace it brings us all. We need to develop new ethics that transform the values people ascribe to nature and the way we relate to it. The neoliberal obsession with economic growth and profit is a major driver of this mooted global extinction. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the main way economists measure economic growth. Economists talk of “market failure”, when the external costs to nature of human activities are given no monetary value. A farmer can grow a profitable crop of maize, ignoring the costs of cleaning up the nearby river contaminated with silt, nitrogen fertiliser and pesticides; or the homes flooded further downstream. These costs are externalised and are either not addressed or are paid by the taxpayer. GDP counts the economic value of the crop, the cost of cleaning the nitrogen from the water and the cost of clearing up after the flood all as contributing positively to GDP. This makes no sense on any level. We need to radically transform the way nature is valued through economics. Perhaps the largest causes of nature destruction in Europe over the past 40 years are the common agricultural policy on land and the common fisheries policy at sea. These have paid farmers to replace areas rich in nature with places almost entirely devoid of it; and they have paid fisheries to empty the seas. All this has been paid for by taxpayers. It is time to abolish the CAP and the CFP and replace them with systems that only support farming and fishing practices that either do no harm or actively restore nature. Practices that continue to cause unnecessary damage to nature should be taxed or outlawed. The planet cannot sustain our current consumption of finite resources and, as our population expands, other species disappear. There is a near free market in the products of wildlife crime, in that the laws of supply and demand operate without much hindrance. The wealthy can afford to pay ever higher prices for poached products, such as ivory. Elephants have a right to exist, and their existence enriches all our lives. Yet the ivory buyers have no care for elephants, nature or for society. As wealth is concentrated in corporations and the top 1%, key decisions that affect the future of nature are left to a tiny number of individuals, who act neither in the interests of society, or of nature. It is also the world’s poorest people who depend most on nature, so their lives are most affected when nature is damaged. In the long run nature will survive, as it has the previous five extinctions. It is we, Homo sapiens, who will join the myriad other species disappearing in this mass dying, unless we radically change our relationship with nature."

"Chinese media coverage of the Lima climate change talks included comments by the country’s top climate negotiator who described the deal reached as “balanced”.  Xie Zhenhua told the state news agency Xinhua that the outcome was “within” the Chinese delegation’s expectation. However he said: “we’re not very satisfied with the outcome, but we think it’s a balanced and nice document”.   Xie added that the summit is an important step towards next year’s summit in Paris but that those “negotiations will be more challenging and require parties to show greater flexibility”. China’s role going into the talks was buoyed by its recent climate deal with the US. In the agreement announced in November, China committed for the first time to cap its output of carbon pollution by 2030 and to increase its use of zero emission energy sources to 20% by 2030. However, while there was much progress on commitments, the issue of historical emissions has once again proven to be a sticking point that China is not willing to let go. “Developed countries should honor their commitments and shoulder their responsibilities under the Convention to do more in support of developing countries in terms of mitigation, finance, technology and capability building,” Xie was quoted as saying. A critical opinion piece in the English edition of the state run China Daily newspaper criticised the developed countries’ “double standards” and that they have “blurred the difference between responsibilities of the rich and poor nations to fight climate change”. “Why does the developed world even pretend to help save the planet?” it adds.  Li Shuo, climate campaigner with Greenpeace said the issue of common but differentiated responsibilities is “the most challenging issue” for next year’s climate change summit in Paris. “It has to be resolved in 2015 to achieve a robust agreement,” Li added.  Another difficult negotiating point during the talks was on a method of accounting emission cuts. “The Lima conference ended up with a weak decision on this issue,” said Li. “Largely as a result of opposition from China and India, there will not be much top down scrutiny that the multilateral process can put on the offers from different countries,” he added.  Alvin Lin, the China Climate and Energy Policy Director with the National Resources Defence Council writes that China “is moving in the right direction and should be pro-active in providing the details needed to evaluate its actions, so that other countries can have confidence in China’s actions and in turn step up their own efforts to reduce the threat of global climate change”.
