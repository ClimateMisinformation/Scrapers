"Twelve climate scientists and contrarians recently had dinner together in the UK, which for some reason received media attention. While everyone should be free to have dinner with whomever they like, the problem with this particular event was that the ensuing media coverage made the contrarians seem downright reasonable. For example, the article about the dinner stated, “...the insults slung around online only hinder the process of rational scientific debate.”  Yet one of the contrarians attending the dinner was Anthony Watts, who runs a blog that regularly insults climate scientists and climate realists. In fact, just a few days after the dinner, Watts was already taunting Ben Santer, one of the world’s most highly respected climate scientists, who had previously treated Watts with courtesy and respect. The article also quoted Watts as saying, We’ve been at odds so long, it is time to present science together, Climate contrarians are already free to present science at climate conferences. For example, the annual American Geophysical Union (AGU) fall meeting is the largest gathering of climate scientists presenting and discussing their research. Every year, the vast majority of scientific research presented at the AGU conference and others like it (about 97% or so) is consistent with the expert consensus on human-caused global warming. Contrarians don’t present science there because they have so little science to present. The Mail on Sunday’s David Rose also attended the dinner. His latest climate article focused on the slight increase in Arctic sea ice as compared to the record low of two years ago (and of course on Al Gore), while ignoring the fact that the Arctic has lost about 70% of its total volume of sea ice over the past three decades. The Mail in general seems incapable of covering a climate science story without adding some denial spin to the headline. Also attending the dinner were Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) advisor and contributors David Whitehouse, Nic Lewis, and Marcel Crok. The purpose of the GWPF is to dilute, delay, and prevent government policies aimed to address the threats posed by global warming. The organization releases biased scientific reports from contributors like Lewis and Crok to support those efforts. Supposedly, through the course of the dinner and discussion, the two sides found that they are not all that far apart, A survey of the table at the end of the meal revealed that the views of scientists and sceptics on the level of “transient climate response” – or how much the world would warm should levels of pre-industrial CO2 be doubled – differed only by around 0.4C Yet another contrarian and GWPF contributor, climate scientist Judith Curry, has just published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal (where else?). In it, she argued that the aforementioned small difference in the transient climate response, and the slowed global surface warming over the past few years “means there is less urgency to phase out greenhouse gas emissions now.” Recent research has suggested that the lower climate sensitivity estimates preferred by Curry, Lewis, and other contrarians are likely incorrect because they fail to account for different efficiencies of different climate influences, and underestimate the amount of global warming in the oceans. Nevertheless, the contrarians may be right that the climate sensitivity is toward the lower end of the possible range. It’s just as likely that it’s toward the higher end of that range, but most likely in the middle. From a policy perspective, it makes little difference. As climate scientist Myles Allen put it, A 25% reduction in [transient climate response] would mean the changes we expect between now and 2050 might take until the early 2060s instead ... So, even if correct, it is hardly a game-changer. Climate contrarians are essentially asking us to bet our future on their beliefs that (1) the climate sensitivity is toward the lower end of the possible range, and (2) that the impacts of global warming will be toward the extreme lower end of the possible range. There’s a slim chance they’re right, but gambling our future on that slim possibility would be humanity’s greatest-ever risk management failure. Contrarians have a lot invested in rejecting the expert climate consensus and opposing climate policies – culturally, ideologically, they’ve invested their reputations, and in many cases they’re financially invested as well. They’re invested in keeping us on a path towards catastrophic climate consequences. While social gatherings may seem benign, we have to be careful not to inadvertently assist them in keeping us on that path to disaster."

"Independent senator Nick Xenophon has claimed his proposals to alter the Coalition’s Direct Action climate plan will give the policy “credibility” and may even allow for Australia to make deeper cuts to its carbon emissions. Xenophon is in talks with the government over his amendments to Direct Action, which appears unlikely to have the votes to pass the Senate in its current form. Since the repeal of carbon pricing in July Australia has had no primary policy to lower emissions.  Xenophon wants to amend the emissions reduction fund, the centrepiece of the $2.55bn Direct Action plan. His proposal would create a penalty system so that around 200 of Australia’s largest polluters would face fines if they breach accepted industry emissions benchmarks. In its current form, the emissions reduction fund would provide voluntary grants to businesses that wish to lower their emissions. But the government has yet to include a “safeguards” mechanism that would ensure that emissions would not go up elsewhere in the economy, thereby replacing the pollution prevented by the fund. Xenophon’s amendments would also allow $500m for the international trading of carbon permits, in order for businesses to keep to the emissions limit. Business groups are in favour of this idea, although Tony Abbott has previously said he doesn’t want money “going offshore into dodgy carbon farms”. The government has done no modelling to ascertain whether the emissions reduction fund could meet the bipartisan goal of a 5% cut in emissions by 2020, on 2000 levels. Abbott has instead said the Coalition will “have a crack” at making the policy a success, although independent analysis has cast significant doubt on whether it could be achieved without huge extra expense. Xenophon, however, told Guardian Australia that a beefed up emissions reduction fund could meet the 5% goal and could even help Australia meet a more ambitious target of a 15% cut, should it agree to deeper cuts at UN climate talks next year. “I think it could not only achieve the modest target of 5% but also be a springboard further down the track,” he said. “The architecture is there to ramp up. Obviously we don’t want to spook the horses yet as we want to get the architecture right first, but, if we do, we can get to the 5% and we could get higher targets depending on what happens in Paris next year. “That will cost taxpayers something, of course, but I want to get a good environmental outcome at the lowest possible cost and I think these amendments do this.” Xenophon, who has been discussing the amendments with the environment minister, Greg Hunt, said the Coalition’s climate policy would lack “fundamental credibility” if a penalty system wasn’t put in place for businesses who chose to rapidly increase emissions. The independent senator said he was confident that a combination of fines and reputational damage would ensure polluters wouldn’t do this. “I’m confident this will get a fair hearing from the Coalition and my other colleagues,” Xenophon said. The Greens, who have said they will work with the Coalition to improve Direct Action, are understood to be looking at Xenophon’s proposals before committing to them. Labor and the Palmer United Party, both of which have labelled Direct Action a waste of money, have yet to formulate a position on the amendments. The negotiations come as figures released by Cedex show that total emissions in the national electricity market were 1.3% higher in the month to September 2014 than they were in the month to June 2014, which was before the removal of the carbon price. Generation of brown coal, the most carbon-intensive type of coal, was 2.2% higher in the year to September 2014 compared to the year to June 2014, the figures showed. "
"Taking measurements of the Earth’s weather and climatic state is challenging in many ways. One challenge is that we just don’t have sensors everywhere all the time. Sometimes we can use automated sensors (like Argo ocean floats or satellite imagery). But other times, scientists have to put their boots on, fire up a vehicle, and get out in the world. One great example is with hurricanes/cyclones. The best measurements of cyclone strength come from flights of airplanes through the storm itself.  It is a problem, however, when you just don’t have airplanes available for many cyclones. This problem is particularly an issue outside of the North Atlantic. Without airplanes, how do we know where cyclones are? How do we know how strong they are?  Identifying long-term trends is even more difficult because measurements change over the years. For instance, during the 1940s, aircraft observations of cyclones were routinely made in the North Atlantic and Pacific. In 1987, the Pacific observations halted and have not yet restarted. Without continued observations, how do we know if cyclones are changing in intensity or strength? One way to get around the paucity of aircraft observations is through remote sensing from satellites. Satellites can take pictures (visual and other images) and record other data which can be used to infer cyclone intensity and position. The question is, how are the cyclone qualities inferred?  Well, currently there are procedures such as the Dvorak technique, which uses cloud patterns and cloud-top temperatures to infer maximum sustained winds. The official intensity records are produced at the end of season by forecasters but forecasters come and go and the rules and their interpretation differ between centres and forecasters and over time. An alternative to this human-intensive process is through the use of automated methods. These methods can rapidly process many hundreds and thousands of images (which is a strength). But they have troubles recognizing the transition from weak to strong storms (a weakness). So, as things stand, we are faced with either an imperfect set of manual analyses or an imperfect set of automated analyses.  Scientists use many tools to sift through mountains of data – many of the tools (such as the Dvorak methodology) are able to be implemented by automated computer programs that can quickly and effectively judge environmental conditions. But there is nothing as appealing or as valuable as good old fashioned human eyeballs for processing data. But how do you process information at the required rate? A few scientists simply do not have enough hours in the day. A recent study has approached this conundrum by enlisting help of thousands of citizen scientists to provide cyclone interpretation. The project, called Cyclone Center, published its first journal paper just days ago. The authors who I communicated with (Christopher Hennon and Peter Thorne) show that they can effectively outsource hours of cyclone identification to an army of skilled and dedicated citizen scientists.  The authors report more than 7,500 volunteers have sifted through approximately 350,000 images. Each citizen scientist classifies a storm based on satellite images. Multiple classifications are given for each image so that there is a degree of redundancy. When the classifications were compared with automated methods and aircraft data from the Atlantic, the authors found that in some cases, the crowd outperforms the automated method. The authors learned more from their work though. They found that while many users classified just a few storms, other participants were super users. Some classified more than 1,000 storms. In fact, approximately two-thirds of the classifications came from the top 5% of the participants. I wrote to Dr. Thorne who said,  This paper shows that citizen scientist volunteers really can help improve our understanding of hurricane/typhoon/cyclone records and their changes. As the Chinese proverb goes, many hands make light work. How true. It will be interesting to see if similar projects can be carried out in other areas of science which require processing of massive amounts of data."
"The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) briefed the environment minister, Greg Hunt, on the link between climate change and extreme weather shortly before he cited Wikipedia as evidence that Australia had experienced bushfires regardless of global warming. Documents released under freedom of information laws show Hunt was told on 3 October 2013 the link between extreme weather and climate trends was “increasingly established” in scientific literature in Europe, Australia and the US.  The minister was also told by Rob Vertessy, the director of meteorology at the BOM, that while it was not possible to attribute any single weather event to global warming, “these recent extremes are consistent with the general pattern of warming. A number of more recent studies are drawing probabilistic links between extreme seasonal heat records and climate change, including the Australian summer of 2012-2013.” Just a few weeks after receiving this advice, Hunt appeared to downplay the influence of climate change on bushfires that had just raged in the Blue Mountains and elsewhere in New South Wales. Hunt told the BBC on 22 October: “Australia has since European settlement and obviously well before that, had a history of recurrent bushfire. “I looked up what Wikipedia says for example, just to see what the rest of the world thought, and it opens up with the fact that bushfires in Australia are frequently occurring events during the hotter months of the year. “Large areas of land are ravaged every year by bushfires. That’s the Australian experience.” Hunt said “we all have to be very careful” when linking fire-prone weather to climate change. About the time of the bushfires, the UN’s climate chief, Christiana Figueres, cited them as evidence of the influence of climate change. Tony Abbott subsequently said Figueres was “talking out of her hat”. The BOM advice, requested by Fairfax, made it clear the “frequency, intensity and duration” of heatwaves was increasing across large parts of Australia. “Fire weather is also increasing since consistent records began in the 1970s,” it said. “There is a longer fire season and an increase in the occurrence of extreme fire days at the majority of sites studied in fire-prone regions of southern Australia.” In further advice designed to help bureau staff in a Senate estimates hearing, the bureau stated: “Individual weather events cannot be attributed to being caused by climate change. “However, climate projections show that heat events (and associated bushfire risk) are expected to occur more often and with greater intensity in the future. “There is a clear trend towards increasing temperature extremes that increase the probability of fire weather. Other factors include fuel load and dryness.” Earlier this year, Guardian Australia revealed how the federal Department of the Environment had rewritten references that linked extreme weather to climate change in its official online advice. A spokesman for Hunt told Guardian Australia: “The minister has reaffirmed his and the government’s fundamental belief in climate change on numerous occasions and indeed has released reports to that effect. “The minister repeatedly made this point in this and other interviews. The science is real, clear and unequivocal. “However, as the BOM director has stated in briefings, no single event can be directly attributed to climate change.” Asked whether he obtained his climate information from Wikipedia, Hunt told Fairfax: “This is an absolute distortion ... I must have done 200 interviews referring to the science and the scientists. This was an overseas [interviewer], who has no idea about the CSIRO. The point was that even the most basic sources will say Australia has always had massive bushfires.” Australia’s hottest year on record was in 2013, with temperatures 1.2C above the long-term average. Last week, research was released showing it would have been “virtually impossible” for last year’s heat to occur without human-induced climate change, primarily caused by the release of greenhouse gases."
"The transport sector has a key role to play in fighting climate change – but a little closer to home it should also be working to improve the health and wellbeing of the UK population. It’s a challenge all countries are grappling with, as the Public Leaders Network editor Jane Dudman discovered when she visited Kuala Lumpur, a city where 1,000 cars are registered every day.  One solution could lie in devolution of powers to cities and regions. Writing for the Guardian’s big energy debate series, Ruth Bradshaw, on the board of the Transport Planning Society, said that when responsibility for public health was transferred to local authorities, it marked a big leap forward for integration of transport and health objectives.   Meanwhile Labour MP Alan Whitehead wrote recently about the need for greater regulation to ensure green objectives are met by the sector. It’s important to build sustainability into new infrastructure projects, but this is not always the case. At a recent Guardian roundtable, professor Roderick Smith of Imperial College London said HS2 was being developed in a “policy vacuum”, with no assessment of how it would impact on CO2 emissions.  So how do we get greener, healthier transport systems across the whole of the UK?

"Canada has switched on the first large-scale coal-fired power plant fitted with a technology that proponents say enables the burning of fossil fuels without tipping the world into a climate catastrophe. The project, the first commercial-scale plant equipped with carbon capture and storage technology, was held up by the coal industry as a real life example that it is possible to go on burning the dirtiest of fossil fuels while avoiding dangerous global warming.  Saskatchewan’s state-owned electricity provider is due to cut the ribbon on the $1.3 billion Canadian project on Thursday. But officials from SaskPower International Inc told guests invited to the ceremony the 110 megawatt plant went live on Tuesday night. The Boundary Dam power plant promises to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 90% by trapping C02 underground before the gas reaches the atmosphere – making its opening a milestone in the coal industry’s efforts to remain viable in a low-carbon economy. The company said the project would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 1 million tons a year, or the equivalent of taking 250,000 cars off the road, in one of the more fossil fuel-dependent regions of Canada. Captured CO2 from the Boundary Dam project will be pumped underground and sold to the Cenovus oil company for use in priming nearby oil fields, or buried in geological formations. “Saskatchewan is number one in the world,” said Brad Page, the chief executive of the Global CCS Institute, said. “This is an incredibly important event from our perspective.” Scientists from the United Nations climate panel said last year that without broad deployment of CCS technology most of the world’s fossil fuel will have to stay in the ground to avoid dangerous climate change.  Page was cautious however in predicting CCS technology deployed at Boundary Dam would soon be replicated on a large-scale.  He noted the Saskatchewan plant relies on a local source of coal – and on selling on the CO2 to the oil industry – to keep it in the black. Coal also faces intense competition from historically low prices for natural gas, which makes it prohibitively expensive to build new coal plants with CCS. Even so, the opening of Boundary Dam represents a rare success story for the CCS industry.  The technology has not been fully embraced by the big US coal companies – which are still focused on opposing incoming power plant rules from the Environmental Protection Agency. CCS is also viewed with deep suspicion by environmental campaigners because its economic viability - so far - depends on using the CO2 to increase oil production, and because it is more expensive than renewable sources of energs. The technology of carbon capture and storage has been around for years. “This is not a moonshot,” Ian Yeates, the SaskPower executive in charge of CCS, told the Guardian earlier this year.  But projects combining power generation and CCS have faced long delays and cost overruns, and run into criticism for receiving government subsidies. A number have been scuttled altogether because of competition from historically low prices for natural gas. In Mississippi, Southern Company has spent more than $5.5 bn over the last six years trying to bring a new-built CCS project, the Kemper County Energy Facility, into operation. The opening is now delayed until mid-2015.  Only one other CCS project involving power generation is currently on the boards in the US, in Texas. Boundary Dam claimed its cost over-runs had nothing to do with the CCS technology, but in other construction issues involved in overhauling a 50-year-old power plant. Officials also said they were confident they could bring in the next such CCS project 25% cheaper. The plant received some CAD$240m in subsidies. But Yeates acknowledged that at this point the viability of the technology depended on having a nearby source of coal and an additional revenue stream from the enhanced oil recovery. “I think at this stage of the game, because the concept is so new, having a revenue stream from the CO2 is critical to help the economics. But I think eventually that will not be required,” he said. He said the company had seen a lot of interest in the CCS plant from China, India and other places which have large quantities of similar lignite coal.  “There are 7,000 coal-fired turbines on the planet right now and they are not going to be turned off any time soon because people need the energy they produce,” Yeates said. “Is there going to be enough gas to replace all those units? We are going to be burning fossil fuels as a world economy for many many decades if not a century or two as energy demands grow...something like carbon capture and sequestration will be of value to deal with that.” Prof Stuart Haszeldine, director of Scottish Carbon Capture & Storage, said: “Boundary Dam is working proof for naysayers, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that full-scale CCS on power generation now exists and works commercially to deliver electricity, with no subsidy.” He claimed the plant’s opening would “create ripples worldwide.”"
"The free market lobbying group, the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), has hit back at Google, which announced this week that it was leaving the network over its “lies” about climate change. Alec, a secretive organization that acts as a dating agency between largely Republican state politicians and big corporations by producing “model bills”, has released a letter (pdf) addressed to Google chairman Eric Schmidt, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and eight other executives. Signed by 156 state legislators who are active members of Alec, the letter expresses disappointment at comments made by Schmidt on National Public Radio (NPR) and strongly denies that Alec has anything to do with climate change denial. “The facts are: Alec recognizes that climate change is an important issue and just hosted a roundtable conversation for a variety of companies – including Google – on this very issue … The organizations that pressured you consistently conflate climate change denial with having significant concerns over government mandates, subsidies and climate regulations,” the letter says. Shortly after Alec’s rebuttal was released, two of the organizations it accused of mounting the pressure – the watchdogs the Center for Media and Democracy, and Forecast the Facts – released their own account of Alec’s record of climate change denial. They said that, at the network’s most recent meeting in Dallas, the president of the rightwing Heartland Institute Joseph Bast led a workshop in which a presentation was made that denounced the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which has produced some of the most authoritative accounts of global warming, as “not a credible source of science and economics”. The presentation went on to state that “there is no scientific consensus on the human role in climate change”, “global warming is not a crisis, the threat was exaggerated”, and “there is no need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and no point in attempting to do so.” The watchdogs also point out that a file called “top 10 myths about global warming” (pdf), written by the then head of Alec’s national resources taskforce, appeared on Alec’s website for many years. It has been a testing week for Alec in terms of its relationship with major technology companies. Schmidt laid into the network in an interview on NPR, when he said: “The facts of climate change are not in question anymore. Everyone understands climate change is occurring, and the people who oppose it are really hurting our children and our grandchildren and making the world a much worse place. And so we should not be aligned with such people – they’re just, they’re just literally lying.”  In the wake of Google’s outburst, Yahoo dropped its Alec membership, Facebook said it was unlikely to renew next year and Yelp said its membership had lapsed. The tension with the technology companies follows a run of bad news for Alec which came heavily under fire for its dissemination around the country of stand-your-ground laws in the fallout to the Florida shooting of the black teenager, Trayvon Martin. Desperate to regain corporate members and shore up its ailing finances, Alec put together a list of companies it wished to woo back under the title “the Prodigal Son Project”."
"With the beat of a wing, the splash of a flipper, or the stomp of a hoof, they’re off. As the seasons start to turn, animals gather in every corner of the world. Assembling in groups measured in millions, travelling thousands of miles through air, water and snow, they often have one thing in common: the search for food. “Generally, most migrations are driven by food and its seasonal availability,” says Dr Grant Hopcraft from Glasgow University. “That changes either across things like latitude – for instance, birds flying from the tropical regions to the temperate zones – or often you also have animals moving up elevation gradients, such as elk in North America moving up the Rockies. An excess of food allows animals to put on weight quickly and if you get fat fast, it means you can [produce] offspring.” While working in the Serengeti, Hopcraft and his team have been able to track wildebeest and zebra using GPS collars as they travel. But this is only one of many methods employed by scientists over the years to work out where animals roam. “Some of the traditional techniques have been aerial censuses, and more recently, camera traps. In some animals they’re using [chemical] isotopes [in teeth], because isotopes can give quite a defined signature of the location of an animal at a specific time,” says Hopcraft. What these migrations tell us can be very interesting: “Here is an organism, a biological indicator that is sampling a huge part of the globe within a year, in fact sometimes within just one month.” While they travel vast distances, crossing oceans and continents, these animals can also help us to understand the spread of diseases such as the 2004 outbreak of Avian flu (H5N1) in Asia. As humans continue to alter the environment and climate change progresses, this poses many problems for migrating species. “I think [climate change] is the pressing question at the forefront of the minds of people who are studying migrations,” Hopcraft says. “Migrants have typically evolved over systems which are very predictable, and suddenly we’re potentially going into a period of time which is less predictable.” Even with many migrations in decline due to mankind’s meddling, there is a glimmer of hope. The past 50 years has seen the population of wildebeest in the Serengeti rise to a tumultuous 1.3 million animals thundering across the savannah as they chase the rains. This has been down to a number of aspects, including the eradication of rinderpest (introduced by European farmers), the successful management of tourism, and allowing the herbivores to migrate in a landscape free of barriers. “I kind of like to think of migrations as inhalations and exhalations of a healthy ecosystem,” says Hopcraft. “If their populations decline ... then that’s a fairly good indicator that something global, something big, is happening.”"

"The Daily Mail has an extensive list of bugbears – migrants, the BBC, press regulation and Stephen Fry among them – but the latest target of the paper’s wrath is respected medical journal the BMJ. Apparently in its latest issue the journal dares to describe global warming as a “public health emergency”. Under a story headlined “Fury as top medical journal joins the green bandwagon”, the Mail attacks the BMJ’s stance, describing the move as “bizarre”. It thunders: “the journal has set aside 11 pages of this week’s issue to warn doctors of the dire consequences of global warming – without any obvious relevance to medicine”. Its story leans heavily on critical quotes from Lord Lawson’s climate sceptic thinktank the Global Warming Policy Forum, which describes the BMJ report as “alarmist” and “desperate”. But what of the “fury” described in the headline? Monkey can find nothing in the story to back it up – perhaps the rage was limited to the Mail editor’s office."
"As former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently noted, local leadership and action is crucial for reducing the impacts of dangerous climate change. Initiatives by cities, he argued, “will save lives, they’ll strengthen and protect the national economies, they’ll make cities more healthy and economically vibrant, and together they’ll make a difference in the global fight against climate change”.  The management of our cities, especially major cities like Melbourne which are moving beyond a manufacturing-based economy and experiencing rapid growth, presents a major opportunity.  Projections of climate change for Victoria and for Melbourne were presented by CSIRO in 2007 and the state department of sustainability and environment in 2008. Average temperatures in Melbourne are expected to rise, even in a “low emissions” scenario.  By 2070, average temperatures in Melbourne will be around 1.0 to 2.5°C hotter than the 1990s, double to five times more warming than occurred from 1910 to 1990. The number of days above 35°C in Melbourne is projected to more than double by 2070 in a “high emissions” scenario. Winter rainfall is estimated to drop by 12% by 2070. This could lead to reductions in average annual stream-flow of 7-35% by 2050. Increases in sea level are occurring too, and more extreme weather events, such as heat waves, frosts, floods, and droughts, are predicted. Increases in the frequency and intensity of heat waves in Melbourne affect human health and infrastructure. They lead to increased hospital admissions for heat stress and associated illnesses, as well as increased mortality, such as was experienced in late January and early February 2009, with the heat waves leading up to the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria. Impacts on infrastructure include speed restrictions on the metropolitan railway lines due to bending of tracks, cancellations of trains because of failure of cooling systems, and reductions of electrical power transmission from Tasmania through BassLink. These types of infrastructure may also be vulnerable to flash flooding caused by extreme rainfall events, as well as damage caused by storms and heavy winds. But sea-level rise is expected to be the most significant climate-change issue for coastal areas of Melbourne including the high-density cities of Melbourne and Port Phillip, due to the associated impacts of coastal erosion and storm surge.  The extreme storm surge associated with a 1-in-100-year storm today potentially will become a 1-in-20 year annual storm surge event by 2070 due to sea-level rise.  By 2070, inundation from a 1-in-100 year storm could affect more than 1,000 existing dwellings and property to a value of approximately $780 million. This would have impacts on high-density urban renewal areas such as Docklands and Fishermans Bend, which are only a few metres above sea level. There is increasing evidence that the biggest obstacles to rapid implementation of large-scale de-carbonisation strategies are political and social, rather than technological.  Key political roadblocks include denial of the necessity and urgency of action, the influence of the fossil-fuel industry and its allies, political “short-termism”, and governance constraints. The Victorian state government’s metropolitan planning strategy Plan Melbourne identifies “a changing climate” as one of the key pressures facing Melbourne, but does so using highly ambiguous language without a clear need for action.  It is therefore not surprising that, while Plan Melbourne includes discussion of key challenges such as energy efficiency and supply, waste management, water, and food security, it falls well short of providing a comprehensive program. Climate change is treated as a discrete area of the plan, rather than a key principle running through other areas, such as population growth, economic productivity, and transport infrastructure.  This tendency to downplay the link between climate change and extreme weather events is consistent with the ongoing reluctance of Victorian governments and authorities to fully address these linkages, for example, the failure of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into the 2009 Black Saturday Bushfires to explicitly address climate-change risks. The City of Melbourne’s approach is significantly more promising. Its emissions reduction strategy provides a comprehensive overview of opportunities for reducing emissions across Council operations, buildings, and systems, including a “game-changing” combination of initiatives driving a rapid transition to a zero-emissions CBD comprising switching to renewable energy (50%), reducing energy used by city buildings (40%), and reducing energy lost from the grid (10%).  Its climate-change adaptation strategy discusses expanding storm-water harvesting and re-use, tackling the urban heat-island effect through heat-wave response action plans, actively planning to control the consequences of sea-level rise, and developing sophisticated communication and warning systems to respond to extreme-weather events. The City of Melbourne has also recently been selected to be a member of the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities program. This will fund the creation of a chief resilience officer position and provide other support to develop a resilience strategy for the whole of metropolitan Melbourne. Other municipalities are also taking positive steps. The cities of Moreland and Yarra have set up the Moreland Energy Foundation and the Yarra Energy Foundation respectively. These independent not-for-profit organisations support local residents and businesses in moving towards a zero-carbon society, including by advising on and helping with the installation of solar panels and improving the energy efficiency of buildings. There needs to be a clear and unequivocal public commitment by the premier of Victoria and the mayors of Melbourne’s municipalities to achieve a swift transition to a just and resilient zero-carbon economy, including setting emissions reduction targets informed by the most robust and up-to-date climate science. Climate-change action must be a key objective in the implementation of Plan Melbourne’s initiatives, tasking the Metropolitan Planning Authority with both the responsibility and power to take action, including legislated targets of zero emissions by 2020.  In particular, an implementation plan for Plan Melbourne’s transport objectives must feature a greater emphasis on environmental goals, including making public transport more attractive and improving conditions for active travel (such as cycling and walking), as well as moving from petrol- and gas-fuelled vehicles to electric vehicles. Carbon emissions standards for all new buildings, taking into account energy use throughout their lifetimes, must be implemented, as well as programs for retrofitting of existing buildings, including through energy-efficient heating and cooling. The energy-related activities of the cities of Moreland and Yarra should be scaled up to establish the Melbourne Energy Foundation, with a renewable energy plan based on the goal of achieving 100% renewable energy within 10 years. The key feature of this plan would be a rapid phase-out of all Victorian coal-fired power stations and coal mining, and an immediate end to all public subsidies and tax concessions to fossil-fuel industries. However, this would need to be complemented by support for communities affected by the phase-out of fossil-fuel-based industries, mobilisation of investment for renewable energy sources (such as wind power, solar photo-voltaics, and solar thermal), and accelerating the electrification of household and industrial heating and cooling. It is imperative that Melbourne takes serious action on climate change, both in reducing emissions and in reducing vulnerability to the impacts of climate-change. Climate change must be seen as a key issue intrinsically bound up in the city’s wellbeing and prominent in decision-making for the city’s future. The time to act is now. Professor John Wiseman is the deputy director of the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute. Professor David Karoly is professor of atmospheric science at the University of Melbourne. Alexander Sheko is a research associate at the University of Melbourne. This is an edited extract from the chapter ‘Cool Melbourne: Towards a Sustainable and Resilient Zero Carbon City in a Hotter World’ in the forthcoming ebook Melbourne: What Next?  In collaboration with the University of Melbourne’s Election Watch, Guardian Australia will be running a series of articles from the ebook, which will be available for free download from 6pm on 17 October. http://tinyurl.com/melbwhatnext"

"France promised $1bn to a near-empty climate change fund for poor countries on Tuesday and called for the establishment of a new green economy in the first concrete result of a milestone United Nations summit. The pledge came on a day of impassioned speeches from some 120 presidents and prime ministers – as well as a cameo by the actor and now UN ambassador Leonardo DiCaprio – telling the summit they had wasted precious time and now needed to deal urgently with climate change.  Both China and America, the world’s two biggest emitters, pledged their support for a climate deal, without offering specifics. Chinese vice-premier Zhang Gaoli said his country’s emissions would peak “as soon as possible”, and pledged $6m to help developing countries fight climate change. Barack Obama, in a stirring address, said America would lead efforts to reach a global compact on climate change. “We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last to be able to do anything about it,” he told the summit. David Cameron touted his government’s environmental policies. “As prime minister I pledged to lead the greenest government ever and I believe we have kept that promise,” he said. But leaders from Africa and the Pacific islands threatened by rising seas said rich countries needed to do more. “We must get away from the ‘wait and see who is doing what’ style of leadership before deciding what needs to be done,” said Anote Tong, the president of Kiribati, which could be drowned by rising seas. The summit – the first such gathering of world leaders in five years – was convened to move countries towards an international agreement in Paris to fight climate change by the end of next year. The French leader, François Hollande, said it would be impossible to reach such a deal without laying the foundations of a new green economy. “We need to define a new economy for the world.” “You can’t fight climate change without development,” he said, pledging $1bn (£600m) to a fund to help poor countries deal with climate change. The Green Climate Fund was founded in 2010. UN officials and developing-country diplomats have said repeatedly it will not be possible to reach a deal in Paris without a significant fund for the countries which did the least to cause climate change but will bear the brunt of its effects. Officials had been hoping to raise $10bn to $15bn by the end of the year. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, made the first significant pledge last July, committing $1bn. South Korea, which hosts the fund, also committed $100m yesterday. But the fund remains well below its goal. The shortfall matched the plaintive calls from presidents and prime ministers who said the United Nations and world leaders had been talking about the threat of climate change for years – without actually following through on action. “Why today are we still so passive and so dispersed that we do not have a common strategy for the fight against climate change? Why can we not agree on a pragmatic strategy in the fight against climate change?” Ali Bongo Ondimba, th president of Gabon, told the summit. The summit did produce other agreements – in addition to cash – but these too were relatively modest. Some of the world’s biggest palm oil and paper producers committed to stop destructive logging by 2030, and restore a huge area of forest equivalent to the size of India. Nigel Purvis, the chief executive of the Climate Advisers consultancy which worked to get the deal, said: “This is like if Exxon Mobil and the Koch brothers got together to cut greenhouse gas emissions.” But Brazil – despite its critical role protecting the Amazon rain forest – said it was left out of the negotiations, and a number of campaign groups did not sign onto the agreement saying it did not go far enough to protect the rights of indigenous people who rely on the forest, or to hold the big forestry companies to account. “I think that it’s impossible to think that you can have a global forest initiative without Brazil on board. It doesn’t make sense,” Izabella Texeira, the Brazil environment minister, told the Associated Press."

"Computer giant IBM last week revealed the prototype of its advanced solar electricity generators: a 30ft-high concrete “sunflower” fitted with wafer-thin aluminium mirrors and a maze of tiny tubes for carrying coolant through the heart of each device. The machines, which will be built in conjunction with the Swiss company Airlight Energy, can convert 80% of the sun’s radiation into electricity and hot water, it is claimed, with each generating 12 kilowatts of electricity and 20kW of heat on a sunny day, enough to supply several homes. At the device’s official unveiling in Zurich, executives for both companies said they hoped that by 2017, when their sunflower generators should be ready for the market, they could be manufactured for half to one-third of the cost of comparable solar converters today. According to IBM, the machine’s secret lies with the microscopic tubes that carry water through the cluster of photovoltaic chips at the heart of each device. This system has already been adopted by IBM to cool its high-performance supercomputers. “We were inspired by the branched blood supply of the human body,” said Bruno Michel, from the IBM Research laboratories in Zurich.  The sunflower operates by tracking the sun so that it always points in the best direction for collecting its rays; these are then focused on to a cluster of photovoltaic cells that are mounted on a raised platform. The cells convert solar radiation into electricity. However, without the microchannel cooling system, which carries distilled water through the chips, temperatures would reach more than 1,000C. With the microcooling system, which carries water to within a few millimetres of the back of each chip, temperatures are kept down to 90C – a far safer, and far more efficient, operating level. Electricity is generated while the system also produces large amounts of hot water from the cooling system. “That hot water is a game changer,” added Michel. “Electricity is obviously vitally useful but so is the heat – for we can use it for desalinating water.” At present, about 1.3 billion people have no access to electricity. However, that figure is dwarfed by the number – 2.5 billion – who have no access to proper sanitation. And according to figures supplied by Airlight Energy, that latter number is currently increasing at a rate of 9% a year. However, the IBM-Airlight sunflower is designed to tackle both problems. The electricity will have numerous uses while the hot water can be pumped through desalinators that use porous membranes to boil salt water and distil the result into pure, drinkable water. A large installation made up of several generators could provide enough fresh water for an entire town, it was claimed at last week’s launch. Apart from sites in Africa, the Middle East and Australia, it is hoped the sunflower system will be used for remote hospitals, hotels and holiday resorts. IBM says it will instal its first two devices for free in 2016 and has asked towns around the world to put their names forward to be the first to have a solar sunflower erected on their land."

"The plight of thousands of walruses forced to crowd on to an Alaska beach because of disappearing sea ice has set off an all-out response from the US government to avoid a catastrophic stampede. The Federal Aviation Authority has re-routed flights, and local communities have called on bush pilots to keep their distance in an effort to avoid setting off a panic that could see scores of walruses trampled to death, federal government scientists told reporters.    Curiosity seekers and the media have also been asked to stay away.   An estimated 35,000 walruses were spotted on the barrier island in north-western Alaska on 27 September by scientists on an aerial survey flight.   The biggest immediate risk factor for the walruses now is a stampede – especially for baby walruses – but they have been facing a growing threat from climate change, the scientists said.  The extraordinary sighting – the biggest known exodus of walruses to dry land ever observed in the Arctic under US control – arrived as the summer sea ice fell to its sixth lowest in the satellite record last month.  “Those animals have essentially run out of offshore sea ice, and have no other choice but to come ashore,” said Chadwick Jay, a research ecologist in Alaska with the US Geological Survey. Until 2007, it was unheard of for walruses to leave the sea ice for dry land for prolonged periods of time. But the retreat of sea ice has seen “drastic changes” in behaviour, Jay said. Walruses have struck out for beaches in six of the last eight years.  He said there was no doubt the migration – or “hauling out” as it is called – was caused by climate change.   “It is really a reduction in the sea ice that is causing the change in behaviour, and the reduction of sea ice is due to global warming,” Jay said.  But the immediate concern was to avoid a stampede – a leading risk factor for walruses when they crowd onto beaches and barrier islands.  The FAA is asking pilots to remain above 2,000ft and half a mile away from the walruses. Helicopters – a bigger risk to the walruses because they are noisier – have been asked to remain 3,000ft up and a mile away. News crews, which have been clamouring to film the walruses, have also been asked to stay away. “The government and local communities are respectfully asking you to leave the haul-out alone,” Joel Garlich Miller, a Walrus biologist with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, told reporters. Walruses are naturally skittish animals, unused to being closely packed together. They also spend 80% of their time on water. Those in the Chukchi sea this time of year are generally females and juveniles and so at greater risk of being trampled to death.  “You have all these animals that are normally distributed on a flat surface. When they lose their sea ice habitat and come ashore in places that are accessible – like flat, sandy beaches – they gather in large numbers, and it becomes like a giant pig pile,” said Margaret Williams, managing director for the World Wildlife Fund’s Arctic program. “When they are disturbed it can cause stampedes in large numbers.”  The walruses were first observed at Point Ley on 12 September, the scientists said. Since that initial sighting of an estimated 10,000 walruses, their numbers have fluctuated – falling to as few as 1,500 on 23 September. However, the scientists cautioned these were very preliminary estimates.  The survey flights have also spotted walrus carcasses on the beach – 50 last week, and another 36 on 27 September. There were signs of both brown bears and polar bears in the area. Hauling out of walruses have become increasingly frequent since 2000 – as warming creates bigger expanses of open water in the summer months. The US Fish and Wildlife Service is considering expanding protections for walruses as an endangered species.  The sea ice was especially low this year, off Alaska and eastern Siberia, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Summer sea ice cover fell to 1.94m sq miles on 17 September, according to the NSIDC, forcing the walruses on to land.  Those forays on to land have frequently proved deadly in the past, because of stampedes and competition for food. Scientists have recorded mass deaths of walruses due to stampedes following such landings in Russia.  “We have seen this phenomenon in terms of high concentrations of walruses that has been occurring on the Russian coast for some time in huge numbers. There are high rates of walrus mortality, especially in calves – babies,” said Williams.  In addition to the stampede risk, it is also much harder for the walruses to hunt from the beach. The walruses typically disperse over large expanses of water, uses ice floes as a platform to hunt for the clams and other shell fish that are their main food source.

"Forests provide benefits few of us appreciate. They store carbon and mitigate the impacts of climate change, preserve biodiversity and ecosystem stability. They provide resources we all use, and more than a billion people around the world depend on forests directly for their livelihoods.  But forests are under more pressure today than ever. Between 2000 and 2012, the world lost a net 1.5 million square kilometres of tree cover, an area roughly the size of Mongolia. The clearing and burning of forests is responsible for between 12-20% of greenhouse gas emissions. In response, a major declaration on forests was signed at the UN climate summit in September, committing to end global deforestation by 2030. But one major barrier to curbing the destruction of forests around the world remains: the lack of reliable data that tells us precisely when and where it’s happening.  To fill this data gap, we created Global Forest Watch (GFW) – an online platform combining hundreds of thousands of satellite images, high-tech data processing and crowd-sourcing, to provide near-real time data on the world’s forests. Our goal is to enable governments, companies, NGOs, and the public to better manage forests, track illegal deforestation and more.  But big data comes with big challenges. From the start, GFW grappled with a lack of public data, barriers to participation, and confusion over terminology. In our experience, these challenges are common to data-driven initiatives that aim to enable public use of big data. So as we push forward with Global Forest Watch, we thought we would share a few lessons that might help other big data initiatives seeking to tackle climate change.  It can be difficult to manage the process of opening up previously exclusive data – like the locations of concessions for logging, agriculture, and mining – for public use. Global Forest Watch compares this data with satellite-detected tree cover loss to determine where harmful or illegal activities might be taking place. Governments may release official deforestation statistics, but not simple ways for the public to verify these numbers. And without a history of public data-sharing, even virtuous countries, companies, and researchers may be reluctant to share their information, for fear of losing control over how it would be used. Despite these concerns, many groups have embraced open and transparent data recently. In June, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil released via GFW the first detailed public maps of their certified concessions, which Global Forest Watch now uses in its analyses. As the open data movement slowly gains trust and traction, big data tools like GFW will have more and more material to work with. Satellite images and data processing techniques can only do part of the work. Global Forest Watch was built to allow users to contribute their own data to provide local context, such as: maps of protected areas, concessions, or land ownership, or short stories explaining why forests were lost, regrown, or conserved in a particular area. However, despite hundreds of thousands of visitors to the GFW website, relatively few submitted their own data or content. So we have learned that outreach on the ground is indispensable and are now showcasing GFW for governments, local communities, and businesses around the world. We have also been looking for ways to better engage users online. We are now working with TomNod, a crowdsourcing platform that is part of Digital Globe, a GFW partner, that uses ultra-high resolution satellite imagery to identify areas in Indonesia where forests and other sensitive ecosystems have been cleared by fire for agriculture or due to land conflict. These detailed satellite pictures have prompted almost 300,000 “tags” on the images, identifying over 24,000 active fires. This data will be posted online for the public and law enforcement officials. Providing data on forests for both technical experts and the broad public requires caution in defining key terms and describing exactly what the data show. The term “forest” is particularly fraught, with many countries and experts defining forest by different thresholds for canopy cover, some including “plantation forests” in their definition, while others exclude it. “Deforestation” is even more confusing, with over 800 competing definitions. Satellites tend to be agnostic to such definitional questions and, without extensive additional analysis, measure only tree cover loss, showing where trees were but no longer are or vice versa. Without consistent definitions, there is increased risk that the data on GFW may be misinterpreted, or dismissed as not relevant. Clarifying and responding to critiques and inquiries about the data has therefore become a major priority for the project, along with continually improving response to such feedback. It has also inspired new research efforts, including an extensive project to map the extent of degradation in the world’s pristine intact forests, and an initiative to map plantation forests in key countries across the world. So while finding definitions that everyone can agree on may not always be possible, we discovered that that there is much that can be done to provide options for those with different priorities.  As we see it, these challenges are not unique to the development of GFW but are hurdles that anyone working in the sphere of big data for the environment needs to tackle. The big lesson is that the big data revolution is under way, and we can all play a role by demanding transparency, contributing our efforts and feedback to science-based platforms where we can, and supporting efforts that confront climate change with timely and accurate data.

"In August 2014, the Australian parliament voted to repeal a scheme that placed a price on carbon emissions. The carbon price was working as intended: reducing carbon emissions while supporting continued economic growth. Australia was once a leader in dealing with climate change; seven years after ratifying the Kyoto protocol, it is now something approaching an international pariah.  This is how the New York Times responded to the scrapping of the carbon price scheme:  At a time when president Obama is seeking emissions limits on new and existing power plants, and when many scientists are arguing for major reductions in fossil-fuel use by 2050 to keep global warming within manageable limits, Australia – among the world’s highest emitters per capita of carbon dioxide – has chosen to become an outlier.  Slate went further, condemning the “rapacious policies of the current government”. In an article headed The Saudi Arabia of the South Pacific, it told its readers how Australia became the dirtiest polluter in the developed world. Strictly speaking, both publications are wrong. Australia is not alone; it constitutes one half of the Canada-Australia axis of carbon.  Not to put too fine a point on it, since the election of the Abbott government in September 2013, Australian politics has become fruitier than a tarte tatin. Nuttier than a pecan pie. It feels as if the Enlightenment never reached these shores. And climate policy is but one victim of the malaise. An explanation to the world, if not an apology, is warranted.  *** According to Credit Suisse, Australia is the wealthiest country in the world. It has enjoyed a stellar run of 23 consecutive years of economic growth. It ducked the great recession thanks to a textbook Keynesian stimulus response combined with the momentum of an unprecedented mining boom. Yet to live in the frequently irate bubble that is contemporary Australia is to be subjected to persistent and shrill cries of “crisis” or “catastrophe” over productivity, red tape, security, debt and deficit, emergency low interest rates, sovereign risk and border protection.  Take the latter, formerly known as immigration policy. For the last 15 years, Australia has struggled with a modest proportion of the world’s 54m asylum seekers arriving on its shores by boat. To punish the new arrivals and deter others fleeing from Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Iraq and Syria, government policy has sought to replicate the misery that prompted them to flee their home countries. A multitude of measures have been tested along the way. Of them all, two have endured: outsourcing and human rights abuses.  Money has not been an impediment. Australia has bought off neighbouring Pacific island states, including Nauru and Papua New Guinea, to induce them to incarcerate refugees – men, women and children – until some of them end up physically and mentally broken. Many self-harm. Some die. Others have been sent home to be tortured or even killed. One asylum seeker detained on PNG’s Manus Island recently died from complications arising from a cut on his foot. Last week, Australia forged a new deal with impoverished, corruption-ridden Cambodia under which five refugees whose will have been broken on Nauru will “voluntarily” be resettled there. Officials from both countries celebrated with champagne at a ceremony in Phnomh Penh. There were no speeches, and journalists were not permitted to ask questions. Immigration policy in Australia also proves once and for all that religion can be invoked by its adherents to rationalise almost anything. While former PM Kevin Rudd briefly flirted with the “biblical injunction to welcome strangers”, his conservative nemesis and current prime minister Tony Abbott asked: “What would Jesus do?” The answer was obvious, at least to him: “Jesus knew that there was a place for everything and it is not necessarily everyone’s place to come to Australia”. *** If Australia mistreated refugees to deter others, is repealing a price on damaging carbon emissions so hard to understand? Prime minister Abbott once famously described climate science as “crap”; he typifies a discernible demographic trend in his country. For white men aged 50 and over, climate change skepticism seems to be our new national sport, perhaps even more popular than golf.  But it’s not just climate science that has been shunned. For the first time in 70 years, Australia is without a science minister. Why? The government refused to appoint one. Why? Because it can. Instead, the government appointed a gaggle of older, right wing businessmen and lobbyists to key advisory roles. They include David Murray, Maurice Newman, Tony Shepherd, Dick Warburton.  Cardinal George Pell, while not appointed to a government role, enjoys a close relationship with the prime minister and has been described as a spiritual adviser of his. In the face of thousands of cases of child sexual assault by Catholic clergy in recent decades, Pell has been effective: the Church’s assets and wealth remain intact. With such business acumen, Pell is well-credentialled to offer a view on climate science and climate change. He doesn’t buy it, and doesn’t trust the scientific consensus. Maurice Newman, appointed chairman of the prime minister’s Business Advisory Council, recently argued that Australia needs to get match fit to tackle the scourge of “climate cooling”. Newman is right that Australia is completely unprepared for this scourge. So, it seems, is its climate. So unprepared that 2013 was the hottest year on record.  Newman has now turned his campaign against the employees of the Bureau of Meteorology, demanding a judicial inquiry into their methods. In the last year, Australians have endured an unsteady procession of fringe politics straight from the Republic of The Giant Tin Foil Hat. Outlandish pronouncements from a crusade of conservative politicians have covered the big issues. Sex. Science. Animals. Abortion. Burqas. More Sex. Breasts. Muslims. Cars. This is a land where, according to treasurer Joe Hockey, “poor people don’t drive cars”. And if they did, they may be exposed to the “utterly offensive” sight of wind turbines, “a blight on the landscape”. Hockey has declared war on “the age of entitlement”, and the accompanying belief that “one person has a right to a good or service that someone else will pay for.” Like roads, hospitals and schools. As it happens, spending on welfare has been decreasing as a proportion of GDP for years. As has health spending. Shortly after scrapping the carbon pricing scheme and making it cheaper to emit carbon, the Abbott government sought to introduce a tax on going to the doctor to send a “price signal” to deter unnecessary visits. The horse hockey doesn’t stop there. The nation’s top law officer, attorney general George Brandis, mounted a spirited, if unsuccessful, campaign in favour of the fundamental human freedom: the “right to be a bigot” and incite racial hatred. When that failed, Brandis turned his hand to foreign affairs, unilaterally declaring that East Jerusalem was no longer an “occupied territory” but instead was a “disputed territory”. Even the Israeli government was nonplussed. Minister for workplace relations Eric Abetz recently invoked that well-known link between women who undergo an abortion and a heightened risk of breast cancer. That was the link discredited by medical science 50 years ago. Australia’s answer to the Tea party is senator Cory Bernardi. In response to Abbott’s belated urging for all Australians to unite against Islamic terrorism and join “Team Australia”, Bernardi launched a campaign to ban the burqa. On 1 October, the Australian parliament duly proclaimed that visitors sporting burqas would be required to sit behind a glass partition in a space usually preserved for young children. That there has never been a visitor to the Australian parliament dressed in a burqa is a mere technicality. Bernardi is a tireless activist against legalising gay marriage, arguing that it is but one step away from legalising bestiality. Bernardi’s stance has earned him widespread condemnation, including from the British conservative party. Why has the Australian body politic removed its head and replaced it with a pumpkin? A simple answer to this question is elusive. Like a strange new virus, it’s easier to describe the symptoms than to isolate the cause. However one rationalises the slide into irrationality, what is happening in Australia is not unique. In 2012, Will Hutton argued that the political right across the west was “giving up on the Enlightenment” and in doing so rejecting “tolerance, reason, democratic argument, progress and the drive for social betterment as cornerstones of society.” The US, UK, South Africa and parts of Europe have not been immune.  Now, it’s the turn of Team Australia and the end result is there for all to see: Australians are rich, angry and easily frightened – and we’re not gonna take it anymore."
"Rich states that bean-count their climate aid contributions are threatening the prospect of a climate deal being agreed in Paris next year, French leaders say. By 2020, a $100bn-a-year (£62bn-a-year) green climate fund has been pledged to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate disruption. And the UN has set itself a fundraising target of $10bn (£6.2bn) for the end of this year.  But so far, just $2.3bn (£1.4bn) has been banked, despite pledges of $1bn (£620m) each by France and Germany at a UN climate summit in New York last month. The former French prime minister, Laurent Fabius, told a conference in Paris on Saturday that even though the meeting hosted by Ban Ki-Moon had been positive, “the financing commitments were just not there”. “It is fine and dandy to have these summits but a lot of countries still need to contribute funds,” he added. Nicolas Hulot, the country’s special envoy on climate change, told the Guardian that the matter would have to be settled well before next year’s summit, if a successor deal to the Kyoto protocol is to be thrashed out. Otherwise, “this will put the multilateral process at risk because of legitimate defiance by the most vulnerable countries in the global south,” he said. “Anyone can understand why countries which are victims of natural events – for which they are not responsible – expect minimal solidarity from states that have the capacity to contribute. Their defiance is understandable. If we want to have them around the table in 2015, we need first to make clear what our financial commitments are. For my part, I consider it an absolute precondition.” Many poor countries have expressed concerns about counting private sector finance in the proposed international fund, fearing cherry-picking and profit-taking by companies with little interest in their plight. Hulot said this was a valid perspective because of past experience and “for the respective proportion of grants and loans, I tend to think that 50-50 would be something quite realistic”.  Most climate funding promises to vulnerable countries made at the Copenhagen summit in 2009 were not kept, he noted, and unblocking the process now would require commitments from the world’s richest states. “The first country on my priority list is the US,” Hulot said. “I can well understand the difficulty of a legally binding agreement for the US but its hard to understand why president Obama came to the New York summit without any announcement on this matter. Everyone knows that on financing, this is the main bottleneck to enable other states to come forward.” The French goal is a universal and legally binding treaty in 2015, with a “differentiated approach” that takes account of development criteria. But no decision has yet been taken on whether a deal based on national commitments could be accepted. Climate action foot-draggers such as Russia, Canada, Japan and Australia will be presented with reasoning from the US department of defence, which shows that global warming poses a threat to geopolitical security on a par with terrorism. The EU’s outgoing climate commissioner, Connie Hedegaard, told the conference that a European summit later this month would be a vital staging post on the road to Paris. “It is essential that our leaders on 23 October get their act together and agree on the climate and energy targets for 2030 so that investors know where they’re going,” she said. “Don’t be mistaken; if we don’t do this in October, no one thinks it will happen in December, when the EU discusses economic strategy so then you are into the first quarter of 2015 and the EU will not be able to pull its weight in the runup to Paris.”"
"Street protests, petitions and a row over undeclared financial interests heralded the start of parliamentary hearings into the suitability of former oil mogul Miguel Arias Cañete to be the EU’s next climate and energy commissioner. Hundreds of protestors – some dressed in Cañete face masks – gathered outside the European parliament, while the online activist group Avaaz, which has collected 300,000 signatures against Cañete’s candidacy, claimed that thousands of angry constituents had been phoning in complaints to their MEPs.  “This is pretty big in the sense that the petition was only launched about 24 hours ago,” said Luis Morago, Avaaz’s campaign director. “People normally don’t care about the formal appointment of a commissioner but the number of signatories shows that citizens at large can see the scandal that will develop if this man, with his huge conflict of interests, is appointed as a climate leader.” Cañete changed his members’ declaration of interests on Tuesday to include payments for acting as chairman of the election committee of Spain’s ruling Parti Popular. A PP spokesman told El Pais that he had “possibly forgotten” to declare these earlier. Jordi Sebastien, a Spanish Green MEP, linked the revelation to a financial scandal that has hit the PP over an alleged slush fund used for funnelling payments from big business to politicians. “He has changed his members’ declaration of interests twice in recent weeks,” Sebastien told the Guardian. “It means that he has a ‘dark’ interest that public opinion now knows about.” Some environmentally-focused MEPs, such as the German conservative Peter Liese, have defended Cañete as a stalwart supporter of a strong carbon price in votes during the last parliament. But the nomination of the former agriculture minister, who El Pais described as “always being on the edge of a conflict of interests,” has been controversial from the outset. A former president of two oil companies, Cañete sold his shareholdings in Petrologis Canarias and Ducor SL, but his brother-in-law Miguel Domecq is a director of both. His son Arias has resigned as a board member at Ducor. Cañete’s approval will partly depend on the strength of his performance in the three hour grilling by parliaments environment and industry committees, which began at 5pm on Wednesday. More telling though may be the adhesiveness of a gentleman’s agreement between the new parliament’s two biggest groupings, the Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and European Peoples Party (EPP). This is based on a Mexican stand-off in which the EPP would vote down the S&D nominee for economic commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, if Cañete is rejected at an MEP’s co-ordination committee on Thursday. Jo Leinen, a S&D MEP on the environment committee claimed that a lack of clarity about Canete’s business affairs was creating a groundswell for rejection of Cañete among socialist MEPs. “I would say that our group is negative towards him as there are too many conflicts of interest and his financial declaration was problematic,” he said. “One has a problem to trust him on the climate portfolio.” That view was echoed outside the parliament by Molly Walsh, 29, a protester from Ireland.  “I don’t think someone with such close connections to the oil industry is a good person to be Europe’s climate and energy commissioner,” she said. “I think that oil connections and fossil fuels distort how our democracy works and corporate power and influence is increased when these types of people are given top jobs.”"
"A very recent study released in JAMA (Climate Change: Challenges and Opportunities for Global Health) provides a very thorough review showing how climate change affects human health. Perhaps more importantly, the paper also describes how tackling climate change leads to many health and economic benefits. Authors Jonathan Patz, Howard Frumkin and colleagues combined a survey of the current literature with measured and projected changes to climate to assess health risks associated with climate change. They report many things that we already know. For instance, some of the adverse health effects from climate change are heat-related (such as heat stress, increased cardiac arrests, reductions in work productivity, to name a few).   Others, such as decreased respiratory health (from changes to ground level pollution associated with climate change or increases in pollens for example), increases in infectious diseases, decreased food security, and more mental stress are just some of the lesser reported effects we are seeing and will continue to see. The authors conclude, Evidence over the past 20 years indicates that climate change can be associated with adverse health outcomes. Health care professionals have an important role in understanding and communicating the related potential health concerns and the co-benefits from reducing greenhouse gas emissions. First let’s talk more about these health impacts, then we will get to so-called co-benefits. It’s clear that some changes are happening to our climate and weather. For instance, heat waves, floods, extreme precipitation, and droughts are happening with greater severity in different parts of the globe. These changes, associated with human emissions of greenhouse gases, can be dealt with by either mitigation (stopping climate change), adaptation (dealing with climate change as it occurs), or both. The authors propose various adaptation strategies including more robust infrastructure, increased public green spaces, and white roofs (as just three examples). Information about extreme heat waves was determined from downscaled climate models that take global or regional climate information and bring it to a more local level. They also obtained ground level temperature and ozone measurements from the US Environmental Protection Agency and nicely show that temperature and ground-level ozone are tightly connected. It should be noted here that ozone in the upper part of the atmosphere (often termed the ozone layer) helps us by blocking high-energy solar radiation which can cause a variety of health effects. However, near the ground, in the air we breathe, ozone is a harmful pollutant. With the information described above and from other literature, the authors report that the health impacts of a warming planet can be significant – they can also be under-reported. For instance, during very hot episodes, deaths recorded to cardiac arrest may actually be caused initially by elevated body temperatures – although the officially reported cause of death may not reflect this fact. But, even with the under-reporting of heat-related health impacts, we learn that these deaths exceed fatalities from all other weather events combined. This was an astonishing finding; I work in the area of biological heat transfer and yet I was surprised by the numbers. The authors report that by the end of the century, “more than 2000 excessive heat-wave related deaths per year may occur in Chicago.” They also report that mega-heat waves may increase by 500-1000% in Europe over the next few decades. Likewise, days with high temperatures (above 90–100°F) will increase significantly in major cities.  But it isn’t just heat, there are many other health impacts that should concern us. For instance, the broad category of respiratory disorders has seen a lot of recent research. Most of that research has focused on either ozone (mentioned already) or airborne particulates which can be inhaled during respiration. The authors of the paper discuss how changes to emissions and temperatures affect these pollution levels. In fact, even if we reduce particulate pollution, the changing climate will cause a respiratory “climate penalty” that must be prepared for.  Other health issues discussed are allergens and pollen, increases in infectious diseases, and vector-borne diseases, reduced food security, mental health, and climate-displacement problems. I was particularly interested in the report on water-borne diseases because it is an area of my own research. I am involved in projects to provide pasteurized water to impoverished areas or regions hit by disasters or civil strife.  What we have found, and what the research shows, is that it is difficult to keep pathogens out of a community water source. Some sources, like surface waters, streams, lakes, rivers, or shallow wells can be expected to contain bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and other pathogens which can cause diarrhea and death, particularly in small children. However, when extreme precipitation events occur and short-term flooding results, otherwise clean water sources become contaminated. While estimates vary widely, each year more than 1 million children die from diarrhea and the number is likely far higher. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions while simultaneously improving water infrastructure will help alleviate flood-related water contamination. But as with other studies, this is not all doom-and-gloom. The important point is there is something we can do about the problems. Of course, we can rapidly implement smart policies that encourage more efficiency in our energy systems. We can also speed the implementation of clean and renewable energies. But too often, the cost-benefit analysis is focused solely on the energy costs with such plans. Rarely do we think of the other benefits that might be achieved by taking smart actions. As an example, the study finds that increases in energy efficiency and renewable energy generation will cause a reduction in other pollutants such as nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide (aside from carbon dioxide). Such reductions would result in human health benefits that must be considered in the calculus. Additionally, dealing with black carbon or other short-term greenhouse gases would reduce premature deaths and improve crop yields. Putting in urban green spaces and cooling cities with white surfaces would increase worker productivity and urban life quality and improve health by promoting exercise. The point of all this is, these so-called co-benefits must be added to the ledger as we think about dealing with climate change. We often hear that mitigating and adapting to climate change is too expensive. We are now learning that doing nothing is very costly and an unwise choice. What this latest work shows us is that taking action will provide hidden auxiliary benefits that should encourage us to act faster. "
"Cities around the globe should have more say over their energy policy and powers to deal with climate change, the Mayor of Rio de Janeiro has told the Guardian. Speaking on the fringes of Climate Week in New York, Eduardo Paes said: “They should have more autonomy, it would make a difference.” Most cities are subject to regulations and policy set at the national level, which can fail to take account of their individual needs and characteristics, he said.  “National governments make decisions but do not consider what cities are doing [on energy and climate] and therefore do not properly support cities,” he argued. That can also result in a lack of financing for cities to be able to make vital changes, such as improving energy efficiency and public transport, he said. In many countries, mayors of large cities have extensive powers, including over policing, transport, building and large aspects of health and education. But energy policy is usually dictated by national governments, with cities having little say in how their residents and businesses are powered. Paes, who hosted the 2012 environmental conference Rio+20 and is chair of the C40 group of cities which have pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change, added: “Cities need to work with national governments and regional governments on this. Cities have the capability to cut global emissions by 3 gigatonnes, our research has found - this is a big opportunity.” As part of Climate Week, which kicked off on Sunday with a 300,000-strong march through New York and similar marches around the world, the C40 group presented its annual prizes to cities that have come up with innovative ways to improve the environment. Among the ten awards were two for London, on air quality and carbon accounting. The former was criticised by green campaigners as the UK’s capital has a record of breaching EU air quality standards. Other winners included China’s Shenzen, for urban transportation, and Seoul for green energy, Amsterdam for finance and economic development, and Barcelona for intelligent city infrastructure. Paes said the examples of cities performing well should inspire others. “I am confident that their knowledge and experience will help drive other cities to implement on-the-ground solutions faster and more efficiently. Through cooperation and collaboration, cities continue to deliver the results that are having a global impact.” More than half of the world’s population live in cities, and they produce the majority of greenhouse gas emissions.  City residents are also among those likely to face the perils of climate change, including rising sea levels - many major cities, from London and New York to Shanghai, Sydney and Rio de Janeiro are built by the sea - and the threat of major rainfall and extreme weather. Often, city infrastructure - including power networks, sewage and drainage systems, telecommunications and transport - has been built to old specifications that may not reflect the stresses they could be put under if global warming proceeds rapidly. The vulnerability of even modern, rich and industrialised cities to extreme weather was illustrated when Hurricane Sandy hit New York in 2012, overwhelming much of the infrastructure in the areas worst affected. • Fiona Harvey’s travel to New York was paid for by Siemens, one of the sponsors of the C40 awards."

"The global warming effect of ‘black carbon’, or soot, has been greatly exaggerated due to mistaken assumptions about the atmospheric altitude at which its particles are concentrated, according to a new study. Soot plumes belch from chimneys, stoves and forest fires, causing numerous health ailments and, it was thought, a contribution to climate change second only to carbon dioxide.  But when recent observations about the atmospheric height of soot particles were used, a model simulation by the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research-Oslo (Cicero), published in the journal Nature Communications, found that its warming impacts were roughly halved. “Soot located at high altitudes has a stronger climate effect than soot closer to the ground,” said Øivind Hodnebrog, the study’s first author. “Most of today’s climate models have too much soot in the upper part of the atmosphere and as a consequence, estimates of its climate effect could be overestimated.”  Uncertainty surrounds the exact influence of black carbon on global warming, partly because of the difficulties involved in estimating how much of it is there is.  Soot particles are also enigmatic substances, with warming and cooling properties that depend on the atmospheric conditions they encounter as they drift upwards. In the upper troposphere at tropical and middle latitudes, they have the potential to absorb and emit heat and solar radiation. But if they do not rise that far, they may stabilise lower-lying clouds that block the sunlight, so reducing temperatures. “We found a quite strong negative [warming] effect, a cooling effect which partly counteracts the warming caused by the black carbon itself,” Hodnebrog told the Guardian. “Overall the net effect is still positive but the warming is much less.” The Cicero team used contemporary observations taken from the Pacific and Arctic – regions relatively free of the short-term particle fluctuations caused by regional industrial emissions – which indicated that the cloud-forming effect of black carbon had been overlooked. Other models had “severely overestimated” the presence of black carbon in the upper atmosphere, possibly because of an over-estimation of their lifespan, they concluded.  The Cicero researchers factored in data showing that the particles are short-lived and relatively localised phenomena, with a lifetime of just a few days before rain washes them out of the clouds they have drifted into. The implications for efforts to combat climate change could be profound. “Soot has been highlighted as a candidate for strong emissions reductions, to achieve a rapid limitation of anthropogenic climate change,” said Bjørn H Samset, another Cicero researcher. “Our results show that this potential is not as large as many believe.” The new study’s findings are qualified with a caveat that they stem from a single climate model and “generalisation of these results should therefore be done with some caution”. Even so, “the bottom line is that efforts to counter global warming should be focused more on CO2 than black carbon,” Hodnebrog said, “because that way you can be sure that you are reducing global warming.” "

"Neil Young has released the first song from Storeytone, his upcoming orchestral album. Who’s Gonna Stand Up? (and Save the Earth) is available in three different versions, all free, and offered gratis to filmmaker activists trying to bring attention to climate change.  According to Young’s website, 92 people performed on the orchestral version of Who’s Gonna Stand Up?, including “60 of the music industry’s finest musicians” and a 30-piece choir. Recorded live at Hollywood’s MGM/Sony soundstage, the piece was arranged by Christopher Walden, mixed by 19-time Grammy winner Al Schmitt, and produced by Young and Niko Bolas. This all corresponds with recent rumours about Young’s new album; the singer has now confirmed that Storeytone is out in November.   Besides the rousing chamber-rock rendition, two more recordings of Who’s Gonna Stand Up? have been posted on Young’s website as free downloads: an acoustic solo take, and a live version with Young backed by Crazy Horse. “I’m giving you permission to please use this music in videos, clips and communications, or in any way you see fit during this critical time,” Young writes. “I hope this music can assist you in the important work we do to reach out for understanding and action in the world.” The song’s live take was first released last weekend, timed to coincide with the People’s Climate March. In recent years, Young has become extremely vocal on environmental issues, criticising the automotive industry, supporting anti-fracking activists, and raising money for a Native Canadian group’s legal battle with oil companies. “Take out the dams/ Stand up to oil/ Protect the plants and renew the soil,” he sings on the new single. “Let’s save the water/ And build a life for our sons and daughters.” Young’s most recent album, the lo-fi LP A Letter Home, was released in April."
"California is experiencing severe drought for the third year in a row as water levels fall to historic lows. More than 80% of the state in the midst of “extreme” or “exceptional” drought and the state’s farmers resort to digging deeper and deeper to tap into groundwater resources.  Half a world away, monsoon flooding in Kashmir has killed more than 460 people and sparked fears of a cholera outbreak. And in central Asia, the drying up of the Aral Sea (once the world’s fourth largest lake) is seen as an environmental disaster and is being linked to the demands of cotton production.  Water - whether too little, too much, too dirty or too exploited - is fast emerging as one of the greatest global threats. And it’s a complicated challenge to confront, especially given the inextricable links between water, and the production of energy and food.  Take energy. A huge amount of water is required in production, whether it’s generating hydropower, cooling in power plants or extracting gas. Around 15% of water withdrawals globally are for energy production. Equally, water is power intensive. California, for example, uses around a fifth of its electricity for water-related processes.  It’s impossible to look at the sustainability of one sector without the other - integrated solutions are vital but thin on the ground and business has a key role to play. Volkswagen, for example, is tackling energy and water consumption throughout the vehicle production process. But more needs to be done to get governments, NGOs and business to join up their actions. More often these actors are coming to blows over access to resources as farmers, big business and governments fight over water use. As Oliver Balch reports, the private sector is finding itself increasingly embroiled in these conflicts with consequences for business, reputation and ability to operate. Good governance is key, and for business this means collaboration on water stewardship. The good news is that this is happening - for example through the CEO Water Mandate – but is the pace fast enough? Then there is the question of water quality. In the UK and US, the heated fracking debate has focused on the pollution risk from accidents, spills and poor waste water management. Mines, farms and factories, and other business operations are all part of the equation. And with the impacts of climate change increasingly felt, how can business ensure water quality is monitored and managed, preventing disasters such as the toxic algal blooms in Lake Erie, blamed on agricultural pollution? Sanitation too is an important part of the debate. With 748 million people lacking access to clean water supplies, and 2.5 billion without access to a toilet. What is the role of business in providing access to clean water and and sanitation, and how to move these efforts beyond corporate philanthropy and embed them into core business strategy? Over the next 12 months we’ll be delving into all of these issues. We’ll examine the interconnected nature of the water-food-energy nexus and where progress is being made. We’ll look at the key problems with ensuring water quality and what business’ role should be. We’ll explore water stewardship. And we’ll spotlight the new technology being developed – often spearheaded by the private sector – which is allowing the mapping, and monitoring, as well as treating of water.  It may be a complex topic but putting the discussion at the heart of mainstream debate is key if we are going to be able to address the sustainability issues that face water.  We kick off with a list of 10 key tweeters who are working to do just this - from the World Bank to Matt Damon. And Oliver Balch explores whether we’re going to see a third world war over water and just what the role of business is and should be in water conflicts.  This is just a snapshot of the topics we’ll be covering over the next twelve months. We’d love to hear from you with ideas, questions and suggestions about what else we should be writing about.  Who should be writing? Which experts, academics and business voices have something interesting to say about water and sustainability? Which parts of the water debate have been neglected? Are there any standout examples of good or bad practice?

"The Global Warming Policy Foundation set up by former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson as an educational charity has been rapped by the government’s Charity Commission for blurring fact and comment and for lacking neutrality on climate change. The commission examined the website and material published by Britain’s leading climate sceptic organisation and ruled that “it was difficult not to form the conclusion that the publications and postings on the charity’s website promoted a particular position on global warming.  “In areas of controversy, education requires balance and neutrality with sufficient weight given to competing arguments. The promotion of a particular view or position would not equate to education.” Complaints that the charity, set up in 2009 to challenge government policies to reduce man-made climate change, was promoting political rather than educational views were upheld by the commission. “The high media profile of the charity and the concerns raised as to its political nature created a potential risk to the integrity of the sector. Although a charity may properly campaign in support of its objects ... where the purpose is education then the requirements of balance and neutrality still need to be met,” it said.  According to the commission, the charity’s trustees argued that the main purpose of the foundation was to promote research. “They pointed to “a wide divergence of views among members of its advisory council and that it did not hold or support any particular view,” it said. But in July, after nearly 12 months of discussions, the foundation set up a new campaigning arm, the Global Warming Policy Forum, which is not subject to the commission’s rules. Benny Peiser, the foundation’s director, said the commission’s ruling had helped to make the organisation more effective. “We accepted that we had to split the website. We are very happy with this development. It allows us to do things we could not do before and has made us more effective. It allows us to become a campaigning organisation which we never could be before”. Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at London School of Economics and Political Science, said: “Now that it has been found in breach of the Charity Commission’s rules, it is telling that the foundation has decided not to comply, but instead to set up a campaign arm to continue to disseminate inaccurate and misleading information and to lobby against climate policies.” . “However, at least politicians, media and the public will know that they should treat information from Lord Lawson and his fellow campaigners with greater scepticism.”"

"DeSmog UK has found that libertarian banker Lord Leach is a likely funder of the anti-climate political advocacy group Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). In May of 2009, Lord Leach gave a long speech in Parliament detailing his beliefs about global warming. The speech was full of inaccuracies, myths, and misinformation. Known as a Gish Gallop, the sheer number of false claims in the speech would require tremendous effort to debunk. Most telling were the sources that Lord Leach relied upon to support his statements. For example,  Probably the best climatologist in the world is Professor Lindzen and another good one is Professor Singer. While Richard Lindzen is a climate scientist, he’s also the climate scientist who’s been the wrongest, longest. Throughout his climate science career, Lindzen consistently took positions that were contrary to the climate science mainstream. For example, Lindzen claimed that global warming over the 20th century was minimal, that humans have an insignificant impact on global temperatures, and that water vapor will act to dampen global warming. All of these claims and many more have proven to be completely wrong. In another contrarian position, Lindzen has disputed the link between secondhand smoke and lung cancer. So has the other source Lord Leach cited in the above quote, Fred Singer. Unlike Lindzen, Singer doesn’t conduct climate science research. Instead, Singer is essentially a professional contrarian. On behalf of various industries, Singer has disputed the links between ultraviolet radiation and skin cancer, between chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and ozone depletion, between passive smoking and lung cancer, and of course between human activity and global warming. As with Lindzen, Singer has been proven wrong on every point. Political advocacy are another commonality between the two. Fred Singer is affiliated with numerous fossil fuel-funded political think tanks, including the Heartland Institute and Cato Institute. When he retired from academia last year, Richard Lindzen likewise joined the Cato Institute. Their lifelong contrarianism, history of being consistently wrong, and affiliation with political organizations should make anyone question their climate credibility, let alone relying on them exclusively or claiming they’re the world’s best climatologists. Later in his speech, Lord Leach continued his reliance on dubious sources. The world’s leading expert by far on sea levels is Professor Axel Mörner In reality, Nils-Axel Mörner is arguably the world’s least credible person when it comes to sea levels. Actual sea level experts have taken efforts to distance themselves from him after Mörner has misrepresented their positions. Mörner has repeatedly disputed the accuracy of the sea level record by resorting to conspiracy theories, claiming for example that the satellite record has been falsified. Instead, Mörner has invented an alternate reality without any supporting evidence. He also claims to be an expert in dowsing. Joining the group of those who Lord Leach relies upon for climate information, Professor Carter, a distinguished economist specialising in climate economics in Australia I was unable to find a record of an Australian economist named Carter who made the arguments attributed by Lord Leach. There is however a Bob Carter – an Australian marine geologist and widely-known climate contrarian who has made statements exaggerating the costs of reducing carbon pollution similar to those advanced by Lord Leach. Like Fred Singer, Bob Carter is affiliated with various fossil fuel-funded political think tanks. He also has a nearly nonexistent climate science publication record, and certainly is no economist. However, these sources of climate misinformation pale in comparison to this last one cited by Lord Leach in his speech, If you immerse yourself in the blogosphere, which is as good a place as any to study the science — and where sceptics are much more courteous and open to dissent than believers — you will find that scientific opinion is very divided, and that there are at least as many sceptics as believers. The blogosphere is absolutely not as good a place as any to study climate science. If you want to study climate science, you should read the peer-reviewed climate literature. True to form, Lord Leach has spoken highly of anti-science blogs, which are the most inaccurate and unreliable sources of information about climate change. How can one reject the consensus of climate experts in favor of a few habitually wrong, biased, cherry-picked individuals? As Lord Leach illustrates, by denying that the consensus exists. It is widely believed that there is a universal consensus. If that is so, why have 33,000 scientists—the number grows so fast that I may be out of date, and it may be 35,000 or 40,000 — signed a protest against the climate extremism expressed in the Kyoto Protocol? There is no scientific consensus. Here Lord Leach undoubtedly refers to the Oregon Petition, which can be signed by anyone with any college science degree (and even by some fictional characters). This is not a list of climate experts. Moreover, study after study after study has proven the existence of the approximately 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. In his speech, Lord Leach discussed the importance of being open-minded. However, as the saying goes, Do not be so open-minded that your brains fall out. It’s also important to consider the credibility of one’s sources, and their history of accuracy (or in Lord Leach’s case, lack thereof). It should go without saying that rejecting the conclusions of 97% of experts in favor of a few individuals with a history of contrarian thinking that’s been proven consistently wrong is a bad idea.  While the implications of climate research may be inconvenient (i.e. pointing to the need for government action to tackle the global threat of rapid climate change), denying the science and expert consensus won’t make the problem go away. Even if you doubt the expert consensus and supporting evidence, basic risk management principles dictate that we need to take action to mitigate the high probability that the experts are right and you and your cherry picked sources are wrong."

"Governments, multinational companies and campaigners are pledging to halt the loss of the world’s natural forests by 2030.  A declaration announced as part of a UN summit on climate change being held in New York also pledges to halve the rate of deforestation by the end of this decade and to restore hundreds of millions of acres of degraded land.   Backers of the New York declaration on forests claim their efforts could save between 4.5bn and 8.8bn tonnes of carbon emissions per year by 2030 – the equivalent of taking all the world’s cars off the road.  The UK, Germany and Norway have pledged to enter into up to 20 programmes over the next couple of years to pay countries for reducing their deforestation, which could be worth more than £700m.  Companies such as Kellogg’s, Marks & Spencer, Barclays, Nestle, the palm oil giant Cargill, Asia Pulp and Paper and charities including the RSPB, WWF and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) have signed the declaration. The declaration’s supporters say ending the loss of the world’s natural forests will be an important part of limiting global temperature rises to 2C, beyond which the worst impacts of climate change are expected to be felt.  It comes after analysis suggests that land use change such as deforestation accounts for around 8% of the world’s carbon emissions, with carbon dioxide released when trees are felled and burned to free up land for agriculture or development.  “Forests represent one of the largest, most cost-effective climate solutions available today,” the declaration says.  “Action to conserve, sustainably manage and restore forests can contribute to economic growth, poverty alleviation, rule of law, food security, climate resilience and biodiversity conservation.”  Signatories to the declaration are committing to a number of steps to halt forest loss, including backing a private sector goal of eliminating deforestation from producing agricultural products such as palm oil, soy, paper and beef by no later than 2020.  They are also seeking to support alternatives to deforestation which is caused by subsistence farming and the need for wood fuel for energy and reward countries that reduce forest emissions.  The countries, businesses, charities and indigenous groups are also committing to restoring 150m hectares (370m acres) of degraded landscapes and forest areas by 2020, and speed up restoration so that another 200m hectares are restored by 2030. Restoration of 350m hectares by the end of the next decade – an area greater than the whole of India – would have benefits for the climate by storing carbon and take pressure off primary forests.  The declaration is a key announcement at the UN climate summit, attended by more than 120 leaders including David Cameron, which aims to drive action ahead of talks in Paris next year when it is hoped a new global climate treaty will be agreed. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, who convened the summit, said: “The New York declaration aims to reduce more climate pollution each year than the United States emits annually, and it doesn’t stop there.  “Forests are not only a critical part of the climate solution – the actions agreed today will reduce poverty, enhance food security, improve the rule of law, secure the rights of indigenous peoples and benefit communities around the world.”  John Lanchbery, the RSPB’s principal climate change adviser, said many of the companies which had signed up alongside the wildlife charity and other conservation organisations had historically played a role in tropical deforestation. He said they had either been directly involved in forest clearance or involved in supply chains that caused significant deforestation.  “Some have been a major part of the deforestation problem. They must also, however, be a major part of the solution. Signing up to the forest declaration shows their intention to change their ways and reduce deforestation dramatically.  “We welcome their willingness to change, although we will continue make sure that they really do,” he said.  Asia Pulp and Paper, one of the companies that has been attacked by green groups over deforestation in Indonesia, but which last year outlined a “forest conservation policy” committing to ending loss of rainforests, has signed the pledge.  Aida Greenbury, APP’s managing director of sustainability, said: “We have shown through our own zero deforestation policies that ambitious targets to protect the world’s remaining forests can be agreed, implemented and achieved by companies operating in emerging economies.  “Our view is that wherever a company is involved in the forest supply chain, they should be implementing these policies immediately. There is no time to waste.”  But Kumi Naidoo, executive director of Greenpeace International, which has not signed the declaration, said there was a need for strong laws to protect forests and people, and warned that the pledge was missing ambitious targets and tangible actions.  “Halting the global loss of natural forests by 2030 and eliminating deforestation from agricultural commodities by 2020 at the latest would mean that years of continued forest clearance still lie ahead of us.  “While we are celebrating announcements on paper today, forests and forest peoples are facing imminent threats that must be averted if we want the declaration to become reality,” he said."
"From the observation tower in the Thar desert and as far as the eye can see, the dark blue arrays of a million solar panels can be seen sitting silently on the red dust. The Charanka solar park in Gujarat is an “ultra-mega” power project – the Indian government’s phrase – and the biggest in Asia. But unlike the hundreds of coal plants and their noxious smokestacks being built in the country, the only danger linked to the solar panels are the snakes and scorpions that slink and scuttle between the sparse shrubs, posing a minor hazard to those who dust off the panels after dusk. “But today, God is doing the cleaning,” says Poojan Ghodadra, programme manager for SunEdison, as rare, intense rain bounces off the panels. SunEdison has provided about a 10th of the 221MW total in the 5,000-acre solar park. The project was the brainchild of Narendra Modi. As chief minister of Gujarat, Modi spurred companies to build more than 900MW of solar plant across the state in just a couple of years. Now, as prime minister, the question is whether he can repeat the feat across India, which receives more sunlight than any other country in the G20. The answer matters across the globe: at the heart of tackling climate change is bringing power to the world’s poorest people without choking the planet with rising carbon emissions. The UN negotiations, which must deliver a deal to beat global warming by the end of 2015, began their crucial final stage on Tuesday in New York, with the assembly of more than 120 world leaders. Boosting clean energy over dirty fossil fuels is high on the agenda and solar is booming, with new installations around the world doubling every two years. China is also aggressively pursuing the green technology, installing 12,000MW in 2013 – a record for any country in a single year. As production goes up, panel costs are plummeting – down 80% since 2008, according to the New Climate Economy report released on 15 September. This puts solar on the edge of beating coal and gas on price. Such energy choices are now on Modi’s desk: he has pledged to give electricity to every one of the 300 million Indians living in the dark, a feat he achieved on the smaller stage of Gujarat, and energy experts in India are impressed with the impetus given in his first 100 days to renewable energy, particularly solar. Three more ultra-mega solar parks were backed with cash in July, as were solar-powered irrigation pumps and canal-top solar plants. The electric fences on India’s sensitive northern borders will be solar-powered as the military installs 1,000MW of panels to replace expensive diesel generators across its posts. Another 7,000MW of solar is out for tender across the country and the rooftops of Delhi are to be bedecked with panels under a new scheme. Elsewhere, glitzy new shopping malls in India’s blackout-prone cities are turning to solar for cheaper and more reliable energy, while thirsty Chennai is experimenting with solar-powered desalination. Modi’s power minister, Piyush Goyal, says solar has a glittering future. The previous government’s target of 20,000MW of solar by 2022 will be smashed, he says. “It will be much, much larger. I think for India to add 10,000MW a year [of solar] and six, or seven or eight of wind every year is not very difficult to envisage.” But coal has not gone away. Electricity produced by coal burning between June and August 2014 jumped 21% on 2013 and, despite corruption allegations, coal mining is increasing. The state coal company aims to double production to 1bn tonnes a year by 2019. All acknowledge that coal must provide the steady power needed to underpin India’s rapid economic development: if the 360 million Indians living in poverty were a nation, it would be the third most populous on Earth. But the extent to which plummeting solar panel costs and their sometimes surprising fringe benefits help solar eat into coal’s share of the energy mix is crucial to keeping emissions down. On a 15-metre-wide (50ft) irrigation canal that cuts through the green cotton and barley fields of Gujarat, another Modi project illustrates the extra benefits. Here, 3,600 solar panels stretch more than half a mile along the waterway, but do not just produce power. With water the critical resource for the farmers, the shading of the canal by the solar array saves an estimated 9m litres of water from evaporating each year while the cooling effect of the water under the panels edges up the electricity output. Furthermore, the part of the canal in the sun is clogged with reeds but in the shade of the panels, the water flows freely. Spanning the canal, while adding cost, also avoids covering valuable farmland with panels. “The canal is the property of the government, so the cost of the land goes away too,” says Ghodadra. Modi is known to enjoy talking about the world-first canal project to the presidents and prime ministers he meets around the world and has backed a national expansion. Even using just 10% of the canals in Gujarat would give 2,200MW of solar power. Along with millions of solar water pumps, Goyal says this pushing of power into the countryside will lift the income of poor farmers and increase food security by extending growing seasons. Solar power can also reach remote villages faster and cheaper than sending pylons striding across the land, says Pranav Mehta, chair of the National Solar Energy Federation of India. “The country needs more decentralised power, like rooftop solar, to reach the large parts of the country that the grid has not reached.” India’s booming cities are another huge challenge, with many struggling with blackouts, particularly when temperatures soar and air conditioning is ramped up. Again, Modi’s 13-year tenure in Gujarat is providing the solar template. In September, it was announced that rooftop solar power projects in the state capital, Gandhinagar, will be replicated in Punjab and Delhi, where a storm at the end of May plunged its fragile grid into rolling blackouts for a week. Delhi is ever more power-hungry, but with little open land and 300-plus days of sunshine a year, rooftop solar is an attractive solution. Since businessman SN Dwivedi put solar panels on his home, the previous back-up system has been silent. “I haven’t used the diesel generator in my house for a year,” he says. Goyal says rural and urban off-grid solar are being looked at “very actively”. “Offgrid is a very viable solution, especially for small, remote villages,” he says, while new assessment for his department calculates a potential for 120,000MW of rooftop solar across India. Other assessments are even higher at 200,000MW. The minister is certainly generating enthusiasm in the industry.  “We have a government that is even more bullish than the entrepreneurs,” says Rahul Munjal, scion of the Hero motorcycle family, the world’s biggest makers of two-wheelers. His new company, Hero Future Energies, will complete 280MW of solar by 2015, three years after it started. “The Modi factor is very real with solar. He recognises that not only is solar very clean, it is also very fast to build,” says Pashupathy Gopalan, SunEdison’s managing director in south Asia and Africa. He says the cost of solar versus coal – the critical immediate factor – is near a tipping point. “Grid parity”, ie equal cost, has already been achieved for commercial and industrial customers putting panels on their roofs, Gopalan says, and is coming soon for other users. Bloomberg predicts parity for solar in India by 2020, while solar consultancy Bridge to India suggests 2018. “I think the grid parity debate is history now,” says Gopalan. Grid parity would mean solar subsidies could be phased out, but Mehta notes that fossil fuels still get more than $40bn (£24bn) in subsidy every year in India: “You give me [a fraction] of that and I will make solar affordable and available everywhere.” But despite highlighting the advantages of solar power – and new incentives to close old and dirty coal plants – energy minister Goyal is unable to pledge that the proportion of electricity generated from coal will fall from its current 65% in the coming years. “I would love it to be lower,” he says. “But the ambitious plans India has to expand infrastructure, create jobs, improve the lives of people, get 24/7 power in every home, I think considering the huge magnitude of the demand shift, for renewables to meet this kind of demand will have serious challenges. So I would imagine coal also would have to expand in a very rapid way.” Even solar champion Mehta agrees, expecting the proportion to be unchanged in 2030. Goyal says a key obstacle to ensuring solar power grabs its huge opportunity in India is getting the up-front capital at affordable interest rates – coal is relatively easy to fund, he says. The provision of clean energy finance will be a central one in the UN negotiations, which must deliver a global climate change deal by the end of 2015. Developing nations will demand financial help for green power projects from the industrialised west, in return for forgoing some of the fossil fuel burning on which the west itself grew rich. But there has been little progress so far, Goyal says: “So far I have yet to see any significant offers or proposal of support from the west.”Rajendra Pachauri is an expert on India’s energy system and the challenge of global warming, as head of the Delhi-based Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) and chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which provides the world’s governments with their most definitive assessments. He thinks coal power expansion in India is likely to choke on supply problems, boosting the attractiveness of solar and other renewables. “It is a myth that India can continue to produce more coal,” he says, noting the shortage of coal that is leaving many plants stranded even today. “We have set up power stations in this country and there is no coal to run them.” Pachauri is optimistic India under Modi can follow the cleaner energy path. “We have a prime minister who first, believes in climate change and, secondly, is a doer. It is a unique opportunity,” he says. “I believe you will see a snowballing of renewable energy developments in India in the next few years.” But while a step-change in clean energy generation is a must if global warming is to be tamed, climate change does not have to be the principle reason for change, according to Pachauri. “I don’t think India is really [expanding renewable energy] to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Here it is happening largely because renewables will turn out to be the most feasible and most attractive form of energy supply.” He then paraphrases Deng Xiaoping’s famous quote: “It doesn’t matter if a cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice.” Whether the world is prepared to capture enough mice – carbon emissions – to avert catastrophic climate change is what is at stake in the next 15 months of global UN negotiations."

"Julie Bishop has told a UN climate change summit that Australia’s emission reduction targets compare well with other countries’, suggesting Australia is a small emitter and placing a special onus on the bigger industrial economies. Addressing the high-level UN climate summit in New York, the foreign minister took a much more conservative line towards climate change action than many of the other world leaders and representatives assembled. The head of the UN, Ban Ki-Moon, opened the summit by saying climate change is the “defining challenge of our age” and called on the more than 120 delegates assembled to get “all hands on deck”. Attendees made impassioned speeches about addressing climate change and reducing carbon emissions across the globe. The US president, Barack Obama, told the summit that time was fast running out to prevent the worst effects. “We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last to be able to do anything about it,” he said. Australia’s prime minister, Tony Abbott, as well as the leaders of India, Canada, Russia, China, UAE and Germany, chose not to attend. Bishop reiterated Australia’s commitment to reducing emissions by 5% below 2000 levels by 2020. “This is a bipartisan target. It is an ambitious target because it means that Australia will reduce its emissions by 22% against business-as-usual levels. This compares well to the targets of other major economies,” she said. Bishop spoke of the government’s controversial Direct Action policy and the $2.55bn Emissions Reduction Fund, and said the government would look at its post-2020 targets when it conducted a review into international targets and settings next year. “This review will consider the comparable actions of others, including the major economies and Australia’s trading partners,” she said. “We are striking the responsible balance of safeguarding economic growth while taking action on climate change.” She suggested Australia was a small emitter of carbon and it was up to the larger industrial economies to act. “In taking action at home we are recognising that Australia is responsible for about 1.5% of global emissions. All countries need to act, especially the world’s biggest emitters.” But representatives from countries most at risk to rising seas and other effects of climate change called for wealthier countries to lead the way. “We must get away from the ‘wait and see who is doing what’ style of leadership before deciding what needs to be done,” said Kiribati’s president, Anote Tong. Graca Machel, the Mozambican politician and widow of Nelson Mandela, said at the end of the summit that she had the impression that “there is a huge mismatch between the magnitude of the challenge and the response we heard here today”. Tim Flannery, the chief commissioner of the Climate Council, told Guardian Australia the federal government was “failing badly” in its efforts. “President Obama made it very clear he expects nations to come to the table with a clearly defined plan of action,” he said. “Before the election both parties pledged to the 5% reduction with the scope for larger reductions if the rest of the world moved. We’re hearing no more about that from Australia. “We need to have a fairly substantial reduction program in place. We’re the 15th largest polluter overall, we’re a wealthy developed country. The US has already seen a reduction of 12% in carbon emissions. Ours are on the rise with the repeal of the carbon tax, so we’ve got a big job ahead of us.” The Climate Council said the world was at a “critical juncture”. “To stabilise the climate system this century at a temperature rise of no more than 2°C above the pre‐industrial level, requires urgent, rapid and deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2 emissions,” it said in a statement.  “To have a good chance, two-thirds or greater, of stabilising the climate at the 2°C target, we have a total budget of 1,000 billion tonnes of carbon emissions from all human sources since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s.” Half that budget had been consumed by 2011, with consumption rates increasing, the council said. The meeting, which is the largest such gathering since the failed 2009 Copenhagen event, is hoped to speed up moves towards a global climate agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol. The Paris conference in December 2015 will see negotiations held under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Obama told the summit the US government would meet its current 2020 commitment of a 17% cut and would announce new carbon reduction ambitions by next year. The French president, François Hollande, urged delegates to remember the failure of Copenhagen and said there was an obligation to succeed with the next set of negotiations. “Such an agreement [in Paris] presupposes international mobilisation to arrive at a legal framework that will be adapted to different levels of development,” he said. “It is very important for us to win this battle and ensure an agreement can be reached.” France and Germany pledged $1bn to the Green Fund for climate aid for poor nations. The UK prime minister, David Cameron, told the meeting he had pledged to lead “the greenest government ever and I believe we have kept that promise”. The actor Leonardo DiCaprio gave an opening address to the summit, telling delegates “you can make history or you will be vilified by it”. “This disaster has grown beyond the choices that individuals make,” he said. “This is now about our industry and governments taking large-scale decisive action.” The summit comes just days after the biggest climate change march in history saw more than half a million people take to the streets in more than 160 countries, according to organisers. The largest gathering was in New York, where 310,000 people urged the summit delegates to take action."
"Sometimes you just want a quiet life, which is why I wasn't going to go on the climate change march last weekend. Well, I did initially plan on going – you hear about these protests and you're immediately filled with a burning desire to stand up and be counted, because the sea levels will soon be up past our chins and the sun is going to be replaced by Jeremy Clarkson's face on a burning orb, and what are the simpering simians in government actually going to do about it? But then the Sunday morning of the rally arrived, and I was tired, and I started to wonder if my burning sense of moral urgency might just have been cystitis. I thought about the last time I tried to protest about something environmental, when a student friend took me to the sacred woodlands to join the tree-people who were blocking construction of the Newbury bypass in 1996. And how we had gone there in her car, and driven around and around for hours, trying to follow the map on a handprinted leaflet that we'd been given by a protester and growing increasingly bewildered by the fact that the road we were on never matched the shape of the one on the page. Until it dawned on us that it wasn't actually a map – we were trying to follow the proposed route of the Newbury bypass.  I thought about the fact that I have a kid now, and that the wheels of her pushchair would probably bash into the dangling bongos of marchers who believe that toothpaste is a conspiracy and that 9/11 was a false flag operation. I thought about the celebrities who said they were going on this demo, including Russell Brand, who lives near me, so I can stand behind him in the queue at Tesco and watch my friend take a photo of the back of his head any time I like. So I could have happily turned on the telly instead. But the television wasn't working, because of a massive electrical storm that hit the satellite dish two days earlier, which got me thinking. So off we went. Into central London to join a gentle sea of people, united with others marching simultaneously in cities all around the world, from Romania to India to the US, to demand clean energy. As we walked down Whitehall, somebody had made a pedal-power disco bus that played Donna Summer records, and everyone sang along to I Feel Love – and I did feel love, actually. My daughter shook her tambourine, and we marched alongside a woman with a banner saying, Chicks Dig Guys With Big Solar Panels, and then we passed a man dressed as a penguin. We met up with a friend who had brought her daughter, too, and our children proceeded to engage in a violent offensive against each other somewhere near the end of Downing Street. Then we passed the Houses of Parliament, and I had a flashback to the day I got shown around them by an MP who took me for a sneaky fag at the foot of the clock tower, and how we had looked up at the endless tourists on the bridge taking their Big Ben photos, none of them thinking to glance down and get a shot of a politician sharing a Marlboro Light with a journalist. The protest ended in a rally outside Parliament. People with loudhailers spoke. People without loudhailers cheered. The digging chick ended up deep in chat with the flightless bird, and gave him her phone number, and we all cheered again: it's always nice to see someone pick up a penguin. My friend Jack, who likes to confound people's expectations of a male model, texted to ask me to take some photos of the demo and send them to him, so he could put them on his Instagram and make it look as if he was there, too. The next day, the Rockefeller family, who made their vast fortune from oil, announced that they would get rid of their $50bn fossil fuel assets and reinvest the money only in clean energy. And I felt glad that I hadn't opted for a quiet life – even though that is, actually, the whole point of political activism. People don't go on marches to change the world, but to keep it steady. They go to tether the Earth to its axis and stop it spinning off its tilt altogether. • Follow Sophie on Twitter."

"Today some 2.8 billion people face insufficient supplies of fresh water, and according to the United Nations that number is set to increase to half the world’s population by 2030. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that 40% of the world’s food depends on irrigation, which accounts for almost 70% of fresh water used.It makes sense then that farmers are turning to new and old technology in an attempt to manage their water.  The old business dogma, “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it”, holds especially true with water usage. But in many places around the world the amount of water diverted from rivers or pumped from the ground to irrigate crops is not measured. Even California groundwater was totally unregulated until this month. That’s a political rather than a technological problem, said Peter Gleick, co-founder of the Pacific Institute, an independent research organization focused on water issues. Flow meters to measure water use are neither new nor expensive, Gleick said. But in many places groundwater has long been considered a property right, so farmers have seen no need measure or justify how they use it. But with drought and over-pumping dropping water tables, some are beginning to recognize that better water use tracking will help to keep a dwindling resource flowing.  Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Wellntel, a water technology company, is answering that need with a water-measuring system that uses sound sensors to detect the water level in a well – without touching the water or opening the well. The sensors transmit data to the Wellntel website, where customers can log in to private accounts and see their water level at various points: when pumping, after rainfall, and over time. In an attempt to mollify farmers, Wellntel specifically touts a farmer’s right not to share data on the amount of water used with anyone else. The first place to save water is in conveyance: as much as 60% of the water withdrawn for irrigation is lost through leaks in canals, spillage and evaporation, according to the FAO. Another part of the problem is flood irrigation – the most common method of field irrigation globally. About half the water on flood irrigated fields isn’t absorbed by crops, according to the US Geological Survey. Instead it runs off, taking with it fertilizers, pesticides and topsoil that pollute water bodies around the world and cause dead zones, areas where too much fertilizer causes algae to bloom, which in turn sucks oxygen out of the water, killing other life. Flood irrigation is commonplace because it’s cheap. But in response to strained water supplies, some farmers have made the shift to much more efficient underground irrigation or precision micro-sprinkler and drip irrigation systems that deposit tiny amounts of water directly above the roots of crops. These systems also help farmers earn more money by allowing them to plan more acreage while using less water than before. The up-front cost of a drip system is significant – about $500 to $1000 per acre, according to the FAO. Even though these investments pay for themselves within a few years thanks to better water-use efficiency and lower irrigation-related energy bills, many farmers don’t have the cash – or credit access – to install them. However a Middle Eastern firm has developed a new low-tech solution that also places water right at the roots of crops and can work with or without drip irrigation – and comes with a much smaller price tag. In Israel, where water scarcity has been a way of life for decades, Tal-Ya (“God’s dew” in Hebrew) manufactures trays that capture dew and funnel it to plants, often tree crops. The 28- by 22-inch polypropylene trays trap air underneath themselves as well, insulating plants from extreme temperatures and catching moisture evaporating from the earth to create a perpetually moist soil pocket around the roots. They also block weeds that would otherwise compete with crops for water. Each tray costs $3 to $5 apiece. Mickey Chesla, Tal-Ya’s vice president of marketing and sales, said the trays can reduce water use by up to 90% although 50% is more typical. They can also reduce fertilizer use by 30% because the trays direct the nutrient straight to the plant’s roots. While introducing more plastic into the environment might not seem like a great idea, Tal-Ya states that its trays last for up to 10 years and are 100% recyclable. Since beginning commercial production in 2013, farmers in Israel, the United States, China, Chile, Georgia, Sri Lanka, and Australia have adopted them according to the company’s web site. This past spring Tal-Ya was a runner-up in the Imagine H20 food and agriculture competition. Its tray system “improves agricultural yields without increasing resource allocation”, said Scott Bryan, Imagine H2O’s chief operating officer. “These solutions that enable farmers to produce more with less are proving crucial to surviving the California drought,” he said. Another way to avoid waste is to avoid watering when it’s about to rain or the soil is still moist. A variety of systems – including Measure-Tek, Ranch Systems and Pure Sense – use weather-monitoring stations and soil moisture probes that send data via radio or cellular signals to a grower’s computer or smart phone. Some can be programmed to turn irrigation off and on as needed. Taking this concept to the extreme, Oakland, California-based Fruition Sciences has created a web application that crunches data from more than 40 sensors to determine whether crops need more water. The system tracks crop nutrient uptake, aerial photos, and weather and soil conditions. One special sensor tracks sap flowing through grapevines. “People are overwatering,” said Thibaut Scholasch, founder and vice president of research and development for the company. “Everywhere we go, from Spain to Argentina to California to Italy to France, we measure a plant response showing that vines are much more resilient than we think.” “We are teaching people to un-train their eyes: drippy-looking leaves do not mean the plant needs water”, Scholasch said. “Often it simply means the weather is hot even if there is still plenty of water in the root system.” Fruition Sciences is working with farmers in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water District on a project to save water. “So far we have saved anywhere from 40% to 100% of water used for irrigation,” Scholasch said. The range reflects a big swing in how much a grower is over-irrigating as well as the spatial variability and climate dryness of a given vineyard. The systems aren’t cheap however. Costs range from $40 to $5,000 for a “site” which can be as large as 50 acres – if the field is planted with a single crop – but is often much smaller.  The expense has so far limited the appeal of Fruition Sciences’ system to use with wine grapes. But Scholasch said the firm is currently testing the technology with other cash crops. An even more nuanced way to manage watering is a strategy called regulated deficit irrigation. The goal is to irrigate crops just enough to maximize crop-water productivity by reducing irrigation at the point of diminishing returns. For example, reducing water by 50% might result in a yield reduction of just 10%. Some crops, such as wine grapes and certain nuts, actually benefit from water stress during drought-tolerant life stages. Regulated deficit irrigation can be implemented with any type of irrigation system. It is sometimes used with rain-fed crops, adding a bit of irrigation during droughts or in sensitive growth stages, such as when the plants are producing vegetation and during final ripening.  Reuse is also growing in appeal, with urban wastewater being lightly treated and directed to landscaping, industry, power plant cooling, groundwater recharge – and crop irrigation.  “In Monterey and Salinas Valley, much of the strawberries and artichokes are grown with recycled wastewater effluent,” said David Sedlak, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California at Berkeley. A new technology from Calgary-based Livestock Water Recycling is treating animal waste for reuse on row crops in what amounts to a little sewage treatment plant. The nutrients in the treated sewage benefit the crops by reducing the need for fertilizer inputs, and reduce pollutant runoff because the plants absorb some of the nutrients.  It’s an improvement over the common lagoon system, in which waste sits in a pool for multiple months, to allow solids to settle out before being sprayed on crops. These pools emit toxic gases and can leak into nearby water bodies. Farmers can also capture flood irrigation runoff and reuse it. This kind of reuse is easier and more cheaply done in organic farming, where the water contains fewer fertilizers and pesticides, than in more conventional agriculture. And dry-land farmers have developed many strategies to collect rain via barrels and cisterns for direct use, and to resupply groundwater using bioswales (land features that filter water), buffer strips, off-stream storage reservoirs and natural wetlands. Not all countries or regions may be able to be self-sufficient in food production. Fifty-one percent of the world’s population may rely on food imports in 2050, according to a study last year in Environmental Research Letters. Certain crops need less water and are well suited to dry environments, whereas others such as rice, cotton, or alfalfa – notoriously thirsty crops – are probably better left to wetter regions. Choosing to grow the right crops for the climate – right-cropping – is important in making the most of available water. Countries in the Persian Gulf are turning increasingly to international food imports after decades of depleting their groundwater. Israel, too, is spending more of its limited water resources on industries other than agriculture, earning money to buy food internationally. “There may be no countries in the Middle East that have enough water to be self-sufficient in agriculture,” said Gleick of the Pacific Institute. However, some countries are buying land in wetter countries to grow their food, a practice that can jeopardize local food security, environmental justice and human rights. A study last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found land grabbing inextricably linked to gaining water rights, with 60% taken by the United States, the United Arab Emirates, India, the United Kingdom, Egypt, China and Israel. Forty-seven percent of such land purchases occurred in Africa and 33% in Asia. There is also a growing debate over whether some non-food crops should be grown at all in an increasingly water-scarce world. Feedstocks for biofuels, for example, take hundreds of gallons of water per gallon of fuel to produce. The International Energy Agency predicts a 317% percent increase in water consumption by biofuel crops by 2035.  While modern industrial agriculture has tended to treat soil merely as a medium that props up plants – first bombing it with insecticides and pesticides, then applying fertilizer to pump up the plants – healthy soil has built-in plant nutrients, absorbs water more deeply and retains it better. Many traditional agricultural practices – such as reduced tillage, crop rotation, planting cover crops, applying compost, manure, or mulch – nurture the microscopic critters that live in soil. But ways to increase soil moisture and water efficiency are also coming to conventional farming.Polymer soil additions have been researched for 20 years as a means to help soil retain moisture. The idea is that when the farmer irrigates, the polymer absorbs water that would otherwise run off and holds it around the seed.  Bay Area-based mOasis, which produces a soil polymer called BountiGel, claims its product is a significant advance on this concept: it doesn’t break down before the plant can use it, said Steven Hartmeier, mOasis’ CEO. But it does break down. It’s harmless to soil microorganisms because it is highly diluted in the soil at about 10 parts per million, he said. Made of ingredients already approved for human use and consumption, BountiGel has been approved for use by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Roda Group, a venture capital firm based in Berkeley, Calif., has invested more than $5m in mOasis.  In use the polymer has shown the potential for 25% higher crop yields due to decreased stress on plants, 25% reduced water use overall, and 15% savings on water-related energy utilities, Hartmeier said. “We had a tomato grower this year that would normally drip-irrigate every seven days, and with our product, they stretched it out nine to 11 days.” Although BountiGel costs about $150 an acre, an average grower can generate about $900 more per acre thanks to increased yield and water savings, according Hartmeier. The farmers he works with, like farmers nearly everywhere around the world, “need to figure out how to grow more with less water”, Hartmeier said. “We have a water problem in California, and it’s not going away.” This piece was published in conjunction with Climate Confidential.

"The Earth seems to have been smoking a lot recently. Volcanoes are erupting in Iceland, Hawaii, Indonesia, Ecuador and Mexico, as well as the recent eruption of Japan’s Mount Ontake. Others, in the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, erupted recently but seem to have calmed down. Many of these have threatened homes and forced evacuations. Among their spectators, these eruptions raise question: is there such a thing as a season for volcanic eruptions? While volcanoes may not have “seasons” as we know them, scientists have started to discern intriguing patterns in their activity.  The four seasons are caused by the Earth’s axis of rotation tilting toward and away from the sun. But our planet undergoes another, less well-known change, which affects it in a more subtle way, perhaps even volcanically. Due to factors such as the gravitational pull of the sun and moon, the speed at which the Earth rotates constantly changes. Accordingly the length of a day actually varies from year to year. The difference is only in the order of milliseconds. But new research suggests that this seemingly small perturbation could bring about significant changes on our planet – or more accurately, within it. A study published in the journal Terra Nova in February showed that, since the early 19th century, changes in the Earth’s rotation rate tended to be followed by increases in global volcanic activity. It found that, between 1830 and 2013, the longest period for which a reliable record was available, relatively large changes in rotation rate were immediately followed by an increase in the number of large volcanic eruptions. And, more than merely being correlated, the authors believe that the rotation changes might actually have triggered these large eruptions. Altering the spin of a planet, even by a small amount, requires a huge amount of energy. It has been estimated that changes in the Earth’s rotation rate dissipate around 120,000 petajoules of energy each year – enough to power the United States for the same length of time. This energy is transferred into the Earth’s atmosphere and subsurface. And it is this second consequence that the Terra Nova authors believe could affect volcanoes. The vast quantities of energy delivered to the subsurface by rotation changes are likely to perturb its stress field. And, since the magma that feeds volcanic eruptions resides in the Earth’s crust, stress variations there may make it easier for the liquid rock to rise to the surface, and thereby increase the rate of volcanic eruptions. The Terra Nova study is far from conclusive. Nevertheless, the idea that minute changes to the Earth’s spin could affect volcanic motions deep within the planet is intriguing. But there’s another natural phenomenon that has a much stronger claim to affecting volcanic activity: climate change. In recent decades, it has become apparent that the consequences of planetary ice loss may not end with rising sea levels. Evidence has been building that in the past, periods of severe loss of glaciers were followed by a spike in volcanic activity. Around 19,000 years ago, glaciation was at a peak. Much of Europe and North America was under ice. Then the climate warmed, and the glaciers began to recede. The effect on the planet was generally quite favourable for humankind. But, since the mid-1970s, a number of studies have suggested that, as the ice vanished, volcanic eruptions became much more frequent. A 2009 study, for example, concluded that between 12,000 and 7,000 years ago, the global level of volcanic activity rose by up to six times. Around the same period the rate of volcanic activity in Iceland soared to at least 30 times today’s level. There is supporting evidence from continental Europe, North America and Antarctica that volcanic activity also increased after earlier deglaciation cycles. Bizarrely, then, volcanic activity seems – at least sometimes – to rise and fall with ice levels. But why? This strange effect might come down to stress. Ice sheets are heavy. Each year, Antarctica’s loses around 40bn metric tons of ice. The sheets are so heavy, in fact, that as they grow, they cause the Earth’s crust to bend – like a plank of wood when placed under weight. The corollary of this is that, when an ice sheet melts, and its mass is removed, the crust springs back. This upward flexing can lead to a drop in stress in the underlying rocks, which, the theory goes, makes it easier for magma to reach the surface and feed volcanic eruptions. The link between climate change and volcanism is still poorly understood. Many volcanoes do not seem to have been affected by it. Nor is it a particularly pressing concern today, even though we face an ice-free future. It can take thousands of years after the glaciers melt for volcanic activity to rise. Yet while it may not be an immediate hazard, this effect shows how our planet can respond to change in unforeseen ways. Contrary to their brutish reputation, volcanoes help scientists understand just how sensitive our planet can be.

"An EU fund for marine protection has been condemned by lawmakers, scientists and NGOs for being tasked with promoting public acceptance of deep sea oil and gas drilling. The €36m (£28m) ‘Blue Growth’ funding pot is part of a Horizon 2020 disaster response programme to help EU countries measure and contain oil and gas pollution spills, in the wake of the calamitous BP Deepwater blowout in 2010.  While its scope deals with increasing operational responses to similar accidents, the research programme’s expected impacts include increasing the competitiveness of European industry, reducing risks for the new offshore economy and, crucially, persuading a sceptical public of the merit of offshore drilling. One of its stated objectives is to “improve societal acceptance of offshore activities.” “It is outrageous,” Isabella Lovin, a Swedish Green MEP, told the Guardian. “We know from scientists that we need to leave two thirds of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground if we are to stay within the 2C global warming trajectory. So why on Earth would we give taxpayers money to raise public acceptance for offshore oil drilling which will damage the sea floor, marine life, and the planet. It is totally absurd.” Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe said that the research “completely contradicted” the EU’s pledge to cut CO2 emissions by 80-95% of 1990 levels, by mid-century. “The EU committed to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies in Philadelphia in 2009 but I would imagine this is a fossil fuel subsidy in green disguise,” said Wendell Trio, CAN Europe’s director. “It would mean the whole procedure of giving licenses for offshore activities would become easier because one of the problems that companies and governments have often faced is public pressure not to approve them.” Sustainable development is described as an overarching objective of the EU’s Horizon 2020 programme, and is slated to receive 60% of its €15bn budget, with another 35% earmarked for climate-related expenditure, according to official documents. But other low carbon competitive energy projects in the programme, such as a €113m fund to help shale gas companies identify environmental risks and impacts, have previously been condemned as hidden fossil fuel subsidies. Environmentalists say that shale firms would otherwise have had to do the research themselves. Private consortia and academics are invited to bid for Blue Growth grants of €4-6m from next July, although higher amounts may also be requested, and disbursed. The broad wording of the grants is intended to cover all offshore activities, including windfarms, as well as oil rigs. “We see no conflict or inconsistencies here,” Michael Jennings, a spokesman for the EU’s research commissioner, Máire Geoghan-Quinn, said. “The call is very much focused on response to any spills and pollution, in the interests of future ‘Blue Growth.’” “We strive for coherence and of course all kinds of initiatives will be scrutinised by commission services as they go into consideration,” said Elina Badram, a member of the cabinet of climate commissioner, Connie Hedegaard. “The fact that we achieved a 20% spending target for climate-related action within the EU’s 2014-2020 budget speaks loudly and clearly about our commitment to keeping climate as a priority for future.” But it is accepted in Brussels that better management and containment systems for oil spills and marine accidents – the funding call’s core objective – would increase public acceptance for the activities that had led to them. Speaking on the fringes of a cross-party scientific conference at the European parliament, Professor Orjan Gustaffson of Stockholm’s Bert Bolin Climate Centre warned that encouraging any further oil and gas extraction would use up the limited atmospheric space available for further carbon dioxide pollution. “The carbon budget must be zero,” he told the Guardian. “We can say we have so-much-more-CO2-emissions to spend but net zero emissions is the only sustainable long direction direction. Putting money into exploiting more than can even fit within the 2C trajectory doesn’t chime with that. It is obvious that we don’t want to go in that direction.”"

"During his reign from 2,450-2,400BC, King of Lagash set about building boundary canals around his territory. The result was a gradual reduction in the water flowing to nearby Umma (modern-day Iraq). Fisticuffs followed.  Violent tensions over water are certainly nothing new, but they are on the rise. “We see thousands of years of examples where water has been a source of tension in one form or another … but violence related to water is growing, not shrinking”, says Peter Gleick, president of the Pacific Institute, an independent US research centre that publishes a chronology of water-related conflicts.   Basic demand-supply rules go a long way to explaining the reasons behind this growing friction. Water resources are finite and, according to climate change scientists, could well be dwindling in some existing dry regions. At the same time, the combination of a surging world population and steady industrialisation means the scramble for water is heading ever upward. The result is a predictable clash of interests, states Paul Reig, a water expert at the World Resources Institute, a US conservation organisation. “Water is likely to cause the most conflict in areas where new demands for energy and food production will compete with the water required for basic domestic needs of a rapidly growing population”, he says. Water can act as a secondary cause of conflict as well. Take India and Pakistan. Water doesn’t explain the two countries’ fractious relationship, but the fact that they jointly rely heavily on the Indus River for irrigation and hydropower doesn’t help. On occasions, water can emerge as a de facto instrument in conflict too, with warring parties targeting one another’s water resources. Exactly such a scenario is seemingly unfolding in Iraq and Syria today. So are we going to see a third world war over water, as some alarming predictions maintain? It’s unlikely, say most analysts. More probable are regionalised conflicts between neighbouring states that are heavily dependent on the same water source. If China decides to continue damming upstream sections of the Mekong River, then the downstream impacts on Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam could be profound. Similarly, Uzbek farmers are unlikely to take kindly to Tajikistan’s desire to dam the Vakhsh River. Nor have moves by Ethiopia to build a hydropower facility on the Nile been well received in Cairo.  Even more likely is an escalation in sub-national conflicts, says Gleick. Expect growing localised tensions around specific watersheds between one ethnic group and another, between farmers and cities, and so forth, he warns: “Rather than India versus Pakistan, it’s Karnataka versus Tamil Nadu over the allocation of a river that is shared between those two states.”  The Water Stress Index, produced by UK risk analysis firm Maplecroft, provides an indication where water-related conflicts might be most likely to occur. Worryingly, the world’s ten most water-stressed nations are all located in the already combustible Middle East. Equally concerning are the number of water-scarce countries where conflict is already underway. The list includes hotspots such as Afghanistan, the Palestinian Occupied Territories, Syria and Iraq.  The private sector is far from a silent bystander in these water-related conflagrations. In a number of notable cases, corporate activities have proved the match that lights the wick. Coca-Cola’s allegedly excessive abstraction of groundwater at Mehdiganj bottling plant in the Indian city of Varanasi sparked long-running protests. The 2003 decision of Finnish forestry firm UPM to locate a $1.2bn pulp mill on the banks of the Rio Uruguay, meanwhile, led to a prolonged diplomatic spat between neighbours Argentina and Uruguay over pollution claims. But companies don’t need to be the protagonists of conflict to find themselves embroiled in water-related tensions. Multinational firms are especially vulnerable, notes James Allan, associate director for environment and climate change at Maplecroft. “Water is a local issue but the end product isn’t being used or enjoyed locally, so there’s a real tension there between international business and local users”, he states. The consequent risks to business are considerable. Water-related conflicts threaten companies’ profits in the form of reputational damage, legal sanctions and regulatory obstacles. In the worst scenarios, businesses may see their licence to operate revoked (as Coca-Cola recently found with its Mendiganj facility). Already, companies are feeling the heat when it comes to expanding existing operations, notes Allan. “If you’re going to put a £200m investment in a new bottling facility, do you upgrade a current facility that you know is in an already water stressed area or do you look for an entirely alternative location to do that in?”, he says. “They [businesses] haven’t really come up with the tools and approaches to allow them to make these decisions.”Clearly, the more efficiently fixed and limited water resources are managed, the higher the chance of averting future conflict. Advances in water footprinting efforts and water efficiency strategies in recent years show that some companies – if not all – are getting on the case.  Yet the multiple demands on local water resources demand that business look beyond its own four walls. Collaborative ‘water stewardship’ frameworks championed by the business-led CEO Water Mandate, among others, demonstrate what a meaningful cross-sector approach might look like. Ultimately, the solution lies in good water governance. Governments need to provide clear rules for water resource management and effective methods for enforcing them, argues Gleick. “The greatest risks of conflicts over water are not really at the intersection of the corporate sector and the water world”, he concludes. “They are in regions where water is scarce and governments are not addressing how to allocate water fairly and effectively.”  More than three millennia after the Sumerian cities of Lagash and Umma came to blows, it’s time we learned the bellicose lessons of water’s long history.

"The Spanish conservative Miguel Arias Cañete was confirmed as the EU’s new climate and energy commissioner on Wednesday after a deal between centre-left and right parties in the European Parliament, despite protests from environmentalists. The centrist pact saw Liberal former Slovenian prime minister, Alenka Bratušek, overwhelmingly rejected by MEPs as the commission’s new energy union commissioner, but the words ‘sustainability, climate action and energy’ added to the portfolio of Cañete’s boss, the Dutch socialist, Frans Timmermans. MEPs had demanded this caveat as a condition for supporting Cañete, a former director of two oil companies. But after more than half a million people signed an Avaaz petition calling for Cañete’s rejection, environmentalists were left fuming at a perceived democratic deficit in the EU. “MEPs betrayed our hopes and placed a petrol head in charge of Europe’s climate policy,” said Luis Morago, Avaaz’s campaigns director. “The leaders of the Socialists and Democrats have broken their promises. They have neither listened to Europe’s voters or given people back trust in the EU. The public campaign to reject Cañete was always going to be tough because of horse trading in Brussels, but people across Europe will not stop until their representatives lead the world in action against climate change.” Many Socialist and Democrat (S&D) MEPs were uneasy about the final agreement but cited a need to avoid the “political chaos” which would follow a rejection of Cañete, potentially involving a break-up of their nascent pact with the centre-right European Peoples Party (EPP) group. The Belgian S&D MEP Kathleen Van Brempt told the Guardian that she understood the criticisms but that the change to the portfolio of Timmermans, a Dutch social democrat, would safeguard climate change priorities at the EU’s highest level. “We were not giving [i.e. throwing] a party when we voted for Cañete,” she said. “We are as concerned about climate issues as most of these people. It is one of our top priorities. But this is political life, we had to compromise, and we made sure that Cañete will be supervised by the strongest possible commissioner in Juncker’s commission. Timmermans has a lot of authority and Cañete will not be able to do anything by himself. On his own he’s nothing.” Friends of the Earth, though, said that they were disappointed at the appointment, citing a potential conflict of interests as Cañete had been replaced as chairman of the two companies by his brother-in-law, Miguel Domecq Solis. “People will be watching his actions closely and he will have to prove he is acting independently, and working for the benefit of the climate, not polluters,” said Magda Stoczkiewicz, Friends of the Earth Europe’s director."
"This week the city of Austin played host to SXSW Eco, the international conference on the future of sustainability. Following the global climate marches and summit of last month, its tagline, “Where urgency meets opportunity”, seemed apt. We know the problems that climate change poses: but what are the solutions? And what does this mean for cities?  The discussions largely focused on US cities, though it was stressed that cities around the world could and should learn from each other’s solutions. Here are a few of the tentative conclusions.  We often hear that with a rapidly rising global population, we urgently need to produce more food. “This is a myth,” said Rick Nahmias, founder of Food Forward, an organisation based in LA that taps into the growing “gleaning movement” by redistributing leftover food from wholesalers, market sellers and farmers to those in need. According to Nahmias, almost one in six Americans suffer from food poverty; but, he argues, the food is already there – it’s just being wasted. Through diverting food from landfills and distributing it to people, those suffering from hunger are fed, food waste is reduced and community is built in the process. Other organisations in cities around the US are doing similar gleaning and redistributing, or “food recovery”, operations. Rotary First Harvest in Seattle connects farmers and truckers trying to get rid of food with volunteers and food banks in order to relieve hunger. In Austin, too, the Keep Austin Fed scheme gleans food from restaurants and gives it to charities helping those who are hungry. Nahmias believes a lack of political will and distribution systems are keeping some people hungry, while others have an overabundance of food. But gleaning and redistribution initiatives like these may become more commonplace very soon, at least in the US. In July 2015, it will become illegal for restaurants in New York to send food waste to landfills. “It’s simply not possible,” stated Eric Klinenberg, sociologist and author. What we can do, he continued, is adapt cities to prepare for the threats of climate change. From the destructive impact of Chicago’s great heatwave, New Orleans’ Hurricane Katrina or New York’s Superstorm Sandy, it’s clear that US cities need to be better prepared. Old forms of protection won’t cut it any more, either. Cities have a tendency to build walls and gates in order to keep out things they do not want. We continue to do this today, to prevent flooding. But walls are not the answer, argued Klinenberg. “Building walls is stupid: the water just goes somewhere else, and fragile ecosystems are threatened.” After Sandy, one proposed tactic was to create a wall in order to keep New York from being flooded. But other methods have been favoured in the Rebuild by Design competition, including a flood protection system that doubles up as a community park. While the state of Texas does not recognise climate change as an issue, Austin is taking sustainability very seriously. It has a bike share and a car share scheme. Its Office of Sustainability runs programmes to combat climate change as well as a mobile app encouraging greener behaviours. It has banned plastic bags and committed to zero emissions by 2050. Electric vehicles are popular, as well as solar power. If cities want to be more sustainable, more resilient against climate change, city leaders are crucial in pushing forward this vision and the strategies that can implement it.  While it’s important for city leaders to lead the charge, it was stressed that successful projects of sustainable change and development rely on local communities being fully involved in the process and taking ownership of it. Shelley Poticha of the NRDC described a “new awareness” within the organisation that communities are part of the climate solution. But there is not a one-project-fits-all method. Change and real resilience has to be community-led and community-specific; ideas cannot simply be parachuted in. The Atlanta BeltLine, a 22-mile loop of abandoned land repurposed into a cycling and walking trail linking 45 neighbourhoods in the city, is a project that came to fruition through placing the community at the core of its development. It includes public art, an arboretum, public parks, affordable housing and community gardens. “Giving communities ownership is crucial,” explained the BeltLine’s urban designer Ryan Gravel. “It will be messy but it will be worth it. Community involvement makes projects more viable and work better in the long run.” Rapido is a disaster recovery housing project in Brownsville, Texas facilitated by the local community development corporation. It works largely with low-income families struggling to rebuild their home following a disaster, providing them with a rapid-response core house structure, moving them through a design process that shapes the house to their needs as well as forming local partnerships to ensure whole teams are in place when disaster hits. Nick Mitchell-Bennett, executive director of the Brownsville Community Development Corporation, calls it “development with morals”, and argues that this kind of investment in preparing for disasters is vital for resilience. Adapting to climate change can feel like a task too large to stomach. Which is why climate change mitigation and sustainability projects can’t just be about “resiliency”; they need to deliver tangible, everyday benefits to citizens’ wellbeing, quality of life and health so that more people embrace them. In turn, as we grapple with constrained resources, public amenity projects like parks need to work harder to be better at mitigating the impact of climate change. Our city elements have to multitask. As Nette Compton from The Trust for Public Land explained, in limited space and with minimum funding, environmental benefits are not enough; there need to be economic, community, and educational benefits, too. In Rotterdam, the Benthemplein water square is a sunken park and skatepark that in times of flooding is transformed into a water storage basin. In South LA, the Avalon Green Alley network involves making back alleys into green bike lanes that can absorb water. The creation of Brooklyn Bridge Park provided waterside amenity space for local residents; its design also absorbs storm water to reduce flooding and removes the pavement to mitigate the city’s heat island effect. SXSWEco’s Place by Design competition aimed to celebrate visionary public space designs with tangible community benefits. The three winners were announced on Tuesday: Libros Libres, a literacy and community design initiative in Dallas, part of the global Little Free Library movement to create small book shelters and new local gathering spaces; + POOL, a floating public pool in New York that filters the river water; and Pavegen, a London-based project that installs paving stones that can turn footsteps into renewable electricity.

"In July Greenpeace launched a global campaign calling on Lego to end its co-promotion with Shell because we believed Shell is leading the race to exploit the Arctic’s oil reserves under the rapidly melting sea ice. After overwhelming pressure from the campaign, Lego confirmed on Thursday the end of its 50 year relationship with Shell. Greenpeace has been campaigning to save the Arctic for a number of years. The Arctic sea ice is vanishing at record speed to unprecedented lows due to climate change.  Now that Lego have confirmed they will no longer partner with Shell, here are a few of our reflections on how we built enough pressure to topple the deal: Be disruptive and cheeky In our viral video watched by over 6m people, an Arctic Lego diorama and all its cute inhabitants and animals, drown in oil. It was Lego alright, but not how the world knew it. And was that a remix of the theme tune to the hit Lego movie? Is that even allowed? We risked a copyright conflict, and staged a toy-shaped disaster, to bring home Lego’s collusion in Shell’s plans to drill in the Arctic. The impressive production gained respect of the design and advertising communities, who helped deliver our message to new audiences. If it’s a one-way conversation, keep talking Apart from a statement responding to the launch of our campaign, Lego remained tight-lipped. This could have been awkward for us, but we saw it as a sign that our campaign was being taken seriously by Lego’s decision makers. One device we used to scandalise their silence was to deliver our petition to their door. We went to Lego’s headquarters in Denmark and in the UK to force a response from Lego, but they shut down the front desks and refused to receive the list of thousands of names. The story of Lego not listening to its consumers escalated the campaign. Work with children and animals Sometimes you’ve got to rewrite the rules. We felt that Lego forfeited its responsibility to children by allowing Shell to wheedle its way into playtime and normalise its brand for the next generation. It needed a new approach so for the first time, and entirely safely, 50 children led a peaceful protest outside Shell’s office in London. As three arctic animals made of giant Lego took shape, the scene visualised the innocence of play and made space to discuss how climate change threatens children’s futures. Lego’s status as a trusted and family-friendly children’s brand was at the heart of why many commentators saw the Shell-branded toy range as irresponsible and inappropriate. Make it real As the next phase of toy collectibles began to appear in petrol stations – including a Shell-branded Lego oil tanker – Shell announced their plan to resume drilling in Alaska. This gave the campaign a tangible sense of urgency. We foresaw a potential PR nightmare for Lego’s alignment with Shell, and used the hook to push the petition up to 1m names. Around the same time we invited a journalist to participate and report on a creative ideas session with top designers and creative agencies. This ensured Lego heard it on the grapevine that we were planning our next big push. Creativity is everywhere Co-creativity is one of our biggest assets when we’re up against daunting PR budgets or chummy political ties that oil companies enjoy. We invited our supporters and allies to shape the campaign with us. We started a mini-figure backlash by sneaking into Legoland in Windsor to set up pocket-sized banners on the models of Big Ben and the Eiffel Tower. We distributed 5,000 mini figures to dozens of local groups to take to Lego stores and engage the public in mini protests. And we launched a competition asking our supporters, the Arctic needs your imagination, what would you build to save it? Their efforts were instrumental in multiplying the voices in the call for Lego to drop Shell.

"Build momentum for fossil fuel divestment: The top five fossil fuel companies in the US – Exxon, Shell, BP, Chevron and ConocoPhillips – spend $440,000 a day lobbying US congressmen. They are strangling democracy; using their enormous wealth and power of influence to disseminate confusion about climate change, and prevent our leaders from taking action.  Use social media to mobilise people: We need to keep combining online engagement with offline action. The two amplify each other. With the People’s Climate March, we didn’t just get hundreds of thousands of people in the streets, we also had incredible traction online. Over 600 million people in 70 countries saw tweets about the march in the last week. Find local ways people can act at scale: Each local victory is a win on its own and builds momentum for the broader campaign. Your work is amplified 1,000 times over. Our biggest problem isn’t convincing people to care about climate change, it’s convincing them they can do anything about it.  Take actions that reverberate on many levels: Don’t just install a solar panel; organise your entire block to install them, make a video for social media about the experience, crowdfund some additional money to support others to do the same, and then send a photo of you and your solar panel to David Cameron and tell him to get on with it already! Empower young people to be leaders: Youth are the drivers of change, both political and social. Young people in developing countries are imitating the lifestyles of young people in developed countries. Young people need to be the model green lifestyle for their generation, much like the baby boomers defined their generation by rights. Educate governments to increase understanding: We organise workshops with the government to increase their capacity, understanding and knowledge of climate change issues. This establishes a direct communication with them and ensures that climate change issues are taken into the planning process.  Share knowledge with the media: We have a collaboration with a daily newspaper. We send them articles written by our researchers and staff, and conduct training sessions with their journalists. In turn, they train our staff to look for angles that will resonate with the public and help us to improve our journalistic writing ability.  Realise that we are part of the problem: We need to see ourselves as part of the problem as well as part of the solution. Until we connect our way of living, our expectations, and the idea of limitless growth to climate change, and what see around us, we won’t be able to influence policy in a meaningful way. Unify with people most at stake: The trick is to recognise that this is not an “us v them” issue. It’s important to amplify the voices of those most affected, because what they’re experiencing will be experienced by us all in one way or another. This is the idea behind Many Strong Voices which highlights the voices of people who live in the Arctic and small island developing states. Turn attention to the grassroots: We can start crowdfunding the real solutions, like renewables, typhoon-resilient homes, electric cars, and mass transport systems. We can even crowdfund people’s initiatives and community-based climate action. We have proven that the crowd can be powerful. It will change the global market once we start crowdfunding what matters to us. This battle will be won or lost at the grassroots. If world leaders do not address the climate crisis, the crowd will. Provide evidence for action: Typhoon Haiyan was not an isolated case. It was the third Category 5 storm in a row that coincided with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meeting. I have immersed myself in the communities affected by these storms and they tell a common story – humans are paying for our neglect of nature. Climate activists should tell these stories of real people whose lives and livelihoods are affected.  Read the full Q&A here.

"The United Nations Climate Summit in New York last week passed with many promises, but no firm pledges. Most notably, China’s vice-premier Zhang Gaoli promised his country would peak its carbon dioxide emissions “as soon as possible,” and President Obama said that next year he would publish a plan to cut US emissions after 2020. On the fringes, major corporations trading in agricultural commodities grown on former rainforest land joined with governments in signing a declaration promising to halve net deforestation by 2020 and end it by 2030. The summit was never intended to conduct detailed negotiations for a new climate treaty. Those talks will take place between now and the UN climate conference in Paris at the end of next year, which is intended to deliver the legally binding national commitments that a similar event failed to deliver in Copenhagen in 2009. But behind the scenes, some are asking what happens if there isn’t a deal in Paris. Or even how much it matters whether there is such a deal. Failure is possible, after all. The political winds are even less propitious today than they were five years ago. Economic stasis continues in Europe, previously the most vocal advocate of action on climate change. Earlier this month, the European Union decided to do away with a stand-alone climate commissioner in Brussels, merging the post with the energy portfolio. The new post-holder, Miguel Arias Cañete, holds shares in an oil company and, when he was agriculture minister at home in Spain, sat in a government that cut spending on renewables, in defiance of EU policy. Meanwhile, Germany, once Europe’s climate tub-thumpers-in-chief, is in a messy transition on climate policy as it burns ever more coal, while shutting down its fleet of low-carbon nuclear power stations. Japan’s emissions are rising post-Fukushima. And Russia, the world’s second largest oil producer, is not about to cozy up to anyone on climate policy.  It sounds bleak. Yet, strangely, all may not be lost. The answer may lie in Plan B — reframing the entire climate issue as one of national decision-making and self interest, rather than global treaty-writing. A close reading of national policies shows that many countries are taking action on climate not because they have made legally binding international commitments, but because they want to. Plan B began to emerge in the aftermath of Copenhagen. By the following year’s UN climate conference in Cancun, Mexico, many nations with no previous formal emissions targets — including Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and China — had made their own domestic commitments. Most were about cutting the carbon intensity of their economies rather than actually cutting emissions. But it was a start. Some of the targets were aspirational. But Britain passed a Climate Change Act requiring future governments to cut emissions decade by decade to deliver an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 from 1990 levels. Sceptics would point out that, without international treaties to hold their feet to the fire, future governments can always repeal laws they find inconvenient. But that may be to misread what is going on. The commitments are not about burden sharing internationally, but about self-interested domestic energy policy. Many agree with two former US senators, Timothy Wirth and Thomas Daschle, writing at Yale Environment 360 last May, that national self-interest is the only likely route to cutting emissions. For 20 years since talks began to draw up the first Kyoto protocol — whose meek emissions targets expired at the end of 2012 without being fully replaced — negotiations have taken place around “burden sharing.” Cutting emissions has been assumed to be bad for economies, so nobody has wanted to go faster than anyone else. The United States, in particular, refused to take on any formal commitments unless emerging industrial rivals in Asia did too. But those countries said their low and recent emissions were not to blame for climate change so far. The result: deadlock. But suppose that is exactly the wrong way to look at the issue — 20th-century thinking when the world has 21st century technology at hand.  Suppose there is no real economic penalty for being a climate good guy. And suppose that going green is actually a boon to economic growth, with the short-term costs of adopting low-carbon solutions quickly outweighed by benefits from industrial efficiency, more jobs, healthier air, and more productive ecosystems.  It sounds like a utopian vision. But it is what is increasingly being argued by some economists. Earlier this month, it was the main message of a report, Better Climate, Better Growth: The New Climate Economy, from the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. This is an independent body chaired by Felipe Calderon, former president of Mexico, and Lord Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, whose Stern Review in 2006 first opened up a debate about the economics of tackling climate change. The report’s authors included researchers from two leading environment think tanks, the World Resources Institute and Stockholm Environment Institute, economists from McKinsey, and others. Their central conclusion is that low-carbon investment is a smarter way to economic wealth than high-carbon investment. It will restructure economies and societies — and even corporations — so that they enjoy better economic growth. There is no longer a burden-sharing downside. It is a race to the top. High-tech and high efficiency equal low carbon. The report looks in detail at urban design, energy, and land use, and concludes that “all countries at all levels of income now have the opportunity to build lasting economic growth at the same time as reducing the immense risks of climate change.” Denser, greener cities have lower transport costs and reduced health bills, especially for illnesses caused by air pollution. Smog illness currently reduces GDP by 4% in many countries, the report notes, and by more than 10% in China. Meanwhile, smarter and more intensive food production that brings abandoned and degraded farmland back into productive use will deliver higher yields, bigger profits, and reduced carbon emissions as forest loss is stemmed. Finally, with the costs of renewables down 90% in the last decade, the report says, these energy sources are now competitive with coal for power generation. In comments to reporters, none of the authors of the commission report said a global treaty to fight climate change would be anything other than a good thing. It would send important signals that encouraged action by governments and companies. But the report’s lead author, Jeremy Oppenheim, a London-based economist at business consultants McKinsey, said a deal in Paris “is not essential. All the things we propose are in the economic interests of countries on their own terms.”  Similarly, a recent report from the respected British consultantsCambridge Econometricsforecast that the planned 60% cut in U.K. carbon emissions would deliver a GDP that was 1.1% higher than if the country stuck to a high-carbon economy. Countries, the report found, should be making these changes out of self-interest. But just because the economics may stack up does not mean a low-carbon economy will emerge automatically. Capitalism isn’t so simple. Right now, says Stern, the markets and governments are rigged against the economically (and environmentally) optimum path to growth. The vested interests in high-carbon are huge. They are on display in the current pushback by the US power industry against Barack Obama’s June announcement of rules to cut carbon pollution from the country’s power plants by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. Estimates of the amount of government subsidies given to fossil fuels around the world range from the International Energy Agency’s half a trillion dollars a year to the International Monetary Fund’s $2.3 trillion. Even the lower figure is six times the total subsidies for renewables. According to the IMF, fossil-fuel subsidies “crowd out growth-enhancing public spending.” Moreover, pure market forces cannot counter the hidden costs of dirty fuels, such as higher health bills and environmental damage. Such subsidies and market failures, Stern says, slow growth as well as pollute the atmosphere and cause deaths. They have to be tamed. Carbon pricing is one route, institutional investors agree. Earlier this month, investors handling trillions of dollars a year called on governments to establish a stable system for global carbon pricing. They said it would reduce the risks to their investments from climate change. All this leads Stephen Tindale, former director of Greenpeace UK, toargue in a recent report that international climate negotiations should be focused less on setting national emissions targets and more on fixing these perverse financial incentives against a low-carbon economy. Yet despite the dysfunctional markets, green growth may already be fitfully turning into reality. Witness how major corporations consuming agricultural commodities signed up at the UN climate summit last week to a New York Declaration on Forests — an initiative that the World Resources Institute said “could result in more emissions reductions than removing every car, bus and plane from the U.S., China and India combined.” As part of the declaration, the companies promised to cut forest loss from their activities by half by 2020 and to end it by 2030, and to push a massive effort to restore degraded croplands — potentially preventing billions of tons of carbon emissions annually. With productive land running out, they see this as good, self-interested business as well as climate-smart.  Many governments, in varying manners and to varying degrees, also seem to see national benefits from reducing their dependence on high-carbon fossil fuels. China has reduced its annual rise in coal consumption from 18% a decade ago to almost zero. Coal burning is set to decline in China starting in about 2020, according to some analysts. The reasons include both the health costs of killer smog and the growing availability of cheap low-carbon alternatives, from nuclear to solar. The new technology-minded Indian government of Narendra Modi is committed to bringing electricity to the 400 million rural Indians without power from the grid through the installation of solar panels. But Modi, who did not attend the UN climate summit, has a long way to go. The Global Carbon Project points out that the carbon intensity of the Indian economy is still bucking global trends by continuing to increase.Nonetheless, the global explosion in solar power is a major reason why almost half of all new electricity generating capacity coming on stream last year was from renewables. And that trend helps explain why there has been at least a partial break in the previously lockstep rise of global GDP and CO2 emissions, which historically have increased at about the same levels. According to a study for the European Union, in 2012 global GDP rose by 3.5% while CO2 emissions rose only 1.1%. “We are seeing a decoupling of CO2 emissions from global economic growth,” said co-author Greet Janssens-Maenhout, a researcher at the EU’s Joint Research Center. She may have been premature — the gap narrowed in 2013, according to the Global Carbon Project. But the signs of progress are there.  This doesn’t mean the end of the climate crisis is in sight. Far from it. Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rose at a record rate last year, due in part to nature’s faltering ability to soak up the enormous amount of greenhouses gases that we emit. And time is short. According to a new study published last week in Nature Geoscience, at current emission rates the trillionth ton of CO2 from human activity would be thrown into the atmosphere in about 30 years. That would mark the moment when many scientists say we will be all but committed to warming beyond 2C, the presumed threshold for dangerous climate change. If the economists who note the benefits of moving to a low-carbon economy are right, and if we fail to halt the danger, then politics will be more to blame than economics. But if self-interest is the route to saving the climate, then maybe we still have a chance. "
"What do the catwalks of Paris have to do with 25,000 miles of exposed sea bed thousands of miles to the east? While all eyes have been fixed on designer collections and members of the front row, the true cost of the fashion industry has been revealed in a shock announcement by NASA that the Aral Sea in Central Asia has now completely dried up. The Aral Sea was once the world’s fourth largest lake, home to 24 species of fish and surrounded by fishing communities, lush forests and wetlands. While the lake was salt water, the rivers that fed it were fresh water. In the 1950’s the Soviet Union began using the rivers to irrigate the surrounding agricultural area, a process that has been continued to this day by Uzbekistan’s brutal dictator Islam Karimov.  The exposure of the bottom of the lake has released salts and pesticides into the atmosphere poisoning both farm land and people alike. Carcinogenic dust is blown into villages causing throat cancers and respiratory diseases. The fashion industry is linked to this horror of dictatorships and environmental devastation by the fact that the crop being grown with the river water is cotton – 1.47m hectares of cotton. A hugely water intensive crop, one shirt can use up to 2,700 litres. “Conventional cotton (as opposed to organic cotton) has got to be one of the most unsustainable fibres in the world,” says fashion designer and environmentalist Katharine Hamnett. “Conventional cotton uses a huge amount of water and also huge amounts of pesticides which cause 350,000 farmer deaths a year and a million hospitalisations.” Reflecting on the loss of the Aral Sea, Hamnett states: “This is not just climate change this is an extinction issue. As Vandana Shiva said ‘no species has deliberately designed its own extinction’, but with industrial agriculture we have. The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world, causing human misery, enormous cost of life and gigantic environmental devastation.” The harvest of Uzbek cotton is taking place right now – it started on the 5 September and is expected to last until the end of October. The harvest itself is also a horror story, on top of the environmental devastation, this is cotton picked using forced labour. Every year hundreds of thousands of people are systematically sent to work in the fields by the government. Under pressure from campaigners, in 2012, Uzbek authorities banned the use of child labour in the cotton harvest, but it is a ban that is routinely flouted. In 2013 there were 11 deaths during the harvest (pdf), including a six year old child, Amirbek Rakhmatov, who accompanied his mother to the fields and suffocated after falling asleep on a cotton truck. Campaigners have also managed to get 153 fashion brands to sign a pledge to never knowingly use Uzbek cotton. Anti-Slavery International have worked on this fashion campaign but acknowledge that despite successes there is still a long way to go. “Not knowingly using Uzbek cotton and actually ensuring that you don’t use Uzbek cotton are two completely different things,” explains Jakub Sobik, press officer at Anti-Slavery International. One major problem that Sobik points out is that much of the Uzbek cotton crop now ends up in Bangladesh and China - key suppliers for European brands. “Whilst it is very hard to trace the cotton back to where it comes from because the supply chain is so subcontracted and deregulated, brands have a responsibility to ensure that slave picked cotton is not polluting their own supply chain.” The two issues – of environmental destruction and forced labour – are intrinsically linked. “Changing the policy that puts farmers and citizens in the position of forced labour to harvest cotton is the essential first step to addressing the overall picture,” states Matt Fischer-Daly from the Cotton Campaign, an international coalition working to end Uzbek slavery. “Farmers free to diversify their crops and escape local government controlled monopolies are the lynch pin to changing the ecological impacts.” With cotton one of Uzbekistan’s largest cash crops (pdf) accounting for 11.3% of the country’s export earning in 2010-2011 and with little criticism of President Karimov’s human rights record by his allies in the US and UK, there are serious hurdles to overcome. Hurdles that could be lessened if fashion conglomerates demanded higher standards.  This could be done by brands implementing legally binding contracts with suppliers that ensure suppliers and sub-suppliers do not ever purchase Uzbek cotton. The contracts could be verified using traceability systems and social audits, a process that requires time and money but which is fully achievable. Hamnett advises another key step - phasing out conventional cotton and investing instead in its far more sustainable counterpart: organic cotton. The environmental impact of losing the Aral Sea is not yet known, what we do know is that the cotton that destroyed it, is cotton picked by forced labour and destined for European shops. This is the reality of a subcontracted deregulated industry not bound by any global environmental or minimum wage legislation. There was nothing accidental about what is happening in Central Asia, a catastrophe that has provided irrefutable evidence of the damage being done to our planet by the fashion industry. We can either focus on Paris Fashion Week or we can act now to save our world. But to ignore the industry’s role in the loss of the Aral Sea is to ignore the destruction of our planet.

"Australia had a hot one in 2013 – a real record breaker. We started off with a heat wave that made January 2013 the hottest month on record that was part of the hottest summer on record that then became the hottest year on record. Meteorologists and climatologists looking at records tend to express things by “anomalies” – how far above or below the long-term average is a particular temperature.  September 2013 had all the anomalous bells and whistles you could muster, managing to break above the long term average by 2.75C – a departure greater than any other month on record going back to 1910. But how much of the temperature rise from that remarkable year was actually down to the extra CO2 in the atmosphere that’s caused the planet to continue to build up heat? Did we leave our dirty fossil fuel fingerprints anywhere? Here’s one answer (actually there are several, but we’ll start with one). Climate scientists Dr Sophie Lewis, of the Australian National University, and Professor David Karoly, of the University of Melbourne, ran two groups of computer models for a study into Australia’s scorching 2013. In one group, they included the extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere being added at the rates they are now. In another group of models, they left out the human contribution. They found that on average, the computer models with current levels of carbon dioxide managed to reproduce the temperatures comparable to that scorching year of 2013 every six years. For the computer models without the added greenhouse gas emissions, they got a year as hot as 2013 only once in more than 12,000 years. So was it global warming what done it? I asked Dr Lewis. Instead of focusing on blame, it is more useful to understand the contributing factors to an event, such as natural variability and greenhouse warming. In the case of Australia’s record hot year, anthropogenic influences were a big contributor, to the point that the temperatures we experienced would have been virtually impossible without greenhouse gases. This doesn’t mean that natural variability isn’t important too. There is one line of thought that all the weather and climate events we have experienced have occurred in a hotter, wetter environment caused by greenhouse gases. Because of this, we play a part in everything. Another is the old stock statement that because many factors interact in complex systems, we can’t separate out human influences from natural climate variability. I don’t think either is particularly useful for helping to understand the extremes we are experiencing. Statements like “no single event can be blamed on global warming” aren’t useful. They prevent us from understanding how climate change is influencing what we experience. Lewis’ study was one of 22 in a special edition of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society that looked at potential human influences on 16 extreme weather events across the globe. Five of the 22 studies looked at Australia’s record heat of 2013. One study, led by scientists at the US Government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, looked at Australia’s record-breaking temperature “anomaly” in 2013 for average temperatures – that’s 1.72C.  Then they ran a series of computer models. They then sliced up the 1.72C into chunks and found that just under half of the temperature increase (0.81C) was down to human emissions. Another study led by Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology looked in particular at that hot September where the maximum temperatures were 3.32C above the long-term average (what they were between 1961 and 1990). Human influences played “an important role”, the study said, and up to 15 per cent of the extra heat was down to the warming trend since the early 1980s. Another study found that the risk of Australia experiencing more heat waves had now tripled when compared with an atmosphere without the added greenhouse gases. Finally, the fifth study looked at the relationship between drought and maximum temperatures. Before 2013, the hottest year in terms of the maximum temperatures was 2002. The study found that the risk of Australia getting a year of maximum temperatures hotter than 2002 is 23 times greater than it was in the late 19th century. There was an at least seven-fold increase in the risk of Australia getting a combination of extreme heat and drought occurring at the same time. But hold on there. I’ve just realised that in the course of all this, I have forgotten to add those stock phrases about scientists not being able to separate human influences in the climate from all that natural variability.  I also neglected the one about human-caused climate change being something we should worry about in the future.  My sincere apologies. "

"Polar bears are passé. Saving the human species is this generation’s real challenge. At least that’s the message Conservation International is delivering in a new public awareness campaign called “Nature is Speaking.” Seeking to inspire young people to help craft solutions to the most pressing environmental challenges of our time, the conservation nonprofit projects a startlingly indifferent message from the earth, forests, and ocean, among other elementals voiced by top Hollywood talent, in a series of visually stunning videos under the hashtag #NatureIsSpeaking. The campaign – launched at SXSW Eco in Austin, Texas, this week – is an opportunity for individuals and companies to brag about their good works and state their ecological aspirations. It’s also a frontal attack on the residue of thousands of years of Western thought alleging human dominion over the earth as nature’s crowning species. “Humans, they’re not different. I don’t owe them a thing,” intones a remorseless Ocean, voiced by Harrison Ford, CI’s vice chairman. “I give; they take. But I can always take back. “Me, I could give a damn with or without humans.” Mother Nature also minces few words. Stressing humanity’s complete dependence on her, an icy Julia Roberts states: “I have fed species greater than you and I have starved species greater than you. ... I’m prepared to evolve. Are you?” Pitiless as that message is, there is something refreshingly honest about the approach taken by Lee Clow, director of media arts for global advertising network TBWA Worldwide, who launched Apple’s brand with the riveting “1984” commercial. “We thought the idea of giving nature a voice ... might make it clear to all of us that the planet will evolve with or without humans. It’s our choice,” Clow said in a prepared release. Each segment concludes a resounding all-capped clarion call: “NATURE DOESN’T NEED PEOPLE. PEOPLE NEED NATURE.” But will this approach resonate with viewers? “With any campaign, even one as carefully planned as this one, you have no idea how it’s going to work,” M Sanjayan, CI’s senior scientist and frequent TV news personality, told the Guardian. But a trial at the Social Good Summit in New York City during Climate Week on 22 September saw the hashtag start to trend globally. Sanjayan takes heart in the combination of A-list stars, social-media agreements with major companies such as Coca-Cola, Walmart and Virgin Airlines, and a decision to target younger media outlets, including MTV and Vice Media. He doesn’t expect it to be embraced across the board. “We are going to get some flak, without a doubt,” Sanjayan said. “Not everyone’s going to like this. It’s not happy talk. The ocean is angry, Edward Norton is edgy, [Kevin] Spacy drips with sarcasm. You can feel that.” Among the optimistically skeptical is Connie Roser-Renouf, associate research professor at George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication. She worries that the clips – which don’t address directly what people can do to make a difference – may stir a sense of helplessness among those already concerned about climate change. Meanwhile, those in denial have historically been very hard to reach. The opportunity, as she sees it, lies with those who are currently unconcerned. As she wrote the Guardian by email: The research we at George Mason have been doing in collaboration with our colleagues at Yale places just over a third of the American public into this group. Building support for action among them is critical to building momentum for national action on the issue. I see these messages as potentially effective at speaking to people who view nature as something separate from us, who haven’t thought about how dependent we are on nature, and who don’t strongly reject evolution and climate change. I would have advised against threatening people with extinction – it’s too scary for some people and not credible for others.  Of course, millennials have grown up swaddled in the message of catastrophe. The shadows of Al Gore’s intimidating film An Inconvenient Truth and packs of stranded polar bears have stalked their psyches most of their lives. Yet as the scientific evidence of climate change as tightened, public concern in the industry-induced crisis has remained static or faltered. Decades of international frittering has failed to tackle what many are calling the greatest challenge of the generation. Marked most obviously by the United States’ refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, this inability to drive policy has forced environmentalists, regulators and researchers to revise their talking points. When Gina McCathy started selling the Obama Administration’s new carbon emission limits, she declared its goal was protecting US citizens. “Climate change is not about polar bears, which I think are cute,” she told the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation a year ago. The US Climate Assessment released in May repeatedly emphasizes the negative impact of climate change on the public. “Climate change is already affecting the American people in far-reaching ways,” the report’s overview opens, before cataloging a litany of woes. While past environmental messaging has helped bring about positive changes like the Endangered Species Act, it’s not up to the challenge of climate change, the depletion and acidification of the oceans, and increasing freshwater scarcity, Sanjayan said. That’s where the CI message seeks to reframe the debate. “It’s not about nature being this fragile thing we need to take care of,” he said. “We need to take care of nature because it gives us everything. It’s in our own enlightened self-interest.” Although the campaign does not dwell on CI’s work, the group will see direct gain. Hewlett-Packard has pledged to donate $1 to the organization up to $1m for every message with the hashtag #NatureIsSpeaking on Twitter and a slew of other social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, G+, Vine, LinkedIn, YouTube and Tumblr. And although Conservation International has been implicated in numerous examples of conservation efforts that have punished indigenous communities in years past, Sanjayan said those practices have dramatically shifted in more recent years. “Today our mission is based around the ethos that people need nature to thrive – and we work on that part of nature that provides the most for people.” To help the Nature is Speaking effort go viral, CI has lined up a to-be-announced roster of celebrities to deliver even more video messages. It has even recruited aging grunge rockers Pearl Jam for the cause. The band has agreed to screen the films prior to one of their concerts (and sport campaign T-­shirts) at the Austin City Limits music festival this month, said Nick Mitsis, director of media relations for Conservation International. “Back in the day, companies like Patagonia formed because consumers were asking for it,” Sanjayan said. “I’m not sure that’s what’s happening today. I think the bigger companies today are sort of ahead of the curve because they see what’s coming at the end of the pipe. This helps us narrow the gap while forcing companies to do better.” CI intends to release a new video every week for the next few months at www.conservation.org. In addition to Mother Nature and Ocean, those screening in Austin this week are: What’s your take on these films and this approach? Do you think they will be effective or fall flat?

"How can buildings help with climate change? It’s all about renewables and “sequestered carbon”. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills’ 2010 report on Low Carbon Construction concluded that construction was responsible for around 300m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, which is almost 47% of the UK’s total. Of this, around 50m tonnes is embedded in the fabric of buildings.  Making one tonne of steel emits 1.46 tonnes of CO2 and 198kg of CO2 is emitted make one tonne of reinforced concrete. One square metre of timber framed, hemp-lime wall (weighing 120kg), after allowing for the energy cost of transporting and assembling the materials actually stores 35.5kg of CO2. If we can convert plants into building materials, we are in a win-win situation. Plants use the energy of the sun to convert atmospheric CO2 and water into hydrocarbons – the material from which plants are made.  The plant acts as a carbon store, sequestering (absorbing) atmospheric CO2 for as long as the plant continues to exist. This CO2 is only re-released when the material is composted or burnt, and the great thing is that through replanting it you can re-absorb this CO2 annually, in the case of straw or hemp, or every decade or so in the case of timber, rather than the 300m years that it takes to recycle coal or oil. Secondly, plant based materials can be used to make high performing building envelopes, protecting against external weather and making a building more comfortable, healthy and energy efficient to live in. Not only can they be used as insulation materials, displacing oil-based alternatives such as polyurethane foam, but they also interact with the internal environment in a way that inorganic materials just can’t do.  This is because they are “vapour active”. Insulating materials such as hemp-lime, hemp fibre and wood fibre are capable of absorbing and releasing water vapour. This is doubly effective, because not only can they act as a buffer to humidity (taking moisture out of the air), but they also stabilise a building’s internal temperature much better through latent heat effects (energy consumed and released during evaporation and condensation within the pores of the material). To build using hemp, the woody core or shiv of the industrial hemp plant is mixed with a specially developed lime-based binder. Factory-constructed panels are pre-dried and when assembled in a timber frame building, the hemp shiv traps air in the walls, providing a strong barrier to heat loss. The hemp itself is porous, meaning the walls are well insulated while the lime-based binder sticks together and protects the hemp, making the building material resistant to fire and decay. The industrial hemp plant takes in carbon dioxide as it grows and the lime render absorbs even more of the climate change gas. Hemp-lime buildings have an extremely low carbon footprint. In this way bio-based materials can be used to construct “zero carbon” buildings, where the materials have absorbed more CO2 than is consumed during construction. By applying PassivHaus principles (the voluntary industry standard for low-carbon design) to bio-based buildings, a building’s energy use once inhabited can also be reduced to minimal levels. This is a true “fabric first” approach, where the fabric of buildings passively manages energy consumption, rather than purely relying on renewables such as solar panels and ground source heating systems, which have a more limited life-span and the potential for failure. I worked on a project recently for the Science Museum to reduce the high energy cost of archival storage. They needed to have large enclosures kept at a steady humidity and temperature to ensure that items ranging from the first edition of Newton’s Principia through to horse drawn carriages and even Daleks do not deteriorate. Normally this uses energy intensive air conditioning systems. The three-storey archival store that the Science Museum built in 2012 using a hemp-lime envelope was so effective that they switched off all heating, cooling, and humidity control for over a year, maintaining steadier conditions than in their traditionally equipped stores, reducing emissions while saving a huge amount of energy. Improved bio-based materials can also passively improve the internal air quality of buildings by interacting with airborne pollutants, removing them from the building. The new HIVE building – a £1m project funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council – has been designed as a platform for research projects into this kind of sustainable construction. The HIVE has a purpose-built flood cell, which will also support research into creating buildings and building materials that are more flood-resilient – a valuable resource in these times of climate change induced adverse weather conditions. Industry and government must also embrace the opportunities presented by bio-based construction materials to reduce emissions. Domestic housing is a key part of this. Good quality housing can be built out of structural timber with a bio-based insulating envelope using straw; hemp-lime, or other systems using wood fibre or other cellulose fibres. With domestic housing high on the government’s agenda, it is time the construction industry recognised the economic and environmental benefits of bio-based construction materials and became less reliant on depleting resources including oil and steel.

"Greenpeace is being too simplistic, hypocritical and deserves “0 out of 10” for its successful campaign to make Lego drop its partnership with Shell, according to the former director of London’s Science Museum who gave the go-ahead to the oil company’s sponsorship of a climate change exhibition at the museum. On Thursday, the Guardian revealed that Lego would not be renewing a partnership with Shell after coming under sustained pressure from Greenpeace over the energy giant’s plans to drill for oil in the Arctic.  Responding to the Lego announcement, Chris Rapley, former director of the museum, said: “It is all too easy to demonise the oil companies, but demanding this kind of disengagement is just too simplistic. It’s also hypocritical because we wouldn’t be able to live the lives we take for granted without the supply of energy these companies provide us.” He said a sensible and intelligent debate was needed with the oil industry. As head of the the Science Museum, Rapley oversaw a major sponsorship deal with Shell for a climate science exhibition, ‘atmosphere’, that opened in 2011. On Shell’s website, he is quoted as saying “our relationship with Shell has been crucial to the Museum’s transformation.”  Rapley, who stepped down as director in 2010, said: “It is scientists and engineers like these [at Shell], not the activists, who in the end will deliver the alternatives to fossil fuels and are turning companies like Shell from oil companies into energy companies.  “10 out of 10 to campaigners like Greenpeace for wanting to provoke change. 0 out of 10 for this campaign, in my opinion, which might attract headlines and make them feel good, but does not address the real issues and will not deliver the changes we all need.” John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said in response: “10 out of 10 for Chris Rapley’s career as a scientist. 0 out of 10 for defending Shell’s Arctic drilling programme. Intentionally or not, he completely misrepresents the [Greenpeace Lego] campaign,” he said. He added: “Most people understand how these corporate tie-ins work, that’s why we won this campaign. Chris’s relationship with Shell appears to have blinded him to reality.” Sauven said that other companies associated with Shell were now in the firing line. “Shell’s tendrils reach into many aspects of popular culture. We know Shell has tie-ups in the arts, with our museums, with major sporting events and with popular public-facing commercial brands like Costa and Waitrose. “This isn’t by coincidence. All these brands bring Shell respectability. They help Shell appear uncontroversial. It’s yet another way that Shell lobbies to maintain its powerful hold on our fossil fuel energy systems.” He added Lego’s announcement should be “a warning to Shell’s other tie-ups”, but the green group did not say what brands it would be targeting next. Asked whether the Science Museum would be reviewing its sponsorship with Shell in light of the Lego news, a spokesman said: “External partnerships are vital to the Science Museum, both in enabling us to remain free to millions of visitors each year and in allowing us to curate ground-breaking temporary exhibitions. We’re grateful for support from a broad range of organisations, including Shell.” He added that the Shell-sponsored climate exhibition “supports our belief that civil society, industry and governments need to collaborate to build a cleaner energy future.” Rapley also defended the Shell deal, telling the Guardian: “I stand firm on the decision to accept Shell sponsorship for ‘atmosphere’. The agreement we signed made absolutely clear that the museum and its expert team retained total editorial control, and Shell not only respected this, but made very helpful inputs. I could not have wished for a more supportive engagement.” Waitrose, which has a tie-up with Shell for joint shops and forecourts with Shell, said it would not rule out future promotions with Shell at this point. The retailer’s managing director in 2012 ruled out opening any Waitrose-Shell sites until post-2013 after coming under fire for the relationship, but last month reportedly opened four ‘Little Waitrose’ stores at Shell petrol stations. A spokesman said: “Like all businesses, Waitrose is always looking for opportunities to find new ways to provide our customers with the products they want wherever they may be or may be travelling. At the same time, as a responsible business we always endeavour to minimise the impact of our operations on the environment, by reducing packaging waste, CO2 emissions and by responsibly sourcing our food.” A spokeswoman for Costa Coffee, which has coffee machines and marketing materials at Shell petrol stations across the UK, said the company had no plans to review its relationship with Shell in light of Lego’s announcement."

"In an increasingly volatile world, China’s economic growth has proved remarkably resilient. While the economies of Europe and America have stalled or nose-dived since the 2008 financial crash, China’s has continued to expand. The headlines are startling: since the early 1990s, GDP growth per capita has averaged 8.9%, and nearly 600 million people have been lifted out of poverty. Perhaps less well known is the fact that China’s growth was kick-started by investment in agriculture. This, in turn, catalysed growth in the wider rural economy and, as China’s rural inhabitants got richer, so they moved to growing towns and cities, building – literally – the skylines of Beijing, Shanghai and other megacities.   In the meantime, China’s agricultural economy has motored on. Despite rapid urbanisation, and an economy now driven by industry rather than farming, the country is still able to feed over 20% of the world’s population. Maintaining self-sufficiency in wheat and rice remains ideologically important, even if imports of feed grains for meat production have soared over recent years. But agriculture – and particularly the irrigated agriculture that supports food production in the drier north of the country – needs water. And as other parts of the economy have boomed, water scarcity is biting hard. This has created something of a dilemma for China’s ruling Community Party (CCP): how can it safeguard food production, and the incomes of China’s farmers, while releasing water to increasingly thirsty urban and industrial users? Globally, roughly 70% of freshwater withdrawals go to agriculture, followed by industrial and domestic sectors (roughly 20%) and power generation (10%, and increasing). Not all of these uses are ‘consumptive’, in the sense that water diverted is also used up. Hydropower, for example, is not a big consumptive user. But agriculture is, and in a growing economy, ‘who gets what’ in terms of water allocation is both economically significant, and hugely political. In strict economic terms, water should be allocated to its most valuable uses – outside agriculture. But the farming lobby in most countries has sharp political teeth, and in China’s case, the political legitimacy of the CCP – already under strain – is still bound up with the welfare of its peasant forbearers. Faced with this dilemma, and realising that investments in ‘new’ water developments can’t continue indefinitely with a fixed supply, China has turned its attention to managing demand. And China has made significant progress, as a new report from research think-tank ODI makes clear, despite well-rehearsed problems of environmental degradation.  Getting more ‘crop per drop’ has been key. China’s agricultural productivity has more than doubled since 1990, its total irrigated area has increased by over 30%, and its per capita grain yield has risen by over 10%. Yet over the same period, agricultural water withdrawals per hectare of irrigated land have declined by over 20%.  Despite progress, however, agricultural water withdrawals still account for over 60% of the total, and the CCP has been reluctant to implement stricter regulatory or water pricing reforms that might hurt farmers and hit food production, particularly in a country wracked by famine as recently as the 1950s. As so often happens in China, policy makers have experimented with different reforms to see what works. In northern China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, for example, officials have initiated a novel water transfer programme aimed at alleviating water shortages for downstream industrial users on the Yellow River.  The programme transfers water saved in agriculture to downstream users, with the costs of water saving in irrigation met directly by industrial beneficiaries. By the end of 2014, roughly 170m cubic metres per year of ‘saved’ water will be transferred from irrigation to industry, keeping both farmers and industries happy.  Meanwhile, officials are setting up a water bank that will buy under-used water rights and transfer them to thirstier areas and users. In the words of one official, “We can’t change the price of water we charge to farmers – that’s fixed [at roughly one cent per cubic metre]. But we can help farmers use less, and make sure the water is transferred to those who really need it”. Elsewhere, different approaches are reaping rewards. On the North China Plain, a densely populated and strategically important grain-growing area of some 400,000 square kilometres, sophisticated remote sensing techniques are being used to help cap groundwater withdrawals.  The aim here is to measure and control the amount of water actually consumed in growing crops (through evaporation and transpiration), rather than simply withdrawn from underground aquifers. The situation is urgent: water levels in some areas are dropping by more than one metre per year, threatening food production. The challenges are enormous, and China is not about to solve its water problems in a few years. Left unchecked, water scarcity and pollution threaten not just food and economic security, but the political legitimacy of the CCP itself. But progress is being made. Reform is a delicate balancing act, particularly where farmers and food security are concerned. Getting the balance right will determine whether China can continue to feed itself, grow economically and protect its precious ecosystems.

"One of the main objectives of this week’s New York climate summit was to mobilise finance to tackle climate change. Slow progress in scaling up finance has been a key bottleneck in negotiating a global climate treaty. The World Bank estimates that adapting to a warmer climate could cost $70bn to $100bn per year by 2050, assuming warming is kept to the target of 2C. However, the real costs could be far higher, as recent analysis shows the world is currently on course for 4C of warming, a level unprecedented for humanity. Current levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have not been this high for about 3m years.  The New Climate Economy Report, released last week, concluded that the economic cost of inaction is greater than the cost of action, and that investing in reducing emissions has economic benefits, including health benefits. However, many countries have failed to make new pledges of public finance to tackle climate change. Could debt relief be a way to generate finance for climate change? The UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon encouraged countries at the summit to capitalise the Green Climate Fund. The UN fund, established in 2010, is charged with mobilising $100bn of finance annually by 2020 for climate action in developing countries. Several countries made pledges to the fund, including most substantially, a pledge of $1bn from France. There is now $2.3bn in the fund, but this still falls short of the $10bn that was requested to get it started. The summit was more successful in scaling up private finance, with an announcement that a new coalition of governments, investors and financial institutions will mobilise $200bn by the end of next year to support climate action. However, pledges on public finance were more limited. One innovative way to generate finance might be through debt for climate swaps. National debt owed by developing countries could be cancelled in exchange for financing actions on climate change. Many developing countries are highly indebted and also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Debt also restricts the capacity of developing countries to respond, for instance by building cyclone shelters. The idea could build on the Jubilee 2000 campaign, which attempted to get large amounts of debt forgiven by the millennium. Tim Jones, policy officer at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, says, “It is the rich world who are indebted to impoverished countries because of their excessive greenhouse gas emissions. Unjust financial debts of developing countries should be cancelled, and the rich world should pay reparations to help countries deal with the damage they have caused.” Debt relief could also make it easier to scale-up public finance for climate change at a time when developed countries are implementing austerity cuts. Many developing countries that are highly vulnerable to climate change have already been taking out loans in order to adapt. In Bangladesh, the government has used loans from the World Bank to build cyclone shelters to cope with increasing cyclones. However, civil society groups have raised concerns about the ethics of providing ‘climate loans’ which increase the country’s debt burden. The government of Bangladesh is already indebted. In fact, for every $1 that Bangladesh received in climate finance over the period 2010-12, it paid back over $3 to service long-term bilateral debt. Climate impacts are projected to get much worse, particularly in developing countries that did not create the problem. The victims of climate change, including future generations, risk being saddled with huge debts as a result.  Already many leaders from the private sector have expressed at the summit that they are willing and ready to act. A group of institutional investors committed to decarbonise $100bn of institutional investments by December 2015. In the meantime, the UK government is still spending $1.2bn per year on fossil fuel subsidies, including loan guarantees. However, most of these fossil-fuel resources are unburnable if we are to have a chance of keeping global warming within limits. Investing in fossil fuels is fundamentally a waste of money, unless the world is banking on destruction. Bold leadership is still needed from governments in the run-up to the Paris Conference next year, including pledges to the Green Climate Fund to support developing countries. The progress on climate action amongst the private sector will not substitute for this. The climate crisis demonstrates the need for urgent action and leadership by both the private and public sector. If not, future generations will face both a climate change crisis and a financial crisis. Helena Wright is a PhD researcher at Imperial College London.

"Drowned out by the hundreds of thousands of people at climate change marches and all those heads of state checking in to a New York climate summit, we got confirmation this week that the world had broken a record. Humanity (ahem) managed to pump 36 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels and making cement in 2013 – an all-time high.  For those cynics among us, you might just hold up that number as a testament to our decades-long collective political and societal failure to cut our profligate fossil fuel and consumption habit. It’s hard to come to any other conclusion than seeing that 36Gt CO2 as a big fat #FAIL which, when you put a hashtag in front of it, can be lost on Twitter among videos of cats falling off kitchen surfaces and other time-sapping bilge.  We can thank the Global Carbon Project (GCP) for confirming the record 36Gt CO2 figure and for also telling us that emissions will probably go up another 2.5 per cent in 2014. The GCP includes work from more than 80 scientists and researchers from 66 organisations in 12 countries. Their research and analysis was released in the wake of all that protest and political rhetoric with four articles published in three science journals.  All of the data from the GCP project has been published on the open access journal Earth System Science Data. The GCP data tells a number of stories that are most clear when you see them in graphs. And who doesn’t love a graph? In short, most of the growth in emissions is coming from China (57 per cent of the growth in emissions from 2012 to 2013 came from China, followed by 20 per cent from the USA and 17 per cent from India. The European Union’s emissions actually fell). While emissions from all types of fossil fuels are still rising, the biggest contributor these days is coal. Coal is also the fuel source showing the greatest annual growth in recent years. A paper looking at how the growth in emissions impacts on climate targets has been published in the journal Nature Geoscience. The Nature Geoscience article looks at the concept of a budget for emissions to avoid 2C of warming - an idea that was also raised in this year’s major UN climate change reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. To have a two in three chance of avoiding 2C of global warming, the team says the total emissions from the year 1870 should not go above about 3200 GtCO2. On that scenario, the world has already used up 2000 GtCO2, leaving just 1200Gt left. Over that 145-year period, about 25 per cent of the budget was emitted in the last 15 years. If the world was to keep emitting the 40Gt CO2 that its estimated we’ll manage in 2014 (that figure includes emissions from land clearing) then the research says the world will burn up its 2C carbon budget in about 30 years.  The research also finds a “robust relationship” between Gross Domestic Product and emissions from fossil fuels. Some of the GCP scientists have started to ask how – in the face of rapidly rising greenhouse gas emissions – the world’s leaders and policy makers could possibly hope to negotiate their way out of trouble. Another article in the journal Nature Climate Change makes some studied suggestions of ways to share what’s left of the dwindling budget among the world’s emitters. This cuts to the chase of the negotiations that will take place at the next major United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meetings in Lima this December and in Paris in late 2015. How much weight, for example, will negotiators put on the historical emissions from different countries? Is emissions intensity more important (the amount of CO2 per unit of GDP) or are current rates of emissions more important than historic levels. The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon’s Climate Action Summit for world leaders in New York this week was not part of the official negotiations process. The idea was to bring world leaders together to try and add some impetus to talks that barely reached crawling speed at last year’s talks in Warsaw. Australia sent its Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to the summit. “We are committed to working with other countries to find practical solutions to the climate challenge,” she told the summit. Australia is vying with Indonesia for the position of world’s biggest coal exporter. As the GCP clearly shows, coal is now the number one source of human CO2 emissions, yet Bishop was unable to utter the “c” word. I wonder if this “commitment” Bishop mentioned includes the trip she made to Hyderabad in India in 2011, paid for by mining magnate and Australia’s richest person Gina Rinehart? At the time, Rinehart was trying to sell her coal assets in Queensland’s Galilee Basin to Indian infrastructure and power giant GVK. GVK founder GV Krishna Reddy’s granddaughter was getting married in Hyderabad and Rinehart wanted some MPs on her arm as a display of her influence back in Australia. Bishop, shadow foreign minister at the time, and two other federal MPs obliged and flew to Hyderabad to attend the wedding with Rinehart.  A few months later, Rinehart secured the sale of her coal interests to GVK for a cool $1.2 billion.  GVK continues its plans to develop these three mines to export 60 million tonnes of coal a year from Australia to India.  Is that the kind of co-operation and commitment to climate change Bishop was referring to?"
"“We are quite convinced that if he were alive today, as an astute businessman looking out to the future, he would be moving out of fossil fuels and investing in clean, renewable energy,” said Stephen Heintz of John D Rockefeller, as he announced that the heirs to one of America’s most famous dynasties, which was built on oil, were pulling their philanthropic funds out of fossil fuels. For sheer symbolism if not financial value – only $60m (£37m) of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund was invested in fossil fuels – it was perhaps the high point of what has become known as the fossil fuel divestment movement.   With its roots in US campuses, the campaign to get institutions to pull their financial investments as a way of tackling climate change has seen a total of $50bn divested so far, according to the US Fossil Free campaign. The University of Oxford says the campaign has grown faster than any other previous divestment movement, including those against apartheid in South Africa and tobacco.  Fossil Free lists 837 institutions and individuals as having committed to divesting so far, and says the rate of those signing up has doubled since the start of 2014.  US colleges and universities have been in the vanguard. “Here’s my bet: the kids are going to win, and when they do, it’s going to matter,” Bill McKibben, the environmentalist and one of the figureheads of the movement, told Rolling Stone. The 13 US universities and colleges that have divested so far are mostly relatively small institutions, with the notable exception of Stanford, which in May said it would pull its investments from coal after a long-running student campaign. The university’s total endowment is worth $18.7bn, though it’s not divulging how much of that was in coal.  Other big name US universities have proven hold-outs to students’ calls so far, including Harvard, though in April it did make some concessions to divestment campaigners, saying it would sign a UN-backed code of responsible investment. But that doesn’t commit Harvard to dropping its fossil fuel investments. Last week, the Australian National University in Canberra said it would divest AUS$16m (£8.7m) in seven fossil fuel companies. But in Europe, according to Guardian research, before Glasgow’s decision today, no university authorities had made the decision to divest. Nonetheless, McKibben told the Guardian that on the European campaigns “it feels to me like there’s a lot of momentum.” The UK campaign started in earnest in October 2013 with the launch of Fossil Free UK, focused on the £5bn held by UK university’s endowment funds. Student campaigns have popped up on campuses across the country, including those with the three largest investments, Cambridge, Oxford and Edinburgh. Elsewhere, the divestment campaign has scored some moral victories, persuading individual churches and groups of churches to pull their funds. In July, the World Council of Churches, which represents over half a billion Christians, said it was ruling out any future fossil fuel investments.  But the council’s holdings are relatively small compared to its member churches, such as the Church of England, which has £5.2bn invested in stock markets including in major companies like oil giant Shell. Naomi Klein, the Canadian author and activist, told an audience in London on Monday that the fossil fuel divestment campaign was a key step forward in tackling climate change: “I think this is part of a process of delegitimising this sector and saying these are odious profits, this is not a legitimate business model... “This is the beginning of the kind of model that we need, and the first step is saying these profits are not acceptable and once we collectively say that and believe that and express that in our universities, in our faith institutions, at city council level, then we’re one step away from where we need to be, which is polluter pays.”"
"Ministers’ rewriting of the law to allow fracking to happen beneath people’s homes without their permission flouts basic democratic rights, according to Naomi Klein. The author and activist said that the UK government’s changes to trespass laws, to speed up the ability for shale gas companies to frack beneath landowners’ property, was energising resistance to fracking in Britain.  “What is animating the anti-fracking movement? Yes, it’s water. It’s also a defence of democracy. The fact the government is colluding with energy companies to force the right to frack underneath people’s homes without their permission flies in the face of the most common-sense definition of democracy and self-definition,” she told an audience at a Guardian event in London on Monday. A consultation over the summer on the trespass law found that 99% of the 40,000 people who responded objected to the changes. But government officials said they would go ahead with the law change, as “no issues have been identified that would mean that our overall policy approach is not the best available solution.” Klein, whose new book addresses how capitalism is holding back efforts to tackle climate change quickly enough, said that shale gas and oil companies were being met by a global movement whose growth was incredible.  “The movement against fracking has been heroic. We are starting to see the kind of resistance where people have those stakes you’re talking about,” she told the event’s chair, Guardian columnist Owen Jones. “People get involved in fighting fracking not because of climate change but because they’re worried about their water. Water is what unites so many of these movements, whether it’s against tar sands, pipelines or fracking, coal mining, it’s water and love of place.” Klein highlighted the series of climate marches around the world in September, which saw more than a reported 400,000 people out in New York and tens of thousands in cities including London, Paris and Melbourne, as a cause for hope. “I was tremendously gratified by what just happened in New York.” She said it was not just the scale of the march in New York that had impressed her but the diversity, made up of local communities who had been hit by superstorm Sandy, indigenous people fighting tar sands developments, anti-fracking campaigners and what she described as the first time the Labor movement was out in force, calling for job creation in response to climate change. “To me, it was not just the size of it, this march had a quality to it that I’d never seen at a mass environmental demonstration,” she said, adding to applause: “I think we need to be very clear about this - the only way you can win against forces with a huge amount to lose is to build a movement of people, many more people, with a huge amount to gain.” The author also argued that rallying around action on climate change would be one of the most powerful ways to tackle austerity, by creating a case for investment in low carbon infrastructure from public money and taking energy ownership away from the ‘Big Six’ energy companies who she said had failed the UK. “This is our chance to liberate ourselves from the brutalising logic of austerity,” she said. “Climate is the big tent we’ve been waiting for, and why wouldn’t it be, the atmosphere is the biggest tent of all, we’re all under it and we need to start acting like it.”"
"Australia’s hottest year on record in 2013 would’ve been “virtually impossible” without human-driven climate change, with the record temperatures made 2,000 times more likely due to greenhouse gases, research has found. Four separate research papers into last year’s record heat have identified a distinctive human “fingerprint” on the series of highs, which included Australia’s hottest day, month, summer and spring since records began in 1910.  Researchers ran a number of simulations that looked at how 2013 would have unfolded without the influence of warming gases, such as those derived from burning fossil fuels. Overall, the additional greenhouses doubled the chance of the most intense heatwaves, made extreme summers five times more likely and increased by seven-fold the chance of hot, dry drought-like conditions. Specifically, the record heat of 2013 was “virtually impossible” without the influence of global warming, with greenhouse gases making the unprecedented temperatures 2,000 times more likely. “When it comes to what helped cause our hottest year on record, climate change is no longer a prime suspect, it is the guilty party,” said Prof David Karoly of the University of Melbourne, who contributed to the research. “Too often we talk about climate change impacts as if they are far in the future. This research shows they are here, now.” Researchers from the University of NSW, University of Melbourne and the Australian National University (ANU) worked on the project for a special edition of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. While natural variability regularly causes hot years, the researchers insist that the level of heat experienced in 2013 suggests that greenhouse gases were a critical influence. Dr Sarah Perkins, research fellow at UNSW, said the research was similar to the way that epidemiologists calculate the contribution of smoking towards lung cancer. “I’d say there is a greater than 90% certainty that human-induced climate change increased the likelihood of that number and intensity of heatwaves,” she said. “I’m a bit concerned by that because that summer of 2012 and 2013 was a neutral summer, we should’ve had average conditions with a few warm days. What happens when we have an intense El Nino?” El Nino is a periodic climatic phenomenon that causes the warming of portion of the Pacific, causing unusually warm weather across Australia. “The records were absolutely blitzed last year in a way we’ve never seen before,” Perkins said. “We need to reduce greenhouse gases and quickly, but I’m not sure how likely that is. “We certainly need to make sure hospitals are prepared, give out warnings about heatwaves and provide good public education such as the importance to drink lots of water.” Dr Sophie Lewis, researcher at ANU, said while not every year will be warmer than the last, it’s likely Australia will see increasingly hot summers in the future. “We saw unusual heat throughout 2013, it was quite remarkable,” she said. “There was quite a dramatic contribution from greenhouse gases.” 2013’s average temperature was 1.2C above the long-term average, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Last January’s heatwave set records for the hottest day, week and month on record, as well as a new record for the number of consecutive days the national average temperature exceeded 39C – seven days between 2 and 8 January. Australia has warmed by nearly 1C over the past century. The BoM and CSIRO have estimated that Australia could warm by as much as 5C by 2070, if current high emissions levels aren’t dramatically slashed. Even if the planet keeps to an internationally-agreed goal of limiting warming to below 2C, Australia is likely to experience significant changes to rainfall patterns, extreme heatwave and drought frequency by the end of the century, especially in the southeast of the country."

"Water is fast becoming one of the most pressing challenges of 21st century: whether it’s too much, or too little or too dirty. But discussions about the resource are often relegated to the too “technical” box - perceived as the preserve of engineers, scientists and water wonks.

"Barack Obama has six months to deliver on the promises he made in a rousing speech at the United Nations climate change summit, Europe’s climate action commissioner said. Obama, in a well-received address on Tuesday, promised the United States would play a leading role in reaching an international agreement to fight climate change, due to be finalised in Paris at the end of next year.  Connie Hedegaard, who is responsible for ensuring the European Union meets its climate change obligations, told the Guardian that after the president’s speech raised expectations, other countries, especially the rising economies of China, India and Brazil, will be looking closely at what the US has to offer in six months. Governments have set a deadline of March 2015 to spell out what they are prepared to offer for a new climate deal, including how far they will cut emissions. “It matters a lot what will come out of America in the first quarter of 2015, we should not be mistaken,” Hedegaard said in an interview on Wednesday. She said Obama’s speech, which promised the US would help lead efforts for a deal, had further stoked expectations. “After his speech yesterday, I think it will be very, very tough for the United States of America not to come up with something substantial for 2015,” Hedegaard said. Obama in his speech claimed America had done more than any other country to cut carbon pollution, and would continue on his watch to fight climate change. “There should be no question that the United States of America is stepping up to the plate,” he said. “We recognise our role in creating this problem. We embrace our responsibility to combat it. We will do our part, and we will help developing nations do theirs.” Administration officials have mounted what the White House described as a “full court press” around the summit, with officials fanning out around the country announcing new climate-themed initiatives. The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy, will follow up on those efforts on Thursday, with a policy address outlining the economic benefits of moving to a clean energy economy. But the administration – for all of its efforts to promote its own climate action – is adamant that it still expects rising economies to outline steps to begin cutting their own emissions. As Obama told the summit: “Nobody gets a pass.” Those rising economies will be the ones watching most closely as America sets out its intentions early next year, Hedegaard said. “If you were India, if you were China, before you present what you intend to do, you would still be looking at what the US, the second largest emitter on planet, and what the EU will be doing,” she said. “The first quarter of 2015 will be absolutely interesting, and what the US can come forward with there will be absolutely interesting,” she went on. China promised the summit it would peak emissions, without declaring a date. But India took a harder line: its environment minister told the New York Times it was still focused on growth, not emissions cuts.  “What cuts,” the environment minister, Prakash Javadekar, asked. “That’s for more developed countries.” He said India could adopt a less polluting course of growth but that it would be at least 30 years before it could actually reduce emissions."
"When Nikki Silvestri, executive director of Green for All in Oakland, California, was growing up, she struggled with the idea that she had to choose between fighting for the environment and fighting for “my people” – in other words, combating social problems traditionally considered to be key African American issues, like police brutality. After all, while the environment has historically been considered a white issue, plenty of studies – such as this 2010 research from Yale and George Mason universities (pdf) – have found that ethnic minorities are likely to be among the hardest hit by climate change. It’s increasingly clear that the environment is a social-justice issue. “There is the assumption that folks have the day-to-day survival mode to deal with and whale-saving just ain’t our shit,” Silvestri said, speaking at SXSW Eco in Austin, Texas, on Monday. “It couldn’t be more wrong.” There’s still a long way to go: a University of Michigan survey in May found that leaders of environmental groups are overwhelmingly white males, with ethnic minorities occupying fewer than 12% of leadership positions. But things have been changing in a big way, Silvestri said. She pointed to last month’s People’s Climate March in New York, in which the lead marchers were people of color, as one example. “I’ve been able to see all of these people of color really take on environmentalism and take on this issue as their own,” Silvestri said at the conference. “It’s been beautiful and it’s been trying.” In a survey of African Americans, Latin Americans and Asians in swing states, Green for All found that the majority of respondents said they actively sought out news and information about the environment.  According to the survey, 75% of people of color think carbon emissions standards will create, not kill, jobs in the long-term, even though 50% think we will lose jobs in the short-term, Silvestri said. Meanwhile, 70% of the respondents said they would vote differently on a candidate who held a bad position on climate change.  The findings echo a Pew Research Center survey last month found that nonwhites are 20% more likely than whites to think climate change should be a top priority for the government, and 2010 research from Yale and George Mason universities (pdf), which also found that ethnic minorities “were often the strongest supporters of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, even when informed that some of these policies would entail individual costs”. What can be done to bring more people of color into the environmental movement? “Do not reinvent the wheel,” she said. When her organization aimed to get people of color involved in the sharing economy, it didn’t try to create a sharing platform on Android. Instead, it turned to a network that already fosters sharing inside the African American communities – the churches, she said.  She reminded the audience that people who are in breakdown mode – struggling to make ends meet – need some lightness in their lives too. “I often think one of the reasons we don’t have civil disobedience now is because we don’t have a soundtrack,” she said. “The role of music and song is to confront things that can’t be confronted directly. Sometimes you have to go around the side or the back.” Lina Constantinovici, CEO of StartupNectar Ecosystems’ resilience depends on diversity within an ecosystem. In many of our human systems we’ve had essentially monocultures, to use that metaphor. … There’s essentially a monoculture, by and large, right now.  So I’m really passionate about solutions that are currently ending up on the cutting room floor because they’re coming from those who don’t fit the narrowly defined segment of the population that has access to participating to providing value to the world with their solutions. That’s a lot of what our work is about, designing a model that, like in nature, is not a one-size-fits-all model and involves our thinking about what incubation means, what entrepreneurship means in its earliest stages, and how we actually support the solutions that the world most needs.  I recently had a talk with a friend who has been a VC [venture capitalist] for a couple of decades and he’s really concerned that the way venture funding is structured, for example, it is not funding the solutions that the world most needs. So diversity involves access to participation but also funding structures and some of the structures that enables a solution to actually come to market. Robert D Bullard, dean of the Barbara Jordan-Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs at Texas Southern University When we talk about communities on the front line, we talk about climate vulnerability and we talk about social vulnerability. We know what happened after Hurricane Katrina, but the communities that were vulnerable during the storm and after the flood, these communities were vulnerable before because of policies, because of land use decisions, because of housing patterns, because of other kinds of policies that were put in place. Social vulnerability involves basic provisions of health care … accessibility to lifelines, which is goods, services, emergency response, etc. So we talk about Katrina, and we talk about what happened, we talk about the flooding, we talk about the policies, we talk about rising water: this is not theory. So when we begin to formulate policies and strategies for addressing these many complexities we have to bring the environmental justice, climate justice frame. The environment is where we live, work, play, learn, worship. When we talk about sustainability, we have to address these equity issues.” John Katovich, founder of the Katovich & Kassan Law Group and Cutting Edge Capital The wealth concentration is rising, the gap is increasing, and the individuals who make up the 99% are at a greater disadvantage as ever before. This means the loss of democracy and the loss of social justice. It’s easy to blame greed, hubris, bank collapse or lax regulation as the problem. But that’s really not the problem. The problem is we are existing in an economy that is set up to create bubbles and more troubles, and it’s doomed to fail. The system is actually working normally. And that is what modern economists are starting to prove. We, as a society, are locked in a devil’s economy that was built on carbon. The fundamental part of it is by accepting the notion – the myth – of shareholder primacy. This myth allow us as companies to begin to just strive for unrestricted growth and much less regulation and shareholders pressure companies to believe that is their only option.

"If we are going to get global consumption of power on to a much more efficient basis, one of the challenges is air conditioning. Could we find a breakthrough that would cut 90% of the electricity required for space cooling? Air conditioners in use today work on the same principle as refrigerators, but instead of dumping the heat into the room (which is what happens at the back of a refrigerator) it is sent outdoors. Air conditioners use a lot of electricity because they involve repeated cycles of compressing a gas to a liquid, and that consumes power. In Singapore – a small, hot, developed country – about 30% of household power is used for air conditioning, and in commercial buildings it is 40%.  Because much global economic development has happened, and will happen, in hot climates, the demand for air conditioning can be expected to increase markedly over the coming decade. There is a need for a much more energy efficient way to accomplish space cooling. The simplest thing to do is to refrain from excessively air conditioning a work or living space. A few degrees higher setting of the thermostat in those chilly restaurants, hotels, homes and offices would go a long way to saving energy. But what about the device itself? If the energy cost of compressing the gas back to a liquid is the critical step, is there any way to reduce or eliminate this? There is an old idea that is now being revived as a result of advances in chemical materials technology. Certain materials have a strong tendency to adsorb (that is bind to the surface) water vapour. When this happens, heat is released. Suppose that cool water vapour picks up heat from a hot room, and is then directed outside to where the adsorbing material is located. The water is trapped and the heat released to the atmosphere.  To get the water back off the material, as cool vapour, only a small amount of heat needs to be applied to the solid. Ideally this would come from solar energy, or from some other source of waste heat. If neither is available, a small electric heater is required. Devices cooling air on this principle are known as adsorption chillers. The problem is that until recently the materials available at a reasonable cost, such as silica gel (the stuff in those little packets you get with various purchases, to keep them dry) do not trap very much water, so you need a lot of them to cool a space. The resulting adsorption chillers are large and heavy – and weight is a consideration for air conditioners, which are often placed on a roof.  New materials are now being developed that are a step change in the amount of water they can hold. These materials are known as metal-organic framework (MOF) compounds.  Some of the recent ones, developed by Dr Raya al Dadah at the University of Birmingham, at Heinrich Heine University in Dusseldorf, and at MIT in the US, will adsorb more than four times as much water as silica gel. As the name implies, these materials are made of various metals, such as zirconium or chromium, bound together with a loose web of carbon atoms, so that there is a much greater surface area with sites where water molecules can be bound. But the work of the chemists and engineers is not done. Many materials will work well for a few cycles of adsorption and its reverse, desorption. But a commercial adsorption chiller needs to keep up this performance for thousands of cycles without requiring a change of the MOF.  The first materials are undergoing such tests, and if they succeed we might soon see commercial air conditioning using 10% of the energy required for today’s units.

"Barack Obama sought to strike a delicate balance at the UN general assembly on Wednesday. He had come to New York to rally the world for a new struggle against Islamic extremism – but at the same time he had to reassure his global audience it was not about to witness a replay of George W Bush’s “war on terror”. Moreover, the president had to achieve that feat at a time when the Security Council is at its most divided for over a decade, with deep rifts between the West and Russia over Ukraine and Syria. The tone of Obama’s remarks addressed towards Moscow were as stern as anything heard from an American president since well before the fall of the Berlin Wall. In an echo of the language of the cold war, he portrayed Russia as the very antithesis of everything America stood for, and invited the world to choose between the two very models they represented.  However, most of the speech was devoted to the new challenges to world order presented by the Isis extremists in Syria and Iraq. He portrayed “the cancer of violent extremism that has ravaged so many parts of the Muslim world” as the most important challenge facing the world as it was “the one issue that risks a cycle of conflict that could derail progress” on all the other challenges facing the international community. While acknowledging that terrorism was nothing new, the president suggested that the movement’s extreme brutality coupled with its mastery of tools of globalisation such as social media made the group a particularly potent threat. “With access to technology that allows small groups to do great harm, they have embraced a nightmarish vision that would divide the world into adherents and infidels – killing as many innocent civilians as possible; and employing the most brutal methods to intimidate people within their communities,” he said. Speaking hours after news broke that the US-led air campaign against the group had been extended from Iraq into Syria, he vowed that the Isis militants (for which he used the acronym Isil) would be degraded and then destroyed. “We will use our military might in a campaign of air strikes to roll back Isil. We will train and equip forces fighting against these terrorists on the ground. We will work to cut off their financing, and to stop the flow of fighters into and out of the region,” he said. “Today, I ask the world to join in this effort. Those who have joined Isil should leave the battlefield while they can.” In the tenor of his remarks, Obama made it clear he was aware that his address risked sounding like an echo of UN speeches made over 10 years ago by President George W Bush – an era marked by widespread distrust of the US and its motives. It is an impression deepened by the widespread doubts voiced over the legal underpinning of the campaign in Syria. But Obama tried to distance his campaign against extremism from his predecessor’s “war on terror”. “I have made it clear that America will not base our entire foreign policy on reacting to terrorism,” Obama pledged. With the Bush legacy clearly in mind, he promised: “America will be a respectful and constructive partner. We will neither tolerate terrorist safe havens, nor act as an occupying power.” Acknowledging that “no external power can bring about a transformation of hearts and minds”, the president said that the rejection of sectarianism and extremism was a “generational task” for the people of the Middle East. He emphasised that Washington was now seeking as wide a coalition as possible to combat the influence of Isis, starting in the Islamic world. “It is the task of all great religions to accommodate devout faith with a modern, multicultural world,” he says, calling for the battle of ideas to be taken online. “That means contesting the space that terrorists occupy – including the Internet and social media. Their propaganda has coerced young people to travel abroad to fight their wars, and turned students into suicide bombers. We must offer an alternative vision,” he said, and he praised the #notinmyname campaign launched by young British Muslims. Obama addressed head-on the deep divide between the West and Russia that has threatened to paralyse the work of the UN Security Council. He laid out the details of Moscow’s intervention in Crimea and eastern Ukraine saying its actions in Ukraine represented a threat to the international order established after the second world war and symbolised by the UN. “This is a vision of the world in which might makes right – a world in which one nation’s borders can be redrawn by another, and civilised people are not allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones because of the truth that might be revealed,” Obama said. “America stands for something different. We believe that right makes might – that bigger nations should not be able to bully smaller ones; that people should be able to choose their own future.” Obama stressed that the US was willing to cooperate with Moscow on the pressing global challenges of the day, such as climate change and the spread of the Ebola virus, but only “if Russia changes course.”"

"As world leaders were gathering in New York for a crucial climate summit on Tuesday, I and around 50 other Greenpeace activists stopped a 400-metre train carrying more than 1,000 tonnes of coal to Cottam power station in Nottinghamshire. For the next 10 hours we attempted to empty the train of its climate-wrecking cargo and in the process blocked off the coal supply routes to both Cottam and the West Burton power station, which together emit more carbon than Sri Lanka every year. What we did is what global leaders must do if they are serious about tackling climate change. They too need to stand in the way of the damage to our climate and health inflicted by this dirty fuel. Coal is the number one threat to our climate, making up around 44% of global carbon dioxide emissions. Yet the countries represented at the summit are still burning billions of tonnes of this dangerous stuff every year, driving up the carbon pollution that is warming our planet.  David Cameron, who spoke at the summit, is one of the world leaders with a substantial coal problem in his own backyard. After years of steady decline, coal has made an unexpected comeback in Britain’s energy system. Last year, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels held the top spot in the UK energy mix as it generated more than 36% of Britain’s electricity. Two hundred years after the start of the industrial revolution, the UK is once again a nation running on coal. This is all the more absurd when you consider that at least on paper, coal plants such as Cottam should be on the way out. Tougher EU air quality standards coupled with measures to slash carbon pollution, such as the UK carbon floor price and the EU’s carbon market, should have put an expiry date at some point in the early 2020s for our ageing coal plants. The government’s climate advisers have warned that coal plants need to come offline within the next decade if the UK is to keep on track to meet its climate obligations. And Cameron himself, before coming to power, promised to put an end to unabated coal burning. Yet, a combination of favourable market conditions and government policies have given old coal a new lease of life. As cheap coal from overseas has flooded the European market, energy companies have started burning a lot more of it simply because it’s more lucrative for them than using gas. Instead of being a last resort, coal has become energy firms’ fuel of choice. The glut of cheap coal has helped the big six energy firms prop up their profit margins, but has left everyone else worse off. Carbon pollution from UK coal plants went up by 19% between 2010 and 2013, and in 2012 was equal to the overall carbon emissions of Norway and Sweden combined. Public health experts estimate that coal fumes are now responsible for 1,600 premature deaths a year in the UK, as well as more than 340,000 lost working days, costing the economy up to £3bn. And for all the talk about making Britain more energy-independent, our country now finds itself importing 51% of its coal from Russia, with about £1bn of UK bill payers’ money going to line the pockets of a clique of oligarchs with ties to Vladimir Putin. The irony is that cheap coal hasn’t even translated into cheaper energy bills for consumers. What’s worse, a raft of coal-friendly government policies could lock Britain into many more years of coal dependence. Back in March, chancellor George Osborne froze a tax on polluting fuels that was supposed to make coal increasingly expensive to burn. A recent Guardian investigation revealed that the environment department has been lobbying the EU on behalf of one of Britain’s most polluting coal plants to water down measures to limit emissions of toxic chemicals. And to top it all off, in December ministers will make available new subsidies worth hundreds of millions of pounds to energy companies so they can carry on burning coal. For all these reasons, the hundreds of tonnes of dirty coal we blocked yesterday are hundreds of tonnes of dirty coal we don’t need to burn. They are bad for our climate, our health and our energy security. The activists who occupied the coal train had already tried every possible avenue to stop the cycle of dependence and destruction fuelled by coal. We have all been on marches. We have all signed petitions. We have all lobbied our MPs. But no one listened. This is why we decided to put our liberty on the line by taking peaceful direct action. We wanted to protect the health, lives and property of people across the world from the ravages of climate change fuelled by our addiction to dirty coal. At the summit, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, invited world leaders to up the ante and lay out ambitious plans to slash carbon emissions. This could have been a golden opportunity for Cameron to restore some colour to his fading green credentials by announcing an end to unabated coal burning in the UK. And he nearly did. A pledge to phase out dirty coal within the next 10-15 years was in the original speech, but wasn’t read out by the prime minister because of lack of time. What could have been the keystone of a serious policy to clean up Britain’s energy system was casually dropped like a footnote. If Cameron is committed to shifting Britain to a low-carbon economy, he must use the next available opportunity to stamp a clear expiry date for our polluting old coal plants. And Labour should do the same. After all, this is about putting the interests of our climate, health and energy security before the profit margins of energy companies. We’re not asking for much."

"The Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation is a conservative evangelical Christian public policy group that promotes a free-market approach to protecting the environment. The organization recently published a list of ten reasons it opposes policies to reduce carbon pollution and slow global warming, purportedly to protect the poor. As the first point on the list illustrates, the group essentially believes that the Earth’s climate will be able to correct any damage done by humans. 1. As the product of infinitely wise design, omnipotent creation, and faithful sustaining (Genesis 1:1–31; 8:21–22), Earth is robust, resilient, self-regulating, and self-correcting.  The group includes climate scientist Roy Spencer and professor of geography David Legates. Spencer’s research is among the 2–3% of peer-reviewed climate papers disputing that humans are the main cause of global warming. He has often argued that climate policies will harm the poor, and has not been shy in making political and free market statements, having gone as far as to make comments about “global warming Nazis.” Legates is known for disputing the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. The Cornwall Alliance has tried to use scientific arguments to support its religious beliefs about the resiliency of the global climate, claiming, 3. While human addition of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), to the atmosphere may slightly raise atmospheric temperatures, observational studies indicate that the climate system responds more in ways that suppress than in ways that amplify CO2’s effect on temperature, implying a relatively small and benign rather than large and dangerous warming effect. By itself, a doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would raise global surface temperatures by about 1.2°C. By claiming the climate suppresses more than it amplifies that warming, the group is arguing that the Earth’s climate sensitivity is less than 1.2°C.  To put that in perspective, ‘sceptics’ Nic Lewis and Judith Curry recently published a paper with one of the lowest best estimates for the Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity, at 1.64°C global surface warming in response to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Their study only included some of the lowest estimates of ocean and surface temperatures, and hence likely underestimated the climate sensitivity, as climate scientist Kevin Trenberth explains, Lewis and Curry not only low-balled their estimates of climate sensitivity by selective use of datasets but they also failed to take the other datasets into account in assigning error bars or uncertainties. They chose low values of temperature change without factoring in the biases of not adequately sampling the Arctic and the huge changes that have occurred there (see Cowtan and Way). They ignored many papers that document the best and most comprehensive estimates of changes in ocean heat storage such as those by Balmaseda et al (2013), Trenberth et al. (2014) and Chen and Tung (2014). There are a number of ocean heat content change estimates based on Argo data, but these miss many regions including the Indonesian region and Arctic, which contribute perhaps 30% of the total. The result is that the Lewis and Curry estimates are perhaps 50% too low, and their uncertainties are much too low. Nevertheless, even the low-ball Lewis & Curry best estimate puts the climate at over 37% more sensitive to carbon pollution than the Cornwall Alliance believes. The Cornwall Alliance’s policy positions are similarly misguided. On the issue of energy in developing countries, they argue, To demand that they forgo the use of inexpensive fossil fuels and depend on expensive wind, solar, and other “Green” fuels to meet that need is to condemn them to more generations of poverty and the high rates of disease and premature death that accompany it. Much of my colleague John Abraham’s work involves the design and installation of clean and robust energy sources in remote parts of the world. Based on his firsthand experience, Abraham says the Cornwall Alliance has got it all wrong. This statement is made by people without much experience in energy or in emerging economies. My own team has led multiple projects where we bring low-cost clean energy solution to very remote and impoverished areas of the globe. Not only can we deliver energy at a competitive (and sometimes lower) costs, but small-scale distributed energy systems such as wind and solar generation provide local control over distribution. What we find is that cleaning the environment also cleans the politics associated with energy. Abraham also told me about the moral challenge surrounding this subject – poorer countries tend to be the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. In subsistence farming regions, people live and die by the weather and agriculture. I have seen firsthand how changes to climate are affecting real people and real communities. In the United States, it is an intellectual exercise to think about how the changing climate will affect our future economy and society. In Africa, South America, and Asia, this theoretical exercise is occurring in real time. Climate change costs are already occurring around the world, they impact the world’s poorest the most. Surely these social and economic costs should be part of our calculus as we think about solving this problem. Many evangelical Christians recognize this moral angle of human-caused climate change, and also view the issue as one of stewardship of the Earth. For example, climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe is an evangelical Christian herself, and often speaks to like-minded groups. She recently did an interview with Bill Moyers that’s well worth watching. Hayhoe told me, The foundation of the Christian faith is about loving others as Christ loved us, and it is clear from the work that I do myself as well as I see from other colleagues that those with the least resources to adapt to a changing climate will be most affected by our actions. The National Association of Evangelicals has likewise acknowledged the reality of human-caused global warming and concluded, Therefore, even when scientific uncertainties are taken into account, the precautionary principle (e.g., Overture 60, Agenda for Synod 2012, p. 594) compels us to take private and public actions to address climate change. Evangelical Christians tend to be divided between these two camps. Although they tend to view global warming as a threat, evangelicals are also more likely to doubt scientific concepts that they view as contradictory to their faith. Many like Hayhoe have been working to show them that addressing climate change, taking care of the Earth, and protecting the poor are all consistent with the evangelical faith. Contrary arguments by groups like the Cornwall Alliance are based on misunderstandings of climate science, free market economics, and the evangelical faith. It remains to be seen who will win over the hearts and minds of the evangelical Christian community, but the poor will be better off if Katharine Hayhoe’s perspective wins out."
"David Cameron believes existing coal-fired power plants in the UK should be phased out in the next 10 or 15 years, while new coal-fired stations must be fitted with carbon capture and storage technology. In his speech to the UN climate summit in New York, however, he omitted the key phase-out pledge. But his aides said this was only owing to having to shorten the speech at the last minute, and the UK team at the UN in New York tweeted Cameron as making the announcement.  We've said no to new coal w/o Carbon Capture & Storage and plan to phase out existing coal over next 10-15 years. - PM Cameron #Climate2014 New coal-fired power stations will have to use carbon abatement technology, under current plans, but the phase-out of coal has not been stated explicitly before. Last week a Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesperson refused to answer a direct question on whether a phase-out was government policy. No 10 said the policy was not new, however. European Union rules on pollutants from coal-fired power stations, known as the large combustion plant directive (LCPD), will mean that ageing coal plants will have to be fitted with cleaning technology, and this is likely to cause most or all of them to come out of service within the next decade and a half. Many are also coming to the end of their useful lives. Despite its outward stance against coal, the government is known to be lobbying the EU to bend the LCPD for one of the UK’s most polluting plants at Aberthaw in Wales. A senior Tory familiar with the discussions said there was “nothing sinister” in Cameron’s omission of the pledge, and that the policy would stand. But green campaigners were concerned at the apparently blasé way Cameron had scribbled out a major low-carbon policy announcement. Greenpeace UK energy campaigner Louise Hutchins said: “The pledge to end dirty coal that David Cameron seems to have casually dropped from his summit speech wasn’t just a footnote but the keystone of any serious policy to clean up Britain’s energy system.  “The huge amounts of coal burnt by the big energy companies isn’t just damaging our health and climate, it’s also sucking oxygen out of the clean tech sector that is booming around the world. “Cameron should use the next available opportunity to finally announce a clear expiry date for our polluting old coal plants, and Labour should do the same.”  The coalition this year voted against an opposition amendment that would have resulted in a clearer policy on phasing out coal."
"Among the findings of the WWF Living Planet Report 2014 was a particularly sobering fact: the global Living Planet Index (LPI), which measures more than 10,000 representative populations of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish, has registered a 52% decline in wildlife between 1970 and 2010.  In the report Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International, outlines how serious this is: “In less than two human generations, population sizes of vertebrate species have dropped by half. These are the living forms that constitute the fabric of the ecosystems which sustain life on Earth ... We ignore their decline at our peril.”  With global species decline showing no sign of slowing down, this is a time for urgent reassessment with regards to how humans interact with the planet. What in particular is the role of business in creating this decline and can businesses be convinced to act for the good of the biosphere? The WWF states in its report that there are three main threats to wildlife, the first is habitat loss and degradation, the second is exploitation through hunting and fishing – for food, sport, or as accidental bycatch. The third threat is climate change. Examples of habitat destruction by businesses are plentiful. From oil companies devastating rainforests and oceans to mining companies dumping toxic waste. Industrial development means only an estimated 300 Sumatran Tigers remain in the wild. As Indonesia undergoes fast economic and social change, precious habitats are being lost. “Over half of Indonesia’s forests which are home to these tigers, and many other animals, have vanished in the last 40 years”, says Sarah Christie, head of regional conservation programmes at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). “Over half of the lost forests have been replaced by palm oil plantations.” Poaching is also a problem with approximately 40 Sumatran Tigers being killed each year. As habitats are replaced by palm oil plantations, tigers are forced to move into human populated areas in search of food. ZLS is working “with the Indonesian government to protect tigers from poaching, and with the government and industry to foster sustainable palm oil production for the future,” says Christie. “The aim is to ensure future plantations are not sited on the remaining forests.”  It is not just legal trade that is taking its toll on wildlife. “Rhinos are currently facing the possibility of extinction as soon as 2026 due to the escalating poaching crisis,” says Susie Offord, deputy director of Save the Rhino International. “Poaching in South Africa has increased over 6,000% from 13 in 2007, to over 1,004 in 2013.” There are now just 5,000 black rhinos and 20,000 white rhinos left in the wild.  The market for rhino horn exists mainly in Vietnam and China, fuelled by beliefs in its medicinal use (despite rhino horn being merely the same substance as human fingernails) and more recently its purchase and display by wealthy business men as a status commodity. “It is used as a status symbol displaying an individual’s wealth and success, the same way someone may park a Ferrari outside their house,” explains Offord. Campaigners are now targeting consumers in Vietnam with the aim of addressing what Offord calls “the emotional and functional drivers that influence them to choose rhino horn”. The campaign aims to persuade men - and men are the main customers - that virility and good luck come from internal character rather than an animal horn. When companies participate in conservation projects there is a great deal of cynicism about whether they are merely engaging in ‘greenwash’. In Ecuador, however, there is a very real attempt to align entrepreneurship with the conservation of the Ecuadorian Amazon – the world’s most biodiverse tropical rainforest.  The key is the establishment of the Socio Bosque (Forest Partners) programme to conserve forests. “Socio Bosque is a pioneering scheme signed between communities, private landowners and the state,” explains Fidel Narvaez, first secretary at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. “As well as participants agreeing to end the hunting of wildlife, they also sign up to protect Ecuador’s precious forests, ensuring the habitat of thousands of species remains intact.”  Socio Bosque runs on similar principles to the UN’s Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+). Ecuador’s Ministry of Environment (MAE) offers 20 year contracts of yearly payments to landowners in exchange for them not cutting down or damaging forest land.   Resulting in the conservation of over 1.1m hectares of forest, Socio Bosque has protected wildlife habitats and provided alternative economic options to indigenous communities and businesses. “The communities have a source of income from the scheme, so they do not depend on hunting animals for survival,” Narvaez explains. “In working together to make the scheme work, all the parties involved have become more conscious of the need to preserve our environment and wildlife.” In the fight to protect wildlife, the needs of impoverished humans and animals are often depicted as being in competition. However this approach hides the interdependency of humans and wildlife. The WWF point out that not only are habitats like forests needed to regulate the climate, but that 2 billion of the poorest people depend directly on forests: for shelter, livelihoods, water, fuel and food.  It is vital therefore that reversing global species decline is undertaken as a means of being a lifeline not just for animals but for people and planet too. This article was amended on 9 October.

"The governor of the Bank of England has reiterated his warning that fossil fuel companies cannot burn all of their reserves if the world is to avoid catastrophic climate change, and called for investors to consider the long-term impacts of their decisions. According to reports, Carney told a World Bank seminar on integrated reporting on Friday that the “vast majority of reserves are unburnable” if global temperature rises are to be limited to below 2C.  Carney is the latest high profile figure to lend his weight to the “carbon bubble” theory, which warns that fossil fuel assets, such as coal, oil and gas, could be significantly devalued if a global deal to tackle climate change is reached. The movement has gained traction in recent weeks, with the World Bank leading an initiative with 73 national governments, 11 regional governments, and more than 1,000 businesses and investors to build support for a global price on carbon emissions during the United Nations climate summit in New York.  At the same time, the Global Invest-Divest Coalition of more than 160 institutions and local governments, as well as more than 500 individuals, together pledged to divest $50bn from fossil fuel investments within the next three to five years and reinvest in new clean energy sources. According to Emerging Markets, Carney encouraged more businesses to include environmental impacts and investments alongside their financial annual reports, arguing the move towards integrated reporting is important to help “influence the allocation of capital and credit today”. Carney issued a stark warning over the lack of long-term thinking by governments and businesses, warning that a so-called “tragedy of horizons” could lead to market failure. The seminar was held on Friday during the World Bank’s annual informal climate ministerial on carbon pricing, which for the first time was also attended by representatives from the corporate community, including Alstom, the Swedish pension fund AP4, Deutsche Bank and the French pension fund ERAFP. Speaking after the event, Rachel Kyte, the World Bank Group’s vice president and special envoy for climate change, said businesses had made a welcome contribution to the discussions. She said businesses had called for better communication between different carbon trading platforms and carbon taxes around the world, while governments had been clear that any carbon pricing mechanism should not penalise the poor. “This has to be done in order to drive investment in clean energy by using the revenues from the tax,” she said. “It’s a necessary step but I think the conclusion of today is this is something that we really can drive forward in coalition between the public and private sector and there is a unanimous call for the World Bank to lead that effort.”"
"The polar bear joined the Flood Wall Street protests on Monday in New York City. The bear danced with the crowds as they descended into the city’s financial district, the same area where Occupy Wall Street demonstrated (albeit without bears).  The bear joined a sit-in, during which protesters desperately tried to tell a police officer about the connection between capitalism and environmental destruction. Not only did the officer not sign their petition, he ruined the bear’s afternoon by not making eye contact at all. The bear rested for a moment with two Captains Planet and linked arms with a man itching his goatee. One of the largest predatory land mammals on earth was caught on video by the Guardian’s Adam Gabbatt, who also saw a dog draped in the protest finery of an old T-shirt with some magic marker on it.  The wise old Arctic emissary smiled at a human interlocutor, wondering what possible iteration of roar, growl or ursine rumble she could understand without fleeing in terror. The bear seemed to enjoy being a media darling.  Standing proudly with the protesters, at least 50 of whom were eventually taken into custody, the bear did not realise that a monstrous ‘Fossil Fool’ lurked behind him, bedecked in some kind of tube outfit. The bear lingered restlessly at the barricade’s edge, trying hard to look inconspicuous for his big move. The polar bear leapt majestically over the barricade, pausing for a moment mid-leap for his balding friend to help him get his foot unstuck, majestically. The bear then accepted the help of a weary protester who had seen this coming from a mile away, because polar bears as a species grow to enormous size and are almost impossible to miss in Manhattan.  By late afternoon, the bear’s fame was spreading to Twitter. ""Chronic income inequality in America? I blame the...

"The UK has been hailed for showing leadership to broker a new target to cut carbon emissions, despite ongoing objections from Poland to a deal later this month.  Any suite of 2030 climate targets agreed now could be taken to a UN conference in Lima this December, allowing a push for reciprocal moves from other countries before a global summit in Paris next year, where a climate pact is supposed to be agreed.  But six central and east European states want more financial support before agreeing EU proposals to cut greenhouse gas output by 40%, improve energy efficiency by 30% and guarantee a 27% market share for renewables by the next decade’s end. The Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb told the Guardian that, at a ministerial summit in Milan yesterday, Britain had “taken a much stronger role than it used to and that is good news. The UK will be needed for brokering a deal on burden-sharing as they have a big vested interest here. We need all the big muscles we can get to solve this and the UK brokering a deal would be warmly welcomed.” Resolving objections from Poland, which is dependent on coal for 90% of its electricity, remains the bloc’s most tenacious obstacle. Two months ago, the country said that by 2050 coal would still be its primary energy source and renewable sources would provide just 15% of energy. The EU has pledged to cut emissions by 80-95% by mid-century. In a separate report to the UN climate secretariat last year, Poland actually projected an increase in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The country’s prime minister, Ewa Kopacz, says that implementing the EU’s planned 40% CO2 cut would increase power prices by 120%, and has vowed to oppose any measures that increase energy bills. “There is no consensus on the number of targets, and there is no discussion on funding the burden, only discussion on fair burden-sharing,” a Polish government source said, on condition of anonymity. But “the UK is trying hard to prove that a deal can be done,” the source added. “Its clear position is that the EU needs just one target.” Asked whether Poland could again veto a bloc climate deal, the source said: “We are working hard to strike a deal that is good for all sides. If we feel the burden is not shared fairly, our option to disagree is there, but it is a last resort and we are not keen to use it. We believe there is room for a deal.” Stubb said that Poland had an interest in agreeing a deal in October, before the country’s former prime minister Donald Tusk takes the helm of the European Council. The Danish climate and energy minister, Rasmus Helveg Petersen, was also optimistic that a deal was possible, partly due to British interventions.  “Ed Davey is taking a leadership role on setting ambitious targets and it is very much to his credit that we’ve made so much progress,” he told the Guardian. “Ed has taken a lead on [energy efficiency], and the greenhouse gas problem of ‘how many roads lead to Rome’. Sometimes we are not in full accord on which route to take but we have an overall objective and it is just a question of the means.” The UK has held out for national control over how CO2 cuts are implemented, arguing that nuclear power, shale gas and experimental Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology could be more cost-effective than renewable power or energy-saving investments. A debate is still raging over whether the renewables and efficiency targets should be binding at national level or just aggregated across the bloc, to take into account states like Denmark, which aims to meet the 40% cut by 2020, a decade early. By the same year, Denmark expects half of its electricity to come from wind power, and it plans to be fossil fuel-free by 2050. Ed Davey, the UK energy and climate secretary, told the Liberal Democrat conference that on the 2030 goals: “Britain is winning and leading the argument. Today I hand over the negotiating baton to Mr Cameron, he must not drop it.”"
