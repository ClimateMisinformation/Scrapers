The stated mission of the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) is to put “ideas into action for peace, justice, and the environment“. These are noble aims, but can be achieved only by finding good solutions, solutions that can be reached only through open, honest discussion. 
I was interested in getting reaction from other leading scientists, journalists and academics on the matter, and so I sent e-mails asking them to comment. Much to my satisfaction, most of them replied. Their comments on the Rossiter fellowship termination follow.

“For any objective reader and citizen of the world, this sort of bullying ought to inform everyone that science and its practice are now no longer free and willing. In fact, we are constantly being terrorized and threatened by the research funding gravy trains and large resources needed for science to progress and prosper. This is a scientific dark age we are living in because no more scientists of Professor Rossiter’s caliber are speaking out and telling the whole truth on any matters scientific. The idea of atmospheric CO2 being the one sure control knob for climate and future disasters is profoundly wrong – not only on scientific grounds but also on the moral and ethical grounds that Professor Rossiter’s op-ed in WSJ has exemplified. Thank God that the United Nations and various scientific institutions will not be able to silence us because we will never let them do that.”
Lennart Bengtsson (Sweden)
Professor of Meteorology, climate scientist
“As I myself have experienced recently, the ceiling of tolerance in climate change has become depressingly low, I might say almost non-existent. This is most worrisome for the health of science. I find Prof. Rossiter’s comments highly reasonable and it is obvious that without a healthy economical development of Africa along the lines we have seen in China, there is neither much hope for the people of Africa nor is there much hope that humankind will ultimately solve its environmental problems. The directors of the Institute for Policy Studies should ask themselves how life in Europe and United States would have been today without access to inexpensive energy in the form of coal during the last 250 years. I find the treatment of Prof. Rossiter in all respect both unintelligent and disgraceful.”
Fritz Vahrenholt (Germany)
Professor of Chemistry, co-author of The Neglected Sun
“The right to free expression and the freedom of science are the very foundation of democratic societies. When it comes to the ideology of climate alarmism, this obviously does not count for institutions like the IPS. This is regrettable. Caleb Rossiter is right: International climate policy has so far produced more damage than good for the people of the world.”
Judith Curry (USA)
Professor of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences
Georgia Tech
“Wikipedia describes IPS as a left-wing think tank.  It is not clear whether Rossiter had a paid position there or not?  It isn’t surprising to me that a think tank with a clear agenda would want to get rid of someone who ran counter to that agenda.  If Rossiter lost a government funded position because of his views, well that would be a different story.”
S. Fred Singer (USA)
Professor of Atmospheric Physics
“I know Prof. Rossiter. Several years ago he invited me to deliver a talk on climate science to his students at American University. I got the impression that he had an open mind on the issue — and simply wanted to know the evidence, both pro and con, about human influence on climate change. I enjoyed meeting him. I had been meaning to contact him to bring him up to date. I also know the IPS; like many left-wing groups, it has a rigid position on issues and enforces orthodoxy. So I am not surprised — even though climate has nothing to do with war in Viet Nam.”

Professor of Physics
“As in so many cases, I am troubled to hear such news about scholars who are fired for their opinions. But in this case, I am not surprised or impressed because it’s some left-wing think tank – really an intellectually flavored organization of activists of a sort – so of course that they don’t tolerate someone who disagrees with some basic orthodoxy of a similar ideological color. This think tank is, hopefully, not pretending to be any open general public organization enjoying a monopoly over something that should be open to all people with some abilities and contributions above a certain threshold. It’s been cherry-picked, much like a political party, to contain people of certain opinions. I am not too troubled or shocked by that.”
Klaus-Eckart Puls (Germany)
Veteran meterologist, European Institute for Climate and Energy
“His fellowship was terminated because he had a diverging view. They said it themselves. That’s dogmatism, and not science or solution finding. This leads us to question if the IPS is a serious organization at all.”
Dr. Sebastian Lüning (Germany)
Specialist for Geology of Africa
Co-author of The Neglected Sun
“The ‘Institute for Policy Studies’ should change its name to ‘Church for Policy Studies’ if the directors restrict freedom of opinions to its scientists. Prof. Rossiter addresses a very valid point in his commentary that deserves detailed discussion. Africa suffers from a great number of current problems among which climate change is only near the end of the list.”
Tim Ball (Canada)
Professor of Geology
“I have no sympathy for Caleb Rossiter. He is not a victim. He got thrown into a small club of people who have been demonized for daring to question, for daring to practice skeptical science, for daring to speak out by default. The sad part is we wouldn’t be hearing about him now if it wasn’t for the termination of his fellowship.
 Where was he when Rachel Carson condemned at least 90 million Africans to death because she falsely accused DDT of causing cancer and her husbands death? Where was he when I and Paul Driessen (EcoImperialism) were writing about thousands of Africans dying because of high food prices caused by US farmers growing corn with government subsidies to drive American cars?
Now we read about his concerns as if he is the first to discover what has been going on for years. The situation in Africa and around the world is a result of the leftist policies he supported and no doubt taught his students. Face the reality that you not only wasted your life, but did so in a way like Rachel Carson.
 It is far too late to come with a mea culpa or even a mea maxima culpa. It is likely he would still be pushing his leftist agenda if the fellowship wasn’t terminated. Is he going to expose what is wrong with the message of the Institute for Policy Studies from now on?”
Nicola Scafetta (Italy)
Professor of Physics, Duke University
“In science issues are solved by applying the scientific method. Those who believe that a proposed theory is wrong, present their arguments and a discussion follows. The scientific method is structured in such a way that science can fix itself of the wrong theories.  Therefore, the promoters of the anthropogenic global warming theory have nothing to worry if they are interested in science and are on  ‘Nature’s side’, as they claim to be. They just need to practice their patience and the scientific method to rebut the critiques.
 On the contrary, the campaign to silence dissent to the anthropogenic global warming theory has nothing to do with science. It is just a political plot finalized to intimidate scientists with the goal to prevent them from doing their job. The only  positive aspects of this sad situation is that politics cannot substitute the scientific method nor stop it. At most politics can slow down the scientific progress with some damage to society, but it cannot really stop it.
 Since 2009 I have published more than 20 papers further developing the study on natural climatic variability and its possible physical causes.  The latest update is here
 Today, many papers are being published on related topics and an increasing number of them are reaching my same 2009 conclusion that at least half of the observed warming since 1950 is naturally caused by climatic oscillations (e.g. by a 60 year plus other oscillations). To me it seems evident that the anthropogenic global warming theory as proposed by the IPCC does not have a future.
 Understanding how climate truly works will be beneficial for everybody. So, I cannot but hope that scientists will have the full freedom to investigate climate change without the inappropriate political interference and that they get the deserved recognition for their truly scientific work and accomplishments.”
Hans Labohm (Holland)
Economist/publicist
“This is the umpteenth example of a scientist being excommunicated by his colleagues because he refuses to ignore facts and is not willing to toe the party line. Throughout the years I have witnessed many similar cases in my own country, The Netherlands, and have been familiar with many other cases abroad. It is part of a hideous tendency of Lysenkoism in the field of climate science. It is inconsistent with the spirit of truth-seeking which should be the main driving force behind science. Every scientist, whether he or she is a climatologist or not, whether he or she is pro AGW or not, should speak up loudly against these kind of practices and should condemn them unequivocally.”
Dirk Maxeiner (Germany)
Veteran science journalist/publicist
“The handling of Caleb S. Rossiter is an expression of a peculiar new worship of stars that stops at nothing. […] Attention is being shifted from the concrete problems of today’s living people and over to future generations. Many people in Africa are suffering from horrendous conditions, dirty water, and polluted air.  These are among the leading causes of death for children. They could be helped today. But the public is more concerned about the Africans as possible climate victims 100 years in the future. The simplest rules for sustainable action seems to have been forgotten. It is called: Whoever wants to survive tomorrow must first survive today.”

"Flexible foxes can be found in almost any sort of terrain. Indeed, one species, the red fox or Vulpes vulpes, is the most widely distributed land carnivore of all, ranging from the Arctic to North Africa. And where its rivals stick to the countryside, these foxes have made themselves at home in modern towns and cities. Why is this? For a start, red foxes are unfussy omnivores. They will eat mice, birds, invertebrates and berries – or your leftover pizza. Our cities are full of potential food for them.  Foxes also benefit from a cat-like agility to navigate around the urban landscape. Their “parkour” abilities mean they can access and exploit more parts of the city than other less agile urban carnivores such as badgers. No wonder then that foxes have been reported in Britain’s cities since around about the 1930s – and my research has shown they’re now found in more or less every town and city in the UK. Back in 1995 it was estimated that England had around 33,000 urban foxes but numbers today will be be higher as they’ve since moved into yet more cities. This is in contrast to the UK’s overall fox population, mostly rural, which has declined by 34% over the past two decades – and will fall even further if Theresa May gets her way and repeals the ban on fox hunting. Many people enjoy the presence of urban foxes and the sense of having genuine wildlife in their gardens. Others however complain about the smell, their poo, or the screaming sounds foxes make when the vixen is calling for a mate during the breeding season. It is not uncommon for next door neighbours to have radically different views. Often, the main conflict isn’t between humans and fox – it’s between two humans.  Foxes are known to prey on rats and pigeons and so may help to control pest populations. However they can also spread certain diseases which can infect humans, so care needs to be taken over contact with fox poo in the garden by people and pets. Reports of bites to humans are rare, considering the number of people and foxes living cheek by jowl. They usually arise from the animal being cornered rather than an unprovoked attack, so people shouldn’t try luring them into their houses with food. Some cities are more fox-friendly than others. As the animals prefer suburban areas to industrial or inner-city areas without gardens, it’s perhaps no surprise that the UK’s highest fox density was recorded in relatively leafy Bristol back in the 1990s. (However shortly after this 95% of the city’s foxes were killed by an outbreak of sarcoptic mange, a contagious skin disease). More recently colleagues and I estimated the suburbs in Brighton average around 12 foxes per km², which contrasts with the human population density of 3,445/km². We are still working on the data, but it looks fox numbers have increased in recently-colonised cities, while things have remained more stable in cities with well-established populations. Foxes still move back and forth between town and country. There is sufficient mixing of the population that would prevent the evolution of a distinct genetically separate “urban fox”.  However, foxes in urban areas may be changing their behaviour to adapt to city life. Previous studies found urban foxes still mostly eat “natural” food such as rodents, birds and invertebrates. Human-provided food is only a supplementary part of their diet. However, as more and more people provide food for wildlife in their gardens it is likely that the diet and behaviour of urban foxes may shift towards food provided by humans.  Colleagues and I are now looking at how this extra food will affect fox behaviour and movements. Fox behaviour is directly influenced by how humans act towards them. If people encourage close contact then this will drive tolerance to our presence and if people feed the foxes they will develop an association between humans and food. As populations are typically limited by resources, providing food could be supporting unnaturally high fox densities. However, foxes also self regulate and it is clear that diseases such as mange have some influence on numbers. This also means that culling foxes has little long-term impact on populations. Certain personality traits or behaviours may also be advantageous when living with humans and exploiting the urban environment. Individuals that are bolder and can solve problems of how to access food quicker are more likely to be more successful in obtaining food, and thus to reproduce. Over time, these traits may be selected for within urban populations, producing smarter and more courageous foxes. On the flip side, those foxes that cannot tolerate humans are unlikely to thrive in cities and will not pass on their traits to the next generation. Whatever the future holds for urban foxes, cities provide plentiful food and refuges for them – so they’re here to stay. Love them or hate them, these animals have successfully adapted to the habitats we have built around them, and they are one of a few animals that can tolerate and adapt to our changing behaviour."
"The sad death of a tiger keeper at Hamerton Zoo in Cambridgeshire, England, has led some to question whether this accident was related to the amount of space the captive tigers had access to.  Some critics of zoos have pointed out that tigers can range over thousands of square kilometres in the wild rather than the few thousand square metres they are provided with in captivity. This is true. But despite being able to roam over such large distances wild tigers still kill significant numbers of people every year. Therefore, I would argue that the quantity of space argument is a fallacious one. What matters is the quality of the space. There is, of course, a minimum space requirement that animals need to experience good welfare, and no tiger should ever be kept in a small cage. But once this minimum has been met, the animal needs space it can utilise meaningfully.  Think about sitting in the seat of a low-cost airline. It is uncomfortable, cramped, boring and almost bearable for a short journey, but not for the rest of your life. At the other extreme, in a first-class airline suite, you are provided with everything you could possibly want – gourmet food, more space, a bed, unlimited entertainment, a shower, and so on. A much longer and more pleasant life would definitely be sustainable in this situation. The reality is that good zoos are more like first-class airline cabins than budget carriers. This is not to deny the existence of awful zoos; my point is that it is perfectly possible for a tiger to live a long and happy life in the right sort of captivity. It doesn’t require pampering. Zoo animals are already becoming obese just like humans in richer societies and for the same reasons – too much energetic food and not enough exercise. For this reason, good zoos have been providing objects or enclosure fittings to stimulate natural behaviour. In good zoos throughout the world, you will no longer see a tiger receiving all of its food in a bowl, but instead some of its food will be suspended by a rope from its enclosure’s roof or placed on the top of a pole. Thus tigers, like most zoo animals, now need to work for a living.   But would tigers choose to work for a living? This is a good question we don’t truly know the answer to, which is why animals should be encouraged to engage with environmental enrichment – but not forced.  What we do know is that optimal foraging theory suggests tigers don’t really want to range over thousands of square kilometres. Scientists have spent many decades looking at how animals search for food. And the consistent result that has come out of the hundreds of studies is that animals try and spend the minimum amount of time or energy for the maximum amount of food reward. That is, animals act like logical consumers and try to maximise their cost-benefit ratio.   Returning to our tiger, it ranges over thousands of kilometres because that is the distance necessary to find all the resources it requires to survive. If resources such as food were more densely distributed then wild tigers would roam over much smaller distances. You can see this playing out in the wild, where tiger ranging distance depends on the density of their prey. In Siberia, each individual covers a vast distance as the deer they eat are few and far between, while the lush forests and marshlands of northern India can sustain many more tigers in the same sized area. My zoo designer friends would rightly point out to me that it is easier to create more complex and interesting space in a larger area. I wholeheartedly agree. However, I personally feel that legislating minimum space requirements is not a good solution, as these minimums become the de facto norm. Such regulations could also stop the implementation of new housing systems such as the Zoo360 animal exploration trails at Philadelphia Zoo, where animals are able to move around the zoo and chose their environment.   Many studies have shown that captive animals enjoy this kind of novelty, and this is one of the reasons environmental enrichment improves animal welfare. But it must be novelty over which the animals have some control – a constantly changing environment can be as stressful as a barren, unchanging one. Variety is only the spice of life when you are in control of it."
" The federal government’s lack of engagement on health and climate change has left Australians at significant risk of illness through heat, fire and extreme weather events, and urgent national action is required to prevent harm and deaths, a global scientific collaboration has found. On Thursday, international medical journal the Lancet published its Countdown report, a multi-institutional project led by University College in London that examines progress on climate change and health throughout the world.  Its first two assessments were published in 2017 and 2018, with annual assessments continuing until 2030, consistent with the near-term timeline of the Paris climate agreement. Findings relating to Australia were tracked and published by the Medical Journal of Australia. Australia was assessed across 31 indicators divided into five broad sections: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; finance and economics; and public and political engagement. The report found that while there had been some progress at state and local government levels, “there continues to be no engagement on health and climate change in the Australian federal parliament, and Australia performs poorly across many of the indicators in comparison to other developed countries; for example, it is one of the world’s largest net exporters of coal and its electricity generation from low-carbon sources is low”. “We also find significantly increasing exposure of Australians to heatwaves and, in most states and territories, continuing elevated suicide rates at higher temperatures,” wrote the authors, led by Associate Professor Paul Beggs of Macquarie University’s Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. “As a direct result of this failure, we conclude that Australia remains at significant risk of declines in health due to climate change, and that substantial and sustained national action is urgently required in order to prevent this … This work is urgent.” Spokeswoman for Doctors for the Environment Australia, Dr Arnagretta Hunter, agreed Australia was poorly prepared for the health challenge of climate change. “Doctors around Australia are already seeing multiple health effects from climate change,” Hunter, a cardiologist, said. “On the coast of NSW this week we know there are more respiratory illnesses, heart attacks and strokes as a consequence of the terrible air pollution from the fires. Doctors see the mental health effects of drought in rural communities. Patterns of infectious diseases are changing. “Average summer temperatures in Australia have risen by 1.66C in the past 20 years, with the intensity of heatwaves rising by a third. And with the increasing temperatures over summer we know there has been increased hospital admissions with ill health. Mortality rates are also affected.” In 2014, Melbourne experienced temperatures over 41C from 14 to 17 January, as well as 167 excess deaths and a new record set for the highest number of calls for ambulance services ever received in a day, she said. Hunter described Australia as the developed country with the most serious vulnerability to climate change through heat, fire, water shortages and extreme weather events. “Doctors for the Environment Australia joins the loud chorus across Australia calling for the federal government to acknowledge the risk and act in proportion to the magnitude of the threat,” she said. In 2019, the Australian Medical Association, Doctors for the Environment Australia and the World Medical Association recognised climate change as a health emergency. Public Health Association of Australia senior policy officer Dr Ingrid Johnston said the priorities of the fossil fuel industry had been placed ahead of the health of Australians. “No one can dispute that climate change poses significant immediate, medium-term and long-term risks to the health of Australians and communities around the world,” she told Guardian Australia. “And yet the government appears to believe that climate change is not a mainstream health issue. This is tragically wrong. The issues cannot be siloed.” She called on the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to issue a statement unambiguously acknowledging the link between climate change and health. Johnston said the activities of the federal government’s disaster and climate resilience reference group – a group of senior officials which considers the risks and opportunities arising from climate change and natural disasters – had not been transparent in its work. “The public has a right to know what that working group is doing,” she said. “How much information is the government giving consideration to regarding climate impacts in national assessments of health? “Australians are crying out for genuine, smart and empathetic national leadership. The above cannot happen without a well-resourced and national effort to reduce future threat levels from fires and drought.” She said the Public Health Association of Australia wanted a Coag health and climate change forum consisting of ministers with responsibility for health, environment, energy and other portfolios. “No area is untouched by climate change,” Johnston said. “This Coag working group would incorporate academic expertise on how to adapt the health system to a changing climate with more natural disasters, with adequate funding for proposals. The sniping politics has to stop so we can get on with working for health and the national interest. “Finally, we call out the policy that does exist. It is a policy that places the fossil fuel industry above the health and wellbeing of all Australians. It backs subsidies for fossil fuels and subverts tough environmental planning for mines and gas projects.” General practitioner Dr Peter Tait, who also has a master’s degree in climate change and is involved with health and environmental groups, said there was no mechanism in the national health system to collect information about climate-related illnesses other than in a random or anecdotal way. “Even in emergency departments where the severe end of these conditions go, data collection is dependent on the treating doctor using a code to identify heat stress or natural disaster effects, and apart from the obvious ones, like burns, they don’t,” he said. “We do know that the mental health toll from destructive fires and other natural disasters will be high. This is a supernatural disaster occasioned by decades of purposeful neglect by governments and as that dawns on people, anger and distress will rise.”"

Bild daily has had enough of the constant screaming of alarm, and expressed it in very clear terms on September 11, 2014:
World refuses to end: Apocalypse? No!
Ozone hole, bird flu, Mayan curse or El Niño: How occupational pessimists, esoteric eggheads, astro-kooks and eco-freaks constantly want to talk us into the end of the world.
For 30 years we feared the ozone hole that had exposed us without protection to insidious UV rays: Until Wednesday.

4. Climate change is melting the poles
Hardly anything in science is more at loggerheads than the question of to what extent man causes climate change. It’s an undisputed fact that the amount of carbon dioxide and other ‘greenhouse gases’ in the air has risen strongly since industrialization, recently at a record level, and also the rise in global mean temperature (currently globally at 0.13°C per decade). But on the other hand the warnings of the dramatic melting of the poles and horror flooding of the poor Pacific islands have proven to be exaggerated. Currently the sea level is rising 3.2 mm per year. And the melting at the poles? Last summer the sea ice area in the Arctic compared to a year earlier rose 60%. 20 ships had to be rescued by ice breakers.”
Read the entire article at bild.de.
=======================================
Adding to Vahrenholt’s and Lünings piece, in its article Bild brings up 8 once claimed end-of-world scenarios that never came true: 1) acid rain/forest die-off, 2) Mayan Calendar, 3)  2014/2015 El Niño, 4) poles melting/climate change, 5) bird flu, 6) Nostradamus, 7) 1910 Haley’s Comet, and 8) nuclear inferno.
Bild sarcastically ends the part about the climate catastrophe with a photo of a semi-submerged Brandenburg Gate with the caption:
The Brandenburg Gate has remained completely spared by the ‘worst environmental catastrophe since Chernobyl’.”
Glad to see Bild is taking this step when it comes to the kooky climate catastrophe. It served them well, but now they are moving on.

"As a child in the 1970s and 1980s Sir David Attenborough’s series were my most eagerly-awaited TV programmes. At school my friends and I discussed Life on Earth and The Trials of Life the way kids today discuss soap operas. We marvelled at the images, but we were hooked by the stories.  The art of a brilliant wildlife documentary is in the storytelling, and Attenborough is the supreme narrator. When I was a child, his wildlife documentaries had more than 20m British viewers, figures Simon Cowell can only dream of. His shows were broadcast in the USSR and China, even during the cold war. At the time, he may have been the most recognised person in the world. Of course, as a young undergraduate biologist he was my idol. I remember once filling in a competition form that asked which living person would you most to like have dinner with. I answered Sir David. I didn’t win that competition, but I did have dinner with him many years later, when I worked on the filming of the Life of Mammals in Brazil. The three days I spent with Sir David showed him to be a humble, empathetic and educated person. The overriding memory I have is of him sitting reading scientific papers in a deckchair, in the field, waiting to film. Mistakenly I believed that the great Sir David Attenborough had research assistants who wrote his script and provided him with information. But then he is not really a presenter acting on camera, but rather a wildlife enthusiast sharing his authentic wonderment with the viewing public. In modern, celebrity-driven TV, image is everything. Presenters parade in front of the cameras like gaudy peacocks: all show and no substance. They may not be reading from a teleprompter, but the lack of spontaneity in their words makes many of them sound as sincere as a second-hand car salesman. Then there is Sir David, he looks unremarkable, like everyone’s favourite old uncle or grandfather, but his talent is extraordinary. It is easy to tell a story about the rock stars of the animal world: tigers, polar bears or giant pandas. But what makes Sir David a great storyteller is his ability to make the humble British dormouse as interesting as a mountain gorilla. It may not come and sit on him, but it nonetheless has a life less ordinary. Conveying the magic in the lives of apparently mundane creatures is a rare gift. But not one without precedent in UK television. Think about Britain’s most famous soap operas: Coronation Street and Eastenders – they succeed by using storylines that show the fascinating lives of ordinary people. I suspect the global appeal of wildlife TV is that all humans share with animals the struggles to find shelter, food, a mate and to rear their offspring. In documentaries of the animal world we see that our everyday existence is worthy of attention, even if we are only celebrities in the eyes of those who know the tale of our existence. Thus, the chronicling of animal lives is very much like the soap opera of our own existence. But animal lives are more timeless, free from fashion, which as I tell my students means Sir David’s back catalogue will always be interesting unlike old episodes of soap operas. If it were not for Sir David’s mesmeric storytelling I would probably have become an accountant. I am sure that people from all walks of life around our planet will join me in wishing him a very a happy birthday."

“You need to get scientists that are not paid by the drug companies to determine what the cholesterol guidelines should be”.

Not long ago I did a report on a study showing that meat-eaters are much healthier than vegetarians – coming from the University of Graz in Austria. I didn’t expect the story to attract so much attention. So far it has been shared over 8000 times and may reach 10,000 shares. The study contradicts everything we’ve been told about what a healthy diet is.

I used to have a lot of respect for the scientific community. But the more I look into things like climate, and now nutrition and medicine, the more I’m realizing that much of it is rotten to the core and has long been overrun by greedy, swindling bastards who crave money and/or power.
My advice: Don’t trust any of today’s “renowned scientists” claiming the science is settled. Chances are they are profiting at the expense of others.

"On Saturday, Labour will hold its clause V meeting to finalise the contents of its election manifesto. Here are five key areas of debate:  A motion passed at conference suggested Labour would target net zero emissions in 2030 – though the wrangling over the wording was so intense it took two separate compositing meetings to reach agreement. Unions, and in particular the GMB, are concerned this is an unachievable target, and would result in mass job losses. They reckon they have won this one: when Rebecca Long-Bailey announced Labour’s policy in October, it included a target of reaching net zero by “the 2030s”. Len McCluskey’s high-profile intervention this week – warning against any significant increase in migration without tougher labour market laws – was a window into the struggle between two aspects of Corbynism. Across the new left, including the campaign group Momentum, which has recently begun taking more of an interest in policy, there is a desire to shift Labour to a much more open approach, definitively rejecting the approach symbolised by Ed Miliband’s “Controls on Immigration” mugs in 2015. But the Labour leader’s trade union backers – and many of his close advisers – are conscious of the risk of alienating Brexit-supporting Labour voters, many of whom, they believe, remain concerned about migration. They are expected to win this one too. Labour’s Brexit policy has evolved significantly over the past 12 months, under significant pressure from pro-remain members of the shadow cabinet, including Keir Starmer and Tom Watson. But with Watson leaving parliament, and Starmer and fellow remainer Emily Thornberry all but absent from the campaigning frontline, there is unlikely to be any further change in the manifesto. Indeed, Corbyn kicked off the campaign by telling the Guardian: “The debate is over” – and signalling that he would not say until after an election which side he would take in a referendum. Labour is keen not to suffer the fate of Miliband, who spent much of the 2015 campaign batting away hypothetical questions about how he would deal with a hung parliament, and ended up Photoshopped into Nicola Sturgeon’s pocket. But at the same time, Corbyn’s team knows its path to power may well lie in persuading Sturgeon’s party to support Labour as a minority administration – and Corbyn himself is instinctively keen on self-determination for small states. Corbyn appeared to suggest his party would not accept another independence referendum in the first term of a Labour government this week – but aides later clarified his position to say it would not be in the first year or two. Expect this part of the manifesto to have been pored over intensely. John McDonnell has said he will publish a “grey book” alongside Labour’s manifesto, setting out his costings for the party’s policies and how they will be paid for. He has already said he would raise the top rate of tax to 50p for workers earning more than £150,000 a year, repeating a 2017 plan; and announced a new tax on media giants to pay for Labour’s broadband plan – but there may well be more tax changes to come. Labour will be keen to counter the perception, pushed hard by the Conservatives this week, that ordinary taxpayers will end up footing the bill. But it will also want to avoid thinktanks such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies picking holes in its plans."

Share this...FacebookTwitterProducing alarmist scenarios and visions of climate horror are in vogue today at various weather and climate institutions. For example a recent study has just come out warning that Western Antarctic Ice Sheet is on the verge of a “chain reaction to collapse” – due to warming of course. (Never mind Antarctic sea ice is at a record high for the date). Things are no different at Germany’s national weather service; Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD), who seem to have problems telling the truth.
======================================
Surprise! Original data refuses to back up DWD’s claims of wetter winters in Germany
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
A dew days ago D. E. Koelle expressed some outrage at questionable statements made by the Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD German Weather Service) at a press conference in March 2014. The dubious statements were about Germany’s historical temperature development and came across as being alarmist (see “German Weather Service Uses Manipulative Statistical Sleights Of Hand To Craft Warming“). The DWD also looked at other weather parameters at the event, like precipitation. On page 2 of its press release the DWD writes:
Winter in Germany has gotten 30% wetter since 1881
Climate change in Germany can also be seen in precipitation data. The DWD experts calculated a 10% increase for annual mean precipitation since 1881. If one considers only winters, the increase nationwide is almost 30%. For spring and autumn the increases are almost 12% and 9% respectively. In the summer months the mean precipitation amounts since 1881 have decreased 1.2%.”
Winters are getting wetter, so salvage whatever you can.

But hold on a second. Let’s take a look to see if there is any truth behind the DWD’s claim of winter floods. To do this we use the online precipitation data that the DWD provide themselves. The result is depicted below. The surprise is great: Winter precipitation (December-January-February, DJF) is currently only about 4.5% higher than the period around 1918 and the 30-year smoothed curve always goes up and down. Climate alarm!

Figure: Precipitation in Germany over the last 125 years. Data source: DWD. Chart: DH7FB
 =========================
Moreover, the chart shows a downward trend, which happens to coincide with Germany’s temperature trend over the last 15 years. The DWD is misleading and abusing the public trust.
[Note: 30% is the relative increase and is thus circa 7 times more than 4.5%]

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe print 35/2014 edition of Spiegel magazine focuses on the growing failure of Germany’s first ambitious offshore wind energy project, BARD Offshore 1, which aims to be a model for the world in providing clean, green energy on a large scale.

So far things hardly could have gotten any worse technically, and now financially and legally. For Germany, a highly admired nation when it comes to science, engineering, and technical prowess, the large scale energy project threatens to morph into an embarrassment of monumental dimensions. See more background here and here.
Fried electrical filters
The trouble surrounds the BARD 1 offshore windpark in the North Sea. Originally the park had been officially opened last year in August, but had to shut down almost immediately because of technical faults.
Then in March, 2014, engineers tried once again to bring the massive windpark online, again they were met with failure as “wild current” fried filters an offshore electrical converter station after a just a few mere hours.
Today, 6 months later, it appears engineers are not any closer to finding a solution.
Lost power valued at 340 million euros
The print edition of Spiegel writes that engineers are still scrambling to sort out the technical problems involved in bringing power from 80 turbines 100 km offshore through a converter station, and then onshore to markets. The project has now been delayed more than one year and Spiegel estimates that the lost power generation could be as high as 340 million euros in value.
Lawyers now getting involved
As the delays grow and financial losses mount, the investors and banks who had poured billions into the project are getting increasingly nervous. Spiegel writes that not only the hunt for the root cause of the technical problem is feverishly underway, but so is the hunt to find the responsible parties. Spiegel writes:

Indeed not only the engineers have been working feverishly on the repairs, but also lawyers are now involved. In the meantime everything has turned to the question of who is responsible for the fiasco – and the costs.”
Spiegel: “problem for entire green industry”
The problems at BARD 1 are so serious that Spiegel writes it is “a problem for the entire green energy industry“. The Trianel Windpark Borkum, Germany’s second major offshore wind project, is scheduled to come online this month, but now no one is sure whether or not the park will operate smoothly, Spiegel reports.
“It’s about a faulty total system”
The problem, Spiegel writes, is the great distance the windpark is located from the coast, which makes it impossible to bring the power onshore with conventional technology. The power cannot be transmitted through an underwater cable as alternating current, but rather must be transmitted as DC current. Unfortunately that task is proving not easy to manage.
Spiegel cites an expert on whether it will be possible to solve the big problems. Hans-Günter Eckel, Professor of Power Electronics at the University of Rostock:

Most likely there isn’t a single thing that is responsible, but rather it’s about a faulty total system. It’s going to require patience. It’s a completely new and complex technology.”

Spiegel sums it up:

The industry is nervous. At Trianel they have put off the decision to build an additional 200 MW windpark until further notice.

Suddenly everyone is now playing it safe – waiting to see if BARD 1 will make it. Finally they are beginning to think about whether the whole project is feasible or not – something that should have been done years and years ago.
One thing is becoming very clear: In the mad rush to green energy, investors and politicians leaped before they looked. Warnings were abundant, but were simply dismissed as offhand. Now the investors and proponents are moaning loudly about the hard landing that is coming soon.

"Ireland’s first youth assembly on the climate crisis has challenged politicians to lead a transformation of schools, supermarkets, farms, forests and businesses. A group of 157 children aged 10 to 17 filled the chamber of the Dáil, Ireland’s lower house of parliament, in Dublin to debate environmental priorities and issue 10 recommendations.  In a statement on Friday the assembly urged elected representatives and adults to pay heed and said: “We are NOT experts. In our recommendations we offer ideas but we do NOT have all the answers.” The gathering was a starting point to protect and progress society, it said. “We call on you to listen to the science, to take on board our recommendations and to work on our behalf to ensure that we – and you – have a future.” The children and teens, drawn from all of Ireland’s 26 counties, matched the number of deputies who are elected to the Dáil. The Dáil Speaker, Seán Ó Fearghaíl, chaired proceedings and RTE carried a live broadcast. Conal O’Boyle, 17, from Donegal told the chamber the world was on a “fast lane to a climate breakdown” and called on children to unite. He criticised Ireland’s dependency on fossil fuels and the policymaker who had granted energy companies licences to drill off the west coast. “They have embarrassed this country on an international level when it comes to climate action.” Sioda Monaghan, 14, from Mayo, said ignoring the crisis was inhumane and not an option. “How many of us have paused to consider the cost of doing nothing?” she said. Recommendations included a ban on importing fracked gas, higher carbon taxes, climate impact labels on food, turning at least a 10th of farmland into forestry, and mandatory primary school teaching about sustainability. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, praised young people as climate leaders. “They’re the ones who understand the science. They’re the ones who get it. And, they are the ones who are demanding action from adults and politicians and from people in power and influence in politics and business and society.” Earlier this month, environmentalists heaped scorn on Varadkar after he said the climate crisis could have benefits such as warmer winters, lower heating bills and fewer deaths. Ireland is one of the EU’s worst carbon emission offenders and faces fines of more than €250m (£216m) for missing 2020 targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adopting renewable energy. The government unveiled an ambitious plan in June that outlined measures to curb emissions and set a path for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Sceptics say trends in agriculture will derail the timetable and that some targets, such as having almost 1m electric vehicles on Irish roads, are fanciful. Jack Chambers, a climate spokesman for the opposition Fianna Fáil party, criticised Ireland’s record and urged authorities to not patronise young activists. “The government must not tell them that they will simply listen to their concerns, and merely applaud the assembly as a symbolic moment.”"

"China’s remarkable growth over the past three decades has elevated it to global superpower status. But its economic miracle has also attracted attention for the wrong reasons: the country is now the world’s largest energy consumer, oil importer, and CO₂ emitter. It led to the line that China builds a new coal-fired power station each week being faithfully and unquestioningly repeated. However, this is no longer a fair reflection of the country’s energy situation. It’s true that China consumes around a quarter of the world’s total primary energy and more than half its coal. This was once a necessity. The “open door” policy to foreign investment that began in the late 1970s led to rapid economic growth and, in turn, a spectacular rise in energy demand. Electricity consumption in China rose from just 232 kilowatt hours (KWh) in 1978 to nearly 6,000 terawatt hours (TWh) today – that is, six thousand billion kilowatt hours – and to keep up with demand, China needed coal. However, coal as a proportion of China’s energy mix peaked at 75% in the late 1980s and by 2016 it had fallen to 62%, the lowest since the establishment of the People’s Republic in 1949. This was a result of Beijing taking serious measures in recent years to cut coal, in order to reduce domestic pollution and to tackle climate change.  One of these measures was the Top-1,000 Enterprises Energy-Saving Programme. Launched in 2006, the programme targeted the country’s largest energy-consuming firms in sectors like steel, petrochemicals, cement, and textiles. Together, these 1,000 enterprises accounted for a third of the nation’s energy consumption. The programme was quite effective and contributed towards China’s efforts to reduce its energy consumption per unit of GDP. The government has also taken action to slow the country’s economic growth and set lower annual rate of GDP growth at 6.5% in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), against 9-10% in the previous three decades.  With economic growth slowing and the heaviest polluters being forced to use less energy, coal generation was a natural choice to cut back. By this point, people in China were well aware of the problem with coal. And from the mid-2000s the pollution problem was becoming too serious to ignore, and civil society groups began to protest. Local authorities initially resisted the government’s “war on pollution” but last year brought about some of the worst smog ever recorded in China and the strongest response yet from the central authorities.  In September 2016, China’s cancelled more than 103 under-construction and planned coal-fired power plants, a total of 120 gigawatt hours (GWh) of capacity. In March this year, premier Li Keqiang announced that an additional 50GWh would be shut down or postponed. The coal power stopped in China so far is equivalent to the combined coal power capacity of the UK and Spain. China’s era of one coal-fired station a week is over. Beijing’s long-standing opposition to international climate change obligations is well-known, at least prior to the 2015 UN conference in Paris. But things are changing. Though China’s coal capacity may yet increase slightly over the next few years, any growth will be dwarfed by planned investment in solar, wind and nuclear. China is now the world’s largest backer of green energy, accounting for 17% of global investment in the sector. According to Greenpeace, it installed an average of more than one wind turbine every hour of every day in 2015. It also covered the equivalent of one soccer field with solar panels every hour, action that may allow China to meet its 2020 goals for solar installation two years ahead of schedule. By 2030 it is hoped that cleaner energy will help reduce China’s CO₂ emissions by 54% from 2010 levels. This is good news because the inescapable fact is that efforts to mitigate climate change are doomed to fail if the Chinese do not get on board. Compared with other countries, China still has a long way to go. Britain, for instance, recently managed a day without coal for the first time in more than 130 years, while other countries have drastically cut their carbon footprint. However, energy policy is, as with most aspects of Chinese life, more complicated and more susceptible to internal and external pressures than many observers believe. The reaction of the Chinese leadership to these pressures gives us hope that the country can free itself of dirty coal, and that this day may come sooner rather than later."

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: I’ve been getting e-mails, especially from skeptic Swedes, who warn of citing people like Fransson…saying that the origins of the SD and some of the planks in its political platform are questionable, and that in doing so it is damaging the skeptic position rather than helping it. Myself I’m not familiar with Swedish politics and posted the story solely on the merits of the science. 
NTZ does not necessarily support or endorse the political positions of any persons featured here, and in all cases detests all extremist views. -PG
==============================
First there was sea level rise expert Nils-Axel Mörner, then top Swedish climatologist Lennart Bengtsson breaking ranks with the IPCC.
Now the Swedish online nyheter24 here has a commentary by Parliamentarian Josef Fransson (photo) of the Sweden Democrats (SD) party, who fires sharp criticism at IPCC climate science and the policymaking based on it.

Photo: sdpartille.wordpress.com.
First, before looking at his commentary, Wikipedia describes the Fransson’s SD party as  a “far-right populist and anti-immigration party“. But readers need to keep in mind that nowadays in Europe anyone who challenges the IPCC, or expresses the need for governments to clean house of all their entrenched political cronies gets labeled a right-wing extremist…a hater. We see this smearing kind of treatment already with the UKIP party and Germany’s AfD. So don’t put much stock in Wikipedia’s biased political characterizations.
There’s just no tolerance for dissent any more.
Science gone awry
At the online nyheter24, Janssen comments that climate science resembles more a religion, noting that even the Swedish Church now devotes more time to activities on climate alarm than Christian preaching. He writes, “The climate debate in Sweden has gone awry and is anything but scientific.”
CO2 a factor on the margins
Fransson writes: “We know a lot about the factors that have an impact on the climate, such as dust particles, cosmic rays, the Earth’s axis inclination, Earth’s distance from the Sun, on altered land use, changes in wind and ocean currents, etc., and to all this there’s also the vital greenhouse effect, which is due mainly to water vapor and water evaporation, cloud formation, and precipitation. On the margin there is carbon dioxide and methane.”

Janssen then reminds Parliamentarians that the climate is a system of great complexity, fraught with great variability and that “CO2’s role is overhyped“.
No correlation
He explains how CO2 poorly correlates with global temperature: “1910-1940 we had a rapid global temperature rise at around 0.5°C although the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were stable….Since that time greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise […] but still we have not been able to see a temperature increase for almost 18 years.”
Fransson also labels projections of 4°C warming and a sea level rise of one meter by the end of the century as outliers, calling them “very improbable scenarios“.
Fransson explained how climate has always changed in the past and that 1000 year ago the Vikings had settled and farmed on Greenland, and that during the ice ages Sweden was buried under a “several kilometers thick glacier“. And now that the planet has been enjoying a warm optimum for the past 11,500 years, he reminds that in general “we are living on borrowed time“.
Wide uncertainty
Fransson also reports that “mapping the past climate is complicated detective work and the farther back in time one goes, the coarser the assumptions become“. He reminds us that even computing today’s mean global temperature with our vast network of measurement stations is a formidable task.
Then he compares the oceans to the atmosphere, saying that the oceans’ heat capacity is “1000 times larger” than that of the entire atmosphere, and thus can have profound impacts on future projections.
At the end Fransson writes higher CO2 concentration in the atmosphere so far “has been a blessing to our world. Carbon dioxide, which are all plant food, has made the world greener and increased crop yields“.
Politicians making “farcical” promises
Frannson calls the promises made by politicians in tiny Sweden to save the climate “farcical”, reminding that the sparasely populated Nordic country represents only 1/1000 of the globe’s CO2 emissions and that every year China increases its emissions an amount that is equivalent to the total annual emissions of 12 Swedens.
At the end, Fransson says it gets down to the needs of the poor: “After China there is a long list of countries in line to go from extreme poverty to more decent conditions.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you do an Internet search of “climate liability insurance“, you will quickly find that it is one of the latest schemes being promoted by insurance companies, banking and even fossil fuel companies to curb “dangerous climate change”. Here they stand to make huge piles of cash by claiming CO2 is causing bad weather. It’s the latest proposed scam to shake down hundreds of billions from consumers and the poor.
Switzerland’s Neue Züricher Zeitung NZZ (New Zurich Newspaper) has a commentary on the “merits” of climate liability insurance.
It works as follows: The “fact” that greenhouse gas CO2 is responsible for storms and thus the property damage they cause is pushed. Fossil fuel companies (at the start of the CO2 supply chain) are held liable for the resulting “climate damage”, and so are forced to buy climate liability insurance. In such a scheme the premiums are based on how much fossil fuel production each company is responsible for. Based on complex calculations, a figure of 15 dollars per tonne of CO2 would be payable by fossil fuel producing companies, in total 400 billion dollars annually. The huge costs added would then be passed along to the consumers and the poor, who find themselves at the bottom of the fossil fuel energy chain.
So what would happen to the 400 billion dollars in premiums that would be collected annually? The NZZ writes: “National, regional and local authorities would have the right to apply for compensatory damage payments because of storm damage to infrastructure” and “A part of the premiums would be invested in projects for the prevention of climate damage; financial instruments (e.g. catastrophe bonds and Green Climate Fund) are already available.” That means green energy companies.
In the end this all has the same effect as a hefty tax on the poor and middle class. Naturally big banks and insurance companies are salivating, as are green energy companies, governments and fossil fuel companies because they stand to profit handsomely.
The NZZ writes that climate liability insurance would be easier to implement because the scheme would not require any international treaty. Moreover, fossil fuel companies would have few qualms about playing along as they would have a good excuse to jack up energy prices. The NZZ:
Climate liability insurance functions when a number of relevant companies start using it. The pressure to play along would successively build up– through appropriate laws in individual countries and foremost because more and more companies, NGOs, and consumers would demand manufactured products be made with insured fossil fuels.”
In the end consumers would be willing to pay more because of having been tricked into believing they are improving the weather.
What would consumers really get in return? They’ll never see any perceptible changes in weather – perhaps a few hundredths of a degree less warming. Many consumers of course will complain about the dubious charging. But no problem, proponents will always be able to claim that the weather would have been worse had the consumers not paid the costs of climate liability insurance. Making tonnes of money with the weather has never been easier. The only thing that is needed are masses of gullible suckers who stand ready to believe anything.

"The world’s existing climate policies will not be enough to end the upward march of record energy emissions rising beyond 2040 without a “grand coalition” of governments and investors, according to the global energy watchdog. The International Energy Agency said carbon emissions from the global energy industry reached a new record in 2018 despite progress in renewable energy in recent years. The IEA expects the growth of renewables to accelerate over the coming decades, but warned it would not be enough to put a ceiling on the energy sector’s emissions before 2040. Dr Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said there was a “deep disparity” between the aim to tackle the climate crisis by curbing carbon emissions and the existing policies which had allowed a “relentless upward march” for emissions. The IEA’s latest figures estimate that carbon emissions are on track to keep rising by 100m tonnes a year for at least another 20 years under existing policy plans. This rate would be two-thirds slower than the emissions hikes recorded in previous decades, but would fall very far short of what is needed to achieve the goals of the Paris agreement. “We will need to see great political will around the world,” Birol said. “This is why I believe that the world needs to build a grand coalition encompassing governments, investors, companies and everyone else who is genuinely committed to tackling climate change.” The IEA said it presented the modelling based on stated policies to “hold up a mirror” to global governments to show the consequences of their policies. “We think that governments’ current plans could bring us to a catastrophic implications for the climate of this planet. In order to be in line with the Paris targets there is a need for huge efforts in pushing energy efficiency, renewable energy and all other clean energy technologies,” Birol added. The record carbon emissions for 2018 are only marginally below the levels forecast by the IEA almost 10 years ago despite the quicker than expected rollout of wind and solar power.  Birol said the “disappointing” efforts towards better energy efficiency and a boom in coal use in China had scuppered the momentum of clean-energy technologies. Energy efficiency is one of the most important levers for policymakers to help reduce carbon emissions across the economy, according to the IEA’s report, yet efforts to cut energy waste have fallen to record lows even as the climate crisis has climbed the political agenda. Under the IEA’s sustainable development model, global carbon emissions from the energy sector should peak immediately and fall to 10 gigatonnes (or 10bn tonnes) by 2050. This would require emissions in advanced economies to fall at an average of 5.6% every year until 2050, and by 3.2% in developing economies."
"All life affects the environment. All organisms remove material they need, and they all release material that they do not need. During the evolution of life on Earth, the planet has been greatly modified by both non-biological factors and also by life itself.  The most dramatic event was the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and its replacement by oxygen. Driven by photosynthesis, it perpetrated for the original life forms – which evolved in strictly anaerobic conditions, with no oxygen – what could be viewed as the greatest environmental pollution event to affect Earth. The removal of carbon dioxide also decreased the levels of this greenhouse gas, which lowered the planet’s temperature.  Where did all that carbon go? One sink was into organic carbon that we now extract as gas and oil. Much of this material originated from the burial of microscopic photosynthetic organisms, the phytoplankton.  Phytoplankton form the base of the marine foodweb: they produce fatty acids, some of which, once they get transferred into fish, form an important part of the human diet. If they become buried for millions of years, the fatty acids are converted into oil. Millions of years of phytoplankton growth have produced the oil that humanity is so rapidly extracting and converting back to atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Most of this CO₂ is not in this form, however – most is phytoplankton buried as chalk, a form of limestone; think of the white cliffs of Dover. Perhaps fortunately for Earth, humans have no great need for chalk, so this reservoir of carbon dioxide remains safely locked up. But why did biology make limestone in the first place? Many organisms, including ourselves, use calcium carbonate for their skeletons. Even microscopic organisms make hard parts made of this material, and some of those structures could certainly be viewed as having a skeletal function, to protect the organism, or to hang components from. However, much of the limestone represents deposits made by phytoplankton that have no obvious need for a skeleton. So why did they go through the effort of making calcium carbonate; indeed why are they still doing it, and will climate change affect the process? Large growths of the phytoplankton that deposit calcium carbonate, called “coccolithophorids”, can be seen from space; their blooms are so large that the white chalky plates, the “coccoliths”, reflect light that is sensed by satellites. Why they make this material has baffled scientists for decades. Some have suggested that the plates help protect the organisms, which are only some five-millionth of a metre in diameter, from viruses or grazers. Others have suggested that making calcium carbonate may enhance the supply of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis by modifying seawater chemistry. Evidence for such explanations has been refuted or at is least not substantiated, however. But a new idea developed by our team lead by Swansea University provides an alternative explanation, which – even if it is not the basis for the evolution of coccolith production – must affect the ecology of these Earth-shaping organisms. During photosynthesis, phytoplankton remove carbon dioxide from the water and the acidity of the water then decreases. This decrease (an increase in pH) is basification, the opposite of acidification. Humans are causing ocean acidification through excess carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and gas dissolving in the sea and volcanoes also contribute. Neither basification nor acidification is good for phytoplankton growth, but while ocean acidification is largely human-made, basification during phytoplankton growth is perfectly natural and is something that all phytoplankton must endure. Actually, this is not true: coccolithophorids do not have to endure it, and this is why. Calcification, such as the production of coccoliths, also removes carbon dioxide, as does photosynthesis. However, the chemistry behind calcification leads in total to a decrease in pH: it causes an acidification event. During our research, we used detailed mathematical models of the growth of coccolithophorids to test the theory that basification caused by photosynthesis would be matched by acidification caused by calcification. The result of such an event would be a stable pH that promoted coccolithophorid growth. The models demonstrated that the ratio of photosynthesis to calcification seen in the real organisms, and in the way that they respond to changing environmental conditions, matched predictions from the model. Coccolithophorids do not do what most other organisms do, take what they need and throw waste out that damages their environment for the next generation. These organisms can bioengineer their environment by mopping up the waste, here, by countering basification. They make the seawater in which they live a more stable environment.  Our research also considered the implications of ocean acidification for coccolithophorids, and the result is not such good news. To balance pH in the future ocean, less calcification is needed; this means they cannot help sink so much of the carbon dioxide humans pump to the atmosphere. So, we may have found the reason why coccolithophorids help make cliffs of chalk, but also why they won’t be doing it so much in the future."
"Greta Thunberg will hitch a ride with two Australian sailing YouTubers on her low-emissions voyage from America to the UN climate change conference in Madrid. The 16-year-old Swedish climate activist had initially been stranded in the United States after the location of the conference was abruptly changed from Chile to Spain at the last minute. “It turns out I’ve travelled half around the world, the wrong way,” she said at the time. Thunberg travelled from Sweden to the US by yacht in August and has since travelled across the Americas by overland train and an electric car borrowed from Arnold Schwarzenegger. On Tuesday night, the Nobel peace prize nominee announced she had found a solution. Thunberg will set sail for Europe immediately on a 48-foot catamaran with Australian vloggers Riley Whitlum and Elayna Carausu and Englishwoman Nikki Henderson – who is a professional yachtswoman. The boat leaves little to no carbon footprint, boasting solar panels and a hydro-generators for power. It also has a toilet, unlike the boat on which she sailed from the United Kingdom to New York in August, which only had a bucket. Whitlum and Carausu are YouTubers who post a new video every week of their journey around their world with their 11-month-old son. They are YouTube’s most popular sailing vloggers, with over a million subscribers. The UN climate conference, known as COP25, was set for 2 December in Santiago, but was moved on 30 October after civil unrest hit Chile, leaving Thunberg with only four weeks notice to make it halfway across the world. Thunberg arrived in the US in August, after sailing for weeks from England. In New York she addressed the UN on the climate crisis, calling out governments for betraying young people. She had planned to travel slowly down to Chile through the Americas. Two weeks ago, she had posted to social media asking for help. “Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November ... If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful.” Whitlum and Carausu met on the Greek island of Ios, when she was working for a travel company and he was living on a sailboat. The pair has covered more than 65,000 nautical miles since 2014. Henderson is an accomplished sailor and last year became the youngest ever skipper to compete at the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race, at age 25. Her team came in second place."

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi tweeted here a chart showing Detroit not only has been struggling with a brutal, cold and snowy winter this year, but has been doing so for the last decade. Soon people won’t know what bare ground in the springtime is!

Joe also adds that 6 of the top 15 snowy winters have occurred in the last 15 years.
No wonder the title of the fairy tale has been changed from global warming (a lie) to climate change. For meteorologist Joe Bastardi, it’s clear: “People around Detroit and everywhere (most snowy winters are also colder than normal) dont believe their lies.”

"There might be a place where “raving inner city lunatics” are the only people who are concerned about climate change but it is certainly not Michael McCormack’s electorate of Riverina. Here in south-western New South Wales, the effects of climate change could not be more keenly felt, as we continue to manage for an extended fire season, as we continue to sell down stock and towns actively deal with water shortages and quality issues for drinking and irrigation. They are just the headlines to our lives. Monday’s extraordinary interview is just more evidence of the tin ear on the national political party most often associated with country Australia. And more’s the pity. Those of us who live in the country need metropolitan Australians to understand our lives more than ever. Yet this sort of rubbish about ‘woke inner city greenies’ is exactly the sort of crap that divides the nation and takes the place of the more difficult policy work to address some of our challenges. It is cheap talk that kills farmers’ social licence at a time when we need cities to understand how important the job of food growing is for their own bellies and how important food production is to the economy of regional communities. As the dairy industry bleeds under crippling water prices, we need to have a serious conversation about the diversity of our food sector and its building blocks – soil, water and energy – and how they are impacted by climate change. We need the city to understand how important the growing renewables sector is to providing new jobs to our communities, while ensuring we take our own coal workers by the hand into new opportunities. In short, this is a story that swirls around McCormack’s head like winds fanning our latest tragic bushfires. It is a national story in a country he purports to help lead and it is a local story in his own backyard. Yet he averts his gaze. While the federal Nationals cannot utter the term climate change, their West Australian counterparts can and do. This is Mia Davies, the smart young leader of the WA Nationals when the state party passed a motion acknowledging climate change is resulting in more extreme and variable weather. “I talk to younger people and I say ‘would you engage with a political party that was perceived not to believe in climate change?’,” she said. “Their answer is universally ‘no’ and so from my perspective this is about saying we are a party that wants to be part of the conversation and work on things that, yes, are difficult, but our communities expect us to be a part of that.” It brought plaudits from WA farmers, such as the influential agribusiness woman Sue Middleton, who explicitly stated on Monday via Twitter that the bushfire events could be a “Port Arthur moment” for the National party, evoking past leadership of Tim Fischer during the gun debate. Importantly, the WA Nats’ acknowledgement has meant West Australian farmers have had the political cover to organise and aim for zero net emissions by 2030 so they are part of the solution. Those goals provide an important part of the answer for any metropolitan citizens who question the role of agriculture in climate change. These conversations are being held across the country. The industry’s thinktank, the Australian Farm Institute, earlier this year addressed the issue of global warming on the already risky business of farming. The AFI followed up, launching a report commissioned by Farmers for Climate Action at Parliament House, which was used to call for a national climate strategy. So scary were the political implications that the National party didn’t turn up to that launch by their own ministerial colleague, the environment minister, Sussan Ley. Once again they poked their own constituency in the eye in favour of inexplicable political priorities. Yet the agricultural industry must build trust with city voters if they are to convince them on their capacity to manage environmental services and improve soil carbon, both important future income streams that are already happening, paid for by corporations and governments. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning That’s just a few of the national issues McCormack ignores. At the same time, the main streets of the little towns and regional centres in his own electorate are hunkering down for a long drought. McCormack must have missed the protest of 1,000 people in his own electorate during the global strike for climate. Were they raving inner city lunatics? He must have missed the protests outside his office by concerned Riverina citizens Wagga Wagga Fridays for Future, some of whom are GPs and mental health clinicians in a group numbering 500. He must have missed his very own Wagga City council declaring a climate emergency, before the local politics of it got too much and it was rescinded. In the past few months I have attended agronomy meetings, working out the tricky juggling acts of making use of moisture stressed crops and feedlotting sheep. I have attended field days where land managers are looking for new ways to ensure that the land can recover after drought in a drier climate – including government-funded courses in the rising movement for regenerative farming. Hell, this week I will attend a renewables in agriculture conference in McCormack’s hometown to hear about the transformation of energy use and income streams on farms. But then I know McCormack understands the opportunities because he handed over $1m to the small town of Lockhart in the Riverina, which is one of a number of rural towns racing to be totally renewable in the very near future. As he told The Land, the project would be “transformational”. “This will re-energise, literally, Lockhart and this is a project almost the entire town, if not the entire community has gotten behind,” he said. People are already acknowledging and adapting. So by all means, throw red meat to what you think is your base. But don’t pretend your own voters aren’t concerned about climate change because they are already thinking about local solutions.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe news of distinguished Swedish meteorology professor and former director of the renowned Max Planck Institute of Meteorology, Lennart Bengtsson, resigning from the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) advisory board just days after having joined it has spread through the blogosphere like wildfire.
Psychological torment seems to be at play.
His resignation in the face of intolerance will surely prompt harsh reactions from some elements of the mainstream media globally in the days ahead. Bengtsson cites “enormous world-wide pressure” and “enormous group pressure” that threaten his “health and safety“. His resignation further underscores a growing, closed-minded zealotry that is embedding itself within the climate science community which is resembling more and more a cult.
Warning signs of psychological aggression appeared early on. For example climate physicist and alarmist Georg Hoffmann paralleled the GWPF to the Ku Klux Klan, simply because they hold a skeptical view on global warming science rather than embracing it as a religion.
At Climate Audit Steve McIntyre writes of “more shameful conduct by the climate ‘community’“. McIntyre adds that scientists like Bengtsson are precisely the “people that the climate ‘community’ should be trying to persuade“, and not run out of town with hounds. He compares the action by the climate science community to a “fatwa“.
A number of readers at Klimazwiebel have reacted harshly as well.

The question is if part of the scientific community will support Lennart in his right to speak out (without necessarily supporting his judgment).”

I am sorry to see he is withdrawing, but such is the climate science religion. No questioning is tolerated. Not even working with people who are questioning. It really is disgusting.”
Roger Pielke Jr. writes:
The main problem here is not that people have strong views or call people names. It is that the elite in this community – including scientists, journalists, politicians — have endorsed the climate mccarthyism campaign, and are often its most vigorous participants.”
Eduardo Zorita:
Whether or not someone wishes to work on a study should be only dependent on the study itself., and not on the political views of the co-authors.”
Benny Peiser, on behalf of the GWPF:
The Foundation, while of course respecting Professor Bengtsson’s decision, notes with deep concern the disgraceful intolerance within the climate science community which has prompted his resignation.”

"Love them or hate them, ring-necked parakeets have invaded Europe and they’re here to stay. Already a staple of many urban parks and gardens around the UK, some of these charismatic bright green birds are now so comfortable in their new surroundings that they will happily sit and feed from your hand.  Parakeets are Britain’s fastest growing bird population and are on a trajectory to global domination. Outside of their native southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, breeding populations are now established in at least 65 cities around Europe, and more than 30 countries across five continents. Such non-native, or “invasive” species are one of the biggest causes of biodiversity loss in the world today, and can cause severe economic damage. Understanding these species is incredibly useful for any attempt to design environment policy and prevent further invasions. Populations of invasive ring-necked parakeets (Psittacula krameri) provide an excellent case study, owing to their patterns of rapid growth and spread. These parakeets were introduced into the UK in the late 1960s and now number well over 32,000 birds. They were originally concentrated around Greater London and nearby Kent, but these areas are now saturated which has resulted in parakeets spreading around the country, reaching as far north as Inverness in Scotland. Many popular stories exist to explain how these exotic parakeets came to live in the UK, including their escape from the film set of the African Queen, and my personal favourite: their deliberate release by Jimi Hendrix to inject some psychedelic colour into the streets of London. More likely it is a result of the popularity of keeping ring-necked parakeets as pets. The global transportation of wild ring-necked parakeets in addition to in-country breeding, has led to their successful establishment outside their native range. Between 1984 and 2007 a staggering 146,539 ring-necked parakeets were imported to Europe, before an EU ban on the trade of wild birds. The UK alone imported more than 16,000. We know how they got to Europe’s cities, but what makes ring-necked parakeets so good at adapting to new environments? The climate is likely to play a strong role in their ability to survive outside of their native range. Despite their incredibly large native range, spanning two continents, the parakeets found across Britain and Europe originate predominately from across the colder foothills of the Himalayas, largely in Pakistan. The distinct lack of parakeets from warmer areas in Africa suggests similarities in temperature and rainfall between the native and invasive ranges made life easy for them. It seems the parakeets were already well adapted to survive in northern Europe. Interestingly, back in the late 1800s wild ring-necked parakeets were observed in the UK, but they failed to survive. So what’s different now? Perhaps warmer winters due to climate change, in combination with our love of feeding birds thus giving them a year-round supply of energy, have provided ideal conditions for parakeets to thrive around the country. Let’s also not overlook the lack of natural predators outside their native range. Unsurprisingly, Asian black eagles aren’t a concern in London’s parks. However, it seems Britain’s urban peregrines and sparrow hawks have now started to notice the exotic new meat on the menu. Yet despite native falcons’ success at preying on wild parakeets, they’re unlikely to make a dent on the growing numbers of invasive parakeets. Despite parakeets being well established in the UK, we still don’t fully understand their potential impact, good or bad. Do they affect native wildlife by competing for nest holes and food? Preliminary reports show some level of competition for nest sites with European native nuthatches, and that they displace garden birds from bird feeders. Back in Asia and Africa ring-necked parakeets are severe crop pests, but we don’t yet know if they’ll damage British fruit crops and cause economic damage. Many scientists are also curious about the impact they are having on people. Does living near large roosts cause noise pollution? Does seeing exotic parakeets in parks and gardens around the UK improve human wellbeing? These are just some of the questions we’re aiming to answer through ParrotNet, a pan-European group of researchers dedicated to understanding the challenge of invasive parrots (ring-necked parakeets are just one of 13 species of parrot established across Europe). Despite their abundance, surprisingly, many British people remain unaware that wild parakeets are living among them. As these vibrant birds are now spreading around the country, in time they will become commonplace in all the UK’s urban areas. While we may still regard these colourful and exotic parakeets as something of an exciting novelty, I suspect our children and their children may simply consider them no more exciting than a common pigeon."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs climate observations continue their now obscene divergence from the earlier IPCC model projections, some media outlets are becoming harsher in their criticism of a science that increasingly appears corrupt and politicized. Moreover climate scientists are looking ever more shrill and desperate.
Hat-tip: hajo.
A recent feature story by Markus Schär in the print edition of Swiss news weekly Weltwoche even goes so far as to call IPCC lead author Thomas Stocker a “butler for politicians”. Weltwoche’s introduction reads:
Climate scientists, foremost some from Switzerland, are issuing increasingly louder warnings of catastrophe. This is because next year the global community should obligate itself to a strict treaty on protecting the climate. Despite the alarm, hardly anyone desires to keep playing along.”
Weltwoche adds later in the article that the way things stand now, the chances that of a new binding treaty getting ratified “are close to zero“.
As a result global warming alarmists are mounting another scramble to salvage a hypothesis that is increasingly looking unsustainable.
With the next large climate conference in Lima, Peru in December, more than ever scientists are coming under pressure to explain why warming has stopped and the models have been so embarrassingly wrong so far. The steam (science) that is supposed to be powering climate policy forward has blown a major gasket. Ironically science is beginning to act as a brake.
Weltwoche writes that the final (up-to-now confidential) Synthesis Report scheduled for release in October is designed to salvage the movement and supply the necessary urgency to get the binding climate treaty process to replace the expired Kyoto Protocol back on track. Here Weltwoche writes: “Dramatic proclamationS are in demand in order to wake up the global public.” It adds:

The authors of the Synthesis Report, among them as always are environmental activists, have to threaten with an apocalypse.”
Clearly among those involved in the effort, Weltwoche writes, are Swiss scientists Thomas Stocker of the University of Bern and Reto Knutti of the ETH Institute, a leading climate modeling center.
As part of the effort to rescue the alarmism, Weltwoche describes how Reto Knutti, once a student of Stocker, was the lead author of a recent paper that systematically analyzed the reasons behind the global warming pause. The paper concluded that it was due to ocean cycles and solar activity, and that these factors merely needed to be adjusted in the models, and so there was “no reason to doubt the newest climate models“.
But Weltwoche writes Knutti’s paper got “more ridicule than praise worldwide“. Weltwoche quotes the Science & Environmental Policy Project (SEPP):
“Unwittingly the study only proves once again that the IPCC got it all wrong with its claims of 95% certainty.”
Weltwoche then informs how there have been a number of recent papers showing that the sun is a major driver in climate change, citing papers by Joos, Beer, and even Stocker himself. The Swiss weekly also sharply criticizes the “method” used by climate scientists who rather than applying the scientitfic method, stubbornly insist their theory can’t be wrong:
The climate scientists, on the other hand, have been working a quarter century using all means to prove their theory. When they fail to do so, they instantly conjure up – like Reto Knutti – a new hypothesis.”

"Conservation is becoming more militarised, and it is cause for serious concern. Rising rates of elephant and rhino poaching in Africa, and fears of a link between poachers and terrorists, have led to foreign national armies, private military companies and even UN peacekeeping forces all moving into wildlife protection. Not everyone is happy to see them: the Game Rangers Association of Africa recently issued a statement raising concerns about the growth of military personnel from beyond Africa involved in ranger training and anti-poaching operations across the continent.  The private contractors, current serving soldiers, and groups of army veterans currently working across Africa are all very different kinds of “conservation armies”. But the common thread is that they are contributing to the development of a more forceful and militarised phase of wildlife protection. Often, terrorism is used to justify a military presence in national parks and game reserves. But, though linking ivory with terrorism makes for attention grabbing headlines, there is no credible evidence to support such claims. British newspaper, The Daily Mirror, recently ran a story about British troops training rangers in Gabon, and claimed it was part of a strategy to fight international terrorism. Readers were told that ivory poaching in Gabon is linked to Boko Haram. The story was repeated by The Independent a few days later, citing the Mirror as the source. However, Boko Haram are not reliant on the ivory trade for their funds, and they are not operational in Gabon either.  It can be difficult to criticise foreign troops for engaging in what appears to be two good causes. Who would seriously be against either saving elephants or fighting Boko Haram? And if the same operation can do both at once, even better. But this image of a benevolent “eco-military” distracts from asking other important questions like what drives poaching in the first place, what role poverty plays, why Gabon is poor despite significant oil reserves, and whether or not the new military presence has been welcomed by locals. The claims about Gabon, ivory and Boko Haram are reminiscent of headlines and slogans back in 2013-14 about ivory being the white gold of jihad, centring on claims that East African Islamist militant group Al Shabaab was funded by ivory. This has been thoroughly criticised and debunked. Al Shabaab’s main sources of income remain the regional charcoal trade, informal taxation at roadblocks and ports, and donations from overseas supporters. But the story had traction – it suited everyone from conservation NGOs who wanted more funds, to governments concerned about terrorism, and private security services who saw a chance to expand their operations.  Several of the new conservation armies operating in Africa have other aims, which are much closer to home. The US-based Veterans Empowered to Protect African Wildlife (VETPAW) is a good example. The organisation aims to reduce unemployment rates among post-9/11 war veterans by using their skills to train rangers and take on the poachers directly.  VETPAW initially provided anti-poaching services in Tanzania. However, in 2015 the government ordered them to leave after comments from one member, US army veteran Kinessa Johnson, about “killing bad guys” went viral and attracted negative publicity. The organisation is currently contracted to run anti-poaching operations in private reserves in South Africa, where it claims the activity helps veterans find peace and cope with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). But these examples only tell one side of the story. We need to think about what kind of conservation this drives on the ground, and how it looks to communities living near the increasingly militarised conservation sites. Survival International and Rainforest Foundation UK have led campaigns against the abuses of forest-dependent communities in Central Africa and the Congo Basin as a result of more militarised conservation.  In one well-documented case, Baka people in Cameroon were allegedly abused by eco-guards who had been trained by a private company and funded by the WWF. Though such stories document the use of violence against some of the most marginalised peoples in the world, they don’t grab headlines as easily as a friendly “eco-army”. At best British troops will only ever provide a short-term fix to Gabon’s poaching problem, and the same goes for private militaries and security services across the continent. They are not capable of (or concerned with) addressing the complex and poorly understood reasons why poaching persists. These include poverty, a desire for status, and coercion of vulnerable communities by organised wildlife traffickers. Poaching is also a longer-term consequence of decisions by colonial regimes to create protected areas for sport hunting and safaris, while banning locals from subsistence hunting. And of course it is driven by increasing demand from wealthier countries for exotic wildlife products. In the longer-term, “conservation armies” can’t fix any of the above. At worst, they will be counter productive and alienate the very communities needed to make conservation work."
"This week was a pretty big one for climate change, the drought and the ALP, and they were all somewhat intertwined. On Wednesday an article published in the journal BioScience, co-signed by 11,000 scientists, warned “clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency”. The authors noted that, despite 40 years of solid scientific research pointing to the dangers of climate change, “greenhouse gas emissions are still rapidly rising, with increasingly damaging effects on the Earth’s climate”, and that “an immense increase of scale in endeavours to conserve our biosphere is needed to avoid untold suffering due to the climate crisis.” This of course is pretty horrific news but at least there was some good news here in Australia, because the next day, for the first time ever, the national energy market produced more than half of its electricity via renewable sources. Of course no one in the government thought it worthy of celebrating or even mentioning – mostly because it happened in spite of the government’s policies, not because of them. And it is possible to come up with effective national, bipartisan policy on climate change. We saw it this week when on Thursday  New Zealand passed legislation committing the nation to achieving zero net carbon emission by 2050. That same day our Department of Agriculture released a report into droughts by the coordinator-general for drought, Major General Stephen Day. It was pretty upfront about what is happening. The fourth paragraph of the forward stated: “As a consequence of climate change, drought is likely to be longer and more severe in some regions and over broader areas. It means that farmers and communities in some regions are likely to see drought more often”. And just in case you needed it underlined, it continued: “ultimately, the nation could see some areas of Australia become more marginal and/or unproductive”. That very same day (it really was a busy Thursday) the prime minister and the leader of the Nationals released the government’s drought package. At no stage during the press conference was climate change raised once. That was despite Day’s report finding “climate change, and the increased frequency and severity of drought in some regions, is considered the most serious threat to land management”. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning And just to top it all off, also released that same day was the ALP’s review into its election loss, in which the politics of climate-change policy was given a very strong focus. This in effect is politics in Australia – the LNP is at best expected to pretend to look like it cares, while receiving barely any heat for doing nothing, while the ALP is expected to actually come up with a real policy and at the same time receive all the heat for attempting to do something. Last week Katharine Murphy and Adam Morton revealed the government had quietly appointed an expert panel to come up with a climate change policy that will lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It would be nice to have some hope that this might actually lead to a policy that does something substantial, but watching LNP climate change policy over the past 30 years forces one to assume the result will be a policy that looks like the government is doing something while in reality it is just another lie that somehow greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced without any economic pain to anyone. Meanwhile the ALP report noted that the Coalition sought to “assert Labor’s climate change policy was not costed”. And that “Labor’s inability to respond effectively played into the Coalition’s characterisation of Labor as a risk”. This is true to an extent. The assertion that it was not costed was false, but the reality was the media in large parts fell for the Liberal party line. And the reason they fell for it was an underlying assumption that we could (nay, should!) somehow compare the costs of a 45% cut in emissions as recommended by scientists with the cost of a 24% cut in emissions which once carryover credits were included was really closer to a 15% cut. It meant that the ALP needed (and as the report noted, largely failed) to “effectively discuss the cost of not acting on climate change.” This is hard enough to do alone, it is nigh on impossible when few in the media are bothering to challenge the LNP with those costs as well. Instead we remain trapped in a cycle where we find yet another drought assistance package presented all the while the government’s own documents state climate change will cause more of them. And it means we’re trapped in a cycle where effectively promising to keep doing the short-term response indefinitely is viewed as a long-term policy. Murphy was right to note that the crucial element of the ALP’s review is squaring the often countervailing forces of traditional blue-collar workers and wealthier inner-city-dwelling progressives. The answer is not to put up the white flag on climate change, and the report makes that clear, noting: “a modern Labor party cannot deny or neglect human-induced climate change. To do so would be wrong, it would cause enormous internal instability and it would be a massive electoral liability”. It also notes the need to focus on the employment and economic positives of the change. This is absolutely a must. The transition to zero emissions will be tough – if it wasn’t we would already have done it. But it needs to be enticing, exciting and desired. The US Democratic party has its Green New Deal, and the UK Labour under Corbyn has very much linked the switch to renewables with jobs. It really is a no-brainer for Australia to be a world leader in renewable production and technology. Anthony Albanese has rightly set off on this path – his speech in Perth a week ago made this a key issue. But it will need more than just a few speeches. It is going to need a policy and a campaign that inspires people, because that is what great progressive policy does. And as with other progressive policies such as Medicare it also shames the conservatives into supporting it. This will be tough because, as we have long seen, the conservatives in this country have no shame when it comes to ignoring climate change. But it needs to be done. • Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia"
"Callum Roberts is professor of marine conservation at York University and was chief scientific adviser on Blue Planet 2. His new book, Reef Life, details a life spent in the oceans studying the marine ecosystem. How was your first dive?It was in the north of Scotland, where I grew up. I dived out of Scrabster harbour near Thurso and I had no idea then just how bruised and trashed and scraped the whole sea had become, and how much life had been removed from it over the centuries. I was in a wetsuit that I’d glued together at home. A wetsuit should hug every curve, but this one didn’t. It was bloody cold.  Did you always want to study coral reefs?From early childhood I wanted to be an explorer and I held on to that desire for a long time. I realised, though, that at some point I had to earn a living. There were patches of the world that were still relatively unexplored, particularly the underwater environment. So I trained in biology and that enabled me to fulfil my childhood dream. You write that heaven is a dive on a coral reef. Why is that?The sheer exuberance of colour and form on a coral reef is unparalleled. It’s like an impressionist canvas where all the brush strokes have come to life. The corals themselves form a 3D architectural complexity with palaces and gardens. There’s the play of light on the seabed, the way the waves dapple the light across the animals. It’s invigorating in a way that’s hard to describe. Any hairy moments?My most dangerous dives have been when I’ve let my guard down and followed the wildlife into the danger zone. You can get into trouble much more easily on a coral reef than on a mountainside. From 40 metres to 60 metres you get nitrogen narcosis and from 80 metres and deeper you get oxygen poisoning. That’s what really kills people. On one dive, I foolhardily went down to 60 metres. I had lost the fear of it. I didn’t sense the danger. There can be very strong downcurrents that can suck you down 15 or 20 metres before you are able to inflate your jacket and counteract the pull. What about sharks?I grew up on a diet of Cousteau and others who milked sharks for all the terror they could. They wanted to show how daring they were. It coloured my view early on, but over the years I realised the sharks are not bothered by me. Sharks do bite people, they do kill people, but not very many, and it seems to be more error than intention. A student of mine was recently diving in the Maldives where here is an incredible abundance of tiger sharks there. She saw 23 on the same dive. The tiger sharks came up to them, and some of the divers were bumped, but other than that the sharks ignored them. I’m not bothered about sharks at all any more, there’s only excitement and the feeling of privilege at being with these creatures. How does climate change harm corals?What’s killing corals at the moment is mass bleaching. Corals have a 100m-year-old relationship with a microscopic alga that lives in their tissues. These seaweeds produce most of the coral’s food: it’s what makes them the reef builders they are. But when the water warms up, the relationship goes bad and the corals have to expel the seaweeds or they will die. The problem is that a bleached coral is a starving coral, so if the temperature stays high for a while, the coral starves to death. 5.4 metres: highest likely sea level rise by 2300, if global carbon emissions are not cut. 653bn tonnes: average ice melted in Greenland, Antarctica and mountain glaciers every year from 2006-2016, equivalent to 500 Olympic swimming pools every minute. 100-1,000 times: the increase in coastal flood damages expected in 2100 unless major adaptation efforts are made. 1.8 billion people: the number likely to be directly affected by sea level rise on low-lying coasts and melting glaciers in high mountain regions in 2050. 1,500bn tonnes: the carbon stored in permafrost, almost double all the carbon in the atmosphere. 7,000: the number of scientific articles considered by the 104 expert authors from 36 countries. Is bleaching the only impact of climate change?Acidification is also happening. Eventually, ocean acidity will reach levels that etch away exposed coral skeletons. They won’t be able to build strong skeletons, or won’t be able to calcify at all. How far and fast this will happen is one of the big unknowns. By 2100, it could cause massive disruption, not only to coral reefs, but to all sorts of creatures that make calcium carbonate shells: molluscs, crustaceans, plankton-like coccolithophores and foraminifera. These are prolific, widespread, economically important and ecologically crucial. What damage have you witnessed?In the Maldives, the mass coral bleaching and death in 2015/16 was brutal. With El Niňo, you see a wave of bleaching temperatures moving from east to west. You can see it coming and there is nothing you can do about it. It’s like a slow‑motion hurricane and you think oh my God, disaster is going to strike. When it hit the Maldives in 2016, it took out about two-thirds of the coral. On one beautiful reef where I dive, 99% of the coral died. That was so shocking, that it could be turned from this extraordinary vitality to something that looked like a concrete replica of a reef in a bad public aquarium in the space of a couple of months. We are now watching the reefs recover, but the problem for coral reefs is that the spaces between impacts are getting shorter and the extent and severity seems to be getting bigger. You say the Gulf states are locked in a “gigantic pissing contest” over coastal development…It’s horrible in the Gulf and has been for a long time. I fear there is no way of stopping it; there is too much money sloshing around. Every new development seems to want to thrust out further into the sea, but the nearest bit of shallow water habitat is the richest and it gets covered over. Along the Red Sea coast they have carved up the reef into marinas and filled it over to create new land. It’s a shocking and needless destruction of an immensely important asset, and nobody cares. The Great Barrier Reef is in bad shape too. What happened?The Australian government has walked away from its responsibility in tackling climate change. They are in thrall to the miners, particularly the coal miners. The government is in the pocket of industry, but so is the population. Many Australians have benefited from the mining industry. They’ve bought second homes on the coast and expensive boats, they can afford to take holidays overseas. It’s hard to rein that in. As people said in the election this year, climate change was on the ballot paper and climate change lost.  Some scientists experience “ecological grief” in their work. Have you?You feel it in your guts. It’s a visceral blow to your sense of where the world is going. You hope for the best, but when you see the worst happening it’s not easy. I’m a hardened optimist, but even cast-iron optimists cannot be optimistic about the future of corals. What keeps the despair at bay is seeing students going out into great positions, actively contributing to protecting the world and making it a better place. Have Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion made a difference?She is motivating a huge number of people across the world to come together and tell their leaders that they need to act. We are seeing a willingness to take action on things like greenhouse gases that wasn’t there before and an urgency about it that is being thrust upon reluctant leaders. You can protest all you like without inconveniencing people and nothing happens, but when you start inconveniencing people the politicians wake up. What can we do for the reefs?There is no real possibility across much of the world of being able to maintain, restore, or recover the reefs to the condition they were in at the start of my career. But it is always worthwhile to protect them. A reef that has no living coral can still sustain a huge variety of other life. Climate change is the big unmanaged stress at the moment. To give reefs the best chance of survival, we need to alleviate all the stresses we can. We need to protect them from fishing, dredging and pollution, in particular nutrient and sediment pollution. And we need to prepare for the worst. That means thinking about global refuges where coral reefs may be able to re-establish themselves if the worst of the predictions come true. Ultimately, the only thing that will save coral reefs is greenhouse gas reductions. • Reef Life: An Underwater Memoir is published by Profile Books (£16.99).

"‘What is it about those melting glaciers and desperate polar bears that makes us want to look away?” the activist and author Naomi Klein asked in 2015. In her book This Changes Everything, she laid the blame on powerful global corporations and acquiescent governments, which both simultaneously underplay the scale of the climate emergency and exploit our collective sense of helplessness in the face of it. Since then, a new urgency has driven climate activism, most successfully in the disruptive protests of Extinction Rebellion. Can art, though, have a meaningful role in raising awareness of that urgency? A forthcoming exhibition, Meltdown: Visualising Climate Change, at the Horniman Museum in London sets out to answer that question in the affirmative. It focuses on the fate of the world’s glaciers through the prism of art, photography and film. “We are using art as a kind of seduction to draw people in, then shock them,” says photographer Simon Norfolk, one of the artists involved. Why glaciers, though? Norfolk points out that, while severe floods and forest fires are in some ways more dramatically visual, “they can leave you open to the charge of not being scientific”. Glaciers, on the other hand, are one of the key and irrefutable indicators of climate change. “Through photography and film, you can record over time the ways in which they are receding, and by how much,” he says. “Plus, they are just so visual.” The Lewis Glacier, Mt Kenya, 1963 (A), 2014. The image traces a line where the glacier’s front was in 1963 while showing where it is now. Using scientific maps and GPS, Norfolk marked out the older line using hidden flashlights. ‘I walked along the line dragging my burning stick, joining up the dots of the flashlights. It took about 20 minutes, which was hard work at altitude. The exposure for the mountain and the stars continues for the rest of the hour. I wanted it to be all in camera because climate change is surrounded by loons who will claim I faked it all.’ By way of illustration, his arresting image The Lewis Glacier, Mt Kenya, 1963 shows a line of fire snaking along the rocky slope of a once completely snow-covered mountain skirting close to some scattered wooden buildings. It is one of a series of photographs he made using long, slow exposures on a mounted camera to track him as he ran along a meandering line on the mountain holding a flaming torch. (You can see him collapse with altitude exhaustion in a short film documenting the making of the work shot by the Observer photographer Antonio Olmos.)  “I use old maps to trace the exact line where the front edge of the glacier existed in previous years,” he explains. “My starting point was 1963, the year I was born, and I have made similar images for selected years ever since. It is a way of photographing the absence of something, in this instance a few kilometres of ice that have disappeared in the intervening years.” The series won Norfolk a Sony World Photography award in 2015. Ice Cave, Vatnajökull, 2014. Richard Mosse used a large-format plate-film camera and infrared film to photograph the ice cave under the Vatnajökull glacier in Iceland. Glacier caves usually form when air enters where water flows underneath the ice, the warm air slowly creates melting and forms a cave from beneath. The dynamic process is becoming more unpredictable as the weather changes and cave access may become impossible in the future. Meltdown is curated by Project Pressure, an activist charity that, since 2008, has commissioned artists to work with climate scientists on often ambitious projects that highlight the earth’s increasingly unstable environment. Their partners and sponsors include Nasa, WGMS (World Glacier Monitoring Service), Hasselblad and the UN Climate Action Summit. “When we began in 2008, climate change was not high on the activist agenda in the way that it is now, but we understood the urgency,” says the founder of the project, Danish photographer Klaus Thymann. “For centuries, landscape has been one of the classic themes of great art, so it makes sense to use art as another means to make people aware of the climate emergency and hopefully help instigate institutional and behavioural changes.” From a purely artistic perspective, what is most interesting about the Meltdown exhibition is that, though it includes the work of a few documentary photographers, it is a reflection of the broad range of conceptual strategies being adopted by contemporary activist artists: from Richard Mosse, winner of last year’s prestigious Prix Pictet, to Noémie Goudal, a French artist whose photographic installations, a hybrid of the real and the created, are made in often elemental landscapes. Glacier 1, 2016, by Noemie Goudal. French conceptual artist Goudal is interested in the meeting of the organic and the manmade. This work was made on the Rhône glacier, where Goudal constructed a large-scale photographic installation printed on biodegradable paper that disintegrates in water. ‘All my work is about the fragility of the landscape,’ she says. For Meltdown, Mosse used a large-format plate camera to photograph an eerily beautiful ice cave underneath the Vatnajökull glacier in Iceland. It was formed by air entering beneath the ice cap, and, in Mosse’s blue-tinged prints, resembles a sci-fi landscape, all smooth curves and jagged icicles, made all the more unreal by his use of infrared film. Goudal specalises in elaborate interventions with the landscape. For this commission, she photographed the Rhône glacier in the Swiss Alps, before printing the results on large sheets of biodegradable paper. She then mounted the prints, which are 3.5 metres tall, on to plastic canvas using “a children’s glue that disintegrates on contact with water”. The prints were then suspended in front of the landscape she had photographed and, throughout a single day, she shot around a hundred frames of the disintegrating image. “I am primarily interested in the choreography of the landscape and how it moves and changes continually,” she says. “I want to alter our perception of it through images that show the organic and the artificial blending and clashing. In this instance, I kept on shooting until the scene reverted to the original landscape.” Mt Baker, 2014, by Peter Funch. Danish artist Funch uses old tourist postcards and historic photos as source material for his series Imperfect Atlas. In this case the images are re-creations of vintage postcards of Mount Baker [in Washington state, US] found on eBay ‘I located the positions from which the original postcard images had been made,’ he says, ‘and re-shot the glaciers from those positions to create comparative juxtapositions of then and now.’ I had assumed that Goudal’s disintegrating prints were a visual metaphor for the effects of global warming on the glacier, but she insists that her art “does not really fit into a discourse about environmental issues” and is more about the ways in which artists and scientists “observe and interpret” the environment. “Geology and astronomy are important elements in my work,” she says, “but, apart from this commission, there is really no big eco-subtext in the rest of my work.” Other artists have turned to the past to make sense of our present ecological dilemmas. Peter Funch uses vintage tourist postcards and historic images of Mount Rainier and Mount Baker in the North Cascades in Washington as raw material for his series Imperfect Atlas. Using maps and satellite images, he pinpointed the exact spot from which the original pictures were taken so that he could photograph today’s mountain glaciers from the same position. Funch also employed an old-fashioned technical process called RGB tricolour separation, in which red, green, and blue filters are used to create three separate monochrome images, which are then combined to make a single full-colour image. The process was invented in 1850, a decade after the first recorded evidence that the mountain glaciers were receding. As his work makes clear, even the earliest 19th-century photographs of glaciers were visual documents of their slow decline. Bone from 4000 BC, Switzerland, 2017: Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin make photographic still lifes of the often perfectly preserved objects revealed by shrinking glaciers, such as this human bone which remained intact in the ice for thousands of years. “In the exhibition, we use glaciers as a symbol,” says Thymann. “But some of the work is about what makes a surprising story. The artists Broomberg and Chanarin photographed objects that were found inside the ice of melting glaciers. Simon and myself collaborated on Shroud, which uses photographs and film to portray the attempt to slow down the melting of the Rhône glacier by wrapping a vast section of it in a thermal blanket.” These images are desperate and deathly, like a Christo installation gone wrong. It turns out that the owners of a popular tourist attraction, an ice grotto, have spent 70,000 euros to try and preserve their site. These kinds of measures are symptomatic of what Thymann calls a kind of belated “adaptation anxiety” – “What are we going to do? How can we adapt to this?” Shroud, 2018, by Simon Norfolk and Klaus Thyman: in an attempt to arrest the melting of the ice at an ice-grotto tourist attraction at the Rhône Glacier, local Swiss entrepreneurs paid for it to be covered up with a thermal blanket. ‘We chose the title,’ says Norfolk, ‘because it looks like they have created a shroud for the glacier’s death.’ That, of course, is a crucial question at the heart of the exhibition – and our global climate emergency. As Norfolk points out: “It is the poorest, who caused the least amount of damage to the environment, that will suffer the most. The rich will build higher flood walls around the financial district in Manhattan, but what will happen to people in Bangladesh?” The point of Project Pressure is to create change though art. “This is not a time for helplessness or looking away,” says Thymann. “The mission is to use art to help accelerate change.” Norfolk nods his head in agreement. “It’s not about making another fancy photobook or beautiful exhibition, it’s about making trouble, starting arguments.” • Meltdown: Visualizing Climate Change is at the Horniman Museum, London, from 23 November to 12 January 2020"
"Cinemas around the world are now showing Finding Dory, the long awaited sequel to Disney and Pixar’s 2003 Finding Nemo. The film takes up the story of Dory, a much loved character from the first film, who embarks on a quest to be reunited with her family. We follow the animated blue tang as she leaps and flip flops from one watery environment to the next, apparently happy to be transported in a beaker of drinking water, a mop bucket or through connecting pipes in a public aquarium.  Along the way, Dory – who suffers from short term memory loss – manages to regain some of the lost memories of her past life with assistance from Nemo, his father Marlin and an octopus named Hank. In the run-up to the film’s opening in America, Finding Dory attracted media attention when questions were raised by conservationists, marine biologists and animal advocates about the potential for the film to trigger a craze for blue tang fish. The majority of marine aquarium species are still taken from the wild and, in the case of blue tang, the process of capture is harmful to both the fish and to coral reefs.  Finding Nemo led to a rapid growth in the trade of clownfish as pets which, in turn, contributed to the decline of wild populations. Reports suggested that the pet industry was expecting a similar growth in sales of blue tang and pet products following the release of Finding Dory. One response to concerns about the impacts of wild capture has been to initiate research into captive breeding programmes. For example, until very recently it was not thought possible to breed blue tang in captivity. But in late July 2016, an announcement from Rising Tide Conservation and University of Florida revealed that for the first time, blue tang had been successfully reared in captivity for 52 days. The press release noted that the six-year project to find an alternative to taking fish from the wild had backing from the SeaWorld-Busch Gardens Conservation Fund. Many will recall that SeaWorld’s profits and public image were irreparably damaged by the 2013 documentary film Blackfish; a story about an orca named Tilikum. SeaWorld’s investment in the Rising Tide initiative and involvement in the captive breeding of blue tang may be playing a role in the company’s efforts to rebrand itself as a conservation organisation rather than an entertainment corporation and theme park.  In this respect it is some years behind Disney, the company responsible for Finding Dory, under its subsidiary brand Pixar. Disney’s moves to reorient the brand’s green credentials involved the creation of DisneyNature in 2008, a semi-autonomous film unit dedicated to producing nature documentaries, which are usually slated for release on Earth Day, and a revised corporate sustainability strategy.  Disney’s efforts have been branded by some in the press as greenwashing. My own analysis of the release strategy of DisneyNature films is in accordance with this: the tensions between the company’s commitment to what it calls “environmentality”, its green rebranding and its drive for profits are untenable. For example, under pressure to address concerns about the impact of Finding Dory on blue tang, Disney Pixar released a downloadable guide to pet fish ownership. The guide is, however, difficult to find and the message that blue tang are not suited to life as a pet is completely overshadowed by the Disney marketing for the film and associated merchandise. Indeed, the messages reaching the public about blue tang are worrying. Media coverage of the breakthrough in raising this fish in captivity, even referring to them as “baby Dory”, celebrates the technological solution that will allow consumers to purchase a sustainable Dory. Consumer fears that they are contributing to destruction of blue tang populations and coral reef areas are appeased by the message that it’s business as usual in the pet trade when entertainment, science and commerce work together.  The fact that many blue tang had to die in the process of developing a captive bred fish, that blue tang are still unsuitable as pets, that once in captivity and even under good conditions their lifespans are shortened, and that far from being the cute memory-challenged character we see onscreen, blue tang have spines on their tails designed to inflict injuries on would-be attackers – all this is lost in the celebratory communication that sustainable Dorys are on their way. While we have yet to see if Finding Dory will have an impact on the trade in blue tang, the question over what degree of responsibility media companies should take for their representations of animals and their involvement in the promotion of animals as entertainment and pets remains. It has been surprisingly easy for media companies to continue to hide behind a thin veneer of greenwashing."
"When Market Forces, a small climate activist group, was singled out as the target of the government’s push to stop environmental campaigns that advocate boycotts of fossil-fuel companies, its leader was briefly taken aback but not disappointed. “You know you’re doing something right when the Morrison government tries to bring you down,” Julien Vincent, the group’s executive director and founder, says from its base in Melbourne. “It’s unpleasant, but it’s only happening because we are getting results.” From Vincent’s perspective, those results include the Commonwealth Bank and insurers QBE, Suncorp and IAG pledging they would soon no longer work with or underwrite developments that use thermal coal, and the group’s part in the campaign that frustrated attempts by Indian company Adani to find investors for its proposed Carmichael coalmine. In terms of winning the government’s attention, it is likely the results also included a recent profile in the Australian Financial Review, the newspaper of the business community. Under the headline “How activists pushed CBA out of coal in five years”, it talked up Market Forces’s successes and methods, including a deal-making meeting with the bank’s chairwoman, Catherine Livingstone. Coincidentally or not, the attorney general, Christian Porter, last week nominated Market Forces as a poster child “radical activist group” trying to impose its will on companies through coordinated harassment and threats of boycotts. Porter said it was “simply not OK” that mining and resources businesses were being targeted on ideological grounds by activists that wished them financial harm. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It followed Scott Morrison telling the Queensland Resources Council that activists who campaigned for secondary boycotts against miners and small businesses that work with resources companies potentially posed a “more insidious threat” to jobs and the economy than street protests. How the government plans to deal with this remains unclear. Porter suggested the response would be urgent and broad, possibly including regulatory action aimed at investors who fund class actions. But in an interview with the ABC on Sunday, Matthew Canavan, the resources minister, suggested any change would be narrow, restricted to adjusting an existing competition law that outlaws secondary boycotts but exempts activities related to environmental and consumer protection. Canavan said there was a case for an environmental exemption, the question was whether it should be better defined. “All we are saying is ‘what are the appropriate exemptions to that law?’,” he said. Taking some of the power ... away from companies, governments and institutions and putting it back in the hands of individuals ... is tackling the inequity at the heart of the system. With the details in the wind, Morrison’s push has led to some confusion among Coalition MPs about what is proposed and how it will avoid impinging on freedom of expression, though none spoke publicly. The Business Council of Australia has backed the prime minister; legal academics have warned changes to reduce the influence of environmental campaigns could breach the constitution. Environmental and civil liberty groups noted the apparent hypocrisy in the government floating a secondary boycott ban given Canavan had urged his constituents to stop doing business with Westpac after it ruled out financing the Adani mine. On Sunday, Canavan said there was no hypocrisy – that the government was focused on actions targeting businesses in regional centres such as Mackay that supplied goods and services to mines. He said it was not interested in stopping campaigns against banks, which has been where Market Forces has done much of its work. As the Guardian revealed, global funds management giant Aberdeen Standard Investments, which controls assets worth more than £550bn, is among those that does not see a problem that needs addressing. It backed the role that groups such as Market Forces play. Bank bosses told a parliamentary inquiry they did not feel bullied by environment groups. In the case of the Commonwealth Bank, it believed engaging with activists had been to the institution’s benefit, helping to shape its thinking on environmental and social issues. All are considering the risk the climate crisis poses to financial security. While the Morrison government says little about climate risk, the country’s major financial institutions, including the Reserve Bank, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, have identified it as a clear and present threat. Market Forces sees itself in the same corner as those heavyweight bodies. Initially a one-man operation, it formed in 2013 as an offshoot of environment group Friends of the Earth. Having worked on a campaign at Greenpeace that helped stop the financing of a small brown coal plant in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, Vincent saw potential in giving customers of banks, superannuation funds and other financial service providers information about how their money was being used. His message was not unique, but proved well-targeted: speak up about your concerns and, if you are not satisfied, take your money elsewhere. Adopting a mantra usually associated with groups from the right as a name was half-joke, half-serious point. As Vincent sees it, the role his organisation plays is a clearer expression of the free market at work than a government considering intervening to keep coal plants open longer. “The whole point of using the term Market Forces is recasting it and to say to people ‘you be the market force’,” the 38-year-old says. The group now employs 18 people, mostly at its Elizabeth Street headquarters in the Melbourne CBD but also in Sydney, Brisbane and, more recently, south-east Asia, where it sees a chance to build a foothold in markets still investing in coal-fired power. Friends of the Earth sits at the anti-capitalist end of the organised environment movement, but Vincent says Market Forces does not aim “to bring down capitalism or anything like that”. He says it is trying to combat what he believes are destructive and corrosive elements of capitalism. “I think taking some of the power and decision-making and influence away from companies, governments and institutions and putting it back in the hands of individuals whose capital is the reason banks can invest in the first place is tackling the inequity at the heart of the system,” he says. He claims it is having an impact. Nearly 90,000 people have this year visited a Market Forces webpage that compares different banks’ exposure to fossil fuels and encourages people to make an informed decision about where their money goes. “We can confidently say that it’s in the tens of thousands of people who have moved their accounts, but we long ago lost the ability to track that,” he says. The immediate backdrop to Morrison’s promised crackdown on environmental campaigns was the violent clash between police and protesters at an international mining and resources conference in Melbourne. Asked whether blockading a general interest mining conference risked damaging the movement’s anti-fossil fuel message and turning away potential supporters, Vincent is not critical of the protesters and says “we need Extinction Rebellion”. But he adds: “It’s essential that we are clear and focused on what the message is with any protest or campaign activity. The problem in this instance comes from coal, which needs to go.” He says it is too soon to say how the group will respond to the government, but emphasises that it is sometimes lost in political discussion that environment campaigns work only if they have public support. There is evidence that support for increased action to combat global heating may be strengthening, though the issue remains politically and culturally divisive. Hundreds of thousands of people marched in climate strikes in September and a recent Lowy Institute poll that found 64% of Australians rank climate change as the number one threat to the country’s national interest. Some support for change comes from within companies targeted by campaigners. Vincent points to the case of engineering firm GHD, where the ABC has reported there has been dissent from staff over the company’s work with Adani. He believes part of Market Forces’ role is to “give licence for that internal conversation”. “Ultimately, if we’re running campaigns that are not fair that will become obvious and they will fail,” Vincent says. “What we’ve often found is, when you give quiet Australians a voice, they tend to speak out against projects like the Adani mine.”"
"Each year, nearly 9,500 people die due to London’s air pollution. It’s one of the biggest challenges for the capital’s next mayor – literally a matter of life and death. The problem has been around for decades. In fact, this year marks the 60th anniversary of the Clean Air Act 1956, passed by parliament in response to London’s Great Smog of December 1952. London was well known for its “pea-souper” fogs, but when the “Great Smog” fell over the city the effects were unprecedented: 4,000 immediate deaths with a further 8,000 dying in the following weeks and months. The act aimed to control domestic sources of smoke pollution by introducing smokeless zones. In these areas, coal had to be ditched in favour of smokeless alternatives such as coke or charcoal, power stations were moved to rural areas and tall chimneys were built for industry to disperse pollutant at height. Air pollution in London is very different today, and yet the same health issues exist. Gone are the polluting factories and the coal burning and in its place are a newer breed of contaminants. One of the primary causes is the old favourite, the combustion engine. Diesel exhausts include carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides, and microscopic specs of “particulate matter”, the smaller fractions of which penetrate the deep lung and pass across into the blood stream.  All of the above are seriously bad for your health. Air pollution has been linked to cancer, asthma, stroke and heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and even dementia. The damage begins during a baby’s first weeks in the womb and continues across an entire lifetime through to old age.  Consequently, any air quality improvements made now will have long-lasting benefits. The effects aren’t distributed evenly, or randomly. Older people and adults with long-term conditions are particularly vulnerable, for instance, and improving air quality will help them to stay independent and well, easing the pressure on NHS and social services. Children are also particularly at risk, as their lungs are still developing. We know traffic-related air pollution causes asthma so, given London has more than a thousand schools close to busy roads it’s perhaps no surprise a recent poll found parents in the capital now see air pollution as the biggest health threat. It’s a social issue too, as pollution exacerbates inequality. Research shows exposure varies a great deal from place to place even within the city, and London’s low income households tend to be in more polluted areas while wealthier people live on leafy side streets. The capital’s next mayor will have the power to make dramatic improvements to London residents’ health. Looking over the manifestos of front runners Sadiq Khan (Labour) and Zac Goldsmith (Conservative), as well as Sian Berry (Green) and Caroline Pidgeon (Liberal Democrat), it’s clear there’s a lot of agreement.  Where they differ is in their methods of dealing with these important issues and the timing of their interventions.  The Greens would bring in a smart road-charging system, while the Lib Dems would ban diesel vehicles within the city centre by 2024. Goldsmith wants to retrofit all existing buses by 2020, while Berry wants to move the entire bus fleet to hybrid/electric by that year. Air pollution isn’t solely caused by transport, of course. Gas burning, often from domestic boilers, also adds to the problem and all candidates have ideas for reducing boiler emissions or boosting energy efficiency – Khan wants further investment in older homes, for instance.  Goldsmith’s pledge that all new homes will meet the zero carbon standard would actually revive a policy the current national government has scrapped.  Of course, you have to ask, are all these policies realistic? Will they be followed through? While air quality is only one of many issues in this election, it is an extremely important one. Five decades on from the Great Smog, we need another clean air revolution."
"Poor management of the rural landscape along with global heating and building on floodplains are the main factors that led to the floods that have engulfed towns in northern England, according to experts. Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster are among the places flooded, 12 years after they were badly hit when the River Don burst its banks in 2007. Many affected areas, including Meadowhall shopping centre, where customers were stranded overnight, lie within the river’s floodplain – low-lying land next to the river that naturally floods during high flow. “This is only a problem if you develop floodplains by building houses, businesses and factories on them, which is obviously what we have done over the years, so to some degree it’s a problem of our own making,” said Roy Mosley, the head of conservation and land management at Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust. The risk faced by floodplain communities is exacerbated by the management of land upstream of the city. Intensive animal grazing leads to short grass and compacted soil, which is less able to absorb and hold water. There are no longer enough trees and plants to absorb rain and stop it from running straight into the river, Mosley said. There are similar problems in Derbyshire, where the River Derwent burst its banks last week, forcing hundreds out of their homes and businesses, and leading to the death of former county high sheriff Annie Hall. Matt Buckler, the head of nature recovery networks at Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, said the fact that fields below the river level remained dry while towns flooded exposed the problems with our rural land. “It would have been easy to reduce the level of the river by 10-15 centimetres by letting those fields flood. “People last week said ‘Oh, we were very lucky, if the water had been a centimetre higher it would have come into the house’. So reducing flood levels by just one or two centimetres can have a massive impact on people’s lives.” Increased flooding is the biggest impact on the UK of the climate crisis, according to the government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. In July, the CCC said there were no areas where the government was preparing properly for climate impacts, though it said flood planning was making progress – with the exception of flash flooding. Met Office data shows the amount of rain from extremely wet days has increased by 17%, when comparing 2008-17 records with those from 1961-90. The two wettest winters on record were 2013-14 and 2015-16. The Met Office calculates that an extended period of extreme winter rainfall in the UK, similar to winter 2013-14, is now about seven times more likely because of climate breakdown. One reason is that warmer air can contain more water vapour. Another likely reason is the effect of global heating on the jet stream. Its normal meandering across the nation appears to be slowing, meaning rain falls for longer on one region, increasing the risk of floods. Mosley said: “The last big flood in [South Yorkshire] and in much of the country was in 2007. At one time that would have been considered a one-in-100 flood, but here we are now just 12 years later with another flood that is actually bigger. We’re going from something very infrequent to potentially something almost regular.” The wildlife trust has worked on schemes such as the installation of the 4.5-hectare (11-acre) Centenary Riverside flood storage area in Rotherham. “Last week it was full to the brim and clearly if that water wasn’t there it would be somewhere else, probably in someone’s business,” said Mosley. The organisation is also working upstream in the hills above Sheffield to install water storage ponds and ditches, plant trees and manage livestock grazing. “We’re encouraging farmers to plough across slopes rather than up and down slope, which is mechanically easier but all that does is create water channels for water to rush off the hills,” said Mosley. “We’re delivering these measures across 14 sites but it needs to be 400.” Meanwhile, the conservation organisation Moors for the Future is working in the Pennines, where the River Don originates, to restore the moorlands, which were degraded by air pollution from previous industrial activity. They are reintroducing sphagnum moss, which was killed off by poor air quality but can store huge amounts of water. Chris Dean, the head of programme delivery for the group, said that while these efforts would not solve flooding problems, they should be considered as important as man-made flood defences. “There is no difference in my mind between getting sphagnum moss back on the top of the hill and building hard defences alongside the river.” A previous project carried out by the group on the River Kinder showed that moorland restoration can take 30% off the flood peak and reduce the time it takes water to leave the site by 20 minutes. The burning and draining of moorland to boost game bird populations for grouse shooting has also been blamed for increasing the risk of flooding across Yorkshire. In 2016, the planting of 40,000 trees above Pickering in North Yorkshire was credited with helping the frequently flooded town avert inundation during heavy rainfall by slowing the flow of water into the river and reducing its peak height. The £500,000 project was significantly cheaper than a proposed new flood wall. MPs criticised the government in 2016 over insufficient funding for natural ways to prevent floods, including trees and putting logs in rivers to slow water flow. But scientists say that natural flood defences must be combined with conventional prevention techniques. Prof Hannah Cloke, a hydrologist at the University of Reading, said more work could be done on the floodplain as well as in the uplands. “You can retrofit houses to be more resilient. If you are building on a floodplain because there’s no other option at all, you can raise these buildings on stilts and make a space for the water to flow around the building. These technologies exist, but they are expensive and therefore are not popular with developers.” Funding for flood defences in England was cut sharply after David Cameron became prime minister in 2010, delaying many schemes. It was restored after serious flooding hit many parts of the country. On Friday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said: “We are seeing more and more serious flooding – perhaps because of building, almost certainly because of climate change.”"
"Much has been written about our incredible psychological ability to ignore or gloss over the threat of climate change. According to Irina Bokova, director general of UNESCO, “the gap between what we know about the interconnectedness and fragility of our planetary system and what we are actually doing about it is alarming. And it is deepening”. This gap between knowing and doing can be explained, in part, by our tendency to reach for defence mechanisms in response to the realities of climate change.  We deny the reality of climate change, minimise its implications or our responsibility for it, or project the consequences onto far off places or into the future. Such processes can occur in individual thinking; and they can appear in conversation, groups and wider societies as deliberate but unspoken “agreements” not to talk about climate change in polite conversation. These denial tendencies are supported on an even larger scale in society and culture, as climate change is routinely absented or minimised as an issue – in media, government policy or advertising for example.  Meanwhile, the climate crisis deepens. Across the planet, climate change is increasing the likelihood of extreme weather. To be defined as “extreme”, a weather event must be significantly divergent from normal patterns, with accompanying severe impacts, and be historically infrequent (about once every hundred years). They include floods, droughts, wildfires and heatwaves. Such “extreme weather events” are predicted to increase in the future as global warming increases.  It is commonly argued that one reason climate change doesn’t have enough psychological or social traction is because it is perceived as distant – in time and space. And so some commentators, including former NASA scientist James Hansen, have predicted that this kind of direct experience of the manifestations of climate science predictions will increasingly bring the reality of climate change home, breaking through established defences, and finally closing the gap between knowing and doing. Is this likely? Perhaps surprisingly, research suggests that in the wake of experiencing extreme weather, people may not consider climate change any more of a threat. For example, while the severe floods in the south-east of England in the winter of 2013-14 were exactly the kind of event predicted by climate scientists for a number of years, those directly experiencing them were found to be “no more knowledgeable, concerned or active in relation to climate change than people without flooding experience”.  Why might this be the case? The cause of such incidents involves an array of factors, and separating out human influence and natural variability in weather systems is challenging. This is why scientists, cautious by profession, talk of climate change “increasing the odds” of extreme weather in general, but rarely weigh in on arguments about specific events. Considering our psychological and social tendency not to attribute worrying events to human-made climate change, the potential power of direct experience to “open our eyes” to climate change is scuppered by the apparent uncertainty in connecting specific events to climate change. But what if extreme weather events could be attributed to human-induced climate change with confidence? The emerging area of “extreme event attribution” allows us to pose such a question. New research by Noah Diffenbaugh and colleagues at Stanford University is the most ambitious contribution to this field to date. They devise a thorough set of measurements and demand a high burden of proof in quantifying the influence of global warming on unprecedented extreme climate events. For one of their case studies, the summer decline of Arctic sea ice, overwhelming statistical evidence meant the significant contribution of climate change was “virtually certain”. More generally, anthropogenic climate change has increased the likelihood of the hottest events over more than 80% of the surface area of the Earth. Diffenbaugh and colleagues refer to the important implications of their research “for climate adaptation and mitigation efforts”, imagined as top-down interventions such as disaster risk management systems. But what interests me are the implications for behavioural and social change, particularly of the potential for extreme event attribution to motivate bottom-up activism and broader engagement with climate change as an urgent issue. Would we be more willing to change our behaviour, get together, act up accordingly, if we had direct experience of an extreme event that is confidently attributed to climate change?  It is certainly tempting to think that combined with direct experience of extreme weather, clearer attribution would be a powerful push factor. But developments in the psychology of defence mechanisms suggest that when we start to feel that threatening situations are getting closer, our defences become more pronounced and manic. We might increase our antagonism for individuals or groups who are bringing the problem to our attention or managing the fallout from extreme events; or uncritically idealise leaders who assert denial (any examples spring to mind?). We might even go overboard in pursuing and cheerleading behaviours deemed environmentally damaging, to reassure ourselves and others that we have nothing to worry about (remember the Republican campaign slogan “Drill, baby, drill”?). This makes sense – we need to work harder, individually and collectively, to deny the reality of climate change when it starts to feel more real. Despite my reservations, we just can’t be sure what the effects of being able to attribute extreme weather to climate change might be. It is still possible that with a stronger causal narrative, immediate and direct experience of extreme events unlocks the motivation of individuals and communities in ways we have witnessed in other areas of environmental campaigning. Firsthand experience of this kind just might puncture the individual defence mechanisms and socially generated silences that maintain the gap between what we know about climate change, and what we are doing about it."

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I wrote a post about the Rheinstetten weather station here.
At first I thought it was the one located at the local gliding airfield, but found it peculiar that siting was pretty bad – as Anthony Watts commented. This is not something that’s typical of Germans, who like to be precise with everything. But it was the only one I could find in the local area.
Moreover, the coordinates provided by the DWD German Weather Service placed the station several hundred meters away from the gliding airfield location. Something wasn’t adding up.
Then reader Tim Channon, who has a lot more experience using tools like Google Maps, Bing Maps and Google Earth than I do, pointed out that you have to be really careful using these tools because many of the images are old and outdated. It turned out that the station at the gliding field wasn’t the DWD station.
Thanks to Tim, who used Google Earth, we succeeded in finding the new, correct DWD Rheinstetten station. Here it is:

The new station location is indicated by the yellow thumb tack. The crappy glider airfield weather station, which I first thought was the DWD station, is to the right at the white building indicated by the white airplane symbol. Google Maps images are old and don’t show the new facility. But Google Earth does.
The photo below is a bird’s eye view of the new, correct station.

Image: Google Earth
I’m guessing the measurement station itself is located all the way on the bottom right corner of the photo, at the end of the footpath, which to me would make it quite well sited. Though I don’t know what kind of impact the agricultural activity could have on the readings.
In summary I learned a number of things in the search for the station. No. 1: Don’t expect Google maps to be up to date!
Now that this all straightened out, time to move on to other business. I’ll leave the weather station hunting to others.

"We very much welcome Bristol city council’s commitment to improving the city’s lethal air quality by banning all privately owned diesel vehicles from the inner city by 2021 (Bristol becomes first UK city to ban diesel cars to fight pollution, 6 November). Now local governments across the UK must follow suit and go one step further in a bid to tackle the impending climate emergency for current and future generations.  The climate crisis is the greatest environmental and health risk of the 21st century, and transport accounts for 26% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, with the main sources being petrol and diesel cars. Quick decarbonisation of the transport sector will require more than a ban on petrol and diesel vehicles, however. The upcoming general election provides political parties with an opportunity to develop ambitious plans to reduce car journeys, especially in cities, and curb polluting vehicles before 2040. Ahead of the election, we are asking the next government to commit to bold action on road transport emissions and to prioritise cleaner forms of travel, such as walking and cycling. This includes: sustained long-term investment in walking and cycling; a 20-minute neighbourhood planning principle for all cities and towns; helping more children walk, scoot and cycle for their school journey; and a UK-wide ban on pavement parking. Failure to do so will have dramatic implications on the health of our planet and future generations.James CleetonEngland director south at Sustrans, Bristol • Bristol wants to ban diesel cars from its centre.

"“This whole area wants to be a wood,” says Edward Milbank, sweeping his arm across the former hill farm in Northumberland. Small saplings of birch have invaded the cleared ground, but many more trees are being pushed into the soil by hand. The bracken and rhododendron that had overrun the hillside took heavy machinery three months to rip out. “When you disturb the soil, it becomes a wood very quickly,” says Milbank. “But the Forestry Commission forced us to put in Scots pine as well. The entire area could be birch without spending a penny, but you have to be seen to be doing something to justify the [planting grants].” This former sheep and cattle farm, Doddington North, is being converted into England’s largest private new woodland in 30 years, with 680,000 trees being planted over the 350 hectares. Moving down the hill, Milbank points and says: “The reason we were able to raise the investment is that – sitka spruce.” The commercial timber tree will occupy 40% of the land, with native broadleaf trees such as birch, alder, aspen and oak on about a third and the rest managed as open grassland. Milbank, whose company Pennine Forestry is running the project, hopes it will encourage more wildlife, such as the red squirrels that live in an adjoining wood, and the kestrels that already fly overhead searching for the shrews that dart between tussocks. The UK needs 1.5bn more trees, according to the government’s official climate change advisers, to suck up carbon dioxide and help restore wildlife. But the question of how they will be delivered – private or public, commercial or wild – remains open, despite the pioneering effort at Doddington North, which should be completed this winter. James Trayte, who leads the team of planters, has done more than most. He reckons he has planted more than 2m trees in his 12-year career. Out since dawn, he has planted about 2,000 so far today, plucking the two-year old sitka saplings from bags around his waist, then prodding them into the hole he makes with a deft twist of the planting spade. “It was pure love at the start, getting paid to walk around on the hillsides, battling the weather.” After 12 winter seasons, the best time to plant trees, he is more blunt about the motivation. “It’s a brutal job and my elbow is going. What brings me back now is the money.” Milbank says: “Most local people have been incredibly supportive of the project, but not everyone. They thought we were taking away good agricultural land to put in trees.” But, if the national tree target is to be met, he says: “There will have to be some land that comes out of agricultural production and goes into forestry.” Much of the timber – and the carbon it contains – gets locked up in new buildings, he points out. All the saplings planted are UK grown, but global heating is already exerting an influence. “We take them from nurseries in the south of England, as that will be the climate we have here in the north in the future,” Milbank says. Very few plastic guards are used, though that has meant killing deer that would destroy the saplings and putting up fences. “It will be lovely to have deer back in here in 10 years”, when the trees are established, he says. Milbank is clear that management is essential to create and maintain woodland, such as removing some trees to let light through the canopy, a task that large wild herbivores would have done in the past. He thinks rewilding 25% of the nation, as proposed by Rewilding Britain, is unrealistic: “I can’t see land just being left – we are too small an island, with 66 million people.” Rebecca Wrigley, at Rewilding Britain, says: “We are not suggesting people are taken off the land across the country and that everything is fully rewilded. We’d like to see a mosaic, maximising rewilding but also production where that is necessary. Rewilding has to work for people and nature, economy and ecology.” But she thinks management is a forestry mindset and often not necessary: “Woodlands have been doing OK for millions of years without human management, though obviously you need fully functional ecosystems.” The government is not far off track in delivering the 11m trees over five years in England that it promised to fund in 2017: 3.6m were planted in the last two seasons, about 2,300 hectares. But, overall, planting in England fell in 2019. There was a jump in UK figures, thanks to Scottish planting, but only to 13,400 ha. That is well below the 20,000 ha target set for 2020 by the government advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. It wants 27,000 ha a year by 2030, a level not seen since the 1970s, when huge monoculture plantations fuelled by tax breaks earned forestry a bad name. “It is wildly optimistic,” says Milbank, but not impossible. “If the incentives are there, farmers will follow.” Mark Bridgeman, the new president of the CLA, the Country, Land and Business Association, and whose Fallodon Estate is near Doddington North, agrees. “Right now it is not going to happen. It’s about creating a market for timber,” he says, noting that the UK imports 80% of its timber. “That is ludicrous – we have one of the greatest climates for growing trees.” But both say the government now has a perfect opportunity for change with the proposed post-Brexit subsidy regime potentially providing public money for public goods, such as carbon removal, flood protection and cleaner air – all things that trees can deliver. “Trees are the ultimate long-term project,” says Bridgeman. Sitkas double their weight – and carbon removal – between the ages of 30 and 40, but the cost of planting is upfront, creating a financial obstacle. A new £50m government scheme launched last week makes a start on tackling that, with people planting trees able to get regular payments for carbon storage. Another obstacle is the cost of getting permission to plant trees. “It was blooming hard to get Doddington North through,” says Milbank, whose company spent £125,000 and 18 months preparing the planning application. “There should be a presumption in favour of planting,” not against it, says Bridgeman. John Tucker, at the Woodland Trust, a charity that has planted 10m native broadleaf trees in the past two years, agrees. He supports the Doddington North project, despite its commercial timber component, saying: “We need more trees, full stop – of all sorts.” All projects now have to meet the UK Forestry Standard, he adds, meaning no monocultures or ugly clear-cutting. Back on the chilly Northumberland hillside, Milbank is confident there is change in the air, “Climate change is now at the forefront of people’s minds and I think the political will is there,” he says. “It will be easier to plant trees in future.”"
"Farming these days is more about brains than brawn. Whereas it used to focus on physical labour, a farmer these days is just as likely to be found on a comfortable tractor using satellite technology to collect data about crops and soil. This shift is in turn changing the face of farming. An increasing number of women are moving from the farm kitchen to the fields. The number of women in farming in the UK has tripled from 10,000 in 2001 to 29,000 in 2014. Women‘s involvement is becoming less peripheral and more professional. They are identifying as farmers and entering the field in their own right. Women have been working behind the scenes on farms for decades as farmer’s wives or daughters with their work unpaid and overshadowed by the man’s job. The stereotype is that a farmer is a man – just think of what a farmer looks like in a children’s book – and that has held women back. In practical terms too, women have historically struggled to own land, which was, at least in the past more traditionally passed on to sons. Historic inequality in ownership and control is both a cause and consequence of farming not being seen as a suitable career for women. In the past, to be a good farmer was to be a good man. Toughness and strength were considered masculine traits and were valued in farming because of the manual labour involved in cutting crops or managing a dairy. Women were often restricted to a supporting role – providing domestic and emotional support. But, it seems that our perceptions of what it means to be a farmer are changing as the number of women running farms increases. This cultural shift could be linked to the women farmers on television which help to break down long established gender stereotypes. Take the radio series The Archers for example. Several strong-willed women characters do not fit the outdated stereotype of a farmer as an unsophisticated old man. They represent a new breed of farming stock capable and determined to get their hands dirty in running a farm.   Meanwhile, in the real world, a plethora of women farmers are coming to the fore. Take Amanda Owen, otherwise known as the Yorkshire Shepherdess, she is renowned for her two bestselling books and is proud to be a farmer who juggles 1,000 sheep and nine children. Kate Humble, known for embracing the peaks and troughs of the farming year in Lambing Live, is a role model for women wanting to own a farm even if they do not come from a farming background. Women often gravitate towards the more business end of the job, such as in marketing, which offers new opportunities for leadership. Business mindedness is now central to the role of a farmer as the industry faces increasing financial pressures and fierce competition within a global market. The machinery has changed as well. In many ways, farming is less physically demanding than it used to be. Different skills are needed and farmers have to be able to embrace new technologies. Take automated milking systems, for example, and the impact it has had on commanding a herd. And of course agricultural education is changing things too. It allows women to establish themselves in the field on their own merit. The accessibility of training is breaking down barriers and inspiring young women to make their mark in a sector over-represented by men. As developing specialisms becomes a key selling point, it is a more necessary part of becoming a farmer than the old days. The changing nature of farming as a profession is helping challenge stigma about what is men’s and women’s work but the battle for equality hasn’t been won yet. Women may be empowered to enter farming but defying stereotypes will remain crucial in keeping women in farming and leadership roles. Despite all this progress, only 17% of farmers in the UK and 13% in Ireland are women."

"The humble honeybee and other pollinating bees and butterflies are all vital parts of the global food chain. Without them honey, strawberries, apples, pears or even a cold pint of cider just would not exist. But the burning question that I and other ecologists are asking is whether these insects – the majority of which are not pests – can coexist with our pesticides. In particular, scientists are worried about a class of pesticides known as “neonicotinoids”, which are more targeted in their application by being coated to the seed rather than being sprayed directly onto the crop. The farmers who use these chemicals aren’t beekeepers, after all, and their main concern is to ensure fruitful crops of oilseed rape and the like. The jury is still out on whether the current EU ban on the use of neonicotinoids should be lifted, with a verdict due in the autumn. Clearly, legislators need to assess all the evidence first, yet previous research has been inconclusive. Some studies have shown clear evidence of harm to bees,  while others raise more questions than answers.  Colleagues and I at the UK’s Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, along with international collaborators, have added to the evidence base with the first pan-European experiment to assess neonicotinoid impacts on honeybees and wild bees in a field-realistic way. Our work shows that under certain conditions and in certain countries neonicotinoids do harm bees. In our experiment, undertaken at sites in the UK, Germany and Hungary, we exposed honeybees to oilseed rape treated with one of two neonicotinoids (clothanidin, from Bayer CropScience, or thiamethoxam, manufactured by Syngenta) or nothing at all. We repeated the experiment for two other species of wild bee, the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) and the red mason bee (Osmia bicornis). Our findings, published in Science, showed that exposure to treated crops reduced survival rates in honeybee colonies over the winter – a key measure of year-to-year viability – in two of the three countries. In Hungary, colony numbers fell by 24% in the following spring. In the UK, honeybee colony survival was generally very low, but lowest where bees fed on clothianidin-treated oilseed rape in the previous year. Perhaps surprisingly, no harmful effects on overwintering honeybees were found in Germany. Neonicotinoids were linked to lower reproductive success in both bumblebees and red mason bees, across all three countries. We believe the between country differences in the response of honeybees may be explained by factors including the availability of alternative flowers for bees to feed on, as well as general colony health. While the Hungarian and UK honeybees we looked at tended to be more diseased, the hives in Germany happened to be larger, showed little evidence of disease and had access to a wider range of wild flowers to feed on. Differences in the honeybee colonies between countries were not part of the experimental design, but were rather a product of where we locally sourced them. Ultimately the study was designed just to test for between-country differences in how bees respond to neonicotinoid treated oilseed rape. The effect of neonicotinoids is subtle and simply being exposed to treated crops does not mean a colony will die. But our research suggests that bees are most vulnerable to these pesticides when they are stressed and already not doing so well. Neonicotinoids do have a vital role to play in food production. As they can target particular insects they can be used in low dosages, reducing the need for broad spectrum insecticide sprays. They are also useful in controlling pests which have already developed some resistance to other pesticides. The question then is could we learn to live with neonicotinoids? How can they on the one hand benefit the farmer – whose primary crops are not necessarily bee-dependent – while on the other hand not adversely affect pollinators? There may be ways to mitigate the negative impacts of neonicotinoids on bees through improved honeybee husbandry or making more flowering plants available for bees to feed on across non-cropped areas. But this needs further research. Although poor health is likely to make honeybees more susceptible to neonicotinoids, it’s unlikely to be as simple as asking people to ensure their hives are healthy. No bee keeper deliberately has unhealthy hives, although there is arguably always scope for new approaches.  It may be easier to achieve the creation of new habitats rich in flowering plants, in agricultural landscapes often stripped of these key resources. Certainly, UK agri-environment schemes can and do provide a mechanisms to achieve this. For wild bees, nesting habitats are also often absent, and creating such areas in agricultural land may also help. Healthy populations of honeybees and wild bees are far more likely to be able to cope with exposure to neonicotinoids, as well as other pesticides that they may be exposed to in these systems.   The challenge for the EU, farmers, conservationists and consumers – and perhaps significantly the UK post-Brexit – is how to navigate the evidence and agree on solutions. It’s a challenge that will reap benefits not only in farmers’ fields but also on dinner menus – and perhaps most crucially on the very existence of global biodiversity."

Share this...FacebookTwitterScience journalist Michael Odenwald at the German news weekly FOCUS used to be quite the warmist, and maybe he still is. But his latest article here tells us that he may be opening up to other climate change explanations: natural factors such as solar activity.

Solar activity has quieted over the last years. Photo image: NASA
Odenwald’s article focusses on the sun’s recent solar activity, noting that the current cycle has only been about as half as active as normal and that the “sun in the second half of the 20th century was unusually active over several cycles.” He then notes how the earth’s climate has suspiciously stopped warming since the sun went quiet.
“Our planet could cool down”

Before citing the works of geophysicist Ilya Usoskin of the Finnish University Oulu, Odenwald writes:
The current low activity of the cosmic oven has possible dramatic consequences for our planet: Our planet could cool down. Perhaps the quiet sun is hidden behind another phenomenon over which scientists have long been wondering about: At around the year 2000 global warming came to a halt.”
Odenwald also informs readers that the high level of solar activity from 1950 bis 2009 indeed had been an outlier and that it is clear that “the global temperature, which has increased for more than 100 years, rose most strongly from 1975 to 2000. According to the IPCC the 30-year period from 1983 to 2012 in the northern hemisphere was the warmest in 1400 years. Roughly calculated it coincides with the most recent Grand Maximum.”
Warnings of a little ice age
Odenwald also writes that some climatologists believe “the real driver of climate change is our sun. Some are even warning of a new little ice age.”

"The private equity firm appointed by the government to manage as much as £400m in investment in electric car charging points has awarded millions of pounds to a company in which it holds a controlling financial interest. Zouk Capital is the largest shareholder in charge point builder Instavolt, having made an £18m investment in the company. Now Zouk has chosen Instavolt as the charge point fund’s first beneficiary, a decision criticised by the Labour party. The Conservative government announced its intention to establish a charging infrastructure investment fund in the autumn budget of 2017, amid plans to encourage drivers to choose electric cars, which emit lower or zero carbon dioxide . The £400m government-backed fund initially aims to deliver 3,000 additional rapid-charge points for electric cars, more than doubling the number of electric car charging points in the UK. However, the fund’s rollout, which hoped to match £200m in private-sector investment with public money, was delayed by almost two years, amid difficulties in recruiting an investment manager. The government finally awarded the mandate to manage the fund to Zouk Capitalin September. It also announced that the fund had raised the first £70m, with half provided by the government and half coming from Abu Dhabi-based renewables investor Masdar. Zouk declined to say exactly how much of the first £70m had gone to Instavolt. However, Samer Salty, Zouk’s founder and managing partner, said it was “less than 50%”. Salty expects to invest more of the fund into other companies by the end of the year. The government faced criticism from a Labour MP for allowing the arrangement. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow business secretary, said the UK needed urgent and significant investment in charging infrastructure, rather than deals between private companies. She added that a future Labour government would invest £3.6bn in publicly owned charging infrastructure. The government said that Zouk’s choice of Instavolt allowed the fund to “put capital to work quickly”, and that an “independent fairness opinion” by accountancy firm PwC had been “positive”. The government and PwC declined to provide the opinion or its reasoning to the Guardian. A spokesperson for the The Infrastructure and Projects Authority, the government body in charge of major investments, said: “Instavolt has ambitious plans for rolling out well-needed rapid chargers across the UK, and has a strong track record in this. “The government has followed a transparent and due process in the selection of its fund manager for the charging infrastructure investment fund, and all investment decisions have been taken in line with industry best practice.” In payment for managing the fund, Zouk will receive a percentage of the assets under management, plus a significantly higher performance fee if the returns beat a benchmark. Salty declined to comment on the fees charged, but said it was lower than the “2% and 20%” model – 2% of the assets under management and 20% of the profits – common in the private equity and hedge fund industries. Zouk will wait for at least five years before trying to recoup its equity investment in Instavolt, either by finding a buyer or floating it on a stock market, Salty said. Salty said similar deals were common within private equity and there had been the “right transparency” throughout. The arrangement was made after “very extensive due diligence” by both Masdar and the government, he added. “There is a conflict of interest but conflicts are there to be managed,” Salty said. “They are constantly being managed across the board.” Zouk holds sole responsibility for deciding future investments from the fund, which could go to Instavolt or competitors. Instavolt was founded in November 2016 by energy industry executives Tim Payne and Adrian Pike with backing from Zouk. It has not yet made a profit. It lost £4.3m in the year to 31 March 2019, up from £3.2m the year before. Providing 3,000 charge points will represent a significant step up for Instavolt. The company only built its first charging station in September 2017, and has so far installed about 400."
"It’s been a devastating week of unprecedented bushfires for New South Wales, Queensland and other states.  Some people are still fighting to save their homes, others are picking up the pieces after fires destroyed their properties and figuring out how to rebuild, and countless others are anxiously watching the fire warnings and preparing to evacuate.  While the numbers roll in to show that these fires are unprecedented – more than 1m hectares have burned in NSW alone, and it’s not even summer yet – fire authorities are warning that the worst is yet to come. As I watch the story unfold – the destroyed houses, the traumatised people, the exhausted firefighters, the dead and injured wildlife, livestock and pets – one thing is abundantly clear to me: we are in a new era of unprecedented bushfire danger and we are not prepared. Climate change has aggravated the catastrophic fire conditions that have torn through NSW and Queensland this week. Record-breaking drought, record-breaking heat, and very dry fuels and soils are a key part of why these bushfires are so deadly. Hazard reduction involves removing vegetation, creating fire breaks and prescribed burning. It is an important tool for fire agencies and land managers but prescribed burning can be a high-risk strategy. For obvious reasons, you can only do prescribed burnings when temperatures are low, humidity is high and winds aren’t too strong. But since it’s hot, dry and windy for more and more months of the year, leading to elevated fire danger, the window for safe burning is shrinking dramatically. Our new bushfire reality is also incredibly demanding in terms of resources. There has been little reprieve for firefighters, even with help from interstate crews. Our firefighting resources have been stretched to the point where we’re now asking firefighters in other countries to join us in the battle. And again, I stress: we are not even in summer yet. I would bet that most of us are in no hurry to get there, since the seasonal forecast predicts high temperatures and low rainfall – a recipe for extremely dangerous bushfire conditions. It is clear to me, and it should be clear to anyone whose job it is to keep Australians safe, that we need to step up how we resource fire and emergency services in this new era of higher bushfire danger, and we need to tackle the root cause of this escalating crisis: climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. The best time to have taken these steps was decades ago when climate scientists first started issuing warnings that burning coal, oil and gas was producing greenhouse gas emissions and fuelling dangerous climate change. The second best time would have been April, when senior emergency leaders from every Australian state and territory came together to warn the federal government that climate change was worsening bushfire danger in our country and that we were not prepared. Unfortunately, successive governments have largely dismissed or ignored these warnings. Even today, we have people disputing the evidence or spreading deliberate misinformation. There’s no more time to waste. The only appropriate time to heed the warnings of climate scientists, of emergency services leaders and of the growing numbers of concerned Australians, is right now. Let us master this crisis by increasing the capacity of fire and emergency services to prevent and respond to a growing number of climate emergencies and disasters. Let us work together to help communities prepare for and recover from these catastrophic events when they do happen. Let us stop this crisis from getting worse, by keeping coal, oil and gas in the ground. We can’t afford to dump more carbon pollution into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels. And we don’t need to – not when we know that investing in renewable energy can make us a thriving society with good jobs and a strong economy. Let’s choose our people over coal corporation profits. Let’s choose our fireys over fossil fuels. Let’s respond to this bushfire crisis like the climate change emergency it is. • Ken Thompson is the former deputy commissioner of NSW Fire and Rescue"
"Eglwyswrw is a real place. This village in Wales is as long on rain as it is short on vowels. Last winter, it rained for 85 days in a row, just missing out on setting the British record.  There’s a reason why it is so wet: the prevailing winds carry moisture-laden air from the Atlantic onto the Welsh hills and as the air rises it cools, losing its ability to hold as much water vapour. The water vapour condenses and falls as sweet, refreshing rain – though I imagine the people of Eglwyswrw may have been employing somewhat different adjectives just recently. The point is that hills make rain – or to be more precise, hills can create the conditions which cause moisture in the air to condense and fall as rain. This insight has whetted the appetite of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Not content with the Burj Khalifa (the world’s tallest building) and the man-made islands of the Palm and the World, the UAE is now considering building its own mountain.  It’s seen as a way to provide the desert country with a steady supply of fresh water. The mountain would, in theory, force the region’s humid air to rise and cool, forming new clouds in an otherwise clear sky. Those clouds could be “seeded” with tiny particles around which water droplets would form and then fall as rain.  I was asked to comment on this development as I work on geoengineering – assessing proposed techniques to cool the climate by either removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere or reflecting a portion of the sun’s light back into space. Whether the UAE’s mountainous ambitions quite count as geoengineering is debatable – I would argue not (sorry, it’s too small-scale) – but the term is sufficiently recent to allow people to play Humpty Dumpty with it (“When I use a word,” Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, “it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less.”) But even if the rainmaking mountain is not itself geoengineering, it still raises many of the same issues of ambition and hubris. To some people this proposal exemplifies the triumph of the human spirit over adverse environmental conditions, enabling the deserts to bloom. To others it is a manifestation of arrogance imposed on nature. Some will simply see the UAE proposal as a practical means to overcome climatic limitations. After all, central heating already enables people in cooler countries to live in far more comfort than their ancestors, even if the frugal option would be to pop on a few more layers instead. And there will be winners and losers. You’d hope that the winners would outnumber the losers, or the project wouldn’t go ahead. But even if the utilitarian calculus overall is positive, there will be some who don’t see the benefits of additional rainfall – and losers make more noise squealing than winners do in their contentment. The viewpoints you take are value judgements – and value judgements are not universally shared. Yet it may be possible to accommodate the differing viewpoints, provided the effects of the mountain are constrained within the territory of a nation. And even were the mountain to deprive a neighbouring country of its fair share of rain, some sort of compensation could be made to avert conflict. But the more transboundary the effects, the more complex the game of attribution and recompense becomes. A prolonged drought or a flash flood might be blamed on the mountain regardless of whether or not it is the cause. Could the UAE build such a mountain? The technical challenges would be daunting and the economic case may not stack up, but the key questions are around social acceptability. Do they have the right to so radically alter the landscape, or can such action be justified if that is what it takes to supply water to a parched land?  My guess is that Eglwyswrw will remain a real, really wet place and the UAE will remain a surreal, really dry place."

Hat-tip DkS
Häring writes that he has a background in natural sciences and took it upon himself to examine the science that allegedly underpins the anthropogenic global warming theory. He finds that “CO2 has been unjustifiably vilinized“.
Upon analyzing the data, Häring concludes:
The statement made by the UN IPCC that an unstopped further development of man-made activities will lead with great certainty to a dangerous climate warming is a prognosis and not a substantiated fact. […] Whoever claims the opposite with sentences like ‘The science is settled’, puts his credibility as a scientist in doubt.”
Häring points out that too many of the conclusions made by climate science rely on prognoses for the future and not on actual observations. He writes:

Prognoses cannot be checked. Just how reliable prognoses are is demonstrated by the financial world, even though it works with more measureable facts and systems that can be better understood. Even more problematic is when prognoses are based on models that no longer agree with observations. The climate development of the last 15 years no longer agrees with the IPCC models. Here there is a need to explain why.”
Häring also describes how the bad climate science has led to foolish and destructive policy measures, such as biofuels, palm oil plantations and carbon sequestration. He writes, “The question of whether CO2 in the ground causes more damage than CO2 in the atmosphere needs to be asked.”
On blaming weather extremes on CO2-induced climate change, Häring says it’s cynical to even speculate on this. “Extreme events such as droughts and floods involving the deaths of thousands will continue with or without climate warming”.
He then explains that building infrastructure and taking measures to counter such events today makes much more sense than cutting back on CO2 in the hope that this will act as a solution 100 years down the road. In a nutshell he says that countries need development today, and not witchcraft to cure the possible ills of the year 2100.
It is not surprising that poor countries are hit harder by natural catastrophes than rich countries because they can’t afford any protective measures.”

"Algal biofuels are in trouble. This alternative fuel source could help reduce overall carbon emissions without taking land from food production, like many crop-based biofuels do. But several major companies including Shell and ExxonMobil are seemingly abandoning their investments in this environmentally friendly fuel. So why has this promising technology failed to deliver, and what could be done to save it? Algae are photosynthetic organisms related to plants that grow in water and produce energy from carbon dioxide and sunlight. Single-celled microalgae can be used to produce large amounts of fat, which can be converted into biodiesel, the most common form of biofuel. There are many possible ingredients for making biofuels, from corn to used cooking oil. But algae are particularly interesting because they can be grown rapidly and produce large amounts of fuel relative to the resources used to grow them (high productivity). In the last decade or so, vast amounts of money have been invested in the development of algae for biofuel production. This made sense because, ten years ago, there was a need to find alternatives to fossil fuels due to the high oil price and the increasing recognition that carbon emissions were causing climate change. Algal biofuels were touted as the answer to these twin problems, and huge investment followed. Unfortunately, things didn’t go quite to plan. Companies making algal biofuels struggled to retain their high productivity at a larger scale and found predators often contaminated their farms. They also found that the economics just didn’t make sense. Building the ponds in which to grow the algae and providing enough light and nutrients for them to grow proved too expensive, and to make matters worse the oil price has plummeted. But algae don’t just produce biofuels. In fact, algae are like microscopic factories producing all sorts of useful compounds that can be used to make an amazingly diverse range of products.  For example, algae can produce large amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, an important dietary supplement. This means it could be a sustainable, vegetarian source of omega-3, which is otherwise only available from eating fish or unappetising cod liver tablets. More generally, algae are excellent sources of vitamins, minerals and proteins, with species such as Chlorella and Spirulina commonly being consumed for their health benefits. Another useful product that can be made from algae is bioplastic. Regular plastic is a product of fossil fuels and takes an extremely long time to break down, which makes it very environmentally unfriendly. Bioplastic from algae can be produced with low carbon emissions, or even in a way that absorbs emissions. Their use could help prevent the build up of plastic in the environment. The diversity of these products may be the key to finally developing algal biofuels. Many are high-value chemicals, selling for a much higher price than biofuels. So by combining them with biodiesel production, we could subsidise the price of the fuel and offset the high costs of algal cultivation.  This concept, known as a “biorefinery”, is part of a new wave of algae research that aims to overcome the issues of the past decade or so. We already know that oil refineries produce plastics, fibres and lubricants as well as fuels. Now we are hoping to develop algal biorefineries in exactly the same way. To make this model cost-effective and sustainable, we would need to use waste sources of heat, carbon dioxide and nutrients to grow the algae. These are widely available from power plants, factories and water treatment plants and so could reduce some of the costs of growing algae. After making algal fuel, you’re left with lots of proteins, carbohydrates and other molecules. These can be converted into the kinds of products mentioned above, or used to produce biogas (another fuel source). This biogas can be sold or used at the biorefinery to produce heat for the algae, closing the loop and making the whole process more efficient. It’s easy to see how this process could be a way forward for sustainable, profitable biofuel from algae. In fact, there are companies already applying this concept to their work. In 2014 Sapphire Energy, one of the world’s largest algal biotechnology companies, announced that they were diversifying their work to include nutritional supplements as well as biofuels. This move towards biorefinery is becoming more common and many firms diversifying their product lines. Clearly, the algal biorefinery will not solve all the problems facing commercial algal cultivation today. There are still key issues facing the loss of yield at very large scales, and the contamination of algal cultures by predators that eat your crop of algae. These issues will only be solved by continued research efforts. However, biorefinery may well be the next step towards a future free from fossil fuels."
"I grew up in social housing. It provided a stable and secure (albeit overcrowded and cold) home for my family, for life. As fire tore through Grenfell Tower, just 500 metres from where I was staying in London, I witnessed the complete and terrible destruction of 120 homes just like the one I grew up in. In the morning, I passed the police cordon and saw dozens of fire fighters standing in complete, abject shock.  Yet as the ashes settle, it is clear that the threat of ruin extends well beyond Grenfell Tower. Indeed, the policies which I argue have contributed to this disaster have been rolled out across social housing projects both in the UK, and across Europe. Earlier this year, not far from Grenfell, local residents in Westminster voted against any form of refit to their notoriously poorly-maintained Brunel Estate. And many residents across London fear the prospect of “urban regeneration”, seeing it as a type of social cleansing, shorthand for a modern form of slum clearance. Residents worry that any improvements will set them on a slippery slope to gentrification and eventual displacement. Over the years, I have watched with dismay as successive governments – both Labour and Conservative – have depleted the available housing stock through schemes such as right-to-buy, while also running down the standard of the remaining housing stock with constant budget cuts. Faced with this gradual depletion and dilapidation, many family homes languish in a state of disrepair, while tenants’ fears that they could lose their homes go unassuaged.  This is not just a British problem. During my academic research in France I have seen deplorable incidences of housing stock that are not fit for human habitation, and where repairs are routinely neglected. Where regeneration does take place, I fear it is often done with little consultation and even less accountability.  As Londoners get to grips with the tragic losses at Grenfell Tower, reports have emerged about a recent refit that the tower underwent. Only last year, the site was given a £8.7m refit, during which a new central heating system was installed, more homes fitted in the lower levels and new cladding added to the outside of the building, among other things.  Yet a local residents action group claims that throughout the process, their concerns about fire safety risks – relating to cluttered exits, lack of emergency access and faulty wiring – were ignored by both the building owners, Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO), and the local authority, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.  It has also emerged that the new cladding was made of aluminium – a heat conducting material which did nothing to halt the spread of the flames. This type of cladding is commonly used across Europe, and indeed the world, to cover the outside of buildings to improve insulation – and also appearances. Indeed, a spate of fires in Dubai, where the cladding is very common, forced authorities to change building regulations.  During my research in Roubaix, in the north of France, another residential block – the Mermoz Tower – was also refitted with aluminium cladding, as part of a redevelopment to add a shopping mall to the base of the estate. The residents I spoke to there for my research were concerned about the quality of the refit, and felt that their worries went unacknowledged. Some time later, a fire broke out and spread up the outside of the building, just as we saw in London. A report by the Fire Protection Research Foundation later indicated that combustible cladding can play a role in the spread of fire, listing the Roubaix fire as a case in point. KCTMO said in a statement “it is too early to speculate what caused the fire and contributed to its spread. We will co-operate fully with all the relevant authorities in order to ascertain the cause of this tragedy.” A spokesperson for the council said: “We have heard a number of theories about the cause of the fire at Grenfell Tower. All of these will be thoroughly investigated as part of the formal investigation which has already begun.” The construction company behind the recent refit of Grenfell has also said it would “fully support” an investigation, and that the work met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards. The regeneration agenda has not only contributed to the destruction of social housing – it has also made it much more difficult to hold those responsible to account. Since urban regeneration became a policy priority in the 1990s, such schemes have become increasingly complex. New Labour touted “the third way” as a means of drawing private companies and funding into urban regeneration schemes. The goal was to harness the efficiency of the private market while undertaking repairs and building schemes. The result was a labyrinthine system, wherein private building contractors are given complex and far-reaching responsibilities for social housing sites.  Grenfell Tower is a case in point. Owned by the local council, it is managed by KCTMO, which is a separate tenant management organisation and which sub-contracts repairs out to further private operators.  As the inquiry into this disaster unfolds, it is likely that the decision-making mechanisms and accountability structures in this complex arrangement will be examined carefully. Yet as social housing tenants who complain about repairs will know only too well, it is likely that the investigators will find it difficult to determine exactly what has happened – and which party in this confusing arrangement is at fault.  The tragedy which occurred at Grenfell Tower exposes the problems with the successive reforms to social housing in the UK. All too often, I see profit and regeneration being placed above the safety and satisfaction of residents. In the wake of this catastrophe, political and community leaders must work to rebalance the scales of power toward the residents themselves, and away from the interests of private developers.  My grandmother grew up in the terrible slums that the Grenfell tower replaced. When asked about rehousing options, she chose uncertainty and a new start in a pre-fabricated house in the suburbs. As I was on the phone to my extended family – who still live in the house – we were very pleased she did."

The climate catastrophe is hitting without mercy. Bild reported on 28 October 2014:
New climate study causes fear and trembling: How bitter-cold will winter be?
The polar ice is melting. And so the jet stream is changing. Result: Lots of bitter cold winters – also in Germany. Excuse me? This US climate study has just been published by the magazine ‘Nature Geoscience’ and it is causing fear and trembling. But what is really behind this? BILD asked climate pope Prof. Dr. Mojib Latif: ‘That’s indeed just an old story. It could be so. But not necessarily. The jet stream can change because of natural reasons. I’m really skeptical.'”
Crazy world: Climate warming is cooling the climate in Germany. And [warmist] Mojib Latif is suddenly a skeptic. So what’s next? Is climate change going to make it dark in the daytime and light at night? Will [the island] of Norderney soon be reachable by foot because of sea level rise? Will the glaciers in the Alps cover Munich because the ice is melting faster and faster? So many questions.

"One of the largest icebergs ever recorded has just broken away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Over the past few years I’ve led a team that has been studying this ice shelf and monitoring change. We spent many weeks camped on the ice investigating melt ponds and their impact – and struggling to avoid sunburn thanks to the thin ozone layer. Our main approach, however, is to use satellites to keep an eye on things. We’ve been surprised by the level of interest in what may simply be a rare but natural occurrence. Because, despite the media and public fascination, the Larsen C rift and iceberg “calving” is not a warning of imminent sea level rise, and any link to climate change is far from straightforward. This event is, however, a spectacular episode in the recent history of Antarctica’s ice shelves, involving forces beyond the human scale, in a place where few of us have been, and one which will fundamentally change the geography of this region. Ice shelves are found where glaciers meet the ocean and the climate is cold enough to sustain the ice as it goes afloat. Located mostly around Antarctica, these floating platforms of ice a few hundred meters thick form natural barriers which slow the flow of glaciers into the ocean and thereby regulate sea level rise. In a warming world, ice shelves are of particular scientific interest because they are susceptible both to atmospheric warming from above and ocean warming from below. Back in the 1890s, a Norwegian explorer named Carl Anton Larsen sailed south down the Antarctic Peninsula, a 1,000km long branch of the continent that points towards South America. Along the east coast he discovered the huge ice shelf which took his name. For the following century, the shelf, or what we now know to be a set of distinct shelves – Larsen A, B, C and D – remained fairly stable. However the sudden disintegrations of Larsen A and B in 1995 and 2002 respectively, and the ongoing speed-up of glaciers which fed them, focused scientific interest on their much larger neighbour, Larsen C, the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antarctica.  This is why colleagues and I set out in 2014 to study the role of surface melt on the stability of this ice shelf. Not long into the project, the discovery by our colleague, Daniela Jansen, of a rift growing rapidly through Larsen C, immediately gave us something equally significant to investigate. The development of rifts and the calving of icebergs is part of the natural cycle of an ice shelf. What makes this iceberg unusual is its size – at around 5,800 km² it’s the size of a small US state. There is also the concern that what remains of Larsen C will be susceptible to the same fate as Larsen B, and collapse almost entirely. Our work has highlighted significant similarities between the previous behaviour of Larsen B and current developments at Larsen C, and we have shown that stability may be compromised. Others, however, are confident that Larsen C will remain stable.  What is not disputed by scientists is that it will take many years to know what will happen to the remainder of Larsen C as it begins to adapt to its new shape, and as the iceberg gradually drifts away and breaks up. There will certainly be no imminent collapse, and unquestionably no direct effect on sea level because the iceberg is already afloat and displacing its own weight in seawater. This means that, despite much speculation, we would have to look years into the future for ice from Larsen C to contribute significantly to sea level rise. In 1995 Larsen B underwent a similar calving event. However, it took a further seven years of gradual erosion of the ice-front before the ice shelf became unstable enough to collapse, and glaciers held back by it were able to speed up, and even then the collapse process may have depended on the presence of surface melt ponds.  Even if the remaining part of Larsen C were to eventually collapse, many years into the future, the potential sea level rise is quite modest. Taking into account only the catchments of glaciers flowing into Larsen C, the total, even after decades, will probably be less than a centimetre. This event has also been widely but over-simplistically linked to climate change. This is not surprising because notable changes in the earth’s glaciers and ice sheets are normally associated with rising environmental temperatures. The collapses of Larsen A and B have previously been linked to regional warming, and the iceberg calving will leave Larsen C at its most retreated position in records going back over a hundred years. However, in satellite images from the 1980s, the rift was already clearly a long-established feature, and there is no direct evidence to link its recent growth to either atmospheric warming, which is not felt deep enough within the ice shelf, or ocean warming, which is an unlikely source of change given that most of Larsen C has recently been thickening. It is probably too early to blame this event directly on human-generated climate change. You may be interested in: When an Antarctic iceberg the size of a country breaks away, what happens next?"
"Large parts of New South Wales have been in the grip of catastrophic fire weather this week as firefighters desperately work to save homes, properties and lives. But as firefighters try and beat back the bushfires, a familiar blame game began with critics pointing fingers at “greenies”, claiming they get in the way of hazard reduction efforts that might have reduced the size and scale of the disaster. “These are very tired and very old conspiracy theories that get a run after most major fires,” says Prof Ross Bradstock, the director of the centre for environmental risk management of bushfires at the University of Wollongong, who has been researching bushfires for 40 years. “They’ve been extensively dealt with in many inquiries.” The chief accuser is Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce who says “greens policy” gets in the way “of many of the practicalities of fighting a fire and managing it”. Among Joyce’s claims, made in several interviews this week, are that Greens policies have made hazard reduction activities more difficult. This claim, just to be clear, is about the policies of a party that has never been in government. Joyce also blamed the Greens for “paperwork” that made it harder to carry out hazard reduction activities. “It’s not burning because they burnt off, it’s burning because they didn’t burn off,” Joyce told SkyNews. According to Bradstock, Joyce’s claims are familiar but “without foundation.” “It’s simply conspiracy stuff. It’s an obvious attempt to deflect the conversation away from climate change.” A former NSW fire and rescue commissioner, Greg Mullins, has written this week that the hotter and drier conditions, and the higher fire danger ratings, were preventing agencies from carrying out prescribed burning. He said: “Blaming ‘greenies’ for stopping these important measures is a familiar, populist, but basically untrue claim.” Preparations for bushfire season are done outside the most dangerous periods using a suite of methods known as hazard reduction. “The fuel is the hazard, so it’s about reducing that fuel load to diminish the intensity of a subsequent wildfire,” Bradstock says. Methods include prescribed burning where authorities identify at-risk areas close to developments, or in areas known for being sites where large fires ignite, and “reduce the load” with controlled burning. In some areas, hazard reduction is carried out by removing trees and vegetation. Another method is to create fuel breaks, also known as fire breaks, where trees are cleared to prevent the spread of a fire to protect developments and infrastructure. This is also done routinely around power lines. It is activities like this which Joyce claims are being suppressed by bureaucracy. A spokesperson for the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment has told Guardian Australia that the National Parks and Wildlife Service carried out hazard reduction activities across more than 139,000ha in 2018 and 2019. The NPWS had a hazard reduction target to treat 680,000ha of parks and reserves in the five years from 2011, which the spokesperson said it had exceeded. The spokesperson added: “Hazard reduction is just one way of preparing for bushfires – it doesn’t remove the threat of fire.” Bradstock says: “In New South Wales, hazard reduction work is governed by policies that are set by coordinating committee chaired by the Rural Fire Service. They bring together all players – with representatives from farmers, environment groups and governments. “Hazard reduction work has increased because of increased funding to the RFS and to national parks. There has been more carried out in recent years than in previous decades.” The Public Service Association has also attacked the NSW government for what it said was a “35% cut to fire-trained positions” in national parks. Its acting general secretary, Troy Wright, said on Tuesday: “It is the Nationals who hold the purse string. Rather than funding the NPWS properly so that they can undertake strategic reductions they have crippled them with massive budget cuts and devastating restructures.” The NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, told Guardian Australia that NPWS had 1,665 full time equivalent staff, a rise of 144 since 2017. Since 2011, Kean said the NSW government had increased the number of NPWS firefighters from 1,050 to 1,226. Some 400 NPWS staff were out fighting fires. He says: “They are risking their lives to keep the community safe. Many are fighting fires that are not on park, but to protect people and property.” He says NPWS undertakes 75% of all hazard reduction in the state, adding that last season, NPWS undertook 137,500 hectares of prescribed burns, which was above its target of 135,000 hectares. Bradstock says research “overwhelmingly” demonstrates that creating a 40- to 50-metre fuel break around a house can give it a much greater chance of surviving fires. He says property holders are largely free to carry out these activities themselves without needing to seek permits. “That vegetation clearance is one of the most effective things to do to mitigate risk.” Bradstock says there is often confusion around the term “backburning” which is only done while fires are burning and is not considered a hazard reduction activity. A separate fire is lit “back against the wind” to suppress the fuel load in the direction a bushfire is travelling, but firefighters are cautious as these fires can also get out of control when conditions are severe. There will always be trade-offs between budgets, the amount of hazard reduction that can be carried out, and the environmental and social impacts of burning or removing trees and vegetation. Bradstock says that no fire authority has an infinite budget and he says that in NSW, the hazard reduction work had reached “the limits of its practical capacity”. “Hazard reduction will play a role, but as the weather gets worse, our research shows its effectiveness diminishes and we will have to introduce other means – maybe more money to clear the edges around developments, but it comes back to return on investment.” He says authorities are also now having to contend with another reality – that prescribed burning creates smoke, “and we now know that bushfire smoke kills people”. He says hazard reduction burns close to major cities such as Sydney had limits because “we end up doing fuel reduction to save lives, but it can also be taking lives” though smoke inhalation. • Open thread: tell us how you’re affected by the fires"
"We’re taught that evolution is all about “survival of the fittest”. But that’s not always the case. In fact, sometimes evolution can be the result of a lucky animal finding “any port in a storm”. And the finding that Luzon, an island in the Philippines, has the greatest concentration of unique mammals in the world – even more than Madagascar – is the perfect example. Islands are often examples of an evolutionary free for all, where a newly-introduced species may find itself in the perfect situation, whether that’s a new and different type of habitat and resources or even a complete lack of competitors and predators. Being introduced to an island ecosystem can turn a rather mediocre mainland species into a weird and wonderful new creation.  Examples of species found on one island and nowhere else (known as island endemics) can be found almost anywhere we look. The lemurs on Madagascar are found nowhere else on Earth, the Galapagos islands are home to flightless cormorants and aquatic iguanas and there are even quirky examples of island species from across the British Isles such as the Scilly shrew or the Orkney vole.  However, islands are not just a melting pot for new species – they’re also responsible for some rather strange adaptations, often allowing species to develop physically in ways that we would never expect to see in their mainland counterparts. This is maybe best shown by the “island rule” which, when all the complicated bits are stripped away, means that small species become big and big species become small.  For proof of this, just look at the dwarf elephants which once lived in the Mediterranean or even dwarf humans in Indonesia. At the other end of the scale, consider how tortoises from Madagascar and Ecuador washed up in the Seychelles and the Galapagos respectively and thrived as giants. It seems islands are nature’s evolutionary laboratories, the places where natural selection runs wild. But even between islands, some are more spectacular than others. Scientists from the Field Museum in Chicago have just published a study where they looked for the world’s greatest concentration of unique mammal species. It turns out that Luzon, the largest island in the Philippines, holds this honourable prize. Their 15-year study concluded that out of 56 species of mammals (not including bats) on the island, a staggering 52 were found to be endemic. With 93% of its non-flying mammals found nowhere else on Earth, Luzon is a biological treasure trove. But if all islands are special for the development and emergence of new species, then what makes Luzon more special? The team puts it down to the island’s size – at more than 40,000 square miles, it’s larger than Cuba or Iceland – and because it has never been connected to the mainland.  With lots of space (in different habitats) and across lots of time, Luzon has given any colonising animals just the right ingredients to adapt and evolve into new species. For animals that swam across from other islands or were swept over on rafts of mangroves or palm trees, it was the perfect opportunity not only to adapt into new species themselves but then for these new species to diversify into yet more species.  Even within this one island, high, forest-covered mountains then acted as “sky islands” – separate ecosystems cut off from the land below, with different evolutionary pressures. This in turn increased the likelihood for even further species diversity. From unusual mice that mainly hunt and eat earthworms, to other rodents with long elegant whiskers stretching the entire length of their bodies, Luzon is an incredible example of island evolution. Sadly, the fragile nature of these ecosystems often means island species are often threatened with extinction. In the Galapagos, introduced goats outcompete tortoises for food, while snakes accidentally taken to Guam, where the birds had never seen a snake before, are destroying the fine balance of island ecosystems there. With pollution and hunting and the ever-increasing threat of climate change all also taking their toll, maybe nowhere are conservation efforts needed more than when dealing with unique island species."
"After 12 years of planning and testing, Solar Impulse has finally completed its epic voyage around the world. The solar-powered plane first set off from Abu Dhabi 16 months ago, and it has since travelled some 25,000 miles (40,000km) over 17 gruelling legs – all without using a single drop of fuel. Solar Impulse is no ordinary aircraft – it has the span of a Boeing 747 but weighs little more than a family car. Covering these huge carbon-fibre composite wings are more than 17,000 solar cells, which provide energy for its four propellers during the day, while also charging four lithium batteries which provide power during the night. To save weight, the unpressurised cabin has just enough room for one pilot, no bigger than the front of a typical car. For up to five days and nights the pilots, Andre Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard have to do everything in this confined space. Fly, eat, sleep (just 20 minutes at a time) and wash. In theory, Solar Impulse could fly continuously for many months, but the tiny cockpit means it must land to swap pilots after each leg. As part of their trip they have broken several world records including the longest continuous flight of any solo fixed wing aircraft – almost 118 hours. But after this epic voyage, the real question is what will be the legacy of Solar Impulse? Are we likely to see 747s with solar cells anytime soon? The short answer is unfortunately no.  Solar Impulse required all those solar cells and four batteries (weighing a quarter of the whole aircraft) just to power propellers that generate around 70 horsepower, similar to a family car. To put this in perspective, the engines on a Boeing 747 have the equivalent power of more than 1,000 cars. The number of solar cells and more importantly the number of batteries to generate and store this energy makes such a plane unfeasible with current technology. However, while a large-scale solar plane is unlikely to be seen, electric or hybrid electric planes have taken a step forward with the recent announcement of the NASA X-57 all-electric plane. Announced by NASA head Charles Bolden as the first of a new series of X-planes, this plane is powered by an array of 14 small propellers on the leading edge of the wing, promising a five-fold reduction in the energy required for a small plane to cruise at 175mph. Such a design would also mean significant reductions in the aircraft noise and pollution.  While the X-57 isn’t a large-scale commercial aircraft, the technology developed in the project could well make it into hybrid electric planes in the not too distant future, especially with the current rate of battery technology development. Solar Impulse’s most visible legacy is likely to be in the domestic power market, as any electric car or plane is only as clean as the power source that generates that electricity in the first place. Solar Impulse has helped to raise the profile of solar power and this is likely to make people consider how they can do their bit to use cleaner energy. This took a major step forward with the news that Tesla is soon to fully release its Powerwall rechargeable battery unit – a battery unit that charges using electricity generated from solar panels, which can then be used in the evening or when there has been too little sun. It has the potential to revolutionise both commercial and personal energy use. While there are other competitors the appeal of the Tesla brand is likely to take solar power to a level not seen before. The pioneering spirit of Borschberg and Piccard may see their legacy in electric planes or domestic solar energy, but perhaps its biggest influence will be on the minds of young people still unsure of their future. The world is crying out for more engineers and scientists, and projects such as Solar Impulse show how exciting science and engineering can be. In the same way that Apple’s iPad and Siri are a throw-back to the legacy of Star Trek, the planes we fly in 40 or 50 years may have their origin in projects like Solar Impulse."

“Seasonal ban on wood burning stoves thinkable”
First, soon humans will have to say good bye to one of their oldest friends: an open fire. Germany’s version of the EPA, the Umweltbundesamt (UBA), is moving the strictly regulate emissions of fine particulates from wood burning stoves and fireplaces.
UBA President Maria Krautzberger on Tuesday announced that she plans to implement stricter limits for fine particulate emissions in 2015, even going so far as to announce: “Theoretically a seasonal ban on wood stoves is thinkable.”
The dark lines show fine particulate emissions by traffic, the greenish lines show emissions for different types of burning wood in kilotonnes annually. (Source: UBA)
Ms. Krautzberger insists the measures are necessary because: “The health burdens on the citizens from fine particulates and NO2 are too great.” The UBA report states that “Fine particulates can cause inflammation of the respiratory system and increase the risk of heart attacks.”
Absolute rubbish. We are talking about banning a fundamental pleasure in exchange for a health improvement that is statistically imperceptible.
I’ve been living in Germany over 20 years and I can tell anyone that the air even in urban areas in Germany is pretty darn clean by any standard. This is needless government oppression and a restriction of a fundamental pleasure that humans have enjoyed for a hundreds of thousands of years: the direct warmth of an open fire. Green wackoism is out of control.

Secondly, if that weren’t intrusion enough, the EU is going after vacuum cleaners. They aren’t energy-efficient enough, they say, and they are simply wasting energy.
Along with a number of media outlets, the online derfflinger.de is reporting that if you want to buy a higher-powered vacuum cleaner, you’d better hurry up.
Beginning September 2014 a new EU Ecodesign Directive goes into effect. In the future it will need to don the EU Energy label and fulfill more stringent minimum requirements with regards to energy efficiency. The practical household appliance will be throttled down and allowed to have a maximum rated power of 1600 Watts. Beginning September 2017 only 900 watts will be allowed.”
Get ready to be sucking and licking the floor yourself shortly thereafter.
Critics have blasted the new regulation, noting that people will end up spending more time doing the chore will a small appliance to get the same result, and thus save little energy in total, if any at all.
Recall that electricity is product that humans purchase and then own, and thus they alone should decide how to use the product. Not so in Europe. Not only are European citizens being forced to pay an exorbitant price for their electricity today, but they are also being told how, when and how much to use – and for what.
The right of ownership and private property is rapidly being eroded.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDaniel Wetzel of the German online flagship daily Die Welt here tells readers the real reason why Chancellor Angela Merkel is sticking to the “senseless” and now impossible to reach CO2 emissions reduction target of 40% for Germany by 2020:
She can sit back and enjoy watching her coalition partner SPD ministers rip themselves apart trying to implement it.”
Already we are seeing a nasty collision developing between Merkel’s Economics Minister, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, who calls the shutting down of coal power plnats an illusion, and Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks, who insists that the coal power plants need to be shut down rapidly. Both ministers are SPD socialists.
Wetzel writes: “The traditional confrontation between the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Economics is taking on absurd traits.”
Now that both of these ministries are run by members of the coalition partner SPD, it is hardly possible for the SPD party to achieve any sense of unity – strife is inevitable. Merkel is skillfully implementing a “divide and conquer” strategy.
Wetzel writes there is virtually no chance Germany will reach the 40% reduction target, citing McKinsey:
Experts of McKinsey Consulting and other institutes have made calculations for the German government showing that the chances reaching these extremely ambitious reduction targets are close to zero.”
Die Welt says it has obtained a government list of 28 power plants that would need to be shut down in order to achieve the 40% target.

The problem is that closing these plants would mean the gutting out of some power companies, such as North Rhine Westphalia power giant RWE. North Rhine Westphalia is Germany’s most polpulated state and is currently governed by a coalition led by the SPD, who are in no hurry to anger the powerful trade unions. Read here.
Also a government move ordering the early closure of power plants would lead to lawsuits by power companies, who would demand billions in compensatory damages. Economics Minister Gabriel not only sees little technical and environmental sense in shutting down the power plants, but also thinks the political risks are too high. Die Welt writes:
Such an approach would also endanger the power supply and increase the prices of power for industry.
Thus in any case it remains open as to how the German government wants to reach its 40 percent CO2 reduction target. […] The 40% target as mere ‘political symbolism” or ‘a fetish’ is increasingly the word among ministry circles.”
Die Welt adds that the 40% reduction target was established in 2007, a time of ambitious aims. But since then the European Emissions Trading scheme has adopted new rules that apply to Europe, and not to individual countries. Also Germany abruptly mothballed a number of older nuclear power plants in the wake of the Fukushima accident, thus radically altering the overall power and policy landscape.
Die Welt quotes Jürgen Hacker, Chairman of the German Association for Emissions Trading and Climate Protection (BVEK):
The national German policy no longer has any direct influence on the emissions of German plants, as they are subject to emissions trading. It is thus pure nonsense to want to include them in a national German climate protection target.”

"Is it pure arrogance that makes laypeople think they know better than scientists who have spent their lives painstakingly researching an issue? Or a desperate insecurity that makes them unable to stand the respect accorded to experts? These questions swirled round Climategate: Science of a Scandal (BBC Four) as it anatomised the events of 10 years ago, when an anonymous hacker stole and shared thousands of emails between scientists at the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia. They were seized on by assorted sceptics and deniers and used to cast doubt on climate change and global warming, helped by an uncritical media that leaned into the storm.  For fossil fuel companies and their ilk, the timing was propitious. The emails were released just as scientific consensus on the threat posed by global warming was filtering through to public consciousness and beginning to take root. The story began a few years before, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had – by collating historical and contemporary temperature data from around the globe – highlighted the iconic “hockey stick” graph. Its easily understandable depiction of 1,000 years of relatively stable temperatures (the long handle of the stick) veering sharply upwards from the industrial age onwards (the blade) did much to impress the threat of global warming on the collective mind. Then Steve McIntyre, who worked in the fossil fuel industry, decided the graph was suspect and asked Phil Jones, the director of the CRU – a key contributor to the hockey stick study – to provide him with the data behind it. Prof Jones initially agreed (“He gave me much more than I was expecting,” noted McIntyre here). But, as the requests became more frequent, he stopped handing over data, because it wasn’t truly the CRU’s to give and he feared antagonising its suppliers. A stream of freedom of information requests followed, and even more when McIntyre mobilised his blog followers to apply en masse. After that came the hack. By cherrypicking phrases from the e-mountain of correspondence, opponents undid much of the persuasive work that had been done. Amid the onslaught from sceptics and deniers, the scientists, wholly unused to such assaults, struggled to get their rebuttals across. One email from Jones caused the most excitement. The phrase “Use Mike’s nature trick to hide the decline” was heralded as proof of a conspiracy to deceive the world about global warming. In fact, his email was discussing how to exclude a well-known set of anomalous tree-ring results that, unlike all other data, purported to show a decline in temperature, so as not to distort the overall picture. “Trick” in statistician-speak basically means “neatest, best way to do something”. Deniers and the media went after Jones to the extent that he can still barely bring himself to talk about it. His former colleague Tim Osborn is likewise unable to suppress tears when he remembers the death threats and anonymous promises “to visit your wife and children”. It is a story we are now depressingly familiar with, and it induces the same incredulous rage. Beyond the trolls, who have their own revolting pathology, who are these people who feel justified to try to undo a life’s work? Who feel able to set themselves up in judgment? What have they added to the sum of human knowledge? The media’s role was examined, though not thoroughly enough. We saw multiple clips of incompetent spokespeople being presented as if they were of equal standing to the scientists under attack or their representatives, and forever whipping up the furore further rather than digging down into the facts. The question of what truly constitutes balance in programmes, of course, has become all the more pertinent in the years since, as our major broadcasters seem to have accepted that it equates to equal air time for all, however unqualified or small a group they represent. Two independent inquiries and a government select committee exonerated the CRU of all the accusations hurled at it. “There is no evidence of any deliberate scientific malpractice … The rigour and honesty of the scientists is not in doubt.” On the 10th anniversary of Climategate, it would have been nice to see the rigour and honesty of their accusers interrogated more closely, but at least the scientists finally got to tell their side of the story. The scandal almost certainly contributed to the lack of success of the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference that followed. Fossil fuel industry-funded researchers have since carried out their own studies on the hockey stick data. They yielded precisely the same results as the original. The injustice still burns, along with the world."

"It’s not just climate protesters who powerful voices are trying to silence in Australia, it’s anyone who wants to talk about the bigger-picture causes to the problems Australia is facing. In modern Australia it has become “inappropriate” to talk about why our rivers are running out of water, why our aged care centres are running out of food and nappies, and why our fire brigades are running out of firetrucks. But it’s impossible to solve problems when you can’t talk about the underlying causes. When people crash their car going around a tight bend we can sympathise with their families while discussing whether speed, fatigue, alcohol or poor road design were to blame. It’s not impossible to be sensitive to victims and serious about the cause at the same time. Climate change makes bushfires worse. Even if we catch an arsonist who lights a fire, the fact is the fires they light will burn further and faster than they would have if the world had burned less coal, and the temperature was lower than we have made it. With the same amount of effort into managing fuel loads and cutting firebreaks, a fire lit by an arsonist will spread further today than it would have in past decades. The embers from hotter fires, moving across drier ground, can spark new fires further away from the firefront than they once did. And as climate change ramps up the intensity of bushfires in Australia, we will need to put in a lot more resources simply to hold the amount of fire damage constant over time. Experienced firefighters have tried to tell the prime minister, but he literally will not listen. If we can’t talk about the underlying reasons why bushfires are becoming more frequent, we can’t possibly talk about how to manage either the fires Australia is experiencing today or the far worse ones we will experience in the decades to come.Plenty of sick people refuse to go to the doctor for fear of hearing they need to change their lifestyle. Such denial is understandable for individuals but it is inexcusable for those elected to protect us. The evidence that climate change makes bushfires worse is as clear as the evidence that burning fossil fuels causes climate change. The Australia Institute summarised the science  in 2006. But in Australia powerful people don’t need evidence to get in their way. They have the right to block their ears and the right to shout down their critics. In turn, it comes as no surprise that many of the loudest voices denying the link between climate change and catastrophic bushfires are the same voices that deny, or diminish, the link between burning coal and climate change. Barnaby Joyce isn’t shy about politicising bushfires. He has been quick to blame those who would do more to reduce emissions for causing the current fires. After blaming non-existent Green governments for everything from a lack of dams to blocked roads, Joyce declared: “So many of the practicalities of fighting a fire and managing it have been stymied by the Greens.” In a democracy, power is the ability to talk crap and get away with it. Baseless attacks on climate science by conservative politicians and commentators make clear where the power lies in Australia. Messenger shooting is so widespread, and the shots fly overwhelmingly in the one direction, that when Jo Evans, a deputy secretary of the Department of Environment, tiptoed around whether climate trends were getting better or worse to a Senate committee, there was no outrage and virtually no coverage. But when Adam Bandt dared to mention the link between climate change and catastrophic bushfires, the full weight of the conservative commentariat moved rapidly to attack him and others who dared link cause with effect. Australia is one of the richest countries in the world and, if we wanted to put more resources into reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the number of firefighting vehicles or even paying volunteers to fight our fires, there is nothing to stop us doing that. Except that we have repeatedly elected governments with a preference for cutting taxes over investing in solutions. But just as we can’t talk about how climate change makes bushfires worse, we aren’t supposed to talk about how Australia’s choice to be one of the lower-taxed developed countries in the world comes at the cost of us having some of the most poorly funded public services in the developed world. Similarly, while it’s considered responsible to have royal commissions into the failure of the “markets” we have created for water, aged care and financial services, it is crazy talk to suggest we need to have a royal commission into the complex mess that is the last 20 years of privatisation and deregulation of government services. There aren’t always simple answers to complex problems, and it’s not just OK, but essential, that we vigorously debate the veracity of evidence, ideas and priorities. But Australia isn’t having vigorous debates, it’s not even having vicious debates. On the big issues there is plenty of vicious but absolutely no debate. Australia is governed by people who refuse to listen to inconvenient evidence and who attack their opponents instead of debating them with opposing ideas. The last election suggests such a combination of apathy and confidence is a successful electoral strategy. But, as this week’s fires show, denial is no substitute for preparation when it comes to natural disasters. Denying the truth doesn’t change the facts. • Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute"
"National Galleries Scotland (NGS) has become the latest arts organisation to end links to BP, citing its “responsibility to do all we can to address the climate emergency”. It said on Monday that the 2019 BP Portrait Award exhibition opening at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh on 7 December would be the last time it would take place there in its present form.  The announcement increases pressure on the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) in London to end one of the UK’s longest art prize sponsorships. NGS said in a statement: “At the National Galleries of Scotland we recognise that we have a responsibility to do all we can to address the climate emergency. For many people, the association of this competition with BP is seen as being at odds with that aim. “Therefore, after due consideration, the trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland have decided that this will be the last time that the galleries will host this exhibition in its present form.” The decision comes nearly four years after Tate and the Edinburgh international festival announced they were ending long-running sponsorship partnerships with the petroleum firm. Campaigners had hoped that would quickly lead to the termination of all BP’s arts sponsorship deals. That did not happen and regular protests continued at the big four recipients of BP money: the NPG, the British Museum, the Royal Opera House and the Royal Shakespeare Company. In October the RSC broke ranks and announced it was ending its deal with BP two years early, citing pressure from young people. BP expressed disappointment at that decision and said everyone needed to work together to achieve a low-carbon future. “Ironically, the increasing polarisation of debate, and attempts to exclude companies committed to making real progress, is exactly what is not needed,” it said. The NPG is due to host what would be the 31st BP Portrait Award next year, with the closing date for entries advertised as 11 December. It has been complicated because the NPG’s building will close for nearly three years from July, when it traditionally hosts the prize exhibition. Observers see that as an opportunity to end the sponsorship. The gallery said it was considering options for the prize."
"George Smiley finally gets his man at the end of John le Carré’s Karla trilogy, but is far from jubilant as the Soviet spymaster defects from East to West Berlin. Reminded by a colleague that he has won his cold war battle, Smiley replies: “Did I? Yes. Yes, well, I suppose I did.” Smiley’s world-weariness was notable by its absence when the west finally claimed victory in the cold war 30 years ago this week. The Berlin Wall was a symbol of oppression. Its demolition was a euphoric moment.  But everything was black and white back then. Freedom had triumphed over tyranny. Washington had defeated Moscow. The market would extend into parts of the world where it had been off limits. The power of a united Germany would be diluted by a new pan-European currency. Victory for a certain set of American-inspired principles meant ideological conflict was at an end. The demolition of the Berlin Wall marked not just the end of history, but the end of geography and the end of politics as well. That was the theory. But three decades on, Le Carré’s caution appears to be warranted.  Yes, there have been things to welcome. The liberation of eastern Europe is one. The lifting of well over a billion people out of abject poverty is another. New products that have enriched people’s lives, such as smartphones, are a third. The idea that everything about globalisation sucks simply replaces the fallacy that the market can solve everything with the fallacy that markets never work anywhere. That said, the key assumptions of late 1989 have been found wanting. To the extent that there was a golden age of globalisation, it lasted a mere dozen years, from the raising of the iron curtain to 2001, when China was admitted to the World Trade Organization. During that period, the former Soviet Union was given free-market shock treatment, India dialled back on protectionism, and Beijing put out the welcome mat for western multinationals. It seemed a win-win game: China attacked poverty by moving people from the country into better-paid jobs in the cities; consumers in the west found that imported TVs, clothes and toys became cheaper. What’s more, downward pressure on the cost of living meant interest rates fell as well, making it cheaper to get a mortgage. House prices spiralled, but inflation stayed low. Cracks eventually started to appear. For workers in the west, the cold war had offered two benefits. First, the existence of a rival to capitalism meant employers and governments had to offer higher wages and more generous welfare systems, or risk a popular backlash. Second, the fact that countries containing more than half the world’s population were off limits to the free market meant there was only limited scope for outsourcing jobs to countries where labour costs were considerably lower. These restraints were removed in the 1990s, with predictable results. A more aggressive approach was taken towards welfare, manufacturing jobs migrated from west to east, and any remaining controls on the movement of capital were removed. The 1990s saw the unlearning of the lessons of the 1930s, namely that uncaged finance was a dangerous beast, and that it was a good idea if workers could afford to buy the goods and services they were producing without sinking into debt. After a series of localised scares, the global financial system imploded in 2008. From the deep recession that followed there has been no meaningful recovery. Clearly, the world in 2019 is not the one envisaged in the heady days of 1989. For a start, it is not unipolar. Russia under Vladimir Putin is a more serious threat than the Soviet Union was in its dog days, under Mikhail Gorbachev. Most of the decline in poverty since 1990 has occurred in China, which operates a form of totalitarian capitalism to rival the free-market US model. Both variants seem to have lost their mojo: US-style capitalism cannot seem to tolerate even modest increases in interest rates; Chinese-style capitalism flounders in the absence of state investment and easy credit. Instead of the rugged free market, we have zombie capitalism. A decade of flatlining living standards has made voters far more questioning about the societies they live in. When they hear politicians say that globalisation is an irresistible force that cannot be reversed, they ask: why? When they are told that artificial intelligence will revolutionise the world of work, they ask: for whose benefit? Those who took the sledgehammers to the Berlin Wall believed that the future would be better than the past, and for them it was. There are plenty of people in developing countries – especially in Asia – who think the same way today. But in the west, faith in progress is far less evident than it was before 2008. The upshot of all this is that free-market capitalism again faces an ideological challenge, and one that was not envisaged 30 years ago. The cold war was won because western capitalism proved better than communism at delivering goods for consumers. The events of 30 years ago created an ideological vacuum that is being filled not by Chinese-style capitalism but by environmentalism, a creed that does not accept the basic “more is better” tenet of capitalism. On the contrary, it says that adherence to this belief is killing the planet. Which is why it poses more of a threat than the real Karlas ever did. • Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWikipedia editor William Connelley displayed his true colors and confirmed the reason why Wikipedia is an unreliable source of information when it comes to climate science: extreme bias by editors.
Ironically, Mr. Revisionist himself complained yesterday in a reader comment at NTZ about one of his other comments being delayed here at NTZ, demanding to know why his childish taunting of distinguished climate scientist Lennart Bengtsson was being held up (spam filter).
Sorry, but I need to sleep too, and so sometimes reader comments caught in the filter have to wait till morning.
Naturally, we do not want the king of climate science revisionism to get the feeling that he himself is being censored, and so I’ve decided to upgrade his comment to a post as a gesture of good will:

Mr. Connelly of course is just being plain childish on the current issue. Lennart Bengtsson, former director of the prestigious Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) in Hamburg, is hardly a meek man who has a history of being “someone who fades easily”. Rather he is someone who has a way of always standing out:
1986: Julius von Hann Gold Medal of the Austrian Society for Meteorology
1990: Körber Prize for European Science (together with Bert Bolin and Klaus Ferdinand Hasselmann)
1996: Milutin Milanković Medal of the European Geophysical Society (EGU)
1998: Environmental Prize of the Bundesstiftung Umwelt as a member of the working group Climate Research of the MPI-M
2005: Descartes-Prize as a member of the CECA (climate and environmental change in the Arctic) working group (together with Leonid Bobylew and Ola M. Johannessen)
2006: International Meteorological Organization (IMO) Prize of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
2007: Rossby Prize of the Swedish Geophysical Society (SGS)
2009: Alfred Wegener Medal
I believe we haven’t heard the last of Bengtsson by any means.
Finally, I’d be the last to hold back such a comment as that made by Connelley above because it clearly reveals and confirms everything we’ve always suspected of many in the alarmist camp and what is really behind Bengtsson’s resignation. Draw your own conclusions.

"Oysters were abundant in the waters around the Dornoch Firth in the north-east of Scotland from 10,000 years ago. But overfishing decimated stocks in the late 19th century and the shellfish became extinct. Now, thanks to a groundbreaking environmental project, the local population is witnessing the reappearance of the native mollusc. May saw the official return of European oysters to Scotland’s Highland coastal waters after a century’s absence. The Dornoch Environmental Enhancement Project (DEEP) is an ambitious project led by Heriot-Watt University, Glenmorangie Distillery (on the banks of the Firth at Tain), and the Marine Conservation Society. Its vision is to restore long-lost oyster reefs to the marine protected area of the Dornoch Firth, enhance biodiversity and act in tandem with a newly commissioned anaerobic digestion (AD) plant built by Glenmorangie on its site to help purify the waters of the Firth. This new £5m AD plant will treat the distillery’s pot ale (the solids that remain after primary distillation), spent lees (residue from the spirit distillation), and washing water (the waste water used when cleaning the mash tun and washbacks.  Inside, bacteria break down the organic waste fed to them in the absence of oxygen – the anaerobic digestion process. The treatment process has a capacity of 2,500 cubic metres – the equivalent of eight days of organic load (that is, the remains of the barley) from the distillery.  Out of the reactor come three by-products: water, a copper-rich sludge and bio-gas. The water and sludge are separated by a complex filtration system, and the resulting high-quality, filtered water is returned to the Dornoch Firth. This is measured in chemical oxygen demand, an index of the effect the wastewater will have on the environment.  The distillery currently falls within its Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) licence to discharge 350 cubic metres per day of suspended solids (that is, the fine organic “soup” left over from the barley) into the sea. But the new anaerobic digestion plant will clean 95% of this waste. The bio-gas process creates steam that will help power the distillery, reducing reliance on fossil fuels by 15%. Meanwhile, the sludge, which contains copper is to be passed to local barley farmers who are reliant on fertilisers on land that is naturally copper deficient. The remaining 5% of the chemical oxygen demand will then be taken care of by the oysters which are natural bio-filters – for a neat demonstration, watch this video on plankton clearance (around 12:30 minutes in). Within ten years, established oyster reefs will comfortably soak up this remaining 5% because they ingest plankton and other matter, build organics and nutrients into their tissues and lock away sediments on the seabed. Today, remaining wild populations of oysters are formally recognised as in need of protection throughout Atlantic Europe. The return of native oysters to the Dornoch Firth for the first time in more than 100 years will enrich protected marine ecosystems of international importance. Shellfish beds create complex physical structures on the seabed and, by filtering water, they concentrate food for other species on the seabed in the form of faeces and partly digested material. The flow of food to the seabed drives rich biodiversity and can create nursery habitats for others species. Of course, because of their rarity, we have to look to other shellfish-dominated habitats in similar environments to understand how this might work in restored European oyster beds. Similar stories have emerged for the American oyster species too, including the soak up of nutrients that would otherwise fertilise the growth of algae in the water. So the DEEP project is casting far wider restoration possibilities in Europe, and beyond that could deliver improved water quality and biodiversity conservation benefits. There are water-quality challenges in many coastal water bodies today, from land-based use of fertilisers in agriculture to human waste. Modern water management techniques have undoubtedly made great improvements, but human populations are growing, and pressures and costs of water management are increasing. In Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, the American species of oyster once filtered the whole water body in a mater of days, so restoration programmes there can show notable environmental improvements.  The DEEP project has shown oysters can successfully re-establish in the Dornoch Firth and the team is now testing their survival and growth with a view to fully restoring the former oyster habitat. This kind of nature conservation project is also a win for the distillery on several levels and the DEEP project demonstrates its investment in proper, sustained stewardship of the natural surrounding environment. Something that in turn can help its brand.  Putting oysters back into a system like the Dornoch Firth will take time (and appropriate licences) because the habitats will need time to mature and oyster populations will require a concerted effort to boost them back to a realistic size. This means long-term thinking and commitment, which happily comes naturally to a company whose products takes a minimum of ten years to produce. For now, the DEEP project has recovered a forgotten past where oyster beds were once plentiful, and made possible a future where the return of oysters to the east Highland coastline means sustaining a healthy marine environment in a natural way."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Global Warming Policy Foundation recently announced that Professor Fritz Vahrenholt is joining its Academic Advisory Council. Early this year prominent meteorologist Prof. Lennart Bengtsson had also announced his membership, but later resigned amid a backlash from activist warmist scientists.
The Council is composed of scientists, economists and other experts who provide the GWPF with timely scientific, economic and policy advice. It reviews and evaluates new GWPF reports and papers, explores future research projects and makes recommendations on issues related to climate research and policy. Other distinguished scientist members of the GWPF Academic Advisory Council include Robert Carter, Freeman Dyson, Christopher Essex, William Happer, Richard Lindzen, Ross McKitrick, Ian Plimer, Paul Reiter, Nir Shaviv, Henrik Svensmark, Richard Tol and others.
Professor Fritz Vahrenholt was one of the founders of the environmental movement in Germany. In the 1980s his bestseller Seveso ist überall (Seveso is everywhere) triggered a nationwide debate which led to a fundamental reorientation of the chemical industry towards sustainable development.
NTZ inquired with Prof Vahrenholt, asking why he had joined the GWPF Council:
I very much appreciate Lord Lawson who in the GWPF has surrounded himself with scientists who are not prepared to alter scientific findings to suit the political mainstream.”
On the political and academic pressures being applied on dissenters, Prof Vahrenolt wrote in his e-mail response:

The socio-political pressure on those who refuse to hop onto the bandwagon of alarmism is immense. Scientists who reject the simplistic formula of Prof. Schellnhuber (there is a linear relationship between CO2 and temperature change) must create a platform to act as a counter-weight against faulty conclusions in science and politics.”
When asked about where he sees global warming science discussion is heading.
The real climate development over the coming years will unleash the discourse over the dead-ends of climate policy.”
As Vahrenholt shows, dissenting platforms are indeed forming while the real data trends act to rapidly undermine mainstream climate science and global warming policy. It’s only a matter of time.
Dr Vahrenholt holds a PhD in chemistry and is Honorary Professor at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Hamburg. Since 1969 he has been a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). From 1976 until 1997 he served in several public positions with environmental agencies such as the Federal Environment Agency, the Hessian Ministry of Environment and as Deputy Environment Minister and Senator of the City of Hamburg. He then held top management positions in the renewable energy industry. Vahrenholt is a member of the Germany Academy of Technical Sciences and the Senate of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. His 2012 book The Neglected Sun sparked a broad public discussion in Germany about the dogmatism in climate science. He is currently the Chairman of the German Wildlife Trust.

"If there is one lesson of British politics of recent years, it is that politicians underestimate the public’s appetite for change at their peril. So the Tories may yet come to regret dedicating the weekend to promoting a dodgy dossier from the Conservative research department that grossly overstated Labour’s spending plans. The Conservatives claim that Labour’s plans will cost the public purse an additional £1.2tn during the next parliament. It is designed to generate “sticker shock” – to be a number that fixes in the public consciousness as a sign that Labour cannot be trusted with the economy. The dossier is not a serious attempt at public policy analysis but a political hatchet job with a calculator. No matter that Labour is yet to agree or publish its 2019 manifesto. The Tories are always happy to speculate wildly – especially when a pliant rightwing press are unwilling to pick apart their claims.  Meanwhile, the chancellor has promised that under a Conservative government public investment will not exceed 3% of national income. That is the current average of OECD countries (the Paris-based club of developed states) and below the G7 average of 3.5%. But investment is a good thing – it is the engine of economic growth – and so it is utterly bizarre to promise to artificially limit it. Yet after a decade of austerity, perhaps it is little surprise that the summit of ambition for the Tories is to be no better than average. In fact, Britain has suffered from chronic under-investment for the past four decades. Since Thatcher came to power in 1979, public investment has never exceeded the OECD average and, taken together with private investment, we lag well behind other countries. According to the Bank of England, nine-tenths of Britain’s economic growth comes from consumption, rather than investment, which is financed by rising household borrowing against inflated house prices. It is as unsustainable as it sounds. What’s more, most people know from their own experiences that Britain does not invest enough. We see it in crumbling hospitals and in antiquated railways, in cramped classrooms and congested roads. So while a figure like £1.2tn is so unfathomably large as to be meaningless, what it does do is signal to the public that Labour represents a decisive break with the past. When the public are hungry for real change, it might just prove to be an electoral asset. By its very nature, investment is a commitment to the future – and that future is imperilled by climate breakdown. There surely cannot be a stronger case for investment than the survival of the planet. Given the unprecedented scale of the crisis, it is absurd to think that what the country needs is yet more of the same. Indeed, sustaining the broken status quo as we hurtle towards disaster is a peculiar form of nihilistic radicalism. As we enter the 2020s, it is well past time to abandon the discredited orthodoxy of the 1980s. As we have seen this year, a whole new generation has awoken to politics as a result of the climate crisis – from Extinction Rebellion to the student climate strikers. These young people are unlikely to be won over by arguments that originate from an era before they were born, having come of age in the wake of the financial crisis that showed the old economic order had collapsed in all but name. They won’t be persuaded that inaction on the climate crisis is preferable to modest increases in marginal tax rates for the already well-off of their parents’ generation. And after all the blows to trust in politics in the 21st century – from the Iraq war to MPs’ expenses to austerity to tuition fees to the Brexit campaign – they certainly won’t be persuaded by a dodgy dossier peddled by newspapers that a declining number of their parents read. • Tom Kibasi is a writer and researcher on politics and economics.

"Veneto’s regional council rejected a plan to combat climate change minutes before its offices on the Grand Canal, in Venice, were flooded, it has emerged as the city continues to battle high water levels. Venice has been hit by recurrent flooding since Tuesday, with 70% of the lagoon city engulfed on Friday morning as the acqua alta, or high water, level reached 1.54 metres amid heavy downpours.  On Tuesday night, as Veneto councillors were debating the climate emergency in Ferro Fini Palace, Venice experienced its worst flooding since 1966. Politicians from the regional council’s majority rightwing parties: the League, Brothers of Italy and Forza Italia, rejected amendments to fight the climate crisis in the 2020 budget that were proposed by the centre-left Democratic party. Sharing pictures of the room as water entered, Andrea Zanoni, the Democratic party’s deputy chairman of the council’s environment committee, wrote on Facebook: “Ironically, the chamber was flooded two minutes after the majority parties rejected our proposals to tackle climate change.” Zanoni, a green campaigner, said the proposals included measures to fund renewable energy sources, replace diesel buses with less polluting vehicles, scrap polluting stoves and reduce plastic use. “There is no more meaningful image than a chamber being flooded, causing the representatives of the Venetian people to flee, to illustrate all the inconsistency and political nullity of a current miserable administrative led by the League, Brothers of Italy and Forza Italia,” he added. Zanoni took particular aim at Luca Zaia, the Veneto president and League politician, for presenting a budget that contained “no concrete plan to tackle climate change”. Zaia has described the Venice flooding, which has killed two people, as “an apocalyptic disaster”. “Venice has been tortured, but there are also other parts of the Veneto region besides Venice,” he said on Wednesday. In a statement to CNN, Roberto Ciambetti, the council’s president and League member, rebuffed the criticism. “Beyond propaganda and deceptive reading, we are voting [for] a regional budget that spent €965m over the past three years in the fight against air pollution, smog, which is a determining factor in climate change,” he said. Venice’s mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, blamed the floods on the climate crisis and promised that the long-delayed Mose flood barrier project would be finished. Brugnaro closed St Mark’s Square as the tide started to rise again on Friday morning, engulfing shops, restaurants and homes. “I’m forced to close the square to avoid health risks for citizens … a disaster,” he said. “We’ve destroyed Venice, we’re talking about €1bn in damage and that’s just from the other day, not today.” The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, declared a state of emergency on Thursday night, paving the way for the government to assist people whose businesses and homes had been damaged. Conte said the flooding was “a blow to the heart of our country”. Residents whose homes have been flooded will receive €5,000 immediately while restaurant and shop owners will get up to €20,000. Brugnaro said a bank account would be opened to allow people from around the world to contribute towards repairing the city. Water engulfed St Mark’s Basilica, flooding the crypt and smashing windows. It is unclear how much repairs will cost, but when water filled the 1,000-year-old cathedral in November 2018 the repair costs were estimated at €2.2m. The opera house, the Teatro La Fenice, was also damaged and a short circuit caused a fire at Ca’ Pesaro gallery. On the island of Murano, the mosaic floors of the cathedral were seriously damaged."
"Rip currents are found along most coastlines, and where they form near popular beaches they can be deadly. The journalist Decca Aitkenhead has written movingly about how quickly life can change after her husband was swept out to sea by a rip current while rescuing their son. A rip current (sometimes incorrectly referred to as a rip tide) is a strong, narrow, fast-flowing current directed toward the sea that travels up to one to two metres per second. Rip currents usually develop close to the shoreline in very shallow water around a metre deep – just where beach bathers are usually found. For rip currents to form, there must be areas close to the beach where some waves break and other areas where they do not. Usually this is caused by sandbars on the seabed that form from the sediment deposited by waves and tides. Waves are encouraged to break when travelling through the shallower water over the sandbars, but they don’t break when travelling through the regions of deeper water between them.  As waves enter the shallow water they “shoal” – increase in height – and through their momentum they begin to force water towards the shoreline. Once the waves begin to break – so decrease in height – this momentum is reduced, opposed by another force known as a pressure gradient. This opposing pressure gradient causes the sea surface level to rise up by a few centimetres where the waves are breaking. As the surface level of the sea where the waves are breaking over the sandbars is slightly higher than where the waves are not breaking, a current forms from water that is essentially flowing “downhill” from where it is higher to where it is lower. These are called feeder currents, and where they meet between sandbars their flow turns away from the shore and becomes the strong rip current that travels through the deeper water. Rip currents are dangerous because they carry anything in the water seawards to deeper waters, and are not easy for swimmers to detect. In fact most bathers are not aware of the hazard they represent. A bather in shallow water is likely to drift with the feeder currents along the shore without noticing, at which point they may be carried into the main rip current. Very quickly, they are carried out to sea and out to depths where waves may break over their heads. At this point bathers frequently panic, often with tragic results. Those attempting to swim back towards the shore against the rip current will quickly tire as the rip will generally be too strong even for the most competent swimmer. While rip currents are caused by the action of waves they are also affected by the tides. Whether the tide is in or out will vary the depth of water over sandbars, effectively becoming a switch that turns wave breaking on and off as water depth rises and falls. In Britain’s south-west, for example, sandbars are frequently found around the shoreline at low tide. For several hours low water waves break over these bars and cause rip currents, but as the tide rises the water depth over the bars increases, the wave breaking stops, and the rips become inactive. This repeats over the twice-daily tidal cycle, and is also regulated by the fortnightly cycle of spring tides and neap tides, which gives rip currents a semi-regular pattern. Rip currents can be identified using complicated instrumentation, GPS-equipped drifter floats, or even by releasing coloured dye into the waters around the surf zone. But a simple trick to spot rip currents is to watch for the patterns of wave breaking visible from the shore. Seen from a high vantage point such as a cliff above a beach, the contrast of intense white foam where waves are breaking versus the flat, dark waters of the rip current creates a characteristic pattern. In fact the same concept is used to identify rip currents using automated camera systems.  It’s worth remembering though that, somewhat counter-intuitively, bathers should head towards the surf, and stay clear of the dark, flat water under which the fast currents lurk – even though it looks more inviting. And the safest beaches for bathers are those with a lifeguard, who are trained to recognise safe regions – their flagged areas and advice should always be followed."
"John McDonnell has announced a radical Labour plan to commit £400bn of investment to what he called the twin crises of the climate emergency and social deprivation, saying “future generations would never forgive us” if rapid action was not taken. The shadow chancellor used an election campaign speech in Liverpool to outline the economic priorities of the party, and said a Labour government would change the fiscal rules so borrowing for investment would be excluded from borrowing targets. McDonnell, who said his programme was “in the best tradition of British socialism” in the footsteps of Hugh Dalton and Gordon Brown, also promised to shift significant political decision-making power from London to the north. He said much of the planning for investment would be devolved, that part of the Treasury would be moved to the north of England and that his ministerial meetings would be held in other places as well as London. “What does this mean?” he said. “It means that the centre of political gravity is shifting away from London. It’s coming back home to the north.” Speaking soon after the chancellor, Sajid Javid, had announced that the Conservatives would revise their own fiscal rules to be able to spend an extra £20bn a year on infrastructure, McDonnell said far greater ambition was needed. As well as £250bn in investment over 10 years for a green transformation fund to invest in areas such as clean energy and home insulation, Labour also pledged £150bn over five years for what it billed as a new social transformation fund. This would be spent on infrastructure projects, such as schools, hospitals and social housing, to “begin the urgent task of repairing our social fabric that has been torn apart by the Tories”, McDonnell said. McDonnell urged voters to ignore Conservative pledges of more spending. “They treat us all with contempt,” he said. “They think people are stupid. That with Brexit on the agenda, they think we’ll all forget about the past 10 years and the prospect of the next five years if they get back.” The election was “a once-in-a-generation chance to get back on track”, he said, with the focus on the climate emergency and crumbling social infrastructure. Asked after the speech whether the amount pledged could spook money markets and lead to interest rate rises, McDonnell said: “Our scale of investment matches the scale of those emergencies that we now face, on climate change and socially. I’ll tell you, if we didn’t set off on that march, future generations would never forgive us.” McDonnell insisted that any Brexit deal negotiated by Labour would not affect the spending plans if it was eventually endorsed by a second referendum: “Whatever deal we seal will enable us to go ahead with our programme.” He said fully costed spending and investment plans would be spelled out in Labour’s manifesto, and that cheap and plentiful government borrowing made the programme realistic. “There’s no shortage at the moment of demand for government bonds across the world,” he said. “Our aim as a Labour government is to achieve what past Labour governments have aspired to: an irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people. “That means change, real change. It means investment on a scale never seen before in this country, and certainly never seen before in the north and outside of London and the south-east. “To achieve that objective also requires therefore an irreversible shift in the centre of gravity in political decision-making, as well as investment in this country, from its location solely in London, to be relocated to the north and regions and nations of our country.” Spending would be guided by a national investment bank, with a series of regional arms, he said, with “decision-making devolved down to local communities”."
"Despite the horror of the fire at Grenfell Tower, UK regulations for tall buildings are ahead of the curve in comparison with other countries. There have been huge improvements in construction materials and technological solutions throughout the modern era. And testing and certification methods have became even more rigorous, to ensure the quality of new products.  Of course, many people are now asking what more could have been done to prevent the tragic loss of life in the Grenfell blaze. The truth is, while architects and engineers can work to mitigate the risk of fire, it cannot be completely eliminated. The addition of some materials to buildings, such as cladding, will obviously now come under scrutiny. But there are several improvements that can be made to old 20th-century tower blocks like Grenfell, to make them safer places to live.  When it comes to managing the risk of fire, builders and architects are guided by three simple principles: prevent risk, evacuate users and minimise damage – in that order. But updating or “retrofitting” older buildings to meet modern safety standards isn’t always straightforward. That’s why architects, builders and other experts work alongside fire engineers to ensure evacuation systems are adequate for the building’s structure, function and users.  There is no single formula. Each building is studied in detail by a design team, which works together to decide what approach is best. It’s important to consider how the building is being used; for instance, while offices are at risk because they contain large amounts of flammable stationary and electronic equipment, in residential units the biggest risks arise from cooking, heaters and other domestic equipment, which can start fires.  Human factors such as forgetfulness, physical limitations and human error must also play a role in fire safety planning – especially when children or elderly people are frequent users. People are also more relaxed at home, which can lead them to lose awareness of some of the risks. People often leave pans on the hob or place heaters near curtains and other combustibles for example. A team must bear all these factors in mind, as they decide how to approach each project: smoke and heat detectors can prevent some accidents, placing sockets away from windows can also help. Some buildings rely heavily on evacuation routes to keep users safe when disaster strikes. This requires sound alarm systems, fire barriers in the form of fire doors and walls, and smoke extractors. These features are especially important in historic buildings, where escape routes are narrow or intricate, and have not been designed in accordance with current building regulation standards. Wherever possible, fire stairs should be partly sealed, to prevent smoke from entering, while automatic ventilation systems can be installed, which allow smoke to escape upwards like a chimney.  Done right, this can provide a safe, smoke free escape route. But it is not always possible to achieve this standard in existing buildings, which is why users are sometimes advised to stay in their flats and steer clear of stairs and corridors where smoke can build up. Smoke inhalation is the most common cause of death in fires so residents are often advised to remain in a smoke-free zone and wait to be rescued. It appears this was the case at Grenfell Tower. Likewise, technical considerations can prevent the use of certain types of fire safety technology – for example, when there is no space to accommodate the installation. Installing sprinkler systems is not always feasible because they often require large tanks to store water, which are heavy and need space to allow access for maintenance.   It’s hugely important for buildings to be designed to accommodate emergency responses, by making space for fire fighters to take control of and extinguish fires, if and when they occur. Some measures affect the internal layout, such as the installation of fire-fighting lifts. Others relate to the areas surrounding the building and the provision of services. For this reason, large structures must have a water source available, to reinforce the fire brigade’s own supply. Fire engines can only reach certain heights and cannot cover the upper floors. In new buildings, dry risers are installed, providing an empty vertical pipe which fire fighters can use to pump water up to the higher storeys. In order to function properly, these need to be regularly tested and maintained. They might not be not suitable for some retrofits, due to the lack of space.  Pavements around buildings are often required to be a specific width and strength, to take the size and weight of local fire engines. All of these design measures help fire fighters keeping us safe but they are also highly reliant on maintenance. Residents of Grenfell Tower reported obstructions to emergency access routes, in one of a series of complaints about the safety and maintenance of the building.  When planning for fires, the team will also try to find ways to minimise the damage to the structure. This is to avoid the risk of collapse, as well as preserve as much of the building as possible, in case it can be reused after the fire.  To do this, the design team can use new building modelling software (BIM) to predict with reasonable accuracy how quickly a fire could spread through a building. All construction materials come with a set of technical data, which designers can input into the software in order to select the most suitable technology and materials for the building.  If a material is highly combustible, then alarm systems become more relevant, while escape routes require better protection and ease of movement. When a building or refurbishment is completed, the designer hands over the key and a maintenance manual to the landlord. Maintenance manuals are very detailed, providing contact information, time schedules and guarantee documents for the upkeep of the building.  But even with all these measures in place, there’s still a one major problem: materials are tested in isolation, which means that their technical data does not take into account how they will react when used in combination with other technologies – or when there are human errors in the design or assembling process. These issues are not picked up by BIM software.  Fire can spread rapidly in the small gap between the external face of the building, and the internal walls. Thermal insulation is often placed inside this cavity, and sometimes it is part of the external cladding. Some aluminium panels are made with a rock wool insulation – these are fire resistant. But aluminium gets hot and expands very quickly, heating the insulation layer. If this layer is combustible, fire can spread at speed by travelling through the cavity – which acts as a chimney – producing vast amounts of toxic smoke. Fire barriers can be used to create compartments within the cavity, installed horizontally and vertically between the cladding and the internal wall at critical points to delay the spread of fire. But this product has to be installed with great skill for it to work efficiently, and it’s not always possible to use it for retrofits, depending on the type and condition of the existing walls. This explains why, despite all the design efforts, the risk of fire cannot be completely eliminated by design. What’s more, designers and managers can only predict human factors and behaviours to a certain degree. For this reason, communities and schools must work together with designers, fire brigades and building managers to help prevent fires. Meanwhile, building contractors and maintenance professionals must use these techniques to ensure that residents are properly protected from harm."

Polar Islands Of Heat
By Ed Caryl
I would like to thank “John”, a commenter on my article on why the Antarctic sea ice is expanding, for inspiring this article. Other writers and researchers have noticed that temperature measurements in the polar regions are influenced by nearby heat sources, even the body heat of the person doing the measurement.
In 1907, William John Gordon wrote Round About The North Pole, describing the various expeditions that had taken place up until that time. One expedition described was that of Umberto Cagni’s expedition in 1900. (H/t Bill Strouss in a comment on WUWT here.)
Here is an excerpt from that book, the bottom of page 77 and the top of page 78.

Figure 1 is an excerpt from William John Gordon’s Round About The North Pole, written in 1907. Note the increasing impact on temperature measurements with the approach of the human body with decreasing temperature.
Every object that is warmer than the surroundings emits infrared that heats cooler objects in the vicinity. The more objects there are that are warm, and the closer they are, the greater the heating. This applies also to thermometers. Are weather stations in the polar regions subject to temperature errors due to nearby heated structures? This notion has been studied for only a few locations. The village of Barrow on the Arctic Ocean coast in Alaska has been studied. The heat island there can reach as much as five or six degrees C in winter when the temperature is between -30°C and -40°C and the wind is calm.
Studies like this require the installation of recording thermometers inside the study area and outside in nearby rural areas. Long-term studies are done using existing weather stations that are close by. One long term study was done using the records from Fairbanks, Alaska, and nearby Eielson Air Force Base. This study found a heat island exceeding 1°C in winter.
Comparison of 2 adjacent Antarctic weather stations
In the polar regions there are few weather station pairs suitable for heat island studies. In Antarctica, there is only one pair that can be used, Scott Base and McMurdo Station on Ross Island in the Ross Sea. These two stations are particularly useful, as they are very close together, less than 1.5 miles (2.3 kilometers) apart as the Skua flies (no crows in Antarctica), at the same altitude and latitude, separated by only a low ridge.

Figure 2 is from Wikimapia. McMurdo (left) and Scott Base (right) are at the southern tip of Ross Island. The red line is the distance between the temperature measuring instruments at the two bases.
If there is a heat island influence on temperature at McMurdo, there will be the following indicators:

McMurdo will be warmer than Scott Base in all seasons.


The annual temperature trend will be greater for McMurdo than for Scott Base.

Winter temperature differences will be greater than summer differences.

Figure 3 is a plot of the annual temperatures and trends for McMurdo and Scott Base.
At the beginning, after Scott Base was built in 1957, the temperature difference was about 2.5°C, with McMurdo the warmer. The trend for McMurdo is nearly twice that of Scott Base. In 2009, the last year where we have data from both stations, the difference was more than 3°C.
Both bases were built to support research in the International Geophysical Year, June 1957 to December 1958. McMurdo was always the larger base, built first to support logistics for the other Antarctic research stations in the area, as well as support for the South Pole station, Amundsen-Scott Station. Scott Base was built by New Zealand in 1957.
McMurdo was sized to support over a thousand people in the Austral Summer season and 150 to 200 people in the winter. Scott Base was sized to support 70 to 80 people in the summer and 10 to 15 people in the winter, 10% of the size of McMurdo.
McMurdo handles the logistics, fuel, sea-borne and airborne freight, personnel transport, and most of the electrical power for the two stations, though Scott Base does have its own generators in case the common electrical grid is disrupted. There is also a three-turbine wind farm with nearly 1 Megawatt peak output.
90% of the fuel used at both bases is AN8 aviation kerosene jet/diesel fuel. Most of the turbojet and prop jet aircraft, and all the diesel engines use AN8, including the icebreakers and the diesel generators, at both bases and the South Pole. AN8 is a special Arctic formulation with antifreeze added to reduce the gel point to -70°F (-57°C).
These stations use a LOT of fuel for heating and electrical power. McMurdo uses 19,000 liters per average day, about 12% more in winter and 30% less in summer. Scott Base uses 1300 liters per day in winter and 900 liters/day in summer. The fuel energy content for AN8 is about 10,000 watt-hours/liter. For both stations, this works out to about 55 watt-hours/square meter in winter and 37 watt-hours/square meter in summer.
But the area of warmer McMurdo is about 400 by 400 meters, or 160,000 square meters, and Scott Base is much smaller at about 50 by 200 meters, or 10,000 square meters, though much more irregular. Here is what the bases look like in winter (now).

Figure 4 is the McMurdo webcam image from Arrival Heights about 2 AM local time on August 13, 2014. Moonlight is just making the unlighted terrain faintly visible. Observation Hill is left of center beyond the base.

Figure 5 is of the “hitching rail” area (outlets for engine heaters) at the entrance of Scott Base, lighted by their one streetlight. This webcam view was taken at the same time as Figure 4.
Below in Figure 6 are the temperature differences between the warmer McMurdo and the cooler Scott Base by season. December through February is summer, March through May and June through August is winter, and September through November is “WinFly”. WinFly is also winter, as it stands for Winter Fly-in, the season when the early crews arrive to begin preparations for the summer work season.

Figure 6 is the temperature difference between McMurdo and Scott Base by quarters. McMurdo is the warmer by 3.5°C in June, July, and August, 3°C in the rest of winter, and around 2°C in summer.
For all seasons, the trend is warming. The WinFly season is warming the most.
McMurdo is warmer in winter by 3 to 3.5°C because of the high-energy use to heat and power the base, and because that heat is over a larger area than Scott Base by a factor of 16. There is also another reason: the siting of the measuring instruments. This is Building 165, the location of “MacWeather”, the weather monitoring and forecasting office, as well as the communications and operations center for the McMurdo base.

Figures 6a and 6b are Building 165 at McMurdo. Figure 6b is a close-up on the weather instruments. Note the stovepipe very close by.
Building 165 is near the center of the base, next door to the Crary Science Center.

Figure 7 is a labeled satellite view from Wikimapia of the center of McMurdo Station. The building outlined in red is building 165, the location of MacWeather. The weather instruments are on the roof at the right-hand corner of the building, closest to Crary Lab. In Figure 6a, you can see the corner of the Phase 2 (middle) section of the lab building.
In contrast to this very “urban” setting, the weather station and the weather instruments at Scott Base are much better sited.

Figure 8 above is an overview of Scott Base. Most of the heat sources, the powerhouse, garage, dormitories, mess building, and the “ablutions” building, are on the right. The building on the left end of the complex is Hatherton Lab. Outside of this building, slightly up-slope and almost 100 meters away, is a Stevenson Screen – see detail below.
Figures 9 and 10 document the position of the Stevenson Screen at Scott Base:

Figure 9: The path to the Stevenson Screen (upper left corner). In order to safely reach it, and return to Hatherton Lab in winter white-out conditions, there is a guide rope strung alongside the path. Photo Credit: Joe Harrigan/Antarctic Photo Library.

Figure 10: Nita Smith is the lady in the photo. Three wind turbines are visible in the background on the ridge above the base. The picture was taken in early December 2011. Photo credit: Rebecca Priestly here.
The last monthly record in the GISS station data is June 2009. Ms. Smith would be deeply disappointed that her efforts were in vain. GISS is taking only the McMurdo data now and ignoring Scott Base. Why are we not surprised?
There is definitely a heat island at McMurdo Station. As we discussed at the top of this article:


McMurdo is warmer than Scott Base in all seasons by 2°C in summer to nearly 4°C in winter.




The annual temperature trend is greater for McMurdo than for Scott Base by 86%.




Winter temperature differences are greater than summer differences by 1 to 1.5°C.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: As reader Harry points out, Rossiter’s last entry was made in May 2013, and not 2014, as I mistakenly believed. Therefore Rossiter’s Wall Street Journal op-ed is a actually a (welcome) breach of his promise of never to discuss climate.
The good side of this is that hopefully he will speak out more in the future as well.
The original post has been modified (17 June 2014, 14:37 CET).
=====================================
Obviously the searing heat felt in the climate science debate was just too much for Caleb S. Rossiter to take last year.
At his blog on climate science he made his last entry on May 13, 2013 where he seemed to throw in the towel for good.
The criticism and hatred fired his way for his refusal to believe the AGW science must have been horrendous: He announced he was quitting the climate debate, citing exaggerations in the science that “make my blood boil” and scientists behaving “like lawyers inflaming a jury“.
What follows are some excerpts of his last entry at his climate blog:

May 13, 2013: My Last Piece on “Climate Change”: The Debate is finally over on “Global Warming — Because Nobody will Debate.”
I am deserting from the Climate War.  I will never write another climate article or give another climate talk, …. when I hear or see the sort of exaggerations and certainties about the dangers of heat-trapping gasses that tend to make my blood boil at their absurdity. …
This is real.  There is simply too little room for true debate, because the policy space is dominated by people who approach this issue not like scholars weighing evidence, but like lawyers inflaming a jury with suspect data and illogical and emotional arguments. …
The believers in human–induced catastrophic climate change, strongly represented among the liberal and radical left of American and international politics, have won the mainstream media and government battle for the conventional wisdom, but lost the war for policy change.

Read Rossiter’s last post here (May 13).
Obviously he views the problems in the climate science debate in the gravest terms. So it’s good he broke his promise and decided to marshal his considerable influence to counter the problem, i.e. not to choose sides but to communicate the real facts to the public.
I hope he continues speaking out because I would think he has the potential to make a serious difference on the issue. Right or left, the truth needs all the help it can get.

"Date palms are an iconic feature of landscapes in the Middle East and North Africa. These graceful trees are one of the oldest known fruit crops and have been cultivated for well over 5,000 years, providing sustenance for generations. To this day, dates have been an important international crop, cultivated in a wide belt from Pakistan to Tunisia and exported to markets across the world. The crops were especially prized by the ancient Sumerian cultures of Mesopotamia between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Once one of the earliest cradles of human civilisation, this region is now home to the sadly war-torn countries of Iraq and Syria.  As anybody who has eaten dates will know, the succulent fruits contain a large pit which is normally discarded, though traditionally in the Middle East they were collected and used for feeding livestock or making decorative beads.  But what if, rather than throw these pits away, we could use them to address a very modern issue, solving a serious problem that plagues people around the world and especially those in countries ravaged by conflict such as Iraq and Syria? What if we could use them to remove toxins from the environment?  Date seeds contain small but significant amounts of oil, which can be extracted by pressing. This oil used to be processed to make soap and other beauty products. However, in a joint venture with colleagues in Syria, we have now found a way to use the oil to remove dangerous toxins from the environment.  This finding came about through a unique international scientific collaboration between Dr Abdulsamie Hanano in Damascus, colleagues in France, and our group at the University of South Wales. Dr Hanano was interested in the problem of how to remove toxins, known as dioxins, that can accumulate in watercourses and soils due to industrial contamination or warfare. Dioxins are byproducts of industrial processes, and perhaps best known from the Vietnam War in the 1960s, when the US military sprayed huge amounts of a herbicide called “Agent Orange” over the countryside in order to remove vegetation.  Tragically, the Agent Orange formulation contained dioxins and many thousands of Vietnamese people were exposed to the toxin, resulting in a huge toll of illness and birth defects that is still with us today.  More widely, industrially produced dioxins are present in many areas around the world and enter human food chains via livestock, fish or drinking water from contaminated areas. Dioxins accumulate in the human body eventually leading to reproductive and developmental problems, damage to the immune system and cancer.  One of the biggest problems in trying to remove dioxins from the environment is their extreme insolubility in water, which means that they cannot simply be washed away. This is where Dr Hanano spotted a possible opportunity to use date seeds: he realised that the seed oil was encapsulated in very stable structures called lipid droplets. And, as we had shown previously, such lipid droplets are covered by a layer of specialised proteins that enable them to form highly stable emulsions. We speculated that these oily emulsions might attract the dioxins and remove them from the environment – in effect acting as “molecular magnets”. The first challenge was to get the lipid droplets out of the hard date seeds. This required the seeds to be soaked in water for two weeks to soften them, before the droplets could be extracted as a creamy emulsion. The next stage was to add this emulsion to a water/solvent mixture that contained the most common and most toxic dioxin, TCDD. The results were dramatic and exceeded all of our expectations: within a minute, almost all of the dioxins had been removed from the solution and into the lipid droplets.  This was the start of several months of intensive research by our respective labs in Syria, France and the UK. Because of the ongoing conflict in Syria, we were unable to meet in person, and our colleagues in Damascus suffered from severe shortages of equipment and supplies – not to mention the very real dangers of living and working in a war zone. Having shown a preliminary “proof of concept” in our recently published paper, we are now interested in practical applications of this new form of environmental biotechnology. One of Dr Hanano’s ideas is to use it on fish farms where the higher levels of dioxins in coastal waters (compared to the open oceans) can result in significant accumulations in fish and shellfish. The water could be passed through cartridges containing date seed lipid droplet emulsions in order to remove the dioxins, which can them be incinerated. In the short term, we hope the technology will be used to help clean up the huge numbers of contaminated sites in Syria created during the present conflict. Longer term, we are also interested in using this sort of bio-remediation to tackle other toxins across the world, proving that date palms are even more useful than our ancestors imagined."
"Global funds management giant Aberdeen Standard Investments has rejected prime minister’s Scott Morrison’s call for companies to listen to “quiet shareholders” as part of a comprehensive rebuff of the government’s attack on activist investors and the environmental movement. The UK’s biggest listed fund manager, which controls assets worth more than £550bn, also defended the role of environmental groups including Market Forces, which has been accused by the attorney general, Christian Porter, of pressuring companies through “widespread, co-ordinated harassment and threats of boycotts”.  Aberdeen’s intervention in Australian politics comes after bank bosses on Friday told a parliamentary inquiry they did not feel bullied by environmental groups and rejected the need for changes to the law foreshadowed by the Morrison government. In a speech to the Queensland Resources Council last Friday, Morrison attacked “an escalating trend towards a new form of secondary boycotts in this country” in which environmental groups “are targeting businesses and firms who provide goods or services to firms they don’t like, especially in the resources sector”. “Some of Australia’s largest businesses are now refusing to provide banking, insurance and consulting services to an increasing number of firms who just support through contracted services to the mining sector and the coal sector in particular, which is the nation’s second-largest export sector,” Morrison said “I think some of our largest corporations should listen and engage with their quiet shareholders, not just the noisy ones.” An Aberdeen spokeswoman said the company had a “critical role to play in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy, and the adaptation to climate change impacts through our products and investment decision”. “We see environmental, and particularly climate, risks as financially material to the businesses that we invest our clients’ money in and that is why it is a strong focus of our analysis,” she said. The company is among shareholders in BHP who delivered large votes in favour of a resolution proposed by activist investor group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility that, if passed, would have forced the mining giant to quit the Minerals Council of Australia and other lobby groups with a track record inconsistent with the company’s position on the climate crisis. “Like many large asset owners and asset managers, we actively engage with companies and much of this engagement is done ‘quietly’, in that it is conducted privately between ASI and the company,” the spokeswoman said. “We believe this is generally the most effective way to influence change. However, we strongly believe that there is also a place for ‘noisy’ action where other forms of engagement have been ineffective, and where the issue of concern is not aligned with the company’s broader strategy. “Shareholders, noisy or quiet, are not faceless institutions. As shareholders, it is our responsibility to represent the interests of our clients in generating sustainable long-term returns.” She said Morrison’s remarks would have no effect on the group’s strategy. “Our engagement and investment activities are informed by our disciplined investment approach, and we will continue to engage with companies, quietly or otherwise, where we believe that company strategy does not adequately address material environmental, social and governance issues – including climate change,” she said. Asked about the government’s attack on Market Forces, which is associated with environment group Friends of the Earth, she said that protesting was “an effective and vital part of a democracy”. “At the end of the day, companies are commercial organisations that will not be influenced by activist groups unless they can see a commercial benefit,” she said. Under questioning from Labor’s treasury spokesman, Andrew Leigh, and the Greens deputy leader, Adam Bandt, at a parliamentary hearing on Friday, the Westpac chief executive, Brian Hartzer, and his counterpart at the Commonwealth bank, Matt Comyn, both denied they felt bullied by climate activists. Leigh took Hartzer to Westpac’s climate commitments, asking: “Is it fair to say you made these decisions in your own business interests rather than being bullied into it?” “Yeah,” Hartzer replied. He said Westpac made its decisions after taking into consideration its role in society. “We do that independently,” he said. Asked if the law needed to be changed as foreshadowed by Morrison, he said: ‘No, but I’m not sure what’s specifically proposed there.” Bandt put it to Comyn that it didn’t sound like the CBA was being “bullied”. “Yes, that’s right,” Comyn said. He said that to his knowledge the bank had never asked the government to change the law because of campaigns people ran that affected its business. The Commonwealth Bank’s deputy chief executive, David Cohen, said that the bank’s “experience has been that engaging with some of the environmental groups has been to our benefit”. He said it had helped shape the bank’s thinking on environmental, social and governance issues. “I think that’s enriched our own thinking over time,” he said. Liberal backbencher Jason Falinski asked Comyn if the bank had been subjected to shareholder activism by groups that bought small parcels of shares in order to put motions or be disruptive. “One of the unique and positive features of the AGM is that people, regardless of their shareholding, are able to get up and ask questions of the chairman,” Comyn said. He said the number of questions on the environment had increased recently, mirroring wider debate in the community. “It’s not unreasonable and as I said in many ways positive that small shareholders are able to stand and ask questions of the board and management of their company,” he said."

 Part 3. Empires
 By Ed Caryl
After the cold snap of 8200 years ago, civilization really began to develop in the Middle East. Villages became towns. Towns developed into cities. Societies adopted formal rulers, religions, and the beginnings of social stratification. The first large temple structures date from much earlier, in eastern Turkey, even before the people building them had domesticated grain or animals, but there are no villages, towns, or cities associated with these structures.

Figure 1 is a diagram of the last 10,000 years. The graph resolution is 100 years. Many significant events are marked on the Greenland GISP2 Ice Core temperature plot. The Greenland and Antarctic ice core temperature records only indicate temperature trends in the surrounding seas, the sources of the snow-water. Global temperatures are represented more accurately by the sea level.
People and animals require fresh water, so the first villages began along the shorelines of the Persian Gulf, and the rivers and streams that ran into it, or at permanent springs. As the cooling at 8200 BP (Before Present) set in, it became dryer, and crops that depended on the monsoon rains began to fail. Irrigation became necessary. The development of irrigation required organization to build and maintain the infrastructure. Organization requires that someone be in charge. As more organization developed, more people could be fed, and more people were necessary to do the work. Villages became towns. Now, the towns were centered around temples. In Mesopotamia, each town had its own deity with its own temple, with dedicated attendants. Towns became cities. Town chiefs became Kings.
The period from 8200 BP to 5900 BP was the last period of the Neolithic, the last period before metal replaced stone for toolmaking. Pottery was in wide use.
In this period, beer was discovered. I say discovered, because beer happens naturally when bread is soaked in water and allowed to ferment. Good beer is just a refinement of that natural process. After a day working in the fields, liquid refreshment is a necessity. Drinking water can be easily contaminated and beer has advantages in that the alcohol kills off bacteria. Beer became a product of the temples. Beer became a civilizing influence.
As the population grew, cities became larger. Eridu was the first large city. Eventually, many cities grew along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. These are known now as the Sumerian civilization, named for the city of Sumer, but each of these cities had their own king, and there was no central ruler. This situation lasted through the period of the Holocene climate optimum, from 8400 years BP until 5900 years BP, a period of 2500 years. This time span is called the Ubaid period, named after one of the important cities.
The cooling and drying at 5900 years BP put an end to all this. The North African Pluvial ended. The Sahara and Arabian Deserts began to dry out. The drying was so sudden, it is now called the 5.9 KY event (kilo-years BP). In Saudi Arabia, settlements on the Persian Gulf coast died out and population dropped for a thousand years. In Egypt, people migrated from the Sahara into the Nile Valley. In Mesopotamia, this period is known as the Uruk period, again for an iconic city. Just before this period ended, during a warm peak, the first writing appeared as cuneiform pictographs. A bit later Egyptian hieroglyphics appeared. This was also the beginning of the Bronze age in the mid-east and the Mediterranean.
Sea levels had been falling for 500 years before the 5.9 KY event. At the low-stand in sea level, people in western England began populating the Somerset Levels. Islands emerged there that were easily defensible because of the surrounding swamps. These were connected to the mainland by some of the earliest “roads” or plank trackways. These were preserved because as the sea level rose again they were protected in oxygen-poor bogs.

The Uruk period ended with the Piora oscillation, 5200 years BP, another cold period, colder than the 5.9 KY event, but this time cold and wet. The Dead Sea rose 100 meters. There were floods on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Cities were wiped out. This may also be the source of the Gilgamesh and Biblical flood stories. Other areas, like the Central Sahara, dried out even further. Climate change in Central Asia prompted a change in the domestic animal choice from cattle and sheep, to the horse, as a horse is better adapted to pawing away snow to get to forage in the winter. Glaciers in the alps advanced.
At this time upper and lower Egypt were two separate kingdoms. During the warm period of 5000 years BP, Egypt was unified by the first pharaoh of the First Dynasty. There is uncertainty about his name. It could have been Menes, or Narmer, or Hor-Aha. Confusing the issue, was the ancient practice of using a “Horus name” instead of a personal or nebty-name on monuments. Menes and Narmer, for instance, were likely the same person. This was the beginning of monument and temple building in Egypt.
In about 4700 BP, a cold period is recorded in the Greenland ice cores, and a seven-year drought and famine is recorded in Egypt in the reign of Djoser. Two hundred and fifty years later, as things warmed and improved, the great pyramids were constructed.
A cooling period and drought 4200 years ago lasted for two hundred years and the resulting series of famines pushed the Akkadian culture into collapse. This is known as the 4.2 KY event and it signaled the end of the Bronze Age in the Mediterranean. The Greek Dark Age followed. It was the end of the Old Kingdom in Egypt, and a period of major unrest throughout the region.
A warm period came after the 4.2 KY event 4000 years ago. Minoan civilization on Crete began to prosper. On Crete, the palace at Knossos was built 3900 years ago. By 3500 years ago, the Minoans were under pressure from the Mycenaean Greeks. Mycenae reached their height of power about 3200 years ago, their expansion was assisted by the destruction caused by the eruption of Thera/Santorini in 1628 BCE. The palace at Knossos was rebuilt after it was destroyed, not by Minoans, but by Mycenaean Greeks
There were four major volcanic events (VEI 7) in the Holocene that caused brief temperature drops that barely appear in the ice core records. I have used a one hundred year centered average on the available data, and the data itself barely resolves these events. The first was the collapse of Mount Mazama (Crater Lake) in what is now Oregon, USA, 7600 to 7900 years ago, just before Erdu was settled, the second was the collapse of Thera. Both events probably depressed global temperature by a degree or so for three to five years, the second causing recorded crop failures in China. The third was Mount Samalas (Lake Segara Anak) in Indonesia in 1257 AD. This collapse may have helped begin the Little Ice Age. The fourth was Tambora, also in Indonesia in 1815, following which we had the “year without a summer.
The generally warm period from 6000 years BP to 4200 years BP fostered the Bronze Age in the Fertile Crescent and the Mediterranean. This period saw the rise of empires in Mesopotamia and Egypt. When the tin required for making bronze ran low, the Iron Age began out of necessity. When this period came to a close, a reordering took place, driven by a cooling and arid climate.
History tells us that rainfall and water availability enables civilization, as well as warm temperatures. Warm temperatures and increased rainfall usually occur together. When it is cold, it is usually dry. Again, when it is warm we thrive, when it is cold we die.

"The email that appeared on Phil Jones’s computer screen in November 2009 was succinct. “Just a quick note to encourage you to shoot yourself in the head,” it said. “Don’t waste any more time. Do it today. It is truly the greatest contribution to mankind that you will ever make.” Nor was it very different from the other emails that were arriving in Jones’s inbox. Others described the climate scientist as the scum of the earth. Some authors promised to kill him themselves. Most of the messages were riddled with obscenities. All made troubling reading.  As to the cause of this outpouring of hatred, that was straightforward. Jones headed the University of East Anglia’s Climate Research Unit, from which a tranche of emails had just been hacked and made public. These, it was claimed, showed that he and fellow researchers were faking the evidence that suggested our planet was heating up dangerously. The affair was dubbed Climategate by those who deny the existence of global warming and it remains one of modern society’s most troubling affairs. Many observers believe it helped delay measures that might have slowed climate change and given humanity more time to cut atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, its key cause. Climategate marks its 10th anniversary this month – an opportune moment to reflect on just how serious was its impact on society, and to look at the effect it had on those who were trying to stop Earth from being ravaged by rising seas, spreading deserts, disappearing coral reefs and suffocating heat. At the time, climate-change deniers were desperate to find ways to undermine the idea that global warming was real, and as Jones’s unit had provided key data that supported this notion – by showing how land temperatures on Earth had been rising sharply in recent decades – his work was considered fair game. So they responded gleefully by ransacking his hacked emails for signs he may have been fiddling results and asserted, in blogs, they had found telltale signs. These claims were then picked up by media outlets hostile to global warming. “Scientist in climate cover-up told to quit” ran one headline. “Scientists broke law by hiding climate data”, claimed another. Jones was vilified. “Within a day or two reporters were outside my house, knocking on my neighbours’ doors, digging for dirt,” he recalls. “I got hundreds of abusive and threatening emails. I knew the accusations were nonsense. But as someone used to being in control I buckled at the loss of it. My health deteriorated. I found it difficult to sleep and eat. I was under intense, spiralling pressure and felt I was falling to pieces. Looking back I suppose I was having some kind of a nervous breakdown.” So what had Jones said in his emails to trigger these attacks? In one message Jones says he would be emailing a journal “to tell them I’m having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this troublesome editor”. This was interpreted as being a bid to suppress academic criticism. “We’re choosing the periods to show warming,” he says in another email that seems to suggest he was fiddling his data. And then there was his remark that he was going to employ “Mike’s trick” to use data that would “hide the decline”. In other words, he was going to cover up data that showed the world was really cooling and was not warming, it was claimed. The Mike in question was Michael Mann, professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University, who had worked with Jones for years. His “trick” was no more than a simple technique to combine the records of temperatures measured directly by thermometer with estimates made from tree rings (which roughly reflect temperature variations). “In fact, the email was an entirely innocent and appropriate conversation between scientists,” Mann states in this week’s BBC Four documentary, Climategate: Science of a Scandal. He and Jones were merely trying to find appropriate ways of illustrating a graph of global temperature changes. This view was not shared by Sarah Palin: the former US vice-presidential candidate wrote a Washington Post op-ed article that claimed the emails “reveal that leading climate ‘experts’ … manipulated data to hide the decline in global temperatures”. Subsequent investigations by journalists showed these claims were unsupportable, however. Guardian writer Fred Pearce studied the leaked emails and produced a book, The Climate Files, from his research. “Have the Climategate revelations undermined the case that we are experiencing made-made climate change? Absolutely not,” says Pearce. “Nothing uncovered in the emails destroys the argument that humans are warming the planet.” Pearce was writing for the eco-friendly Guardian, but his views were supported by many others, such as Mike Hanlon, former science editor of the Daily Mail. “Scratch and sniff as we did, there was no smoking gun, no line that would show that there had been a conspiracy to fabricate a great untruth,” he said later. Thus, from the Guardian to the Daily Mail, the notion that Climategate represented “the worst scientific scandal of a generation” – as one UK newspaper had claimed – was found in the end to be unsupportable. This point is emphasised by Fiona Fox, head of the UK’s Science Media Centre. “British climate science was subjected to huge scrutiny by the world’s best journalists and it stood up to the test. If you look at where we are now in terms of public trust in climate science, it’s hard to sustain the argument that Climategate was fatally damaging to the field. “Climategate also tells us that front page rows about science are an opportunity as well as a threat and the scientists who stood up in that febrile environment and soundly defended science also did a great job. We need to remember that.” Several official UK reports on the affair also supported Jones. One inquiry – by Sir Muir Russell, a senior civil servant – specifically praised the “rigour and honesty” of Jones and his colleagues while another, chaired by Lord Oxburgh, found “no evidence of any deliberate scientific malpractice”. The only real criticism was the suggestion that the researchers had not always shown a “proper sense of openness” in dealing with data inquires. Jones and colleagues were also backed by the US Environmental Protection Agency which heavily criticised American politicians and energy groups who had tried to use the leaked emails to dismiss the risks facing our overheating world. These individuals had “routinely misunderstood or mis-characterised the scientific issues, drawn faulty conclusions, resorted to hyperbole, impugned the ethics of climate scientists in general and characterised actions as ‘falsifications’ and ‘manipulation’ with no basis or support,” said the agency. Other powerful support was provided by physicists at University of California, Berkeley, who decided to test if deniers had been right to question Jones’s temperature charts. Led by Professor Richard Muller and backed by funds that included a $150,000 grant from noted climate-crisis denial supporters, the Charles Koch Foundation – the team re-analysed more than 1.6bn land temperature measurements dating back to the 1800s – and came to exactly the same conclusions as Jones: the fairly level temperatures that had continued through the past few centuries began to spike sharply a few decades ago as atmosphere carbon levels rose. “Our biggest surprise was that the new results agreed so closely with warming values published previously,” said Muller. “This confirms these studies were done carefully and that potential biases identified by climate-change sceptics did not seriously affect their conclusions.” Such powerful endorsements might have been expected to end deniers’ claims about Climategate. However, they have continued since 2009 to accuse Jones and others of collusion and fraud. Former Times columnist and climate contrarian Matt Ridley is typical. The “scandal” showed scientists were “conspiring to ostracise sceptics, delete emails, game peer review and manipulate the presentation of data”, he wrote in 2017, ignoring the many reports and studies that in the interim have shown this was not the case. Note also that since Climategate we have had eight of the warmest years on record; carbon dioxide emissions have continued to rise inexorably; and Arctic sea ice levels in summer have reached record lows over the past decade. Occurrences of heavy rainfall and heatwaves have also increased dramatically. The world has continued to heat up dangerously. Yet humanity has done very little to tackle the crisis. And that raises a critical question: did Climategate play a role in this failure to act? Some observers believe it did and, as an illustration, point to the fate of the Copenhagen climate summit – organised under the UN framework convention on climate change – which took place only a few weeks after the leaking of the CRU’s emails. The Copenhagen summit is widely regarded as a failure. Instead of agreeing on a legally binding treaty to limit carbon emissions as hoped, delegates chose merely to “take note of” an accord drawn up by a core group of heads of state. So did the leaking of the Climategate emails have a pernicious influence there? Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, doubts it. “Essentially the conference was badly managed. Climategate had very little impact.” On the other hand, says Ward, climategate did damage public policy-making in the UK and in other western countries. “Rightwing politicians, allied with fossil fuel companies, used their influence to spread false claims about the emails and to argue against policies to cut fossil fuel use. That propaganda campaign still continues today.” The use of illegally hacked emails in Climategate also shows deniers will resort to all sorts of underhand methods to confuse the public, Ward added. “I am sure they would do the same again today – so scientists are going to have to remain vigilant and be ready to fight back at any time.” This point is backed by Mann, who has fought vociferously to defend climate science in the US. Although the past few years have seen a significant growth in the public’s belief that the world is heating dangerously, climate-change denial has not gone away. “Hard denial has evolved into something more pernicious,” he says. “Attention has been deflected from imposing policy solutions towards stressing that changes should be made in individual behaviour – people’s diet, methods of travel and other lifestyle choices. It is a classic industry manoeuvre: put the onus on individuals to change things and ignore the need to impose systemic solutions and make policy reforms. “Of course, individual action needs to be part of the battle, but not as a substitute for policy reform. It should be as an additional component. We must also be aware how the forces of denial are exploiting the lifestyle change movement to get supporters of action against climate change to argue with each other and engage in behavioural shaming. So yes, we will be vigilant in future.”"

"Australia’s response to climate change is one of the worst in the G20 with a lack of policy, reliance on fossil fuels and rising emissions leaving the country exposed “economically, politically and environmentally”, according to a new international report. Australia’s progress to meeting its already “unambitious” Paris climate targets was third worst, fossil fuel energy was on the rise and policies to tackle high transport emissions and deforestation were also among the worst across the G20 countries.  The Brown to Green report, now in its fifth year, takes stock of the performance of G20 countries on climate change adaptation and mitigation across key sectors, and in the finance sector. The chief executive of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, an Australian co-author of the report, told Guardian Australia: “Australia is behind [on] climate action in nearly every dimension. Australia’s emissions are increasing and there’s virtually no policy in place to reduce them.” Some 14 non-governmental groups, thinktanks and research institutes compile the report, funded by the World Bank, the US-based ClimateWorks Foundation and Germany’s environment ministry. Across the G20, the report said, limiting global heating to 1.5C would cut negative impacts by 70%, compared with allowing global temperatures to rise by 3C. Currently, extreme weather events were costing G20 countries about US$142bn annually. While the report doesn’t provide an overall ranking, Australia appears consistently among the worst performers in the report’s analysis. India and Australia were the only two G20 countries that had not introduced, or were not considering, policies to price greenhouse gas emissions, the report said. Only South Korea and Canada were further away than Australia from meeting the pledges that formed their Paris climate commitments. On deforestation, the report said Australia was the only developed country that was a “deforestation hotspot”, but had no policies to tackle it. Australia was ranked third worst for transport emissions per capita, and the report found “Australia, in particular, lacking significant policy” in the transport sector. Per capita emissions from aviation were 53 times higher than India’s. Australia, along with Russia, had no policies to move away from petrol-powered cars, no policies to decarbonise the heavy-duty vehicle sector and no policies to shift people onto public transport, the report said. Australia, along with the US and Saudi Arabia, had high emissions from the building sector. Australia had no building codes covering renovation of older buildings. All this lack of action, Hare said, was leaving Australia and its people exposed on climate change “economically, politically and environmentally”. Hare told Guardian Australia: “The leadership of the country is effectively telling lies about their performance, and contradicting their own government’s information. “The country is led by politicians who in one way or another deny either the science or are de facto denying it, and actively and wilfully opposing or obstructing climate policies.” Referring to the current Liberal-led Coalition government, Hare said this was the same political party that had repealed climate legislation, such as the carbon pricing mechanism, and “since then has done all it can to undermine any level of action”. He said the country’s position was in contrast with its opportunities in renewable energy, which it had not exploited as fully as it could. “Australia has one of the best solar energy potential and wind potential in general of any of the G20 countries,” he said. “Australia is not transforming its energy system and is focused on building coal and gas, and has not paid any attention to the need to transition to a zero-carbon economy.”"
"This interesting film by the Australian environmentalist Damon Gameau is an optimistic guide to the workable “regenerative” community projects that can help combat climate change. He imagines the great things that could happen by 2040, when his daughter will be a young woman. Gameau is clearly concerned to move his rhetoric away from anything righteously angry or confrontational – he doesn’t, for example, insist on immediate veganism, just a progressive lessening of meat-eating – and gives us an easygoing can-do approach in which there is no great emphasis on sacrifice and not even any obvious sense of emergency.  Sometimes this gives the film a slightly naive apolitical flavour, with repeated, cutesy vox pops from kids about how they want the world to be a nicer place; and occasionally, the film itself treats its audiences like a class of primary schoolkids. But more often there is something likable and practical about what Gameau is proposing. He talks about solar power, and how it can enable householders and communities to donate or sell excess power to create micro-grids of electricity. He imagines a world in which car ownership will go the way of owning films on videocassette or DVD, and travel will be about leasing or using driverless electric cars and an expansion of public transport. He talks about new farming models that can capture or sequester carbon in the atmosphere and about new approaches to the cultivation of seaweed to promote marine biodiversity. In the larger sphere, he wonders aloud about greater education of women, which will mean their having fewer babies later, thus reducing pressure on resources. The focus on what individuals can do right now is attractive. • 2040 is released in the UK on 8 November."

Share this...FacebookTwitterOcean acidification: The terrible little brother of global warming
By Dr. D. E. Koelle
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The alleged global warming, which now has not taken place for 18 years, has just received a “terrible little brother”. It was high time to find such a brother, especially since the older climate sister was becoming so weak.
Here that little brother is the not unknown “ocean acidification”, which was recently elevated by the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in a press release dated 8 October 2014 to being the new global danger that comes with “dramatic impacts” ,”costs in the billions” and the claim that the pH value today is dropping 10 times faster than in the past.
There was no word however that the ocean in fact is not “acidic” in any way. Rather with a pH value of between 7.8 and 8.1 it is clearly alkaline. This is a clear falsification of scientific facts (but the citizens won’t notice at all). If anything, when viewed objectively, a reduction in alkalinity has nothing to do with an “acidification”, which would begin at a pH value of 6.9.

Figure: CO2 concentration in the atmosphere over the last 300 million years (Retallack) – completely without any anthropogenic impact.

Here the claim of the supposed pH value drop is hardly a serious one because there is no global pH measurement network that would allow such a claim to be backed up. Local datasets show a pH value fluctuation of +/- 0.1 points. What is confirmed is the fact that over 90% of the earth’s history, the atmospheric CO2 concentration was considerably higher than the very modest 400 ppm level we have today. The average over the last 300 million years was near 2000 ppm (see diagram from Retallack, which is based on changes in the stoma pores of Gingko plants). Neither the considerably higher CO2 levels over the earth’s history nor the maximum of 6000 parts per million has ever led to an “acidification of the oceans”.
If the claims of a damaging influence on coral reefs were true, then the corals would have died millions of years ago.

So just where is this kind of acidification supposed to come from? Approximately 11 Gt of CO2 (a third of the anthropogenic emissions) is taken up by the oceans, but it is ignored that at least the same amount (and there are also estimates of 20 Gt CO2 per year) getting stored as CaCO3 on the seabed. The complete CO2 circulation in the oceans is everything but known: large quantities of CO2 originate from hundreds of underwater volcanoes along tectonic plate boundaries – and without this, covering the huge need for CO2 by the underwater vegetation (assumed to be greater than even that on land) is not imaginable. The minimum pH values also do not occur at the sea surface, as is supposed to be the case with an atmospheric impact (as is falsely assumed by the IPCC report), but rather at approximately 1000 meters below the sea surface.
At the surface, the low pH values are measured in areas where the deep water currents arrive at the surface. The CO2 absorption from the atmosphere, which is supposed to cause an “acidification”, has to be considered in relation to the total amount of about 39,000 Gt CO2 that is already dissolved in the ocean. As here we are talking about 11 Gt CO2 per year, this is only about 0.028%!  Here already alone the natural impacts of annual ENSO activity and ocean currents with the temperature changes can be considerably larger.
Let’s hope that the AWI-conjured “little awful brother” soon disappears and that research in the field of ocean sciences gets back to being serious.

"At this time of year in Europe, you may have noticed something in the air. 
Dust-laden winds blowing from the Sahara desert cause “seasonal haze episodes” that can even result in mud or “blood” rain.  In West Africa, which experiences haze episodes between November and March, the dust-laden trade wind is called the Harmattan and has important implications, not only for soil fertility but also radio communication, visibility at airports and in shipping lanes, and also on livelihoods – and health.  Dry skin and cracked lips are regular symptoms of exposure to the haze. But it presents more serious problems for asthmatics – and can lead to silicosis, a lung disease caused due to a high content of quartz in the dust. In some areas the dust blocks the sunlight enough to make temperatures drop significantly. Two regions have been identified as the sources of the Saharan dust: the Bodélé Depression in north-eastern Chad, which is part of the now dried up Lake Megachad – the most intense dust source in the world – and the Tibesti mountain region in northern Chad. Dust particles come from rocks in the Tibesti region and broken down by processes such as weathering, erosion and pulverisation. It has been estimated that 400m to 700m tons of dust is transported from the Sahara every year. And the north-easterly Harmattan wind carries this dust as far as Barbados and Miami between November and March. As much as 20% of it reaches the Amazon – and satellite data has been used to calculate that some 27.7m tons of dust are deposited over the Amazon basin, which plays a crucial role in fertilising the soil.  When the wind direction changes to south-westerly in early spring, the dust is carried across the Mediterranean as far as northern Europe and the UK. Natural mineral dust affects the climate, as well as fertilising aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Studies have shown that the dust is rich in phosphorus, which is the main source of nutrients for the Amazon. It also contains potassium and calcium. But to understand its full impact we also need to know the level of iron oxide minerals – and iron – within it.  Iron exists in two oxidation states in minerals: ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric (Fe3+). These are irons which have lost two or three electrons from their atoms. Ferrous iron is soluble and can be absorbed by plants whereas ferric iron is insoluble. Their relative abundance has implications for the fertility of the soils upon which the dust settles.  The bulk mineralogical composition of dust from the Bodélé Depression is quartz (around 75%). And using a Mössbauer spectrometer, the most powerful instrument for determining both ferric and ferrous irons and their ratios, I found that the Harmattan dust from the Bodélé basin contained three varieties of iron-bearing clay minerals that were all seriously deficient of the more desirable ferrous irons for healthy plant growth and had greater levels of highly-insoluble ferric irons.  The impact of this depends, of course, on the type of soil that the dust lands on. One study showed iron was helpful to maize farmers in northern Nigeria while a 2013 study showed that it was a threat to rice grown in several tropical savannah areas. But ultimately, a low ferrous content can still help fertilise soils because of its alkaline range – large amounts of Saharan dust on soils can improve more acidic soils whose pH is too low for plant growth, whereas more alkaline soils should benefit from the addition of iron. Depending on where they have come from, dust particles can range from as small as 0.7µm (microns) to 20µm. The ultra-fine nano-sized particles that are better absorbed by plants are blown further, across the Atlantic and particle sizes also decrease across the Mediterranean.  The Harmattan dust is blown over predominantly rural regions in West Africa, but the Saharan dust in Europe blows over regions of heavy industry and can mix with industrial pollutants. A particularly bad episode of pollution in the UK in 2014 was explained by other industrial and agricultural factors – not just the dust. And when the arrival of dust coincides with rainfall it can be deposited as mud, as happened in Istanbul, Turkey in 2010.  A report on the health effects of the Saharan dust in southern Europe showed that in Barcelona and Madrid, cardiac mortality during Sahara dust days was statistically significantly higher [pdf] compared with dust-free days. Similar trends were observed in Greece and Italy. The report called for further investigation into coarse particles and the mechanism by which Saharan dust increased mortality. Saharan dust that settles on the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean is also likely to be a significant contributor of iron to marine algae. When this algae sinks to the ocean floor, or is eaten by planktonic organisms, whose carbonate shells also sink, carbon dioxide is sequestered into sea floor sediments. The distribution of iron in the oceans is likely to be a way of trapping excess atmospheric CO2. 
On the one hand, global warming could increase winds and therefore dust production, but then more dust could enter the ocean, potentially providing a natural mitigator to those effects."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s once prestigious Alfred Wegener Institute has just issued a stunning press release informing the whole world about a new ground-breaking study showing that we do not need to expect the same climate change today that the earth saw during the last ICE AGE – because, you see, the pre-conditions back then were different.
Really! You don’t say! Gee, who would have ever thunk it. How much money was spent to find out that piece of what has long been obvious to everyone else?
And they wonder why our respect for their multi-billion dollar field, where 97% of their models have been dead wrong, has all but vanished.
AWI climate scientist Gerrit Lohmann summarizes:
There are apparently some situations in which the climate system is more resistant to change while in others the system tends toward strong fluctuations. In terms of the Earth’s history, we are currently in one of the climate system’s more stable phases. The preconditions which gave rise to rapid temperature changes during the last ice age do not exist today.”
Here is the entire press release:
——————————————
Has the puzzle of rapid climate change in the last ice age been solved? New report published in Nature shows that small variations in the climate system can result in dramatic temperature changes
Bremerhaven, Germany, August 19th, 2014.  Over the past one hundred thousand years cold temperatures largely prevailed over the planet in what is known as the last ice age. However, the cold period was repeatedly interrupted by much warmer climate conditions. Scientists have long attempted to find out why these drastic temperature jumps of up to ten degrees took place in the far northern latitudes within just a few decades. Now, for the first time, a group of researchers at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), have been able to reconstruct these climate changes during the last ice age using a series of model simulations. The surprising finding is that minor variations in the ice sheet size can be sufficient to trigger abrupt climate changes. The new study was published online in the scientific journal Nature last week and will be appearing in the 21 August print issue. 

During the last ice age a large part of North America was covered with a massive ice sheet up to 3km thick. The water stored in this ice sheet is part of the reason why the sea level was then about 120 meters lower than today. Young Chinese scientist Xu Zhang, lead author of the study who undertook his PhD at the Alfred Wegener Institute, explains. “The rapid climate changes known in the scientific world as Dansgaard-Oeschger events  were limited to a period of time from 110,000 to 23,000 years before present. The abrupt climate changes did not take place at the extreme low sea levels, corresponding to the time of maximum glaciation 20,000 years ago, nor at high sea levels such as those prevailing today – they occurred during periods of intermediate ice volume and intermediate sea levels.” The results presented by the AWI researchers can explain the history of climate changes during glacial periods, comparing simulated model data with that retrieved from ice cores and marine sediments.
How rapid temperature changes might have occurred during times when the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets were at intermediate sizes (see graphics below)

During the cold stadial periods of the last ice age, massive ice sheets covered northern parts of North America and Europe. Strong westerly winds drove the Arctic sea ice southward, even as far as the French coast.  Since the extended ice cover over the North Atlantic prevented the exchange of heat between the atmosphere and the ocean, the strong driving forces for the ocean currents that prevail today were lacking. Ocean circulation, which is a powerful “conveyor belt” in the world’s oceans, was thus much weaker than at present, and consequently transported less heat to northern regions.
During the extended cold phases the ice sheets continued to thicken. When higher ice sheets prevailed over North America, typical in periods of intermediate sea levels, the prevailing westerly winds split into two branches. The major wind field ran to the north of the so-called Laurentide Ice Sheet and ensured that the sea ice boundary off the European coast shifted to the north. Ice-free seas permit heat exchange to take place between the atmosphere and the ocean. At the same time, the southern branch of the northwesterly winds drove warmer water into the ice-free areas of the northeast Atlantic and thus amplified the transportation of heat to the north. The modified conditions stimulated enhanced circulation in the ocean. Consequently, a thicker Laurentide Ice Sheet over North America resulted in increased ocean circulation and therefore greater transportation of heat to the north. The climate in the Northern Hemisphere became dramatically warmer within a few decades until, due to the retreat of the glaciers over North America and the renewed change in wind conditions, it began to cool off again.
“Using the simulations performed with our climate model, we were able to demonstrate that the climate system can respond to small changes with abrupt climate swings,” explains Professor Gerrit Lohmann, leader of the Paleoclimate Dynamics group at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Germany. In doing so he illustrates the new study’s significance with regards to contemporary climate change. “At medium sea levels, powerful forces, such as the dramatic acceleration of polar ice cap melting, are not necessary to result in abrupt climate shifts and associated drastic temperature changes.”
At present, the extent of  Arctic sea ice is far less than during the last glacial period.  The Laurentide Ice Sheet, the major driving force for ocean circulation during the glacials, has also disappeared. Climate changes following the pattern of the last ice age are therefore not to be anticipated under today’s conditions.
“There are apparently some situations in which the climate system is more resistant to change while in others the system tends toward strong fluctuations,” summarises Gerrit Lohmann. “In terms of the Earth’s history, we are currently in one of the climate system’s more stable phases. The preconditions which gave rise to rapid temperature changes during the last ice age do not exist today. But this does not mean that sudden climate changes can be excluded in the future.”

Share this...FacebookTwitter330 Years of Sea Level
By Ed Caryl
Sea level data suffer from the same problem as temperature and other climate measures; there isn’t enough of it. Satellite sea level data only goes back twenty years, even less than the satellite temperature data. Fortunately, because the West was civilized by seafaring nations, we have some tide gauge records back into the 19th century for locations in Europe and a few locations around the world. These go back far enough that the chief source of error becomes not measurement accuracy or care in record keeping, but Post-Glacial Rebound (PGR) or Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA).
As described in Rebound, my last article, PGR for the Nordic countries, and other ports around the Baltic Sea, make sea level measurements in those ports a measure of PGR, not sea level. Fortunately, accurate GPS PGR measurements have been made for nearly all the tide gauges in the world, and these measurements can be used to correct the tide gauge sea level measurements.
Fifteen tide gauge records from around the world were downloaded from PSMSL Explorer, and one record from Amsterdam NAP. These were selected based on quality: (no quality red flags), length (over 100 years preferred), good continuity, low PGR, and low tectonic activity in the area. These were normalized to their average level in the period from 1960 to 1980, then corrected for PGR. The result is Figure 1.

Figure 1 is the normalized data from 16 quality long record tide gauges.
Figure 2 below is the average of the tide gauge data in Figure 1.

This is the average of 15 Mean Sea Level (MSL) records since 1958, 11 from 1948 to 1958, at least 10 since 1900, at least 7 from 1885, at least 5 since 1864, 4 since 1849, and 2 for most of the period since 1807.

Figure 3 is a chart from climatedata.info. This is presented as a validation of figure 2.
We see an indication here that sea level has been rising since about 1855 to 1860. Before that, sea level was flat or falling. Here is a chart showing trends in thirty-year intervals.

Figure 4 is chart of sea level trends since 1810 using the averaged data from figure 2.
The sea level trend was nearly flat in the whole of the 1800’s, trending up 0.4 mm/year in the first half of the century, then up by 0.9 mm/year in the last half, as the Little Ice Age ended in mid-century. In the whole of the 20th century the trend was up by less than 1.7 mm/year. All together, there has been a sea level rise of about 25 cm in the last 150 years, or about 10 inches. There the trend slowed during the cool 1950 to 1980 period, then increased to 2.25 mm/year in the warming years late in the century. The satellite record begins in the bottom of the cooling years of the Pinatubo volcanic eruption. That is why that record, combined with the artificial GIA/PGA 0.3 mm/year “correction” is listed in U of Colorado satellite data as having a 3.2 ± 0.4 mm/year trend.

Figure 5a, the sea level trend since 1890. Figure 5b, the sea level rise in the last 33 years.
The recent upward tick in 2012 and 2013 due to rebound from the 2011 La Niña is just two years long, and is not nearly as dramatic as several previous short increases and decreases in the record. These are all due to short periods of warming and cooling associated with El Niños, La Niñas, and volcanic events. The 1983 and 1992 El Chichon and Pinatubo volcanic cooling events are particularly obvious in Figure 5b.
We do have one good sea level record from before 1800. The Dutch have been very concerned about sea level for a very long time, as a third of their country is below it.

Figure 6 is a Huddestenen, named for Amsterdam Mayor Hudde, a marble block set in 1684, 2.67 meters above Amsterdam level.
After a severe flood in 1675, the mayor of Amsterdam decided that the only way to make sure dikes were high enough to prevent flooding was to know precisely where the tops of the dikes were relative to the normal high water mark. To that end, during the year 1683 to 1684, September to September, daily records were kept of the tide, and an average high water mark was calculated. Since that time records have been maintained and an almost continuous sea level record exists from 1700 to 1925. This record is called the “Normaal Amsterdams Peil” (NAP) or the Amsterdam Ordinance Datum sea level record. Here is that record, corrected for PGR (or GIA), normalized to and plotted with the average from Figure 2.

Figure 7 is 330 years of measured sea level data.
The sea level rise over the last 200 years, from 1807, is no more than 27 cm, or about 11 inches. In the 125 years before that, there was no rise at all.
So…what will happen in the future? If the cooling predicted by the adherents to the solar climate driver hypothesis comes to pass, then in the next thirty years we will get a hesitation in sea level rise similar to the 1950 to 1980 period. Much of the easily melted ice stored during the Little Ice Age has melted already, so only the large ice reservoirs, Greenland and Antarctica, can contribute to sea level rise. Most of the rise from pumping aquifers and draining land-locked lakes has reached a limit. Thermosteric rise due to ocean heating has reached a limit due to increased evaporation from tropical seas. If all these are taken into account, sea level rise in the remainder of the the 21st century cannot exceed that in the last century, or about 1.7 mm/year, and perhaps less. This indicates a sea level rise by the year 2100 of less than 15 centimeters, or less than six inches.
In areas with glacial rebound, sea level rise will not be noticed at all. In areas with subsidence, the subsidence should be of concern. In the rare areas where neither is happening, normal dike and seawall maintenance and normal replacement of infrastructure will suffice. Coral Islands can grow upwards at 1 cm/year, so will have no problem with a sea level rise 1/6th of that. If the past is any indication of the future, there is little to fear from sea level rise.

"Lewis Hamilton has said he wants to play a fundamental part in Formula One’s ambitious and radical plans to address the climate emergency. Hamilton has repeatedly made his concern for the environment clear and has committed to pursuing a sustainable lifestyle. The British driver, who goes into this weekend’s Brazilian Grand Prix having won his sixth world championship, believes F1 faces a difficult challenge but one on which he is committed to working.  This week Formula One announced its intention to reach a target of becoming carbon neutral by 2030. The plan – announced by Chase Carey, chief executive of the F1 owner, Liberty Media – is a major initiative for the sport, which undertook a comprehensive study of its environmental footprint over the past 12 months. “I don’t see why it won’t happen,” Hamilton said. “I am definitely open to working with F1 and the FIA. I have been talking to Chase for nearly three years saying we have to do something together. We haven’t figured out what that role is but it is something in this area.” Hamilton believes a concerted effort was required across the sport. “Anything is possible as long as they mean it,” he said of the proposals. “You have to put your mind to it. It’s not like we have a lack of money to make the changes, the teams have to want to do it. My team, Mercedes, does. “I’ve not heard about Ferrari or any of the other teams but they need to be on the same journey because it is going to take the whole of the sport to make the change.” F1’s review revealed the sport produced 256,000 tons of CO2 in a season. With 10 teams competing across 21 races around the world and the calendar expanding to 22 meetings next year, achieving the target of a net carbon impact of zero in 11 years will be a major task. Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel was also vehement the sport should be acting swiftly. “It’s a great message and it’s about time,” he said. “It’s great to see people can make decisions and make a change. It is an ambitious target but I would like to see some of the goals achieved sooner. It is a must in our times and we can’t afford to wait. “The challenge is quite clear. To improve our sport, enhance the show, grow passion based on the values that we share but make them sustainable. It is an incredible challenge but about time.” F1 has also committed to making all grands prix fully sustainable events by 2025. The carbon zero target is to be pursued by the development of a carbon neutral power unit using synthetic fuel; using renewable energy across the sport’s facilities, offices and factories; ensuring the logistics and travel are as efficient as possible and using carbon capture and tree-planting to offset anything that cannot be eliminated."
"They are one of the most unwelcome signs of summer. Buzzing through beer gardens, attacking innocent picnics, wasps arrive ominously with a sting in their tails. Universally disliked, they are swatted, trapped and cursed. But would a wasp-free world really be a better place?  Despite their poor public image, wasps are incredibly important for the world’s economy and ecosystems. Without them, the planet would be pest-ridden to biblical proportions, with much reduced biodiversity. They are a natural asset of a world dominated by humans, providing us with free services that contribute to our economy, society and ecology.  Wasps, as we know, turn up everywhere. More than 110,000 species have been identified, and it is estimated there are still another 100,000 waiting to be discovered. One recent study described 186 new wasp species in one small corner of Costa Rican rainforest alone. In contrast there are only around 5,400 species of mammals, and 14,000 recorded species of ant. This huge and diverse assemblage belongs to the order Hymenoptera and is divided into two groups, the Parasitica and the Aculeata. Almost 80,000 species of wasps belong to the Parasitica group, which lay their eggs in or on their prey or plants using elongated tubular organs called ovipositors. The remaining 33,000 species are Aculeates, most of which are predators, and the ones whose ovipositors have been modified through evolution to form a sting.  Both parasitic and predatory wasps have a massive impact on the abundance of arthropods, the largest phylum in the animal kingdom, which includes spiders, mites, insects, and centipedes. They are right at the top of the invertebrate food chain. Through the regulation of both carnivorous and plant-feeding arthropod populations, wasps protect lower invertebrate species and plants. This regulation of populations is arguably their most important role, both ecologically and economically. Although the majority of wasps lead solitary lives, it is the 1,000 or so species of social wasps which make the biggest impression on insect populations. Social wasp queens share their nests with thousands of offspring workers, who raise upwards of 10,000 sibling larvae during the colony cycle. This means a single nest provides a whopping bang for buck in terms of ecosystem services, killing vast numbers of spiders, millipedes and crop-devouring insects.  Many social wasps are generalist predators too, which means they control populations of a wide range of species, but rarely wipe any single species out. This makes them an extremely useful, minimising the need for toxic pesticides, but unlikely to threaten prey biodiversity. It is not yet possible to accurately quantify their huge economic value in this regard, but their diet of agricultural pests such as caterpillars, aphids and whiteflies makes a massive contribution to global food security.  Wasps also play a crucial role in ecosystems as specialist pollinators. The relationship between figs and fig wasps is arguably the most interdependent pollination symbiosis known to man. Without one another, neither the fig nor fig wasp can complete their life-cycle – a textbook example of co-evolution which is estimated to have been ongoing for at least 60m years. Figs are keystone species in tropical regions worldwide – their fruit supports the diets of at least 1,274 mammals and birds. The extinction of fig wasps would therefore be catastrophic in tropical ecosystems. Almost 100 species of orchids are solely reliant on the action of wasps for pollination. The plants mimic the appearance and chemical profile of female wasps, tricking males into attempting to mate with them, so that as the male wasps attempt to copulate with the flower they are loaded with pollen which is then transferred to the next male-seducing orchid. Without the wasp, these orchids would be extinct.  Wasps also function as generalist pollinators, inadvertently transferring pollen between flowers they visit for nectar collection. One type even provide their larvae with pollen instead of insect prey. These “pollen-wasps” are considered to perform the same ecological roles as bees, pollinating a diverse array of plants.  Unfortunately, while bees are credited with contributing at least €100 billion a year to the global economy through their acts of pollination, the works of wasps in the same sector is often ignored. Even the wasps’ sting could have a positive impact on the human population. Medical researchers are exploring the potential use of biologically active molecules found within wasp venom for cancer therapy. A chemical found in the venom of the tropical social wasp Polybia paulista, has been shown to selectively destroy various types of cancerous cells.  Since they protect our crops, make ecosystems thrive, sustain fruit and flowers, and might help us fight disease, perhaps we should appreciate the wonderful work of wasps before we next swipe at them with a rolled up newspaper. They may be a nuisance on a sunny afternoon - but a world without wasps would be an ecological and economic disaster."
"In a dispiriting political week like the one we’ve just had, it helps to keep things simple. Let’s begin with the organising idea of the week, where various politicians asserted, both in measured ways and unhinged ways, that it was inappropriate to talk about climate change while bushfires ravaged the country. Let’s be clear about what this line of argument is.  It’s self-serving crap. It is entirely possible to have a sensible discussion about climate change and the risks it poses, including the risks of longer and more intense fire seasons, and still do all the things that need to be done to protect lives and property. We have that bandwidth. In fact Australia demonstrated amply over the course of the past few days our collective capacity to walk and chew gum at the same time. Despite all the finger waggling from politicians, or perhaps because of it, the climate conversation happened in tandem with heroic efforts by emergency services workers to save lives and contain the damage. In fact, the most compelling part of the conversation about bushfires being a symptom of climate change was led by emergency service workers: a coalition of former fire chiefs, who point blank refused various invitations from politicians to shut up. Given there is no law that says bushfires preclude sensible, evidence-based policy conversations, it’s reasonable to ask why this particular prohibition was asserted. The answer to that is simple. The Coalition does not want its record raked over at a time when Australians are deeply anxious, because it’s hard to control the narrative in those conditions. The government does not want people who are not particularly engaged in politics, and who make a point of not following Canberra’s periodically rancid policy debates (and climate is the most toxic of the lot), switching on to this issue at a time where they have a personal stake in the conversation. While Scott Morrison has acknowledged there is a link between climate change and natural disasters, and in attitudinal terms that acknowledgement is a positive development, it’s not really in the prime minister’s interests for anyone to press very assertively on that pressure point, particularly not at a time when the prolonged drought (another symptom of climate change) is already making the Coalition’s supporters restive. Morrison doesn’t invite the climate action interrogation, because the government’s record is abysmal, and I don’t invoke that word lightly. The Liberal and National parties have done everything within their collective power to frustrate climate action in Australia for more than a decade. The Coalition repealed the carbon price. They attempted to gut the renewable energy target. They imposed fig-leaf policies costing taxpayers billions that have failed to stop emissions rising every quarter. Lest this wrecking, self-interested, destructive behaviour seem a quirk of history – a quaint vestige of the Abbott era curtailed by the sensible man in the Lodge – be reminded that the Liberals blasted Malcolm Turnbull out of the prime ministership only last August in part for the thought crime of trying to impose a policy mechanism that would have reduced emissions in the electricity sector. Not content with that, the Coalition, Morrison and his ministers, also claimed during the May election that an emissions reduction target broadly consistent with climate science would be a wrecking ball in the Australian economy. Not content with that, Morrison and his ministers characterised a sensible policy by Labor to try and encourage the electrification of the car fleet to reduce emissions in transport as a “war on the weekend”. What Australian voters needed after the election in May was a government of whatever stripe prepared to put the country on an orderly path towards decarbonisation. But what the Coalition needed was different. It wanted to remain in power, and one of the principle means to power it deemed necessary proved to be convincing voters in the outer suburbs and regions that Bill Shorten was crazy and shifty about climate change and would confiscate your ute. To put this point very starkly, there was a climate election in May, and the climate lost. I hope it’s clear by now, as a consequence of this heart-warming romp through recent political history, that the arbitrary prohibition of the week – we can’t talk about climate because the country is burning – is about politics, and about self-interest, and not about anything else. And rather than applying false balance and blaming everyone and declaring the whole business of politics and democracy a debacle, let’s also acknowledge that everyone has certainly stuffed up at one point or another, but one political movement more than any other bears the responsibility for Australia’s failure to get on with the necessary transition to low emissions. That’s the Liberal and National parties. The only way the Coalition can make this right is if Morrison uses the coming parliamentary term to execute a significant pivot on climate change. I think he’s capable of it, and there are some nascent signs that a pivot of some kind is in progress, but I don’t know if Morrison will do it, because unfortunately for all of us, he’s worked out you can win an election by not doing it, and right now he’s flirting with division as a management strategy. A couple more things need to be said about the dumpster fire of the week. The first is the Nationals leader Michael McCormack needs to reflect on whether the most productive approach to leading his sulking, riven, party room is to try and out-Barnaby-Joyce Barnaby Joyce. It is possible that McCormack’s “raving lunatics” intervention on Monday did help the government turn the negative media narrative away from itself and back towards the Greens. It is possible this was less bumbling word salad from a bloke who can’t quite nail his job and more a tactical contribution to the outrage economy. Stoking the outrage economy, inviting people to substitute tribalism for reason, is, after all, powerful in the current political age. You’ve probably noticed that a lot of mainstream media business models are now rooted in tribalism, and tribalism is most of what you get on social media. So I’m happy to acknowledge that McCormack may be a brilliant political operative cunningly disguised as a leader struggling to keep his head above water, but at what price? How long will the primary constituents of the National party, the people on the frontline of the drought, people battling fires, put up with being treated like numpties by the party that is supposed to represent their material interests? I also need to touch down on the Greens, and their positioning this week. Do we think anything that the Greens said this week shifted one vote, or changed one mind? It’s kind of silly to eviscerate the Greens for doing what Greens do, and that’s argue a forceful case for saving the planet. That’s what they are in parliament to do. The big hint is in the name of their political party. But it’s not silly to ask whether their interventions are helping their avowed cause. I think we’ve reached a point after 10 years of wreckage and failure where the Greens need to ask themselves much more often than they do whether their current approach to prosecuting climate action is bringing Australia any closer to progress. I don’t intend to revisit the poor decision a decade ago to vote down Labor’s carbon pollution reduction scheme, at least not in this outing, given that all that prompts is a screaming match. There’s a new question I want to pose, very directly and specifically: did the Greens’ campaigning in the May election ultimately advance the cause of climate action, or did it set back the cause of climate action? One concrete example might assist. Did the anti-Adani convoy that Bob Brown’s foundation sent into Queensland help or hurt Labor’s chances of winning government in May? The Greens will argue that Labor’s climate policy offering in 2019 was deficient, so it’s all fair game, but the fact of the matter is there are currently two parties of government in Australia, and one of them had a much better platform for climate action that the other one. The party of government with the better climate policy lost the election, and Labor’s campaign review pointed to the negative impact of the Adani convoy as one of many reasons for the defeat. It was clear the Greens campaign reflected an assumption that Labor was already across the line, so the principle play was influencing the Labor prime minister in waiting – an assumption that events subsequently proved incorrect. Greens supporters seem comforted by the fact their parliamentary representatives have the best climate policy on offer. This level of comfort never ceases to confuse me as a citizen who accepts the science of climate change, not as a point of devotion, or religious belief, or shots fired in a culture war, or as a manifestation of my fandom of any political movement – but as a rational, evidence-based fact. Let’s end on this note of clarity: best policies, declarative statements, well meaning motions in the Senate, are all terrific. But they mean nothing at all, change nothing at all, advance nothing at all, if they can’t be translated into practical action."
"Donald Trump, president of the world’s second greatest emitter of CO₂, has unilaterally withdrawn the US from the Paris climate agreement. The international response has been largely in line with the simple statement from the EU’s climate action commissioner, Miguel Arias Canete, that this was “a sad day for the global community”. But was it? Why Trump has chosen to pull out, and predictions on the policy implications are already well-documented elsewhere. As a social psychologist, I’m more fascinated by the implications for the social processes involved in responding effectively to climate change as a global community.  Social psychological research tells us that we form a sense of who we are from the groups we identify with (in-groups), and, at least as importantly, the groups we don’t (out-groups). Group membership can significantly predict a range of behaviours. For example, we are often more willing to help in-group members and quicker to denigrate members of out-groups. But if common goals arise – by design or default – they have the potential to unite otherwise distinct groups and create a shared or “superordinate” identity that can transcend everyday distinctions and the divisiveness that often accompanies them. At first glance, a problem like climate change could be thought of as the ultimate international superordinate goal, with the Paris Agreement as its unifying totem. As climate scientist Simon Lewis put it in a piece for The Conversation, “The most striking thing about the agreement is that there is one. For all countries … to all agree to globally coordinate action on climate change is astonishing.” But as Professor Lewis also points out, the main problem is that success depends on everybody doing their bit, and plenty of co-ordinated global policy changes. If, at the regular five-yearly stock takes, countries see others fudging or reneging, the precarious superordinate identity holding it all together will start to fray. There’s plenty of scope for evasion, hypocrisy and bluster built into the agreement, and there are no penalties for not complying. As one Conversation commentator pithily put it in response to Trump’s withdrawal: Despite Paris, we are clearly some way off a sufficient superordinate identity. Just look at the huge inequality between nations in terms of vulnerability to climate change, responsibility for causing it, and ability to do anything about it. My point here is that climate change requires a great deal of collective determination and action that is not yet clearly or consistently present at the level of nation states. Trumps’ withdrawal is a highly relevant intervention in this context, but not in the way we might think. Perhaps surprisingly, the concept of “paradoxical intervention”, borrowed from psychotherapy, explains why. Paradoxical interventions were developed in the 1980s as a creative approach to difficult psychological symptoms. They are designed to achieve the opposite of what they appear to set out to do, because of the strong counter response they provoke.  This might involve asking a client to spend time fully enacting their symptoms, with the effect that behaviours perceived as involuntary becomes experienced as voluntary. Or it might involve forbidding a client to do something in the hope that they actually carry it out (the classic example is telling couples in therapy struggling with intimacy that they must not, under any circumstances, have sex between this and the next session). But what’s this got to do with Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris accord, group dynamics and superordinate goals? Well, his decision could fatally threaten the shaky superordinate premise of cooperative climate action, leaving it on the brink of collapse into in-fighting or despair. However, it might paradoxically achieve the opposite of what Trump appears to want – question the reality and urgency of climate change.   The US exit might galvanise determined communities and nation states around the world to take notice again, close ranks, form new alliances. It might start to look like the development of a shared “quest narrative”, which George Marshall, founder of the Climate Outreach and Information Network, considers in his recent book to be a vital but elusive ingredient in successfully responding to climate change. A quest narrative is another way of describing a superordinate identity. We see some hints of this already, such as Canadian and Indian heads of state reiterating their desire to co-operate in the wake of the US withdrawal, and a more general reiteration of commitment from China and elsewhere. Meanwhile within the US, a coalition of various states, city mayors and other representatives have already pledged to adhere to the Paris Agreement. Yes, Paris is promising but it is still easily rendered inadequate. Against this backdrop, we could almost see Trump’s withdrawal as a paradoxical intervention designed to kick-start a resurgent climate movement and revive a superordinate identity. I did say almost."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski at the online Spiegel today features the controversy surrounding the mobbing of distinguished climate scientist Lennart Bengtsson.
The story covers the events leading up to Bengtsson’s resignation from the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). Spiegel writes:
The consequences have shocked Bengtsson – and shaken science”.
Concerning the rejection of Bengtsson’s paper by the journal Environmental Research Letters last February, which according to the publisher Nicola Gulley was based on “scientific reasons”, Spiegel quotes Hans von Storch:
‘Scandalous’, Hans von Storch of the Helmholtz Centre in Geesthacht finds the resaoning behind it: The journal obviously did not go by the scientific norms, but rather political utility.”
The Spiegel article features comments from the other scientists, from the side accused of the bullying. According to Spiegel, NASA climate scientist Gavin Schmidt calls the accusations made by Bengtsson “ridiculous”.
Over all the Spiegel article hardly depicts a science that is settled by a consensus among the experts, but rather portrays one that is bitterly and heatedly disputed. Indeed Spiegel even cites Michael Mann‘s characterization of “Climate Wars”. Spiegel adds: “One Austrian professor even requested the death penalty for climate skeptics.
Clearly climate science is all dispute, and no consensus whatsoever.
The Bengtsson controversy prompts Spiegel to pose a series of questions:
Is their science suffering from peer pressure? Is the pressure from consensus too large? Is criticism being suppressed? At stake is the very credibility of the results of climate change. Can we still trust climate science?”

GWPF accused of being “pseudoscientific”
Spiegel also puts the spotlight on the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), the skeptic organization that Bengtsson was pressured to resign from. Bojanowski calls it a “lobby group“, and quotes Swiss climatologist Reto Knutti of the ETH in Zurich who says: “Organisations like the’GWPF’ contribute to turning the scientific debate into a religious war – they spread pseudoscientific reports even though they are on a political mission.”
Spiegel also quotes Jochen Marotzke, director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, who accuses the GWPF of cherry-picking science and “mentioning only arguments that serve the purpose.”
According to Spiegel, Myles Allen of the University of Oxford calls the GWPF an organization that pushes an “anti-science-agenda“. Even the “skeptical environmental scientist” Roger Pielke junior of the University of Colorado says the GWPF has a political agenda that is “dressed as science“. But Pielke adds that the “GWPF also pursues legitimate targets that a democracy needs to debate“.
“Shocking how colleagues reacted”
On the mobbing and attempted marginalization of Bengtsson specifically, Pielke also comments at Spiegel that he agrees the mobbing-type behavior is a problem in climate science. “My experience is in full agreement with the accusations made by Bengtsson.”
Spiegel writes that Bengtsson also has support, for example, from Heinrich Miller of the Alfred-Wegener-Institute: “I think it’s shocking how his colleagues reacted. Obviously there’s a prevailing disappointment that that a leading figure is making scientific doubt public.” Bojanowski writes that both sides are busily accusing the other of politicizing science.
Near the end, Spiegel writes of how much uncertainty a science can bear and of the lacking consensus.  Bojanowski cites Heinrich Miller:
Climate warming is understood as a dogma, and whoever expresses doubt is evil.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Swiss 20min.ch here reports on a new study just appearing in the latest Nature Geoscience, authored by devout warmist climate scientist Reto Knutti of the Zurich ETH.
Knutti’s study and the 20min.ch article are in a panicked scramble to explain why there hasn’t been any warming in more than 15 years, insisting that global warming has only paused and eventually will resume with renewed vigor – at time yet to be determined time in the future.
The title of the 20min.ch piece is: “Climate Warming Takes a Break“.
The 20min.ch introduction reads:
Climate warming continues, but it’s taking a break. The reasons for that, among others, are the temporary weak solar irradiance and phenomena such as La Niña.”
The tone of the 20min.ch article is one of shaking a finger at the incorrigible, irresponsible and manipulative climate skeptics and advising readers to not stop being afraid and to never ever believe those skeptics.
Litany of excuses
Citing Prof Knutti’s ETH, 20min.ch writes that “multiple possible reasons have been systematically investigated for the first time.”
The all new litany of excuses they present includes:
* aerosols (of course)
* La Niña
* weaker solar radiation
* low sunspot number
* volcano eruptions
* inadequate, unreliable temperature measurement methodology!
That’s right, all the factors that they stupidly refused to adequately incorporate in their models, despite being told time and again by skeptics not to neglect them. Now they are FINALLY telling us there’s indeed a Mai Tai cocktail of natural reasons for the absence of warming.

Antsy warmists
Their panic is truly palpable, at least in Switzerland. Knutti and his fellow warmists are so antsy about rescuing their warming that he is now actively hinting at making up temperature data. The 20min.ch writes that according to Knutti, satellites “do not deliver any data on especially high upward spikes. As a result the average temperature has been under-stated.”
To me that is a clear statement advocating adjusting the data upwards. He talks about the lack of Arctic stations and hints at “filling in” where data do not exist…i.e. making them up. And speaking of the temporary cooling impacts, Knutti insists:
They don’t change anything when it comes to the longer term climate warming due to the greenhouse gas emissions.”
All sounds like a religion desperately clinging to doctrine.
How much longer must we wait?
So just how much longer are we supposed to wait before these “temporary, short-term”  climate factors go away? 2 years? 5 years? 20 years? A couple of generations?
Gradually, but with increasing acceleration, scientists in lots of other fields are beginning to see this type of sorrowful climate science as a monumental laughing stock.
They can adjust upwards and fill in all they want, but it is not going to keep the sea ice from setting new all-time record highs and frosts and snows from blanketing us in the wintertime, or in August. Eventually it’s all going to collapse and the only place global warming will continue existing will be at the nuthouse.

"Across the world, almost three billion people do not have the luxury of a flushing toilet. Instead they rely on static sanitation systems, like pit latrines to deal with their waste. As these are not often connected to a sewer, they require manual emptying and disposal.  Poor understanding of the risks involved means that untreated sludge is often thrown into nearby fields and rivers. The impact of this can be devastating. Germs found in faecal sludge cause illnesses such as diarrhoea which results in the deaths of more than 750,000 children under five every year.  Yet it is estimated that every dollar invested in better sanitation returns up to US$5.50 in social and economic benefits. These come through increased productivity, reduced healthcare costs and prevention of illness and early death.  A crucial part of improving sanitation lies in researching and developing simpler, more efficient ways of treating sludge in places where a sewerage and centralised waste water treatment is not available. My research is part of a partnership with the engineering firm Buro Happold (BH) who were asked by WaterAid Bangladesh to find a sludge treatment technology which was effective, practical and affordable.  After considering options which included biogas and pit additives – products used to try and reduce sludge volume – the company opted for unplanted drying beds. They are simple in design and make use of the reasonable amount of sunshine in Bangladesh. Drying beds dry out the sludge through the processes of evaporation and drainage. As it loses water, the temperature within the sludge rises, killing off some of the germs it contains. Once dried to a suitable consistency for removal, the sludge is composted to allow safe use in agriculture as a soil conditioner. My research aims to better understand the sludge drying process in these beds in order to estimate the time necessary before it is safe to remove, preventing untreated sludge being emptied into the environment. To do this, it’s necessary to make sludge in the laboratory, which replicates the chemical and physical properties of the real stuff as closely as possible. By doing so we can perform safe, reproducible drying tests to ascertain how real sludge will dry in a tropical climate. Aside from being full of germs, faecal sludge is highly variable in terms of its chemical and physical composition. One study investigating the “output” of a group of healthy similarly aged men on a controlled diet for three weeks found noticeable differences in the chemical composition of their poo. Such variation is further amplified between different countries, climates and diets. The main chemical components of poo are fats, carbohydrates (fibre), nitrogenous material, minerals (mainly potassium, calcium and phosphorous) and microorganisms. In 2006 scientists developed a simulant for human poo to test the design of a waste collection system for a crew exploration vehicle for NASA. Using the known chemical composition, the NASA researchers developed a “recipe” that consisted of cellulose to represent the carbohydrates, yeast for the microorganisms, peanut oil for fats and carbohydrates, plus potassium chloride, calcium phosphate and water. Unfortunately the sludge that is dried on the drying beds in Bangladesh is slightly different to fresh poo as it has spent time either in a pit or a septic tank stabilising. This means that easily degradable components in fresh poo (carbohydrates, proteins and sugars) are broken down, leaving behind more stable ones. NASA’s recipe for fresh poo needed to be altered for our experiments to account for the changes and to better represent the characteristics of real faecal sludge. As part of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s Reinvent the Toilet Challenge in 2014, the Pollution Research Group in South Africa  altered the NASA recipe. They included the dietary supplement psyllium husk and miso paste for fibre, removed potassium chloride, added polyethylene glycol to aid water retention, active yeast to represent bacteria and changed cellulose to cotton linters and shredded tissue. We further altered this recipe to replace cotton linters with hemp as it was more readily available. Active yeast was replaced with brewer’s yeast as it is easier to purchase in bulk. Now that we have a suitable simulant for faecal sludge we are able to conduct tests on drying beds to better predict the drying behaviour of the sludge in a tropical climate. This could lead to the use of such beds on a much larger scale, meaning that instead of being left dangerously untreated, the poo has somewhere better to go."

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarly this week a German meteorologist tweeted that Germany had set a new record high for the date in the southern state of Baden Wurttemberg at a station called Rheinstetten. I was even told that the station was fairly new (and thus reliable?).
I’ve noticed that on hot days the Rheinstetten station always appeared to be at or near the top of the list for high temperatures, and so I decided to see if I could get more details about its actual siting to find out more on why this is so.
It turns out that the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) maintains the station and provides a good website with important station information. The simple map provided by the KIT site shows the station location (blue arrow) and that it is situated at the southwest end of a glider airfield.

Source: http://imkhp2.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ws_forch/
From the map we see that it is at least in a rural location. An aerial satellite view from Google Maps gives us much more detail:

Aerial satellite view of Rheinstetten weather station (yellow circle).
The yellow circle in the photo above shows the suspected location of the station. Its location was deduced by examining the photos of the station available at the KIT site.
The next photo is one of the photos, and it shows that the station is the mast at the far end of the building at the corner. Note how the station is right up close to the metal building. Do metal buildings get hot out in the sun?

At the front of the photo we also see a pavestone surface, some 12 meters away from the station mast. Roads are located near the mast as well. They appear to be asphalt surface but had been heavily soiled by excavation works right before the satellite photo was made. They could be gravel as well – hard to tell. Another wintertime photo shows vehicles parked close to the mast.
The next photo shows a close-up of the measurement station right near the corner of the metal building.

Source: http://imkhp2.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ws_forch/
The above photo appears to have been taken mid-morning in the summertime.  One could imagine that under certain conditions temperature reading could be easily corrupted by the metal building which acts as a heat source, especially in the afternoon. The KIT station website describes the station as follows:
The measurement station is located next to a living container at the gliding grounds of Rheinstetten. The glider grounds are approx. 2 km behind the southwest city limits of Karlsruhe. The surroundings are characterized by a mixture of agricultural land, fields, and some forest to the east. Overall the most optimum conditions prevail for meteorological measurements, especially for wind.”
And temperature? The site also gives information about the processing of recorded data.
The measured data are recorded on site at the gliding grounds using a PC. The computer connects to the recording system of the University of Karlsruhe and transmits the data every 10 minutes. The measured data are processed at the same intervals and displayed at this website.
On the graphics pay attention to the date and time given. In the event of an operational disruption, the data are not updated and so may be old. Longer periods of station inoperation can be read at the site “Statusmeldungen” [status reports]. There you will find information about operational disruptions and the transmitted data.”
Though the station is not horrendously sited, it appears the readings are corrupted and thus could be improved. If this site represents the general quality of Germany’s measurement network today, then we need to take Germany’s weather statistics with a grain of salt. Many German weather stations have been moved. And as we know from other countries, often these stations are moved to less than ideal locations, e.g. airports, next to parking lots and/or buildings.
I’m still trying to determine if this station is part of the German Weather Service (DWD) network. No other station seems to exist in the immediate area.

"Across New South Wales more than 575 schools will shut their doors on Tuesday, while aged care homes remain on high alert and animal shelters scramble to re-home pets as much of the state prepares for catastrophic fire conditions. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, declared a week-long state of emergency on Monday in the wake of devastating fires on the state’s mid-north coast in which three people died and at least 150 homes were destroyed. While favourable conditions helped ease the bushfire threat on Monday, more than 60 bushfires continue to ravage the state and the Bureau of Meteorology has forecast “hot, dry and gusty winds” on Tuesday which “will generate very dangerous fire conditions across large parts of the state”. More than 1,300 firefighters have been mobilised and the chief of the defence force has ordered defence bases to provide any assistance requested by local firefighters. The severe fire danger prompted the Rural Fire Service to declare a catastrophic fire danger warning for large chunks of the state, including in the greater Sydney area, the Hunter, Illawarra and Shoalhaven regions. It is the first time the warning has been issued in greater Sydney and the first state of emergency since October 2013, when major bushfires killed two people and destroyed hundreds of homes in the state’s Blue Mountains region. Both the premier and the commissioner of the RFS, Shane Fitzsimmons, urged people living in the catastrophic areas to head for built-up areas, with Berejiklian urging people to “for heaven’s sake stay away from bushland”. “Fires are starting extremely quickly, easily and spreading very, very quickly,” Fitzsimmons told reporters on Monday. “We cannot guarantee a fire truck at every home, we cannot guarantee an aircraft will be overhead every time a fire is impacting on your property, we cannot guarantee that someone will knock on the door and give you a warning that there’s fires nearby, and we certainly cannot guarantee that despite our best efforts the technological tools available will deliver you a message in time.” A community newsletter released on Monday afternoon told Coffs Harbour and Bellingen residents in areas west of the Pacific highway to self-relocate to a major urban area like Coffs Harbour, Woolgoolga, Sawtell, Bellingen, Urunga and Dorrigo, but warned that some places east of the highway are not safe enough to take refuge. The warnings have put much of the state on high alert. Parents will be scrambling to find alternative arrangements for their children after the NSW government again increased the number of schools and Tafe campuses which will close on Tuesday. The full list of government and non-government schools and Tafe campuses now numbers more than 575. “The schools that are operational tomorrow have comprehensive emergency management plans in place which will be activated if required,” the department said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Aged care providers have been put on notice that evacuations could be necessary. “In anticipation of hot, dry and windy conditions forecast for Tuesday 12 November, all of Anglicare’s staff are reviewing the evacuation plans and making sure all contact lists are up to date,” the Anglicare spokeswoman Tess Delbridge said. On the central coast, north of Sydney, the Gosford pound was calling for volunteers to help with short-term re-homing. “We are asking if there are any coasties who would be willing to collect a dog either this afternoon or tomorrow morning to crash at your home until Wednesday,” the organisation wrote on Facebook. When Guardian Australia called the shelter on Monday, a staff member said, “I’ve got about 30 people here wanting to look after dogs.”  Berejiklian said on Monday she had declared a state of emergency at the request of the RFS. “With catastrophic weather conditions predicted for this week, particularly Tuesday with hot weather and strong winds, I have decided to take the commissioner’s advice and make this declaration,” Berejiklian said. “Everybody has to assume the worst and we cannot allow complacency to creep in.” It comes after fires tore through the mid-north coast of NSW over the weekend, killing three people and leaving 100 more injured, including 20 firefighters. Ten of the more than 60 fires in NSW remained at watch and act level on Monday evening. Dael Allison, from the tiny NSW town of Bobin, north-west of Taree, said at least a dozen people she knew had lost their homes. “Bobin is shocking,” she says. “Bobin is devastated. There would be entire hillsides that wouldn’t have a tree standing.” Allison drove with her partner, Rick Haughton, and son from Port Stephens to Bobin on Sunday to check on friends and on their property, where they grow eucalypts. The main house is still standing but sheds, the original cottage they built and that their children spent the first years of their lives in, and most of the land are burned out. “We’ve had fires but I’ve never seen anything like this,” Allison said. “I’ve never seen fires that come right down to the water level of the creek. “I don’t know where fire crews are getting their water from. “The whole area is just on fire. At least a dozen people I know have lost houses. That would be nowhere near the final count.” The RFS inspector Ben Shepherd warned people outside of the catastrophic fire danger areas that other parts of NSW would still have “severe and extreme” dangers on Tuesday. “We need to ensure that people understand there is a risk in all bushland areas, stretching from Bega all the way to Byron, from the Victorian border to the Queensland border,” he said. In Queensland, more than 65 fires were burning across the state on Monday evening, with firefighters battling three watch and act level fires at: Cobraball near Yeppoon, Townson and Thornton in the Lockyer Valley, and Clumber. Meanwhile, a bushfire threatened lives and properties in Rockingham, Western Australian, and homes and businesses in Port Lincoln, South Australia were threatened by an out-of-control bushfire on the outskirts of the Eyre peninsula town."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreens have been all excited about the recent, high publicity solar bike path put in operation in Holland this week. It’s a whole 100 meters or so long…a distance that allows the average cyclist to cycle over and to feel good about saving the planet for about 15 seconds.

NPR writes:
A Dutch project that integrates solar panels into a bike commuter path will officially open this week, on a special roadway outside Amsterdam. Power generated by the SolaRoad’s panels will be funneled into the national energy grid.”
Imagine that, the bike path will be feeding green power “into the national grid“.
That reminds me of the old Peanuts series where Linus once asked Charlie Brown how much allowance he got for feeding Snoopy. “10 cents a week,” Charlie Brown replied. Linus commented: “That helps boost the GNP”. At least for Snoopy it was something worthwhile.

The Guardian proudly trumpeted:
Solar panels embedded in the cycle path near Amsterdam could generate enough electricity to power three houses, with potential to extend scheme to roads.”
Vox.com here writes the bill for the road will be $3.7 MILLION dollars. For the price you’d think it would at least power an entire neighborhood or a small village. Vox writes:
But is this even practical? The bike path will cost roughly $3.7 million and, when it’s fully built out to 330 feet in 2016, will generate enough electricity to power… three households. Not very cost-effective. (That’s more than 1,000 times costlier than the price of rooftop solar electricity in the United States.)”
Of course much of the sum reflects a one time development cost. Even if the price gets driven down 95%, the problem of cost is still relevant and the sun barely ever shines in Amsterdam for much of the year. The horrendous cost of paving all of Holland’s extensive bike paths in the end would not eliminate a single coal power plant for the simple fact that the panels work only for a tiny fraction of the time and conventional power plants need to be on standby.
Then there are still the unanswered questions of how well the panels will hold up. One only needs to consider rain, snow, freeze-thaw cycles, vandalism, cleaning requirements etc.
Many of us have already thought that the idea of mounting them on the roofs of homes was already quite kooky and impractical enough, but the idea of putting them down on road surfaces really takes the economy cake.

"Even for modern Australian political discourse, it jarred. Michael McCormack, deputy prime minister and representative of regional and rural electorates, began the week by “calling out” those “raving inner-city lunatics” who dared to link climate change with Australia’s worsening bushfire season. “We’ve had fires in Australia since time began, and what people need now is a little bit of sympathy, understanding and real assistance – they need help, they need shelter,” McCormack told the national broadcaster. “They don’t need the ravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital city greenies at this time, when they’re trying to save their homes, when in fact they’re going out in many cases saving other peoples’ homes and leaving their own homes at risk.” The comments were made early Monday morning as the nation woke to learn it was facing a “catastrophic” fire emergency along much of the east coast, with worse conditions to come. Emotions were already high. Three people – Julie Fletcher, George Nole and Vivian Chaplain – had died in the 48 hours prior, as a firestorm swept across their northern New South Wales properties. Australia has always equated the start of summer with bushfire season. But every year it seems to get earlier. It began in September, the first month of spring, for Queensland, when fire crews battled to save life and property in areas which had stood untouched by bushfires for decades. Then, rainforest burned. Just over four weeks later and rural firefighter volunteers and emergency service personnel got the call again, with fires stretching from the mid-north coast of NSW to the Queensland border. Summer was yet to begin, and Australia was already on fire. McCormack’s comments followed criticism of a prime ministerial tweet offering “thoughts and prayers” as the bushfire crisis took hold. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been so directly and horribly impacted by these fires. https://t.co/XvgsLv4eht Scott Morrison, who less than three years ago smuggled a piece of coal into parliament as a question time prop, imploring “this is coal – don’t be afraid, don’t be scared” at the opposition, and now leads a government threatening to crack down on environmental activism against the resource sector, was condemned by Greens MPs for inaction on climate change. I’m deeply saddened by the loss of life. Hearts go out to all affected & to brave firefighters.But words & concern are not enough. The PM does not have the climate emergency under control.Unless we lead a global effort to quit coal & cut pollution, more lives will be lost. It was in that context that McCormack, in the face of disgruntled rumblings within his own party room, where a former leader who maintains electoral popularity and media cut-through still sits, turned his outrage meter to 11, sparking Australia’s week of stupid in the process. From the ABC studios in Sydney, the interview spread as quickly as smoke. From Ballarat in the south-east to South Australia’s border towns, Townsville in the north, Perth in the west and everywhere in between, McCormack’s “raving inner-city lunatics” comments overshadowed almost everything but the fire coverage itself. It set the tone for the week in political discourse. Wanting to talk about climate change as a cause of the increasingly unpredicted and unprecedented bushfires marked you as a “leftie”. Those on the right pointed to “Green party” policies as having stymied hazard reduction efforts and other fire preparations. Neither was true. But McCormack’s comments took hold, fuelling debate about whether or not Australia was allowed to have a debate on climate change as more than 100 fires scarred the landscape and capital cities were choked by  smoky haze. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning More than 2,000 news articles, opinion pieces, radio slots and TV segments were taken up by the comments. The prime minister and his opposition counterpart shared a “not today” unity ticket whenever climate change was raised, while authorities, past and current, stressed all preparations had been made within a shortening window of time, exacerbated by the record drought, as they tried to inject some facts into the debate. McCormack’s comments were still ringing around the country as the man who used to hold his position, as deputy prime minister and leader of the National party, attempted to interject his own take into the debate. Barnaby Joyce didn’t want to attack the Greens, he told Sky News, because two of the people who died, had “most likely” voted for the party. Joyce had raised his view of the deceased’s voting preference apropos of nothing. He’d been asked about firefighting resources, but the man once described as Australia’s “best retail politician” strayed into voting beliefs in a garbled bid to explain sections of his northern NSW electorate. “I acknowledge that the two people who died were most likely people who voted for the Green party, so I am not going to start attacking them,” he told Sky News, in comments that flashed around the nation. “That’s the last thing I want to do. What I wanted to concentrate on is the policies that we can [use to] mitigate these tragedies happening again in the future.” He agreed climate change was an issue but maintained the solution to Australia’s coming bushfire woes was to get back to hazard reduction burning, claiming fire authorities could do it in “the winter” and that the process “has been confounded by excessive bureaucracy”. “And I think that the bureaucracy is driven by, let’s call it by conservation principle, by people who do not live in the forest, they do not live near the area.” Again, fire authorities pushed back, calling out the claim as a furphy, and maintaining fire season preparation, including hazard reduction burns, had been done, but the old ways of preparing Australia’s bush no longer addressed the rapidly coming new normal. But more than 1,000 media pieces later, Joyce’s words had taken hold. The following day, they were echoed by a fellow backbencher, this time from the Liberal party benches, with Craig Kelly taking one line from a scientific paper which found the amount of land burned by wildfires had decreased globally by 24% in the past two decades, and using it to explain to Sky News why Australia’s early bushfire season, already rated catastrophic, was not overly unusual. But he neglected to mention the research pointing to human changes in the landscape, where environments had been altered for agriculture, as the leading explanation for the decrease. Instead, Kelly said, someone needed to tackle the Greens’ mentality that had led to a reduction in hazard reduction burns. Again, apolitical fire experts, who had been responsible for preparing entire Australian states for bushfire seasons, dismissed the claims as false. Misleading. A furphy. A lie. But with talkback radio hosts and TV talking heads “asking the question” of Australia’s political armchair expert class, the narrative stranglehold remained. On Tuesday, the same day Joyce was linking voting preferences with those who had died, the Greens senator Jordon Steele-John accused the major parties of being “no better than a bunch of arsonists” for supporting coal-fired power stations. “How dare any of you suggest that in this moment at this time it is appropriate to be prosecuting a piece of legislation with the aim of propping up coal,” he announced to the Senate chamber. “You are no better than a bunch of arsonists – borderline arsonists – and you should be ashamed.” The condemnation was swift. But again, the comments had taken hold. On Friday, after a week of back and forth about who was allowed to speak on what issues, and when, and a fourth death was announced, the National Parks Association of NSW issued a statement calling for the “all-too familiar claims after each fire disaster” – the lack of prescribed burning – to stop. “[It’s] not only unhelpful, it’s dangerous and takes away from the importance of developing new ways to deal with the increased threat fire is having on our communities.” What was needed, the group said, was pushing emotion to the side, and listening to the experts. “Focusing purely on hazard reduction, and in one tenure at that, is a recipe for future disaster.” At the same time, mayors of fire-stricken communities, representing a wide swathe of the political divide, came together to plead for the government to “acknowledge the link between climate change and bushfire,” and to provide more funding and leadership as Australia was pushed into a new reality: anticipating the previously unprecedented. But from the major parties and their leadership, there was nothing, as the “not today” bipartisan narrative held. With authorities warning the latest threat is not over, and to brace for a potentially catastrophic summer, it will be months before the smoke clears."
"Andrea Leadsom, the new Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, faces an unenviable task: putting farmers out of business. Those that survive will rely on advanced pesticides and intensified, genetically-modified crops. After Brexit, the UK is expected to leave the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) whatever arrangement it eventually negotiates (both Norway and Switzerland, for example, have opted out).  At first glance, this seems like something to celebrate. Most agree that the CAP is not a force for the good, and opposition unites everyone from radical environmentalists such as George Monbiot to establishment-friendly free-market newspaper The Economist. CAP payments benefit mostly large agribusinesses and can lead to wasteful overproduction. On a larger scale, it distorts agricultural prices and contributes to global poverty. Yet direct payments, or subsidies, from the CAP provide more than half of the income of the average UK farmer. Without EU subsidies, up to 90% of UK farms would not survive. The referendum campaign created a huge divide among UK farmers. EU subsidies and regulations conflict with farmers’ traditionally conservative economic principles, and some hung their hopes on the UK rather than Brussels. Indeed, Cameron pledged continued support for farmers in the event of Brexit. However, it is almost guaranteed that, in the medium if not the short term, Leadsom will oversee a huge reduction in subsidies.  The UK government will likely expose its farmers to competition from abroad. As stated in a House of Commons report published just after the Brexit vote, “The UK has always made clear that we would like to move away from subsidies in the long run.” It now has the opportunity to do so.  Also, farming is a small part of the overall UK economy, and not of great strategic importance. This means that the government may use reduction of farm subsidies as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations, so it can get a better deal in its priority areas, such as financial services. A huge amount hangs in the balance for farmers as they discover their role in the new economic order. Brexit will likely lead to dramatic changes in which crops are viable, and cause a significant number of UK farms to cease operations. Livestock will be particularly hard-hit: without subsidies, many livestock farmers would actually have negative incomes. The reduction and streamlining of regulation post-Brexit will be greeted as a victory for many farmers and may make them more competitive. Complying with EU agricultural regulations puts a huge burden on farmers and the government has already identified some as unnecessary “red tape”. However, this same red tape, viewed from another angle, is beneficial environmental regulation, and many in the green movement embrace the EU’s greater risk-aversion. For example, the UK government has expressed frustration about the precautionary approach that the EU takes to new technologies, particularly new pesticides, while environmentalists generally support these bans. Also, the government and public in England are less averse to genetically-modified organisms than most other Europeans. This suggests that more GMOs will be approved and used in the UK, again angering many environmentalists and alienating anti-GMO Scotland. Furthermore, as farmers struggle to make up income lost from subsidies, they will need to pursue higher yields and any newly-approved advanced crop technologies, such as pesticides and GMOs, that promise profits. Counterbalancing this, more than half of the food exported from the UK goes to the EU, making it the most important market for British farmers. In exchange for market access, the UK will probably adopt some EU regulation. Overall, however, environmental campaigners are likely to be unhappy with the UK’s greater risk-taking. Some of the CAP’s most vocal critics are environmentalists. Among their critiques is the fact that the CAP has led to poor land management practices. For example, to qualify for rigid payment requirements, UK farmers have ploughed up wildlife-rich pastures. Both the UK government and the green movement want more emphasis on the environmental benefits that farmers can provide, rather than simply giving them money. This informed the position of most environmental campaigners ahead of the referendum: stay in the EU and try to reform the CAP, as the potential benefits are huge.  Yet leaving the EU, and its common agricultural policy, does provide an opportunity to improve upon its failures. The CAP should be replaced by simpler regulation that supports UK ecosystems and encourages farmers to look after their land. Over the coming months, this is precisely the message that Leadsom needs to hear."
"We are told that we are a nation of couch potatoes, lacking the will and the strength to turn around the obesity tanker. We all need a little help in our quest for a healthier life and design can play a crucial part. If we designed our towns, cities, homes and workplaces more like animal experts design zoos, we could be one step nearer to reaching our fitness goals – as long as we can have some fun along the way. It is reported that British people will be the fattest in Europe by 2025 and that if we want to reverse this we should have a healthier lifestyle by exercising more and eating less. But we are often made to feel guilty for not sticking to theses healthy lifestyle plans. I would suggest that before we start blaming people for adopting sedentary lifestyles, we should be taking a step back to look at the design of the environments, towns and cities in which we live. The link between the design of the built and natural environment and its role in our health and well-being has been well explored. Now new research, led by Lancaster University, on “design for health” suggests that the environment, including buildings, cities, urban spaces and transport infrastructure, is closely linked to the lifestyles we adopt.  What is abundantly clear is that, as we shape our environment, it is also shaping us. Our psychological, physiological and physical status as well as our interactions with other people and with the natural environment are all affected. A key challenge that governments and policy makers worldwide are facing is how our built environment and infrastructure should be shaped to support healthier behaviours to prevent disease.  First, we should stop focusing on methods that tell people what to (or not to) do and which attempt to change their behaviour simply through media campaigns and punitive measures, such as tax schemes. While seeking to minimise the barriers that prevent healthy behaviours, we should make sure that the design of new environments is taken into account. A good model would be to look at how zoos are designed. Before a zoo is built, it is common practice for zoologists, biologists, animal psychologists, nutritionists, architects, designers and landscape architects to work closely together to create an environment that optimises the living conditions for the animals.  Important environmental elements, such as vegetation, habitat, lighting, materials and each animal’s requirements are taken into account. The ultimate aim is to design an environment that fully supports the animals’ physical, psychological and social well-being. Ironically, we do not seem to make the same demands when a town, neighbourhood or workplace environment for humans is planned and designed. Another opportunity that has recently emerged is the healthy new town NHS initiative. The aim is to radically rethink how we live and take an ambitious look at improving health through the built environment. Ten demonstrator towns will be built across England with community health and well-being as their main focus. Clinicians, designers and technology experts will reimagine how healthcare can be delivered in these places. Although this is a step in the right direction, what it is currently missing is the more holistic approach we have seen in the design of the zoos.  A crucial element in designing these towns so they are places that people would want to live in, is to include community members in their creation. This strategy would help design-in health-promoting behaviours, such as access to healthy food outlets or green spaces in which people can walk and exercise.  Playful design – the mapping of playful experiences from games and toys to other non-game contexts – can play an important role here in inviting and encouraging people towards healthier alternatives. For example, the piano stairs project in Stockholm, which converts the metro stairs into a giant functioning piano keyboard – much like the piano made famous in the Tom Hanks movie Big (1988) – demonstrates great promise. It encourages commuters to opt for the intriguing new stairway instead of the escalators to enjoy making musical movements as they go up and down. A project in The Netherlands, meanwhile, illustrates how everyday street furniture, such as lampposts, benches and bollards, can be inexpensively converted into impromptu exercise devices, inviting people to engage in casual activity and socialise with their neighbours.  We could therefore envisage several other contexts were playfulness can transform mundane everyday activities into fun ones that encourage people into a more active and social lifestyle.  We could convert building walls into activity walls to encourage stretching of arms and legs through touch; redesign public squares and walkways into interactive dance floors that invite movement and guide you through a city; and transform workplace spaces and public places into “playgrounds” that boost movement and productivity and decrease lethargy. So there you have it. If we want to be a nation of lean, mean and healthy citizens we need to learn from zoos and the animals that live in them. And we need to embrace playfulness and enjoy the place where we live. That way, we can tackle life with a hop, skip and a jump."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe seemingly climate doomsday-obsessed Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) tweeted a link to the Berlin Staatsoper (Berlin State Opera), which is announcing a benefit concert dubbed “Science Meets Music“, slated for 30 August 2014. The proceeds raised will go to the NaturTon Foundation.
I just had to laugh at the new elitist level of climate activism the Potsdam Institute scientists have stooped to. The benefit concert’s announcement has a photo of some orchestra members donning rubber boots – I guess for protection against the one-meter sea level rise Rahmstorf predicts is coming to Berlin. This is classic Potsdam Institute activism at its best.
The Berlin Staatsoper announcement as follows in English:
==========================================
Science Meets Music Benefit Concert
Proceeds to go to NaturTon
Climate scientists together with musicians are organizing a concert at an unusual location, the Observatory of the Potsdam Telegrafenberg. The proceeds of this concert will go to the violin and bow makers as well as the members of the Berliner Staatskapelle-founded Verein Eben!holz e.V., who are committed to the rescue of rosewood and ebony for use in the building of musical instruments. In the Makira Natural Park in Madagascar over 30 different domestic tree species will be planted on 100 hectares of of destroyed forest so that the connection to several tracts of forests will be re-eatsblished. By involving the local residents in the work and through information and festivals, the awareness for the value of the forest will be awakened as well as the sustainable use of wood creating additional sources of income for the people.”
Tickets go for 55 euros (75 dollars) and even include a presentation by the doomsday-purveying PIK titled: “The Forest and the Climate”, which I’m sure will be nothing but goods new and optimism (sarc-off).
Concerning Madagascar, it is one of the poorest countries in the world. Perhaps if the people there had reliable, affordable electric power and infrastructure, and thus the modern jobs such things tend bring with them, they would leave the trees alone.  Cure the poverty, and you’ll cure the environmental ills.

"In one tragic week, many dozens died in two seemingly unconnected fires in the UK and Portugal. One blazed through a high-rise building in London, far away from natural ignitions and cladded with what should have been non-flammable insulation. The other was a wildfire, suggested to have been started by lightning, which then engulfed rural communities surrounded by highly flammable forest plantations. Yet the two tragedies share parallels, and not only in the search for answers. Both fires spread quickly and burned with an intensity well beyond what firefighters were able to stop. Both caught residents largely unprepared, with their escape routes cut off, and both left a death toll far beyond what might have been expected for either a building or a forest fire in such highly-developed countries.  Indeed, the fires in Portugal claimed 64 lives, making it the country’s deadliest wildfire in recorded history. Potential ignition sources for fires are common, be they lightning, accident or arson. However, advances in fire detection, firefighting and use of less flammable building materials have led to a much lower threat from fires in modern cities. The same cannot be said for the rural communities in north-central Portugal and indeed many other regions of the Mediterranean. The roots of Portugal’s latest fire can be found in economic and social changes. Over the past few decades, the country’s rural areas – already among Europe’s poorest regions – have seen significant depopulation as residents moved to wealthier cities or countries in search of work, leaving behind almost abandoned villages. As a result, a landscape that was once dominated by farming, grazing and open oak forest land, has been replaced with denser vegetation such as plantations of native pine (Pinus pinaster) and, more recently, Australian eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus). Both trees grow fast and provide valuable timber. In theory, they are lower maintenance, and require fewer workers, than the more open and intensely managed agri-forest of the past. Such plantations therefore sound like a sensible option for the region. However, the switch to pine and eucalyptus also resulted in a much more flammable landscape. In fact, Eucalyptus globulus, introduced in many countries for pulp production, is one of the world’s most flammable tree species and its extent has more than doubled in Portugal since the 1980s. In severe forest fires, burning bits of vegetation (firebrand) are often lifted by wind and can travel hundreds of metres. Eucalyptus bark is particularly effective at spreading fire in this way.  The humid Atlantic climate of the northwestern Iberian peninsula also plays a role. Mild winters with high rainfall allow for excellent growing conditions, yet its dry, hot summers combine to make this region the tinderbox of Europe. Forest fires are therefore common in this region and Portugal has one of the best fire detection and fighting capabilities in Europe. But though its average annual area burned has decreased in recent years, this tragic fire has been a stark reminder that the threat remains. Firefighters are well aware that once a fire spreads in dense vegetation, such as pine or eucalyptus forests, in hot and windy conditions, it is essentially impossible to extinguish. Efforts are then typically aimed, not always successfully, at halting its spread at its flanks and onto infrastructures, or aiding the evacuation of residents. In the mountainous terrain of Portugal with few escape routes and the fires’ spread accelerated by firebrand igniting new areas ahead of the fire front, this can become an impossible task.  Just as was the case in the tragic Australian Black Saturday fires in 2009, in attempts to escape or avoid the fire, residents drove along mountain roads through dense smoke and were trapped by the fire in the process. Indeed, vehicle entrapment during late evacuation is one of the most common causes of death in wildfire. The scale of human losses in this fire has been unprecedented in Portugal’s recent history, yet the occurrence and extent of fire is not. What caused the fire could be seen as almost immaterial as there will always be potential ignition sources, particularly in areas with widely scattered population. Whether fire will spread and pose a risk to people is then a matter of vegetation flammability, terrain and weather, along with the level of planning and effective communication required to quickly move residents to safe areas. In this event, hot dry weather, scattered villages with a dwindling population insufficiently prepared for fire, surrounded by steep terrain with extensive monocultures of highly-flammable trees and insufficient communication, combined into a tragic loss of life. Yet, as with London’s Grenfell Tower fire, the high fire risk was far from unforeseeable. There is much that can be done to reduce the threat from, or even eliminate, highly flammable materials – be it insulation around buildings, or dense forest plantations surrounding villages. In both cases, importants lessons must be learned."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe keep hearing from alarmists that storms are becoming more violent and more frequent, and thus storm damage and deaths are rising – all because of man-made global WARMING. Unless we stop driving SUV’s, mankind in the future will be wiped out by global warming-precipitated bad weather. Hat-tip: DirkH.
However, the world’s largest re-insurer (and a very active proponent of global warming catastrophe), Munich Re, has just released its latest “catastrophe report“, which looks at the first half of 2014. In it there are some interesting admissions.
Economic losses plummet 56%
“The statistics for natural catastrophes for the first half of 2014 have been marked by pleasingly low levels of global claims. Overall economic losses of US$ 42bn and insured losses of US$ 17bn to the end of June were considerably below the average for the past ten years (US$ 95bn and US$ 25bn respectively). ”
That translates to an almost 56% drop in economic losses from natural catastrophes (not necessarily weather-related, e.g. earthquakes, volcanoes).
Deaths down eye-popping 95%!
“Thankfully, the number of deaths caused by natural catastrophes was also comparatively low. During the first half of the year, 2700 people died as a result of natural catastrophes, which was much lower than is normal during the first six months of a year (10-year average: 53,000). There were around 490 loss-relevant natural catastrophes.”
Only 2700 people died, normal is 53,000! That’s a drop of 95%. Despite the good news, the Munich Re insists there’s been “no change in the overall risk situation“, and so premiums unfortunately will have to stay high because global warming catastrophes are lurking.
“Snowstorms”, harsh “record winter” cause biggest losses!
Ironically the most damage was not caused by something we typically associate with global warming, but rather with global cooling!
“The effect of loss susceptibility on claims was clearly demonstrated by two snowstorms in Japan. These storms in February, which hit Tokyo and central Japan in particular, brought overall losses of around US$ 5bn and insured losses of more than US$ 2.5bn, and were the most costly natural catastrophe worldwide in the first half of the year. Snowfalls of up to a metre are very unusual in the affected provinces in Japan, though they would cause very few problems in other countries. There were numerous accidents, and the roofs of many halls and greenhouses collapsed under the weight of the snow.
Record North American winter, blizzards cause losses

“The record winter in North America also caused significant losses, with extremely cold temperatures and heavy snowfalls over a longer period in many parts of the USA and Canada. The losses from various blizzards totalled around US$ 3.4bn. The most costly snowstorm was in the first week of January: losses for this storm alone totalled US$ 2.5bn, of which US$ 1.7bn was insured. In many instances the harsh winter also had a heavy impact on business, as companies were forced to stop production. At the end of January, a blizzard brought the Atlanta metropolitan area almost to a standstill, even though only a few centimetres of snow had fallen. Snow and ice made the highways impassable, as there was a lack of snow-clearing equipment for a city unused to such conditions.”
Munich Re contorts to blame it on “climate change”
Of course for a company whose business plan is based on promoting global warming catastrophe, the unexpected harsh winter losses may lead to clients asking questions. The Munich Re then undergoes contortions to link the cold to global warming:
“According to Peter Höppe, Head of Munich Re’s Geo Risks Research Department, there is a link between the weather extremes in the northern hemisphere this winter. “These extremes – with heavy winter conditions in North America and Asia, and the extraordinarily mild winter across large parts of Europe – were due to significant and lengthy meanders in the jet stream”, said Höppe. “And scientists are still having intense debates about whether such sustained changes to patterns in the jet stream – and therefore also the frequency of such extreme and persistent weather conditions – might increase in the future due to climate change.”
When one scrutinizes the Munich report, little damage arises from warm events. The warm weather cited is restricted to Europe, which represents a tiny fraction of the world’s surface.
USA tornadoes down 25%
“The tornado season in the USA, which peaks from May to July, has been below average so far. The US weather agency NOAA recorded 721 tornadoes until end of June, in comparison to an average of 1,026 in the years 2005–2013.”
But hey! “Videos filmed on 17 June showed an extremely rare twin tornado in the State of Nebraska.” Wow! Aint that something! Must be global warming.
Munich Re sees no “super El Niño” this fall
“Over the rest of the year, weather events will probably see increasing impact from ENSO, a naturally occurring phenomenon that involves fluctuating ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. “With the contrary effects of El Niño and La Niña, ENSO can influence weather patterns in many parts of the world”, said Höppe. “It currently looks as though a moderate El Niño will develop by the autumn, with warm water from the South Pacific moving from west to east, thus shifting wind systems and precipitation across the Pacific basin.”
La Niña prognosis for next year…hurricanes!
“Hurricane activity in the northern Atlantic normally decreases during El Niño phases. The number of typhoons in the northwest Pacific usually increases, but they make landfall more rarely. Tornado activity increases in the USA. “This gives a different distribution of losses across regions. Globally, our loss database NatCatSERVICE records no significant differences in overall losses in moderate El Niño years when compared to neutral years, whereas losses are significantly lower in years with a strong El Niño”, said Höppe. The stronger the El Niño, the more likely it is that there will be a La Niña in the following year, when hurricane activity tends to increase.”

"Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement is certainly a blow for the global climate regime. But it is primarily a bad deal for the US. It is bad for America’s economy, its global leadership, and its non-climate policy goals. The good news is this: global efforts to tackle climate change will survive without the US. Though Trump claimed the agreement was “unfair” and against American interests, what he doesn’t realise is that climate policy is good business. Already now, twice as many people are employed in the US renewables industry as are in coal, oil and gas.  The Paris goal of limiting global warming at 2℃ also means US$120 trillion will need to go into energy supply, infrastructure and appliances between now and 2050. This is twice the current rate of investment, and the bulk of it will be in low-carbon energy.  Thus far the US has enjoyed an edge in technology, along with many other Western countries. But, given Trump’s opposition to climate action, other nations will now be more hesitant to source from American companies and to engage in joint ventures. This means job losses and possibly even a loss in global technology leadership.  Put differently, climate policy is where the very “tremendous deals” could have been struck that Trump would like to see for US companies, businesses and consumers. Leaving Paris means letting go on these opportunities. Measured by low-carbon patent applications, the EU, Japan and China are well positioned to step in. Jobs that might be “brought back” in the Rust Belt’s heavy industry and mining will not compensate for the opportunities foregone in renewables – the growth area of the future. Trump’s decision is another blow to US soft power. While a mighty war machinery certainly helped America exert global leadership over the past century or so, such “hard power” was always combined with attractive ideas and standards which built momentum for the country’s policies. To be sure, the US refusing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 had already dealt a serious blow to its climate leadership. But it was the Obama administration that together with China pushed the subsequent Paris Agreement over the finish line by ratifying it.  With this climate pullout the US is on the verge of saying goodbye to its global leadership based on soft power. What’s left are gunboats and tanks – and an $18 trillion economy the US leadership now thinks about in classic realpolitik terms.  This will clear the way for others to take the lead. China has a strong interest in greening its economy as turns into the world’s prime low-carbon investor. The EU sees an opportunity to advance its position as the globe’s climate champion and to capitalise on its own well-developed low-carbon industry. Both economies – representing roughly US$30 trillion of GDP – have the economic and political clout to push for global change, even in the absence of the US.  Other nations will join in, as they will want to profit from the economic opportunities coming with a transition toward low carbon. India, for instance, the world’s third largest CO₂ emitter, has pledged its commitment to the common agreement and the global governance principles underpinning it. Finally, global agreements never live in a policy vacuum. To the contrary, they are always embedded in broader deals that brought them about. Regional or bilateral trade agreements, for instance, are often linked to labour or environmental standards. Now the US has quit Paris, partnering countries might be tempted to retaliate. High level European politicians have already suggested the EU consider restricting market access for American goods, in order to avoid “unfair competition” arising from lower standards in the US.  Links like these mean the US will find it a lot harder to get agreements – or “deals” – done in the future, even if they do not have much to do with environmental protection. Security cooperation comes to mind here, among other, which the current administration cares much about. What’s the way forward? To be sure, the US quitting Paris does not mean the country returns to the coal-based economy of old. Renewables have reached grid-parity prices in many instances – and low-carbon energy has become a multi-billion dollar industry. Big companies have called for the US to remain in the agreement because of that. Even Texas, the oil-rich Lone Star State, is now a prominent producer of clean energy. Thanks to renewables and a surge in shale gas production, US emissions are now back down to 1992 levels – and Trump will not be able to change that trajectory. Let’s make no mistake though: the absence of US leadership, policy clout and climate finance will be felt, and the US leaving the Paris Agreement is bad news for the global climate regime. But it is much better than America staying in and pushing for renegotiation of the entire agreement. This would have meant years of deadlock and lingering, with no global action on climate policy.  The beauty of Paris is its bottom-up approach: each signatory sets its own goals, and defines how it goes about meeting them. So the world can move on – even without America."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany-based European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here brings up a television report on the disappointing returns from wind parks, recently appearing on SWR South German public television.
The days of the media not questioning green energy are over.

Mainz public utility director Detlev Höhner dismayed by wind energy returns. Image cropped here.
Wind parks experienced a gold rush atmosphere, with thousands of turbines being erected over the last 15 years. Now the data are coming in on their real performance, and it looks bad. The German SWR TV report (can be viewed at Youtube) first presents the background on wind energy development in Germany and tells the story of “disappointed investors”, especially in the western German state of Rhineland Palantinate.
Initially investors’ expectations of getting rich on wind were high, the report says. Big returns were promised (between 400 and 800% in 2006). But for a wide majority that dream has shattered violently as losses mount.
“2/3 of all projects are running badly to very badly”
The SWR report at the 1:20 mark says the promises of huge returns were based on overly optimistic wind model forecasts. Werner Haldorf of the pro-wind-energy German Association of Wind Energy analyzed wind park performance and sums up the “surprising” results at the 1:38 mark:
We can say that one third of all projects have pleased the investors, or at least have been satisfactory – depending on how high or low the subjective expectations were, satisfied also with respect to the planning results. And two thirds of all projects are running somewhat badly to very badly.”
In his summary report he concludes:

The origin of the plight for commercial windparks in Germany is the excessive “planning optimism” (Garrad Hassan) that was created among investors.”
Unexpectedly high repair, maintenance and insurance costs
At the 2:06 mark Daldorf tells SWF that the cause is “the missing wind, too much wind was planned, shoddy planning, improper planning, and unexpected (or falsely expected) high repair, maintenance, and insurance costs“.
These are the results of Daldorf’s nationwide windpark analysis. More and more it is becoming obvious that many of the investors were conned to some extent by Big Wind.
The missing wind
The report then focusses on the wind parks in the German state of Rhineland Palatinate. There the picture is even worse. The problem is that the necessary amount of wind needed to make the projects profitable there often just does not materialize. At the 2:51 mark economist Uwe Pilgram tells viewers that a turbine must run a minimum of 1700 hrs at full capacity each year in order to make a profit. But Pilgram says the average in 2013 was barely over 1400 hours.
Mainz Public Utility Director Detlev Höhner sullenly says that his community’s 20 wind plants put into operation between 2005 and 2010 so far have not made any profit and has made a “light loss”.
In the city of Trier (3:55) the result for its public utility is also disappointing. Public utility manager Rudolf Schöller:

We planned for average wind conditions, but in the first years we had relatively weak winds, and that’s why the wind yields were not so high.”
The reporter tells viewers that some years saw as little as 80% of the expected wind. The reporter adds: “That’s a disaster, experts tells us. A privately run company would certainly have gone bankrupt.”
The problem, the SWR reporter says (5:15), lies in false wind projections. Often times the planning goes out of control and is thus too costly. For the city of Mainz the new wisdom has become: “Don’t trust any planning office“.
Wind index adjusted downward three times!
At the 6:30 mark SWF brings in a wind energy expert Prof. Uwe Leprich, who warns that wind turbines “are not money printing machines” and says that the last years have seen weak wind conditions, yet hopes that will change in the years ahead. Interestingly he says that future wind conditions are based on data from the past and from these data a wind-index is computed for future planning. Here he admits (7:00 mark) that the wind index has been “adjusted three times” downward. Leprich blames the unpredictable weather conditions specifically in Rhineland Palatinate for the wind park profit problems.
The moderator then asks why that had not been foreseen (7:27 mark). Leprich replies that data from the previous decades were used, and blames “changes in wind conditions over the last few years“, adding that the wind index had to be adjusted nationwide. He repeats that especially in Rhineland Palatinate the wind conditions are especially difficult.
Skeptics’ warnings were ignored
Later Leprich says that “new framework conditions” have since been drawn up for planning future projects and that planners will need to be extra careful when siting wind projects. Readers here need to know that wind-park opponents and skeptics provided plenty of warnings on the poor profitability of wind parks, but in the mad and blind gold rush, no one heeded the warnings. Skeptics were branded crackpots, naysayers and complainers.
And what about the communities that have already falsely speculated (8:40) and lost money? Who pays for the losses, asks the moderator? Leprich doesn’t answer the question, making a huge circle around it. It was a rhetorical question anyway.
German green energy companies collapsing
The SWR report also looks at how Germany’s recent cut in subsidies for green energies and on how renewable energy companies are really feeling the pain. At the 9:30 mark the report features German renewable energy company Juwi., which years earlier had boomed mightily in the wind and solar businesses. In 2012 the company even broke the €1 billion mark in sales. But the report continues: “However 2 years later, everything is different“. Today the mood at Juwi is especially bleak as the company lays off its workers: Every third worker is getting a pink slip – 400 in all.
Government to blame…CEO drives expensive sports car
Without the subsidy nipple, the orders disappear and green energy companies die off. At the 12:20 mark the reporter says that the Juwi managing director Matthias Willenbacher blames the government for the misery, just before he is shown cruising in his ultra-high-priced sports car.
Back in the studio at the 14:00 mark, Leprich says the industry grew too fast and was led by inexperienced managers. He says the move into green energies was too rash and uncontrolled. He calls the massive investment in solar energy a mistake and concedes that the industry was too dependent on politics. At the end Leprich still thinks that solar and wind energy are the energies of the future – a seemingly obstinate position in view of the monumental debacle they are turning out to be. Leprich keeps clinging.
Historic industrial debacle
In reality, however, what we are actually seeing is the unfolding of one of history’s greatest industrial debacles, all driven by a fraudulent climate science and a deceptive industry. Slowly realizing they’ve been bamboozled, the German media, government and the numerous green energy promoters are scrambling to save face.
USA poised to follow same ruinous path
With the debacle now clear to the rest of the world, one would think other countries would sober up and be more cautious about following a similar path. They aren’t. Indeed it is truly astonishing that other countries, like the USA for example, are ignoring it all and are now attempting to put themselves on the very same ruinous path to repeat the German debacle, and to do so on an even grander scale.
If there ever was a definition for madness, this is it.

"After a month of football, Euro 2016 drew to a close with Portugal defeating France 1-0 in extra time to lift the famous trophy for the first time. But the final game was a turgid affair, and perhaps the image most likely to endure involved a rather unexpected participant.  As Cristiano Ronaldo sat in tears on the turf, the reality of his game-ending injury sinking in only 25 minutes into the game, a moth fluttered around his eye and settled on his forehead. This moth was one of thousands in the stadium, pictured in clouds on the pitch as the players warmed up, and being swept with brooms from advertising hoardings. What were they doing there? The bizarre spectacle appears to have been the result of a coming together of several exceptional circumstances. It is commonly known that moths display an extremely strong attraction to sources of artificial light, although we still don’t really know why. The stronger and brighter the light, the better – and this is our first exceptional circumstance.  Fully lit, the Stade de France shines like a beacon even amid the glow of La Ville Lumière. Worse yet, the format of the lighting – in a ring, facing inwards – means that once a moth finds itself inside the stadium, it would be near-impossible for it to escape the influence of the lights. But many football games have been played under floodlights at big stadiums, and this game began while it was still daylight. This brings us to our second exceptional circumstance, then – the stadium lights were left on overnight on the eve of the game, presumably to aid the ultra-tight security effort that has surrounded the whole tournament. The lights had a full night to attract as many moths as they could into the stadium. When fans and players began to arrive, those moths were nearing the end of their daytime slumber. Still, though, brightly lit stadia have held events on consecutive nights before without experiencing mothy visitations. So to find the third exceptional circumstance, we need to look more closely at the moths themselves. As the game unfolded, it became clear to those in the know that the vast majority of moths on display were representatives of a single species: Autographa gamma, the Silver Y – both names stemming from the γ-shaped marking on the wing. The Silver Y carries metallic patterns on its wing, like many other species in its sub-family, the Plusiinae, including the beautiful Gold Spot and my personal favourite species, the Burnished Brass.   Importantly for our investigation, these moths bear a remarkable similarity to another species recently making headlines, the cabbage-chomping Diamondback moth, which also migrate in huge numbers to UK shores.  Silver Ys make the journey annually from North Africa, travelling through France (including Paris) to breed in Britain. Scientists at Rothamsted Research found that in peak years they number almost a quarter of a billion, and up to four times that number return southwards in the autumn. By a twist of fate, the Euro 2016 final appears to have coincided with this year’s migrating Silver Ys reaching Paris on their northward journey. We know from several recent studies that the profusion of artificial light at night spells trouble, both for moths and the other organisms they interact with in the ecosystem. Moths have short lifespans – Silver Ys may spend as little as two weeks in their adult form after emerging from the cocoon – and in this time must complete their migration before finding a mate and a suitable location for their eggs. Time spent under the influence of a light is time wasted. With luck, organisers at the Stade de France will have the sense to leave the stadium lights off on Monday night. Returned to (relative) darkness, most of the stadium’s temporary lodgers will be able to escape the arena and continue their journey merrily northwards – perhaps, for some, to land on British soil within the coming days much to the excitement of moth lovers who, like me, eagerly await their arrival."
"The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity. The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. Dry fuel load – the amount of forest and scrub available to burn – has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth. Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above-average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 had the fifth-driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Australia recorded its hottest  month in January 2019, its third-hottest July and its hottest October day in some areas, among other temperature records."
"The beginning of agriculture changed human history and has fascinated scholars for centuries. Yet it’s hard to study because it happened 10,000 or so years ago. As a result, a number of important issues remain unresolved, including why hunter-gatherers first began farming, and how crops were domesticated to depend on people. Domesticated crops have been transformed almost beyond recognition in comparison with their wild relatives. Look at how maize differs from its wild equivalents, for instance: This transformation largely happened during the early stages of farming, back in the Stone Age, when crops were first deliberately sown, tended and harvested using stone sickles.  One controversy in this area is about the extent to which ancient peoples knew they were domesticating crops. Did anyone in 8,000BC think thin, wispy “teosintes” could one day become corn on the cob? Did anyone really look at wild rice and imagine turning it into basmati or long-grain? Many archaeologists think not, but it’s difficult to rule out deliberate breeding. The question is whether these first farmers knowingly bred domesticated crops, or whether domestication characteristics simply evolved as farmers repeatedly cultivated and harvested wild plants? To investigate this, colleagues and I have a new paper published Evolution Letters in which we looked at seed sizes in wild and domesticated plants. Domesticated cereal crops such as wheat, rice or maize have lost the ability to disperse their seeds naturally – they no longer fall off the plants by themselves, and instead depend on people or machines to plant them. Their seeds have become much larger, however. Maize seeds are 15 times bigger than wild teosinte, while soybeans are seven times larger than their wild relatives. Even in plants like barley, a more modest increase in seed size (60% larger) translates into hugely increased yield. Of course, the farmers who bred the early versions of these crops may have been targeting large seeds because they knew these would give larger yields. This is why we also compared cereal crops with vegetables. This gets around the problem of looking at seed size in crops that were grown for their grain. Any selective breeding of vegetables by early farmers would have acted on the leaves, stems or roots that were eaten as food, but should not have directly affected seed size. Instead, any changes in vegetable seed size probably arose unintentionally.  Natural selection could have caused larger seeds to evolve in cultivated fields if larger seedlings competed or survived better than smaller ones. Larger seeds could also have resulted from genetic links to other characteristics like overall plant size. In this case, people might have bred larger crops by saving and planting seeds from the biggest plants, or unintentionally by thinning out small plants while preserving larger ones. But larger seeds would not have been inevitable – there are many plants which are large when mature, but grow from small seeds. We gathered together seed size data for lots of modern crops and living examples of their wild relatives. Across seven vegetable species we found strong evidence for a general enlargement of seeds due to domestication. This is especially stunning in crops like potato, cassava and sweet potato, where people don’t even plant seeds, let alone harvest them. It is hard to think of any reason why people would breed large seeds in these crops. Instead, larger seeds in these species (found in the flowering plant above ground) surely arose unintentionally.  If early farmers unintentionally produced vegetables with larger seeds simply by cultivating them, then what about grain crops? The size of the domestication effect for vegetable seeds falls completely within the range seen in cereals and pulse grains like lentils and beans. This makes it likely that at least part of the seed enlargement in these crops also evolved during domestication without deliberate foresight from Stone Age farmers – people did not set out to breed larger grains, but these evolved through natural selection or genetic links to plant size. Our findings have important implications for understanding how crops evolved. Unintentional selection was probably more important in the genesis of our food plants than previously realised. Early increases in the yields of crops might well have evolved in farmers’ fields rather than being bred artificially."
"Tiny clutch bags, conceptual knitwear and carbon neutrality – the ideas that fashion chooses to embrace each season aren’t always those you might expect. But thanks to a recent shift, no doubt spurred on by the “Greta Thunberg effect”, carbon – as well as the practice of offsetting it – has become a hot topic for many of the biggest names in the fashion industry. At New York fashion week in September, luxury fashion designer Gabriela Hearst staged fashion’s first carbon-neutral catwalk show. Hot on its heels, Gucci announced it would go carbon neutral with chief executive, Marco Bizzarri, stating that “the planet has gone too far”. Next up, luxury fashion conglomerate Kering, owner of big-name brands such as Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta, announced that its entire group would offset 2.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide in a bid to “become carbon-neutral within its own operations and across the entire supply chain.”  It’s not just high-fashion that is looking to cut the size of its carbon footprint. In April, footwear brand Allbirds announced it would impose a carbon tax on itself. Not long after, San Francisco-based fashion company Everlane reported it had come up with a pair of carbon-neutral trainers. A small section of the industry is going one step further. October saw the launch of a brand called Sheep Inc, which is hoping to be the “world’s first carbon negative brand”, offsetting tenfold its emissions via investment in biodiversity projects. Another recent innovation has seen the creation of clothes made from what have been gorily called “carbon-sucking organisms”. Defined as “calculating your total climate-damaging carbon emissions, reducing them where possible, and then balancing your remaining emissions, often by purchasing a carbon offset: paying to plant new trees or investing in “green” technologies such as solar and wind power,” carbon neutrality is something some labels have been talking about for years. US brand Reformation has been describing itself as carbon neutral since 2015 and Ganni, a mid-range Scandinavian brand popular with millennial floaty frock lovers, introduced “climate compensated” clothing in 2016. Its website explained: “In order to do business, we can’t completely eradicate our emissions but we monitor our impact, reduce what we can and climate compensate the rest.” Carbon neutrality as fashion must-have hasn’t happened in a vacuum. The industry, which is responsible for “around 10% of all global greenhouse gas emissions,” according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, has come under increasing scrutiny. If it were to continue to grow at current rates, it could use more than a quarter of the world’s annual carbon budget by 2050. But is carbon neutrality and offsetting, with which brands are hoping to repent for decades of wrongs, the silver bullet many will be hoping for? “Carbon footprint” – an oft-repeated phrase that attempts to simplify the idea of how much carbon any given activity emits into the atmosphere – is far from simple to calculate. Flights are an easier prospect – as Maxine Bédat, founder of the New Standard Institute, recently told Vogue: “You can calculate the carbon footprint of a flight, but in terms of [the carbon footprint of] a fashion show, that data doesn’t exist.” Gabriela Hearst, for instance, factored in production, design, catering, power, waste and more. It can also prove tricky to calculate carbon emissions when it comes to clothes themselves. “Historically, brands have not had very good oversight or control of their supply chains,” says Alice Wilby, a sustainable fashion consultant. “How are you going to start implementing environmental audits like this? You’ve got to consider absolutely everything, from where your material is grown or sewn through to how it is turned into fabric, how it’s manufactured and how it’s transported.” Gucci acknowledges these difficulties, but is keen to push past them. “If we wait to be perfect, in terms of the calculation of impact or methodology, to me it’s just an excuse for not doing it,” said Bizzarri at the time of the brand’s carbon-neutral announcement. “More and more, we just need to act.” There have been problems with the offsetting schemes too. Companies carrying them out on behalf of the brands have come under fire – for reasons including claims of fraudulent activity, to causing damage to the communities living around their projects. With a lot of offsetting happening in developing countries, “there’s a track record of environmental and human rights abuses occurring,” says Wilby, “because of offsetting projects being set up in areas where indigenous rights are not respected and lands are used without approval.” Since the WWF and others set up Gold Standard, an organisation designed to ensure the integrity of these projects, the hope is that these schemes are improving. For its critics, offsetting can distract from the task of reducing carbon output in the first place, even when done responsibly. “It is important to note that offsetting isn’t actually tackling the reduction of a company’s footprint,” says Ilishio Lovejoy, project manager for policy and research at Fashion Revolution. “It is making the overall global situation ‘less bad’ by ‘doing good’ somewhere else.” Many of its naysayers also note the fact that offsetting prioritises lessening guilt over reducing actual harm. There is a privilege involved in being able to pay away your carbon, whether as a consumer or a company. Writing on the broad subject of carbon offsets as far back as 2006, Guardian writer George Monbiot compared it with the ancient Catholic church’s practice of selling indulgences. “It can send the message that, if you have enough money to buy your way out of the damage you are causing, you don’t need to take action or act as quickly to change your own practices,” says Lovejoy. Sara Arnold, a member of Extinction Rebellion’s fashion wing, says that “it’s better for companies to do it rather than to not do it, but let’s call it what it is: CSR [corporate social responsibility]. And that CSR shouldn’t be used to make people feel like their purchases don’t have an environmental impact.” For Sheep Inc’s founder Edzard van der Wyck, one problem is that carbon neutrality falls short. With the fashion industry growing more rapidly than the efforts to improve its environmental impact can keep up with, “the idea that we’re talking about carbon neutrality as this alpha and omega of sustainability is troubling”.  Steps will need to be bold if fashion is going to clean up its act. Van der Wyck is sceptical of companies’ altruism. “If you look at how Gucci recently said it had invested $8.4m in a carbon-offsetting project … that’s 0.2% of their earnings … then Notre Dame catches fire and the next day [they donate] €200m.” He also thinks that companies need to be making sure their manufacturing is running on renewable energy, using the right, recyclable, materials. Carbon neutrality might, says Wilby, sound sexy – and she believes “it can work as part of a larger programme” – but without reducing carbon output “it cannot be the final goal. It just can’t.” "
"It’s survived! The UK’s oldest and most permanent patch of snow is safely buried under a duvet of fresh snow and will live to see another spring. Known as the Sphinx, this icy pocket situated in an isolated corrie on Britain’s third highest mountain, Braeriach, in the Scottish Cairngorms range, is thought to have melted only seven times in the past 300 years. Counting and measuring the pockets of snow that persist year-round is a passion for Iain Cameron. For 15 years, he and his team of volunteers have been tramping the highlands of Scotland, England and Wales, keeping an eye on snow patches. Their records are providing a valuable indicator of the climate crisis.  Having first melted completely in 1933, the Sphinx has become more vulnerable in recent years, failing to survive in both 2017 and 2018. But after a wild and gruelling walk, including a camp-out in a bothy, Cameron reports that about nine sq metres of Sphinx have made it through summer 2019. The story of the Sphinx is a highlight in an otherwise gloomy report, which shows accelerated disappearance of all snow patches and none surviving beyond 22 May in England and Wales this year."

By Ron Clutz
In a previous study of World Class station records, the effects of urban development could not be discounted since the 25 long service records come from European cities.  This is a study to see what the best sites in the US can tell us about temperature trends in the last century.
There are two principal findings below.
Surfacestations.org provides a list of 23 stations that have the CRN#1 rating for the quality of the sites. I obtained the records from the latest GHCNv3 monthly qcu report, did my own data quality review, and built a Temperature Trend Analysis (TTA) workbook.

Spread out across the USA
As it happens, the stations are spread out across the continental US (CONUS). NW: Oregon, North Dakota, Montana; SW: California, Nevada, Colorado, Texas; MW: Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana; NE: New York, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania; SE: Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida.
The records themselves vary in quality of coverage, but have all been included here because of their CRN#1 rating. The gold medal goes to Savannah for 100% monthly coverage, with a single missing daily observation since 1874.
Pensacola was a close second among the four stations with perfect monthly coverage. Most stations were missing less than 20 months with coverages above 95%.

Only 0.16°C rise per century
The average station shows a rise of about 0.16°C/century. The large deviation, and the fact that multiple stations had cooling rates, shows that warming has not been extreme, and varies considerably from place to place. The observed warming for this group is less than half the rate reported in the European study.
Temperature trends are local, not global
Most remarkable about these stations is the extensive local climate diversity that appears when station sites are relatively free of urban heat sources. 35% (8 of 23) of the stations reported cooling over the century. Indeed, if we remove the 8 warmest records, the rate flips from +0.16°C to -0.14°C.

And the multidecadal patterns of warming and cooling were quite variable from place to place. Averages over 30-year periods suggest how unusual these patterns are.
For the set of 23 stations the results are:

The first period varied in length from each station’s beginning to 1920. Surprisingly the second period cooled in spite of the 1930s. Warming appears mostly since 1980.  As mentioned above, within these averages are many differing local patterns.
Conclusion:
Question: Is it warmer now than 100 years ago?
Answer: It depends upon where you live. The best observations from US stations show a barely noticeable average warming of 0.16°C/century. And 35% of stations showed cooling at the same time that others were warming more than the average.
Note about data quality.
Available is my workbook for Truman Dam & Reservoir as an example of my data quality review method.  There are sheets showing the incoming qcu values, removal of flags and errors, audit of outliers (values exceeding 2 St. Dev.) and CUSUM and 1st differences analyses to test for systemic bias. Note that Truman missed out entirely on warming from 1956 to 2002, in contrast to the conventional notion of global warming from the 1970s to 2000.
Truman Dam & Reservoir also provides a cautionary tale about temperature analysis.  The station’s annual averages appear to rise dramatically from 2003 to present. On closer inspection, that period is missing values for 6 Decembers, 8 Januarys and 5 Februarys. So the annual warming is mostly the result of missing data-points.
This shows why analyzing the temperatures themselves can be misleading. By relying only on the station’s monthly slopes, TTA analysis effectively places missing values on the trend line of the existing values.
Note about Fall et al. (2011).
This was the first study to use CRN 1 to 5 ratings to look at US temperature trends in relation to station siting quality. Much discussed at the time was the finding of CRN 1&2 showing warming of 0.155°C/decade for the period 1979 to 2008. The comparable finding from this analysis is 0.151°C/decade for CRN 1 stations.
Little noticed was Figure 10 on page 10 of Fall et al. That graph shows that CRN 1&2 rate of warming Tavg unadjusted was about 0.2°C/century for the period 1895 to 2008.  This analysis shows a comparable 0.16°C for CRN 1 for the same period up to 2013.

"Last week the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for an end to new coal-fired power plants. Many European countries including the UK and Germany are decreasing their dependence on coal, but this is not the case everywhere. Across Africa many people rely on standby diesel generators to supplement erratic electricity supplies, leading to local air pollution problems and high emissions of climate-heating carbon dioxide. Although Africa is in a unique position to leapfrog dependence on fossil fuels and utilise abundant renewable sources such as wind and solar, the continent is embarking on a massive expansion of fossil fuel electricity. More than 200 new power stations are planned, the majority of which will burn coal. Power ships – vast floating power stations, some burning highly polluting bunker oil – are already moored in Ghana, Sierra Leone and Mozambique.  African countries have little air quality legislation and poor enforcement. Without emission controls, a study led by the University of Leicester found, the air pollution from these new power plants and expanded fossil fuel use in transport could lead to an avoidable 48,000 early deaths each year by 2030. These are predicted to be mostly in South Africa, Malawi and Nigeria, where oil industry flares are already a major pollution source. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis past week the 9th Extreme Weather Congress took place in Hamburg. Curiously this year there was very little coverage by the German media. Doing a Google search of the event turned up very few stories from the mainstream media.

Empty seats pack Day 3 of the Hamburg 9th Extreme Weather Conference, just minutes before starting. Source: here (11:12 mark). 
The above photo is a snapshot from a Youtube video, just minutes before the start of Day 3 of the Congress.
Looks like the German media have grown fatigued by climate science in general and have sensed that something isn’t right with what the “experts” have been claiming. Record high sea ice, lack of hurricanes, low tornado activity, spectacularly failed climate models and bitter cold winters have a way of sobering them up.
Some German public television networks showed up on the first day, see here for example, but there too we see many empty seats – unusual given the opening first day hype.
Not a peep about Antarctic sea ice record
We begin to sense the media is feeling increasingly embarrassed about the climate issue overall. Any reminder of how they’ve been duped gets avoided altogether. Little wonder when Googling “rekord eis antarktis 2014“, we quickly find that the German mainstream media have totally ignored this year’s record high south polar sea ice event altogether. Too embarrassing! Besides, German viewers are totally bored by the climate issue.

Some small sites have reported the event, though. The online German weather site www.wetteronline.de writes that Arctic sea ice is “considerably greater than the record low year of 2012” and that the German Polarstern research vessel of the Alfred Wegener Institute “did not succeed in crossing the Northwest Passage of the American continent in the second half of August“.
Wetteronline.de also looked at the situation at the Antarctic, which this year smashed the all-time satellite era sea ice record. The site however, avoided the use of the word “record” and wrote:
…the sea ice around Antarctica reached 20 million square kilometers. Thus the 30-year maximum of last year was exceeded by about 0.4 million square kilometers.”
Of course this new satellite record high has baffled climate scientists, who are left stumped and only to speculate what is behind the unexpected trend. Wetteronline writes:
The reason for this, scientists suspect, among other factors, is a weakening sea current around Antarctica. Thus there is less mixing of the water masses which favours the growth of the sea ice.”
There’s no data to back this up, and so it just means the scientists don’t have a clue, are just shooting in the dark, and they should just say so.
Meanwhile, alarmist site Klimaretter presented its polar sea ice summary for 2014, but forgot to mention anything at all about the South Pole.

"Carol Heriot was standing in the kitchen thinking about what to cook for dinner on Tuesday afternoon when a police officer knocked on her door. “He said: ‘Love, it’s time to get out of here.’ I said: ‘What do you mean?’ and he pointed up the hill and he said: ‘You see that smoke? It’s coming this way.’” Heriot, her partner Rodney Smith and their dog Bundy were among the 80-odd people, dogs, birds, cats and goldfish crowded into the auditorium of the Tuncurry bowling club on Tuesday night. “We’re a bit of a menagerie at the moment and it looks a bit like Noah’s ark out the back,” the manager, Terry Green, told Guardian Australia earlier in the day. Some played cards, others chatted over a barbecue while the ABC’s rolling coverage of the bushfires that have ripped through New South Wales in the past 24 hours played silently on a big screen in the background. Others somehow managed to sleep as volunteers busily organised the steady flow of donated mattresses into orderly rows. Located about 35km (22 miles) from Taree on the NSW mid-north coast, the twin towns of Forster-Tuncurry – sleepy, seaside places popular with retired people and summer tourists – have found themselves precariously hemmed in on many sides by the bushfire crisis. Besides the three minor (for now) fires that surround the two towns, the out-of-control Hillville Road fire, which by Tuesday night had burned through more than 21,000 hectares (52,000 acres), sits just to the north. In fact, a quick look at the rural fire service’s increasingly visited Fires Near Me app shows there are, indeed, fires near here. So many in fact that in the 650km (400 miles) between Tuncurry and Brisbane it’s hard to see land for all the alerts. The town is almost cut off. The Pacific Highway – the main road in from the south – has been closed, as has Failford Road to the north. The one remaining entry point – the narrow, undulating Lakes Way – is thick with smoke that hangs eerily over the Myall Lakes along which it runs. In the tiny village of Bungwahl, Joseph Schuelein was filling up jerry cans with water from the lake for his gutters. He had been told to leave, he said, but had no intention of going. “The bloke from the local fire brigade did come down and say we should think about moving, but where are we going to go?” he said. “It’ll be bad if the fire comes through, for sure, [but] our place is pretty well protected, and we’ve got Dad’s boat on the lake if things got really bad.” A little earlier, down on the Pacific Highway, a line of trucks too large to handle the Lakes Way snaked back for a few hundred metres. “I reckon I could get her around it, but those bastards up there won’t let me through,” one driver said. By Tuesday night, there were more than 70 fires burning across NSW. Half of them were out of control, with emergency alerts issued for nine of them. Of those nine, five were on the state’s mid-north or mid coast. At least a dozen homes have been damaged or destroyed, and the rural fire service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, was at pains to warn that a southerly wind that was making its way up the coast could worsen conditions on the mid-north coast overnight. “All of those fires are going to demand a bit of attention tonight and are going to be increased and exacerbated by those southerly winds even if it is at 2am in the morning,” he said. While Tuesday was marked as a “catastrophic” fire day for NSW, people in this part of the state have gotten used to the smoke haze that has hung over them for the last week or so. Like Heriot, most of those crowded into the bowling club on Tuesday night came from the nearby suburb of Failford, just north of Forster. Lucy and John Van Hoof were in their home at a caravan park on the edge of town when they were told to leave. For days, the smoke had been building, but by Tuesday afternoon the black and grey clouds seemed to loom unnervingly close. “There was smoke everywhere. We could see it all coming up over the hill,” Lucy said. “We’ve been here 23 years and I’ve never seen anything like it. When they told us to leave I thought: ‘I’d rather leave now than wait.’ “I don’t know what’s happened. I just hope it’s still there when we get back. We don’t even know whether we can leave tomorrow.” Another caravan park resident, Doreen Bigness, was worried about two pillows she had lost in the evacuation centre. She asked a staff member to make an announcement about them over the club’s loudspeaker, then revealed that not everyone at the caravan park had left. “I called my neighbour a couple of hours ago and he’s still there,” she said. “I thought he was right behind me when I left. He’s older than me and he’s got problems with his breathing; he uses a machine, you know? I almost wish I didn’t know, that I didn’t call, but I was just being neighbourly. I just thought he must have booked into a motel.” Evacuation centres like the bowling club dot the coast now. This one was set up, almost accidentally, by Lauren Whitty and some friends who run a community Facebook group. When the fires ran through to the nearby northern towns of Taree and Port Macquarie, they started using the group to see if they could organise a few donations. “We just put out a call for help and we’ve had people from Sydney, Newcastle and some of the locals wanting to donate things. For a while we were like: ‘Oh, we don’t know where to send everything,’” she said. As the fire edged closer to them, though, they organised the evacuation centre with the bowling club and almost immediately people began trickling in. As the auditorium continued to fill, another load of air mattresses arrived from a local store and people filed in and out with more supplies. “I think we’ve got plenty, but they have told us to expect more people later. I don’t know, to be honest, I don’t know what most of these people have been through,” she said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  (FAZ), Germany’s leading national political daily, has a commentary on the IPCC’s WG III report. It’s also online here.
On the front page AGW believer Joachim Müller-Jung comments:
The solution appears so simple – but collectively it is so difficult to achieve.”
He adds that meanwhile
Climate policy is now changing course. […] A global cooperation on stabilizing the climate is not going to happen.”
Never mind that Müller-Jung actually believes the IPCC’s already glaringly faulty crystal ball forecasts are going to come true if we don’t act. He sees a number of obstacles ahead in tackling the “climate problem” globally. He writes that coal and natural gas today are “so cheap that the ecological change to renewables will just have to wait” and that in respect to emission reductions “the IPCC has to acknowledge that rigid mandatory targets have little political value and are morally dubious.”
Müller-Jung sees no chance of a collective global agreement on reductions and that the best we can hope for are regional measures that take regional conditions into account. “Many climate activists have a hard time accepting that.”

"Films and TV shows keep depicting wild animals as fun and friendly characters, with human-like personalities. It’s better than representing them as evil monsters, of course, but sometimes films can have a bad influence on which animals become trendy to have as pets. The most recent example concerns the Disney animation Zootropolis (also titled Zootopia or even Zoomania depending on where you live) and the fennec fox, a small, cat-sized fox with large ears that it uses to keep cool in its native Sahara. In the film a fennec fox, named Finnick, appears in only a handful of scenes as a sidekick to one of the central characters, a red fox named Nick Wilde. Yet the character clearly made the most of his limited screen time. Following the movie’s release in China, there have been reports of huge demand for fennec foxes as pets despite their unsuitability for life as companion animals.  Though the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species currently lists the fennec fox as one of “least concern”, this could be a game-changer. The main threat to populations in North Africa is from trapping for sale to tourists and for exhibition purposes, and there is now speculation that the Chinese pet craze could have an impact on their numbers in the wild. There is good reason for this assumption, as this isn’t the first time pet-keeping trends have been influenced by blockbuster films or popular TV shows that have featured anthropomorphised animals or exotic species.  Large, unusual or hard-to-keep dog breeds have been given an onscreen makeover in movies such as Beethoven (Saint Bernards), Turner and Hooch (Dogue de Bordeaux) or the Harry Potter franchise (Neapolitan Mastiff). 101 Dalmatians portrayed the breed as cute, fun-loving family dogs but experts point out that the breed is in fact strong-minded, requires high levels of exercise and can be destructive. In 1997, a year after the film was released, rescue organisations in the US reported that the number of Dalmatians surrendered to shelters had more than doubled. It’s been a similar story recently for Alaskan Malamutes, Siberian Huskies and other wolf-like breeds after the inclusion of wolves and Northern Inuit Dogs in Game of Thrones and the Twilight movies. By 2014 the number of wolf-like dogs taken in by the UK Dogs Trust charity had tripled over four years. Owners found themselves unprepared for the realities of living with large, powerful breeds and their requirements for exercise, socialisation and mental stimulation. It’s not just dogs: sales of turtles and tortoises increased rapidly following the various Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies. The charity American Tortoise Rescue estimated that the majority were eventually killed, flushed down toilets, or dumped.  Pet shops were inundated with requests for clown-fish after the release of Finding Nemo in 2003, despite the specialist needs and costs associated with caring for tropical reef fish. Harry Potter’s pet Hedwig also led to a substantial increase in the number of pet owls given up to sanctuaries. Chimpanzees have also suffered for decades due to their misrepresentation in popular media. The species is currently listed as endangered, and the illegal pet trade continues to be one of its major threats. The standard practice for acquiring chimpanzees from the wild is to kill the female chimp and take her baby.  Despite numerous film and television representations of chimps as cute, human-like clowns, they are wholly unsuitable as companion animals. Natural behaviour developed by around age five puts humans at risk of severe injury from aggression and biting. Many chimpanzees are given up to research laboratories; a lucky few find a place in specialist sanctuaries. The consequences of trends driven by film and television for many animals are both sad and alarming. The industries should certainly take some level of responsibility for their representations of animals and some have already done this, providing information about the species featured as fictional characters onscreen. However responsibility lies elsewhere too and there needs to be a wider conversation about the relationship humans have with animals in general. This discussion could begin with the acknowledgement that other animals are individual sentient beings with their own species-specific interests and needs. A radical change in human attitudes towards other species is long overdue."
"Headlines claiming that the Labour manifesto means a re-nationalisation of the energy sector are wrong. So what does it really say, and what would it change? First of all, forget the tariff cap on standard household energy bills. Both main parties are promising it, so that’s a zero sum game. Instead, let’s take Labour’s manifesto statements in the direction that energy flows, from power plant to light switch. And that means starting with generation.  The manifesto makes a strong commitment to nuclear, but it is silent on the need for more gas power plants. These “flexible” gas plants will be essential to make sure the lights stay on when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing (coal is too dirty, and nuclear power can’t easily be switched on and off). It’s important to realise there isn’t a single generating technology being built in the UK that is not getting some government subsidy, either in the form of “feed-in tariffs” for renewables, or the “capacity market” for traditional power plants. Since the wind and solar generation boom, flexible plants run less often and make less money, so private companies don’t build enough new ones and are shutting old ones down.  To counter this problem, the capacity market was set up in 2014, and was designed to subsidise gas power plants. The then coalition government asked the market for the cheapest flexible capacity, believing it would be gas. However, the answer from the market was that “cheap” also included old coal plants and diesel generation which is about as dirty as electricity gets. Labour’s manifesto doesn’t give any detail, but some state-owned gas plants might be the only way to solve this problem without even more subsidy. This is probably more ideologically palatable to a Labour government than it is to Liberals, Conservatives or even Greens. Next the infrastructure, the wires and pipes that move electricity and gas around. Because these systems are natural monopolies run by private companies the government regulates these companies’ revenues.  Regulated infrastructure revenues do not exactly scream “innovation”, and because of this grid, companies have needed hundreds of millions in public subsidy to invest in smart grids. This is why cities from Germany to the US are buying back these networks to accelerate investment. This is called re-municipalisation because it is the cities, not states, which are buying the networks back.   Labour’s manifesto says it will legislate to “permit publicly owned local companies to purchase the regional grid infrastructure, and to ensure that national and regional grid infrastructure is brought into public ownership over time”.  To understand why this is Labour policy, it’s important to know that many of these networks are owned by companies like Macquarie, an Australian capital fund which has been criticised for its arguably ruthless model of global infrastructure investing. The same is true for the smaller distribution companies; for example, the company that services Yorkshire is ultimately owned by Warren Buffett, the world’s second richest man. Macquarie, Warren Buffett and similar interests own many UK infrastructure networks, and it is no surprise that this does not sit well with the current Labour leadership. Some point out that if energy sector regulation were to work as intended ownership would not matter, but others argue these companies are extracting what amounts to a privatised tax. Allowing cities and other public companies to buy back these grids costs money, but it also makes money. The choice for Labour would be whether they use those new revenues to fund social programmes, cut energy bills, or reinvest to make grids smarter. Next the retail market, the place where we choose a supplier. Labour’s manifesto promises at least one publicly-owned energy company in every region of the UK. We already have some: Robin Hood Energy (Nottingham), Bristol Energy and White Rose Energy (Leeds) are all owned by the city councils.  I have argued municipal energy suppliers are a good idea if you want to deliver smart, decentralised systems that tackle fuel poverty and promote local green energy. This is not nationalisation. In fact, setting up these new public utilities relies on them having a market to enter.  City utilities are among a group of new energy suppliers which are signing customers up fast by offering a meaningful choice on the mix of green vs traditional energy, new price deals, and for some, an opportunity to buy from a locally-owned company – public or otherwise.  At the demand, or “energy efficiency”, end of the market, the Labour manifesto promises to insulate 4m homes. This is an extremely welcome move as current policy is nonexistent and previous efforts were a dismal failure. Serious action is possible, is good for public health, and is a huge economic opportunity. Homeowners will be offered interest-free loans and measures for private rents are to be introduced. There isn’t any detail on how the 4m homes will be targeted but it reads as though households in fuel poverty will be first. The Labour manifesto signifies the most substantial intervention in the market in 20 years. It is not a full nationalisation though. It is a series of interventions designed to tackle profiteering, and take an active stake in the system."
"In February, a 27-year-old Indian man named Raphael Samuel announced plans for an unusual lawsuit. He was going to sue his parents for begetting him. “It was not our decision to be born,” he told the BBC. “Human existence is totally pointless.” Samuel recently told me over Skype from Mumbai that his is a good life, and he is actually close to his parents. His complaint is more fundamental: he believes it is wrong to bring new people into the world without their consent. He wanted to sue his parents for a symbolic amount of money, such as a single rupee, “to instill that fear among parents in general. Because now parents don’t think before having a child,” he told me.  Samuel subscribes to a philosophy called anti-natalism. The basic tenet of anti-natalism is simple but, for most of us, profoundly counterintuitive: that life, even under the best of circumstances, is not a gift or a miracle, but rather a harm and an imposition. According to this logic, the question of whether to have a child is not just a personal choice but an ethical one – and the correct answer is always no. Since his announcement, the lawsuit has not gotten off the ground. “I have been clearly told by a sitting judge that I will be fined by the court for wasting its time,” Samuel said. Still, his lawsuit gave the anti-natalist movement a boost, even earning a bemused mention by Stephen Colbert. In May, Dana Wells, a 37-year-old Dallas-based woman who goes by “The Friendly Antinatalist” on YouTube, posted a video featuring the Colbert clip and congratulating Samuel. “We all owe you a round of applause,” she said. “It feels like we’ve arrived. It feels like the big time!” The notion that having children may be a bad idea seems to be gaining mainstream popularity. But when we hear about it, it’s most often in the context of the climate crisis: activists are worried about bringing children into a world threatened by rising seas, mass displacement and other calamities. Anti-natalists, however, believe that procreation has always been and always will be wrong because of life’s inevitable suffering. What is similar about both anti-natalists and climate activists is they are seeing an increase in attention due to general pessimism about the state of the world, giving both more opportunities to gain support. ••• In 2006, the South African philosopher David Benatar published a book which is widely credited with introducing the term anti-natalism. In Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence, Benatar quotes the Greek tragedian Sophocles (“Never to have been born is best / But if we must see the light, the next best / Is quickly returning whence we came”) and the text of Ecclesiastes (“So I have praised the dead that are already dead more than the living that are yet alive; but better than both of them is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun”). These quotes suggest that the sentiments at the heart of anti-natalism have been around for a very long time. In modern history, another strain of thought emerged, warning against the dangers of population growth. In the late 18th century, Thomas Malthus sounded the alarm that the population would outstrip the food supply. In 1968, a Stanford biologist named Paul Ehrlich published the bestselling book The Population Bomb and co-founded the organization Zero Population Growth (later renamed Population Connection), arguing that the growth in global population would lead to famines and ecological crisis. He also suggested that people have no more than two children. One member of Zero Population Growth struck out on his own with a much more radical agenda. A man named Les Knight launched the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) with the goal of “Phasing out the human race by voluntarily ceasing to breed”, as stated on the website that he launched in 1996. While Benatar also sought to discourage reproduction, his ideas grew out of different premises. The objective of anti-natalism, as Benatar sees it, is to reduce human suffering. Since life inevitably involves some amount of suffering, bringing another person into the world introduces the guarantee of some harm. He argued that “the quality of even the best lives is very bad – and considerably worse than most people recognize it to be. Although it is obviously too late to prevent our own existence, it is not too late to prevent the existence of future possible people.” Benatar told me recently that he has heard from many readers of his book who “have often felt that they were alone in the world. It was a great comfort to them to read a philosophical defense of a view they found intuitively correct.” Dana Wells, the Dallas-based YouTuber, felt validated by Benatar’s work. About five years ago, she reunited with her biological brother (she was adopted), and he grilled her about why she didn’t have children. Feeling annoyed after their meeting, she searched online for books – “I’m a reader. I’m a nerd,” she says – in hopes of finding out about others who didn’t want kids. For the first time, she encountered the terms “childfree” and “anti-natalism”. She began “to see that this life game is an imposition”. For her, it was simple: “Living things can be harmed. Non-living things cannot be harmed.” As “The Friendly Antinatalist”, she posts videos with titles like First American Use of the Term ‘Antinatalism’ and Can Parents Be Antinatalists? The answer to that question is yes, Wells says, looking into the camera. “It would be great if all anti-natalists could be childfree, but the world just doesn’t work out that way, you know? Especially for people who have recently learned about anti-natalism … you can’t fault those people for having children in the 70s, 80s, or 90s.” She also discusses the distinctions between true anti-natalists (those who believe that creating new life is always wrong); the childfree (who don’t want kids themselves but don’t necessarily consider procreation unethical); and “denatalists” (who disapprove of procreation only under certain conditions such as people with genetic disabilities they will pass on to offspring, though this disapproval doesn’t usually transfer to racial or ethnic groups). Real anti-natalism, Wells emphasizes, means opposing all births, under all circumstances. Wells also uses her videos to address tensions among true anti-natalists. “The biggest rift is between the vegans and the non-vegans,” she told me. To Benatar and his followers, the values of anti-natalism – that is, the imperative to avoid harm – apply not only to humans but to all sentient beings. This brings us to perhaps the most unexpected aspect of anti-natalism: taken to its logical conclusion, it implies that not only humans but all sentient beings should be spared from life. As Benatar writes toward the end of the book, “it would be better if humans (and other species) became extinct.” As a result, many, but not all, anti-natalists are vegans. (The Antinatalism page on Facebook has about 7,000 followers; the Antinatalist Vegans page has more than 13,000.) The challenge for anti-natalists – especially those who believe that not only humans but other species would be better off nonexistent – is how to achieve their goals without imposing additional suffering. ••• While anti-natalists believe that life is a curse, climate activists are primarily concerned about inflicting the ecological state of the world of today – and especially of tomorrow – on a child. In 2015, two American climate activists, Meghan Kallman and Josephine Ferorelli, founded a network called Conceivable Future. They organize house parties throughout the country for people to share their considerations about having children, given the realities of the climate crisis. They upload videos from these gatherings to their website and encourage others to post their own “testimony”. In one video, a 31-year-old elementary school teacher says: “I feel such fear and guilt and shame and sadness already … I find the loss of animals and plant life, the loss of water and air, just sad.” Others are more concerned about inflicting a child – or rather the emissions the child would inevitably produce – on the world.” In another video, a young man asks: “Do I really want to bring someone else into the world who’s gonna consume those fossil fuels?” The Conceivable Future co-founders do not advocate any particular choice about childbearing. Instead, they want to open the space for these painful conversations. “We had noticed that the climate movement really lacked heart,” Kallman told me. Drawing the connections between the issue and these intensely personal decisions was a way to illuminate the stakes of climate change. “Every successful social movement in history has been successful because people can see what it means for them,” Kallman said. “We see our job as giving people the emotional grounding to do the work.” In March, the British singer-songwriter Blythe Pepino began organizing a group called BirthStrike, made up of about 600 people globally who refuse to have children as a result of the climate breakdown. Pepino has said that she wants to be a mother, but reluctantly decided that ecological circumstances were too dire. Like the founders of Conceivable Future, BirthStrike adherents don’t stand for population control but rather for calling attention to the severity of the climate crisis. Anti-natalists and climate change activists have intersected in some ways, and each has drawn more attention to the other. Anti-natalist forums, for instance, often include information about how childlessness can reduce carbon footprints. But ultimately, the goals of the two camps diverge sharply. BirthStrike grew out of a group called Extinction Rebellion, which is protesting against the threatened extinction of millions of species, potentially including our own. By contrast, for true anti-natalists, extinction is the dream. In a way, anti-natalists can offer some useful perspective for the rest of us. It may feel like a scary time to bring a child into the world, but, as anti-natalists I spoke to pointed out, it always has been. “It’s not clear to me that the world is getting worse,” Benatar said. “At all stages in human history, life has been filled with enough unpleasantness, enough badness, and of course always ending in death.” In some ways, children in the past – before vaccines and anesthetic and laws – faced more risk and pain than they do today. Perhaps anti-natalists can help us appreciate that uncertainty and pain are an inherent part of sentient existence – even if we disagree with them about whether the bargain is worth it."
"Formula One has pledged to deliver on an ambitious programme to address the global climate emergency by going carbon neutral within 11 years. The sport has committed to a plan that not only ensures it has a net carbon impact of zero by 2030 but will also adopt policies to make all grands prix fully sustainable by 2025. Both are bold targets that will not be easily met for a sport which produces 256,000 tons of CO2 each season while transporting 10 teams and equipment to 21 races and with the global calendar set to expand. However, as the sport unveiled details of how it plans to achieve its goal, every team has embraced the carbon-zero goal with an understanding that for the sport to prosper it must reflect public opinion on the climate emergency, and the hope it that it may stand as a model for other sports to follow suit. The intention is to wipe out the carbon footprint by developing synthetic fuel, and making logistics and travel as efficient as possible while ensuring offices, facilities and factories are powered by renewable energy and eliminating single use plastic. Anything that cannot be eliminated will be offset. The move also reflects opinion among the drivers. Britain’s Lewis Hamilton, who became world champion for the sixth time at the last round in the USA, has been criticised in recent weeks for his outspoken environmental concerns given his participation in the sport. However he has attempted to adopt a sustainable lifestyle, welcomed F1’s proposals and refused to be browbeaten by critics. “Yes we are travelling around the world, yes we are racing F1 cars,” he said. “Our carbon footprint is larger than the average homeowner but you shouldn’t be afraid to speak out for something that can be a positive change.” The Green Party deputy leader, Amelia Womack, believes Formula One should serve as an example. “It is very welcome that Formula One is making this commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, and significantly clean up their environmental impact,” she said. “It should set a benchmark for all other sports organisations and businesses to follow suit – if F1 can do it then surely anyone can. “The science is clear, we must turn our whole economy and society to be net-zero carbon by 2030. The government should hang their head in shame that they won’t reach net-zero carbon emissions until at least 2050, while a world series of car racing is doing the right thing for the planet.” On Tuesday, the detailed results of a year-long consultation between owners Liberty Media, the sport’s governing body (the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile), the 10 teams, race promoters and sustainability experts, were revealed. The current engine is to be developed into a new net zero-carbon power unit. In 2021, 10% use of biofuel will be mandatory and it is expected with improved engine efficiency and the development of synthetic fuel that uses carbon capture, the proposed target is attainable. This is backed by a commitment to using only renewable energy at F1 and team facilities. While for logistics and travel, employing low carbon means where possible and maximising efficiency will be pursued. By far the biggest contributor to the CO2 the sport produces is the air travel on which the sport depends. There are 21 races this year and next year their will be a record 22. Nine of the meetings were in Europe with the remaining 13 spread across the globe from Australia to the USA, China and Brazil. Unsurprisingly then, 45% of the total carbon is from air, sea and road transport of the logistics required to put on each race. A further 27.7% was derived from the transport of personnel within the sport and its promoters and partners. In comparison the emissions from power units across every team, running two cars each for the entire season represented only 0.7% of the total. Indeed alongside developments F1 has pioneered in automotive safety, aerodynamics, advanced materials and energy recovery systems, the current generation of engine is the most efficient in operation in the world. However Formula One has done a singularly poor job in promoting the advances they have made in this field with F1 cars more than 20% more efficient than a road vehicle. Further decreasing the carbon footprint of the cars themselves is eminently achievable then but for the travel and logistics F1 has had to commit to offsetting any carbon it cannot eliminate by tree planting and developing carbon recapture technology. Neither will be cheap nor easily achieved but the sport is well placed to lead the way. Formula One is a major industry in the UK. Seven of the 10 teams are based there and across the racing industry employ more than 40,000 people, with an annual turnover of around £9bn. Driven by fierce technological competitiveness it is estimated they invest £1bn in research and development every year."
"Bad behaviour doesn’t usually have good consequences but our fossil fuel and fertiliser habits may have had some “good” environmental side-effects. Our new research suggests that the last 200 years of pollution have increased the carbon stored in soils across natural ecosystems in Britain. And this locking in of carbon in soils provides an offset for some of our carbon emissions. But the catch-22 is if we kick our polluting habits, this carbon is at risk of returning to our atmosphere, contributing to climate change. The increase in soil carbon storage in natural habitats across Britain is due to another element: nitrogen. Atmospheric nitrogen pollution has not enjoyed the limelight of its high-profile cousin, carbon dioxide, but they share a similar history. Burning fossil fuels and intensive farming not only releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but also reactive nitrogen. Being reactive means that this nitrogen doesn’t stay in the atmosphere for long, but gets deposited back on the land, especially via rainfall.  The gardeners among you will know that nitrogen is a fertiliser. It’s an important nutrient and the second most fundamental building block of life after carbon. Most natural ecosystems are accustomed to getting by with very little nitrogen. Although there’s lots of nitrogen in the atmosphere, it’s in a form that’s hard for plants to access. In contrast, the nitrogen  added to the land by deposition is easy for plants to access. Since the industrial revolution our pollution has added a vast amount of nitrogen to natural ecosystems. Today, the amount of nitrogen entering natural ecosystems worldwide due to human activities is estimated to be over four times larger than that which is naturally available.  Our team set out to explore what effect this extra nitrogen has had on natural ecosystems. We used computer models to explore the effects and gathered together data where scientists had measured soil carbon decades ago and returned to measure it again. We found that our history of atmospheric nitrogen deposition has had a significant fertiliser effect in Britain. More nitrogen has allowed plants to grow more, and ultimately as they die, add more carbon to the soil organic matter. We found that carbon in topsoils has increased on average by more than 12% since 1800 across the forests, grasslands and heathlands that cover around a third of Britain. This increase is closer to 20% for broadleaf woodlands because tree canopies are better at capturing atmospheric nitrogen deposition. To put this into context, in the 200 years before (1600 to 1800), topsoil carbon in these natural ecosystems increased by only 1%. Soil carbon is very important in regulating our climate. It is the largest store of organic carbon on Earth – larger than the atmosphere and all the vegetation combined. We estimated that an extra 78m tonnes of carbon have been added to soils in the UK due to nitrogen pollution. Due to the high population, this is equal to only about 0.5% of the total carbon emissions since the industrial revolution. But this carbon increase is likely to have also happened elsewhere in Europe and beyond and so the total carbon storage increase in comparison to total emissions is likely to be much bigger. More carbon in soils and not in the atmosphere is good, right? Yes, but nitrogen enrichment comes with many bad side effects. It is known to lead to soil acidification, biodiversity loss and water pollution. But our research also hints at another sort of catch – a carbon catch-22. This extra carbon in the soil will only remain there if pollution continues.  The store of carbon is constantly being refreshed in the soil, decomposing and being lost as carbon dioxide or dissolved in water and replenished by dead plant material. Soil carbon is a mix of matter with a varying lifetime in the soil, ranging from days to hundreds of years.  Unfortunately, our research suggests that most of the new carbon that has entered the soil over the last 200 years is the relatively short-term kind and if we want to keep that carbon there then nitrogen pollution levels must be maintained.  So it’s a catch-22. We can keep this carbon in the soil by sticking with dirty fossil fuel burning habits that drive climate change and suffering the biodiversity and water quality consequences of too much nitrogen. Or clean up our act by reducing emissions, mitigating climate change and reducing the nitrogen pressures on species diversity and waterways – but release all the carbon that has been stored up over the last 200 years and so further contribute to climate change. Which of these options is the frying pan and which is the fire? Continuing to pollute is clearly not an option and we must act now to curb our carbon emissions. But this soil carbon release should be taken into account in all climate projections. We need to better understand how much carbon may be released from similar ecosystems globally as this may bring forward the time horizons over which we can expect to feel the effects of climate change and increase the need for mitigation."

"All the candidates for the 2016 London mayoral elections have talked about their ideas for dealing with the housing crisis, air pollution, congestion, terrorism and extremism. But what has often been forgotten about in the media coverage is that London also has a waste crisis. The capital is the worst performing region in England when it comes to household recycling. (Waste policy for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is devolved.) In 2015, the recycling rate in England as a whole was 44% – London was the only region with a rate below 40%. Out of 33 boroughs, 25 have household recycling rates between 20% and 40%. This means that, as far as the capital’s waste is concerned, more is sent to landfill or is incinerated, compared to other English regions. There is no obvious reason why London should be doing particular badly compared to the rest of the country. Certainly there are reasons that are not specific to London but this can be put down to the differences between the household collection services offered by different local councils.  It is often perceived that housing density and income levels are the main influences on whether people recycle. It is more difficult to provide individual household collection services for people in flats, who may have to take their waste to a communal collection point. Those with a higher income are able to buy more, so may have more to throw away as a result.  However, in a review of research by the Greater London Authority (GLA), it was found that there is a clear correlation between deprivation in an area and lower recycling rates. Local councils may receive less in council tax from those in deprived areas and, with public funding cuts, there is less money to spend on other council services.  The GLA study shows that even deprivation does not have to be a barrier, if there is local political leadership and better negotiation of contracts with waste management companies. Contracts have been criticised as incentivising landfill and incineration over recycling.       Councils are required to provide a waste and recycling collections service. However, this comes in many forms, and my own research has found the general consensus is that the type of recycling collection – unsorted (or “co-mingled”) or sorted by households into different bins – does have an impact. Co-mingled collections are more convenient for households but the risk of contamination and rejection by recycling processing companies is higher. On top of that, since local authorities can use many different waste collection companies, it isn’t always clear what actually counts as recyclable. It also depends on whether councils offer rewards to motivate households or penalise households with fines for not disposing of waste properly. As Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler famously pointed out, decisions taken by local authorities can shape the environment that “nudges” human behaviour.  Two of the main mayoral candidates, Zac Goldsmith (Conservative) and Sian Berry (Green) have suggested working with local councils to develop a consistent or common minimum approach for recycling collection.  There is potentially already a mechanism to do this through the London Waste and Recycling Board, but this body does not have the power to set rules. Its funding comes from the government and the Greater London Assembly. Until 2010, it was chaired by Boris Johnson directly but since then he has been represented by an assembly member, and the current chair steps down this month. This means it is still up to local authorities to decide how to collect waste and they have resisted the idea of a single, London waste authority in the past.  It is perhaps for this reason that Sadiq Khan (Labour) does not think that a common standard for London is realistic. Khan does not elucidate anything more than a vague recognition of the need to meet European Union targets. Caroline Pidgeon, the Liberal Democrat candidate, wants to work with councils to set tougher targets. However, without further lawmaking powers, it isn’t clear how such non-binding targets would help, however tough they are. Yet if Goldsmith or Berry were to be elected they would have a democratic mandate for change, and would find themselves working with a Defra minister in Rory Stewart who is sympathetic to the idea of a unified waste policy. A solution for London’s recycling crisis may be possible – but don’t get your hopes up."
"Despite one or two scares along the way, the UK has not suffered a recession since the deep slump of 2008-09, but it came close to one this year. The economy contracted in the second quarter and for a while there were fears that it could do so again in the three months to September. Those fears have proved misplaced. The City expects the Office for National Statistics to announce growth of 0.3% tomorrow when it unveils its first estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product. The Bank of England has pencilled in a 0.4% expansion.  Either way, Boris Johnson is going to be spared the embarrassment of explaining to the voters why he has called a general election with the economy in recession. That’s not saying all that much, though. The Bank said that, over 2019, the economy is likely to grow by an average of 0.2% per quarter – half its rate of expansion in 2018. Investment has fallen in five of the past six quarters, leaving the economy increasingly dependent on consumer spending. And here, too, there are worrying signs. Consumers have started to save more, an indication they are anxious about the prospects for both the economy and their own finances. Britain is running on fumes. It is not just the GDP figures that will be released this week. Tuesday sees data for the labour market, Wednesday the latest on inflation levels and Thursday news about how much consumers are spending in the shops and online. By the end of the week we should have a reasonably clear picture of the current state of the economy. By that point, the political spin doctors will have gone into overdrive, with one set arguing that the figures show that Britain is booming and another saying it is in dire straits. The truth, as ever, is more nuanced. The good news for the government is that employment levels are high, unemployment is low, and earnings are rising more rapidly than prices. The bad news is that the labour market appears to have peaked in the summer, with gently rising unemployment leading to a slight fall in earnings growth. The story of past elections is that governments can win them – as happened in 1992 – with the economy struggling, and that they can lose them – as in 1997 – with the economy going gangbusters. What matters to voters is not so much whether the economy is growing by 0.3% or 0.4% but which party can craft the better narrative. Labour’s narrative is simple. Years of austerity are to blame for the fact that the economy is growing so sluggishly and that earnings – when adjusted for inflation – are still well below where they were when the last recession began in 2008. Time for a change is always a powerful electoral message, and after a lost decade of growth for wages and productivity, it should be even more powerful. The Conservatives will have a different take. They will point to the delay in delivering Brexit as the reason for the economic slowdown this year and promise that once the uncertainty is ended, a wave of pent-up investment will be unleashed. This is hyperbole. There will, as Mark Carney suggested last week, be some bounce-back in activity now that a no-deal Brexit is off the table, but it won’t be spectacular, and growth over the next few years is expected to be modest by pre-financial-crisis standards. That may not matter, though. The Conservative pitch to voters is that while the economy is perhaps not in the best of shapes, it would be doing a lot worse if Labour were in charge. Will it work? It did in 1992. Britain’s main political parties are entering the general election with – by popular demand – plans for the green economy at the centre of their campaigns. For the first time, polling by YouGov has put the climate crisis among the top three issues facing the country, behind Brexit and the NHS. But will the parties offer realistic environmental policies, or unworkable political one-upmanship? Labour is expected to follow the example of the Green party’s manifesto in bringing forward the government’s existing ambition to become carbon neutral by 2050. It’s an admirable ambition, with a hefty price tag. The Greens would spend £100bn a year to create a “net zero carbon” economy by 2030. Labour plans to spend £250bn on a green fund that would prop up new investments in clean energy and transport projects for a decade. Both are expected to raise taxes and government borrowing to support their plans. But kicking the UK’s carbon addiction will require far more than just cash. Pledges are the easy part, but forging a new path necessitates detailed planning. The government’s official climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, has warned that the earliest date by which the UK could meet a net zero carbon target without serious economic risks is 2050. Over a 30-year period, the country could plan meticulously and take careful investment decisions to lower the risk of wasting public money. But even this would require a step-change in ambition in a country that is on track to miss its 2030 climate targets by quite a margin. This is more than a fight between eco-warriors wary of wasting time and economic pragmatists wary of wasting money. A bungled eco- transition would cost Britain both. A green revolution is nothing without a very careful plan of attack. Shares in UK gambling firms have tanked since last week, when an influential group of MPs called for much stricter regulation of online casinos, including stake limits akin to those imposed on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). In response the Betting and Gaming Council, a lobby group launched this month to replace the trade bodies that proved ineffective in their defence of FOBTs, wheeled out a five-point “safer gambling” plan. It would be cynical in the extreme to suggest that bookies concocted these proposals in response to the hit their shares took at the idea of stricter regulation. It is much more likely that the Betting and Gaming Council prepared this olive branch some time ago, proffering it in good time for the annual Responsible Gambling week (7-13 November). Even so, longtime industry observers are left distinctly unimpressed. Some see the safer gambling manifesto as an act of self-preservation, a minor sacrifice offered up to stave off something more draconian. Others point to elements of the plan that look like flotsam resurfaced from the wreckage of long-neglected commitments. It is certainly a far cry from the quiver of sharp-edged proposals put forward by the MPs. These included hard stake limits and new legislation to replace the Gambling Act, which they described as “analogue legislation in a digital age”. Labour, which drew up the existing act under Tony Blair, has already swung its weight behind a much tougher successor. Westminster sources say the Tory wonks currently writing their manifesto for the election are open to the idea too. A new Gambling Act would bring us full circle. The Betting and Gaming Council is chaired by Brigid Simmonds, once a key figure at lobby group Business in Sport and Leisure, which had a lot of input into the current act. She now faces becoming the mouthpiece of the industry as that legislation is torn to shreds."
"The climate crisis will determine the lifelong health of today’s children, doctors have warned, noting that global heating was already causing harm. Children are especially vulnerable and the global team of researchers say rising temperatures mean the bacteria causing deadly diarrhoea will thrive while poorer crop yields could lead to more malnutrition. The annual Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change tracks the impacts of global heating on health. As well as children, older people are particularly vulnerable to heatwaves since they are less able to regulate their temperature and fluid balance. The authors found that 220 million more people over 65 were exposed to heatwaves in 2018 compared with 2000. Europe, the report said, was especially at risk, due to its high number of older citizens living in large, hot, cities. The 2019 report, coinciding with wildfires raging in Australia, also found that human exposure to fires had doubled since 2000. Wildfires not only cause deaths and health damage but had significant economic and social impacts. Hugh Montgomery, a professor at University College London, who is co-chair of the Lancet Countdown, said: “Our children recognise the climate emergency, and demand action to protect them. We must listen, and respond. This year the accelerating impacts of climate change have become clearer than ever. The highest recorded temperatures in western Europe, and wildfires in Siberia, Queensland, and California triggered asthma, respiratory infections and heatstroke.” Nick Watts, executive director of the Lancet Countdown, said: “Children’s bodies and immune systems are still developing, leaving them more susceptible to disease and environmental pollutants. The damage done in early childhood lasts a lifetime. Without immediate action from all countries climate change will come to define the health of an entire generation.” The report is produced by 120 experts from 35 institutions, including the World Health Organisation, World Bank, and Yale and Tsinghua universities. The study tracks 41 indicators including the spread of infectious diseases. It was found that, spurred on by global heating, the ability of dengue fever to be transmitted by mosquitoes in 2017 was at the second highest level recorded since 1950, while nine of the 10 most suitable years for transmission had happened since 2000. “Dengue is the most rapidly expanding infection around the world,” said Watts. “It is called breakbone fever because it is incredibly painful.” The report also found 2018 was the second most suitable year on record for the spread of the cholera bacteria, which cause much of the diarrhoeal disease and wound infections around the globe. Watts said the first native cases of tick-borne encephalitis in the UK were recorded in October. “This is a disease we know is moving as a result of climate change.” The report said infants were worst hit by malnutrition, and that, as temperatures have risen, the capability of many cereal crops to deliver full yields has fallen in the last 30 years. The report examined people’s exposure to wildfires for the first time. “At a global level, there is an increasing exposure,” said Elizabeth Robinson, a co-author and professor at the University of Reading. (Other research had not  recorded a growth in numbers of wildfires.) Coal-fired power plants should be phased out worldwide and travel shifted to public transport and cycling, the report also said. Robinson said urgent action was needed to cut agricultural emissions by humans eating seasonal plant-based diets. The report found the greenhouse gas emissions from livestock in the UK were equivalent to 40% of emissions from the power sector. Robinson said the technology existed to tackle climate change and that action made sense economically, even just on health grounds, particularly as the air pollution from fossil fuel burning cost trillions of dollars. The choices today were “entirely political”, she said. Stella Hartinger, of Cayetano Heredia University, in Peru, and a Lancet Countdown author, said: “The path that the world chooses today will irreversibly mark our children’s futures. We must listen to the millions of young people who have led the wave of school strikes for urgent action.”"
"Among their many privileges, India’s wealthiest households can rely on a consistent supply of electricity and access to cooking gas. The situation is rather different for other social groups, however. My research has shown lower caste and tribal households have 10-30% less access to electricity and clean cooking fuel, even when controlling for other factors like income or education. This is just one outcome of India’s caste system, which divides the country’s population into rigid and hereditary social strata. Caste discrimination was declared illegal in the Indian constitution – and positive discrimination was introduced to correct historical injustices. Those assisted by the constitution are the “scheduled castes”. They make up about 16% of India’s population and, despite affirmative action, still face many disadvantages. The “scheduled tribes” are another disadvantaged group. They include tribal or indigenous communities throughout India, and are outside the Hindu caste system. They comprise about 8% of the population. Despite substantial progress since independence, India still contains the largest number of energy-deprived people in the world, especially among these marginalised social groups. Access to modern energy has obvious direct benefits (lighting, cooked food, and so on), but it can also help micro-enterprises flourish and improve health and environmental quality. Without access to electricity or clean gas, many Indians use solid fuels such as coal or wood for cooking and lighting. These fuels emit CO₂ and other hazardous substances, creating indoor air pollution that contributes to more than 1m premature deaths in the country each year.  The only widely used clean cooking fuel is Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), which the government heavily subsidises for poorer households. However, the informal and illegal use of LPG in motor vehicles, small industries, and even in lavish weddings, hinders the supply to targeted groups. Motor vehicles, industries and the gas distribution agencies are all usually owned by rich and influential people who often prioritise the distribution of LPG cylinders to suit their own economic interests once the product reaches the black market. Access to electricity is perhaps even more important than access to gas. Officially, all urban areas and more than 90% of rural areas were electrified back in the 2000s, but service can be very inconsistent. Many villages and even some towns and cities may only get electricity for a few hours per day. Major electrification schemes now focus on connecting individual households rather than areas. Despite this, the influence of people with higher social status means the areas where they tend to cluster are first in line for improvements in supply, so energy inequality continues along socioeconomic lines.  My colleague and I wanted to investigate how much of this inequality was down to caste or tribal discrimination, specifically. We also looked at energy access among India’s Muslims, another generally deprived group who make up about 14% of the population. To ensure we identified the role of these three marginalised identities we controlled for other factors such as income, education and rural residency. Our initial results suggest that, in comparison to upper-caste households, scheduled caste and tribe households had inferior access to LPG and lower consumption of electricity. Partly, this is because these marginalised groups tend to reside within their cluster. In rural India, scheduled caste households are often segregated in hamlets outside the main village perimeter which makes it easier for electrical or gas suppliers to discriminate against them. Members of scheduled tribes often live in relatively remote places.  But inequality in energy access also seems to be generated by scheduled caste and scheduled tribe households having lower returns on socioeconomic capital including education or documentation. For example, on average, a household with certain education level, rural residence, income, and documentation from scheduled caste is likely to have less electricity and clean gas than his exact equivalent from a higher caste. This can only be down to discrimination. Our results for Muslims were more mixed, however. This is possibly as they tend to live in urban areas, albeit often in Muslim ghettos where households remain improperly accounted for.  None of this is particularly surprising: right across India, members of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe communities are often denied access to common public goods. Various government policies have had some success in tackling poverty and inequality in general, but very few have dealt with access to clean energy sources for socially marginalised groups. It is impossible to uproot the whole caste system within the short or medium term. The recent direct LPG subsidy policy is a step in the right direction with many pros, but lack of bank accounts, corruption, illiteracy and other problems may cause delays. Electricity policy, meanwhile, cannot simply focus on connecting more households or areas – it must target a more equitable overall consumption.  Access to energy is a crucial determinant of human capital. If India wishes to be a great economic and cultural power, it must ensure everyone has safe cooking fuel and electricity – regardless of social background."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman national weekly DIE ZEIT writes in its latest hard copy edition that one of Europe’s leading green energy thinkers now concedes Germany’s much ballyhooed Energiewende (transition to renewable energies) has been a “filthy blunder”.

Page 4 of December 4, 2014, edition of DIE ZEIT. “Filthy Blunder”
When the green movement itself makes such an admission, then you know Germany’s once highly ballyhooed Energiewende is truly in deep trouble, if not a basket case.
“Germany will not even come close to reaching targets”
Moreover, DIE ZEIT, an influential publication among Germany’s green centre-left, writes, “Germany will not even come close to reaching its climate target despite the massive investment in wind and solar energies.”
The admission is a massive blow to Germany’s renewable energies movement, whose troubles have long been played down or denied by its proponents.
So what has finally compelled Germany’s top greens to make such an astonishing admission? The facts show that although the Energiewende has led to a rapid expansion of wind and solar energies, it has also led to the unexpected increase in coal-fired power. Renewable energies have had the unintended effect of revitalizing coal as a source of energy. A horror for climate protection activists.
The 180° U-turn begins with Patrick Graichen, Director of the Agora Energiewende thinktank, which according to DIE ZEIT, is “the most influential school of thought for energy policy in Germany“. Graichen himself was formerly responsible for energy at the Federal Ministry of Environment.
Making the air dirtier
The DIE ZEIT feature article explains how Germany’s original plan had been to expand wind and solar so that they would first replace the country’s unwanted nuclear power plants, and then later the filthy coal power plants. The idea was to use natural gas power plants to even out the huge irregularities that come with the weather-dependent solar and wind power. And as green and power grid technology developed further, even gas eventually would be throttled down to a bare minimum, and so Germany would be propelled from being the world’s worst villain to a most loved hero – in less than a 100-year span. That was the dream.
But now green energy dreamers are being rudely awakened, and the reality looks very different. More CO2 is being produced. Die ZEIT writes:
It’s a blunder with ugly consequences. The Energiewende, as it is now set up, is not making the air cleaner, but dirtier.”
The problem, DIE ZEIT explains, is that the coal is much cheaper than natural gas. As a a consequence power generators are opting to even out the green power supply fluctuations with coal power instead of gas. But because coal power plants cannot be driven up and down quickly to respond to fluctuations in supply, power producers no longer even bother throttling them down when too much power is fed in by wind in sun. The coal power plants just keep on humming and emitting anyway – even when the power is not needed. In the end it’s still cheaper than operating gas plants. Result: gas plants are being closed down, coal is coming back.

Grotesque market distortions – negative prices
The requirement to feed in green power and all the extra unneeded coal-fired electricity are now causing grotesque distortions on the electricity markets. To illustrate the perverse market conditions, DIE ZEIT describes the events of Sunday, May 11, 2014, when so much wind and solar power was fed into the grid that the power became worthless on the market and at times caused negative prices on the electricity exchanges, as DIE ZEIT illustrates:
The price on the market fell to nothing. A little later before noon, there was so much green power on the market that the German power companies were paying money to get rid of it. By early afternoon when solar power was flowing plentifully, the so-called negative power price rose to 60 euros per megawatt-hour.”
Negative prices due to an uncontrolled supply into the grid is no longer an isolated event that rarely occurs. DIE ZEIT continues:
And that is no isolated incident; it’s the future of German power production. In the first half of 2014 power prices were negative for 71 hours. But already in just a few years that number could be one thousand hours per year, according to the think tank Energy Brainpool. One quarter of the entire green energy production would be energy garbage.”
Skyrocketing electricity prices for consumers while the price on the exchanges go negative: This has got to be one of the 7 wonders of German energy management.
“An Act of God”
Clearly the German electricity market has careened out of control and is in a state of chaos. Now even the strongest denier greens can no longer stomach the deplorable electricity market situation and are conceding it has to change.
DIE ZEIT then asks how it all came to this in the first place. Patrick Graichen blames what he terms the “collective miscalculation by the experts in the branch” who falsely assumed green energies would crowd out dirty coal plants. Graichen claims that “no one could have foreseen the development.”
“Nonsense,” says Michael Limburg, Vice President of the Germany-based European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), a critical climate science and energy policy think-tank. He wrote NTZ by e-mail:
They are starting to confess what is not longer deniable because it’s so obvious to everyone else…typical for politicians in action. Yet, rather than taking responsibility for the damage they have created, they are now trying to act as if it were an Act of God when in reality it was completely foreseeable and they had been warned on many occasions.”
No one can say all of it was unexpected. Early warnings of disaster have been frequent and since quite a long time. The rubric “Alternative Energy” at the NTZ side bar is chock-full of articles on the troubles in the renewable energy sector. What follows are just a few examples:

"Boris Johnson declined to apologise over his government’s slow response to the flooding across parts of the north of England, insisting that a huge amount of work was going on to help and compensate victims. The prime minister faced difficult questions over whether enough had been spent on flood defences in deluged regions of Yorkshire, the east Midlands and Lincolnshire, after giving a speech on how he would give billions of pounds to research and development. Asked to apologise, and challenged over why voters in the areas underwater should support him, Johnson insisted the government stood “ready to support in any way” it could the 850 residents whose homes were flooded. He said the government had already put £2.6bn into flood defences and would look at longer term solutions, such as planting more trees, to manage the environment better. Earlier, he was accused by some flood victims of doing nothing to help them as he visited one of the worst affected areas. The prime minister appeared in Stainforth, South Yorkshire, as 100 soldiers were deployed to help shore up the region’s battered flood defences. One resident told Johnson: “I’m not very happy about talking to you, so, if you don’t mind, I’ll just motor on with what I’m doing.” The woman, clutching a wheelbarrow alongside the troops sent to the area to help, added: “You’ve not helped us … I don’t know what you’re here today for.” Another told him: “You’ve took your time, Boris, haven’t you?” Johnson replied: “We’ve been on it round the clock.” Earlier the prime minister chaired a meeting of the government emergency committee, Cobra, following pressure from opposition leaders to get a grip on the crisis. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, visited Fishlake, near Doncaster, on Tuesday, outlining pledges to spend £5.6bn and £5bn respectively on flood defences. However, Johnson did not mention any extra money for flood defences as he outlined a multi-billion-pound package of spending on research and development while visiting an electric car factory near Coventry. He claimed a Conservative government would launch three industrial revolutions – in green tech, innovation and skills. His main policy planks were: Ensuring that everyone in England and Wales was within 30 miles of an electric vehicle charging point, by spending £500m on expanding the network Increasing the target for electricity from offshore wind power from 30GW to 40GW by 2030, a move he said that could create 9,000 more jobs Spending £800m on carbon capture and storage (CCS) clusters to help them become established by the mid-2020s Doubling research and development spending to £18bn by 2024 compared with 2017 levels, including funding for advanced maths research, a national space strategy and support for nuclear fusion About £1.8bn for rebuilding further education colleges “I want you to imagine a Britain ... where in 10 years’ time scientists are starting to reap the huge rewards from our plans to double funding for research and businesses as well as from space to AI to the gigafactory for batteries we are going to build in the next three years,” Johnson said. The speech also reiterated his core message on Brexit, claiming he had a “Blue Peter deal – here’s one I made earlier” and one that was “ready to go, just add water, stir in pot”. He also suggested that all big new public-sector projects would be forced to hire British apprentices as workers after the UK left the EU."
"After decades of intense observation and campaigning by conservation groups, awareness of microplastic pollution has fortunately grown. There is now worldwide concern about tiny pieces of plastic litter that are having a harmful impact on marine species and habitats.  Large plastic litter has already been identified as both an eyesore and a danger to turtles, seabirds and marine mammals. So the scene was already set for mass action against microbeads and other forms of tiny plastics, which are present in things such as shower gels and beauty products.   But most of the small plastic we find doesn’t come from your face wash. It is formed from the breakdown of larger plastics such as bottles and bags.  Less widely known as a source of microplastic is the breakdown of synthetic fabrics, which forms tiny plastic fibres. Reports now indicate that these are the most common form of microplastic recovered from sediment and water samples. And the vast majority of these are produced during domestic clothes washing.   In the washing machine, abrasion of clothes removes tiny fibres which are too small to be caught by the machine’s filters. This may add up to hundreds of thousands of fibres from a single wash. These fibres are then carried in the waste water into the sewage system, but are far too small to be removed in the treatment plants where other solid materials and pollutants are caught. As a result, the fibres escape into rivers and then oceans. The fibres which end up in the ocean come from every kind of synthetic garment – from your socks and swimsuits to pullovers and parkas.  Plastics break down very slowly in the marine environment, so the amount of fibres in the ocean increases year on year. And they do not stay still. Many plastics are buoyant, enabling them to float for thousands of miles and affect a wide variety of animals on their travels.  As microplastics are so small, they are just the right size to be eaten by a range of marine species. Fish, crabs, lobsters, mussels, sea cucumbers and many other creatures are known to have ingested them. And while not all animals will be negatively affected, plastic ingestion has been seen to increase the number of deaths. Other animals have been observed feeding less, having lower fat reserves, and producing fewer offspring. Some of the species that eat plastic may end up on your own plate. We remove the stomach of most fish species, but invertebrates such as mussels are consumed whole (minus the shell). While there is currently no evidence of negative health effects linked with microplastic transfer from seafood, the fibres are definitely there, and the impact of plastic ingestion may affect the efficiency of fisheries and the nutritional value of our food.    As the world population grows, greater numbers of synthetic fibres will be produced and washed. The annual releases of plastic fibres will increase, and so will their impact on the environment. Animals which previously contained only a few fibres will be exposed to many many more, and those that suffered increased mortality or other negative impacts will be more dangerously affected.  Awareness of the dangers of microbeads and plastic bags has resulted in a reduction in their use by consumers, and actions to produce environmentally sensitive alternatives by manufacturers.  We can reduce the amount of fibres released from our homes by thinking about the way we wash. Ensuring washing machines are at full capacity to reduce the tumbling to which our clothes are exposed is a start. Choosing to wear and wash natural fibres will reduce the number of synthetic fibres from which fragments can be made.  It is also possible to catch some of the fibres before they escape the machine. New products include the Guppyfriend – a laundry bag designed to catch fibres before they reach the drain – and the Cora Ball, which mimics the action of filtering corals. However, the issue of what to do with the recovered fibres remains. In the short term, reducing the amount of microfibers we produce will help to lessen the impact on our oceans. But it will not be enough to stem the effects of population growth. Manufacturers need to address the rate at which fibres are shed from our garments and other fabrics.  For our marine life, plastic means permanent pollution. As consumers we need to understand the environmental impact of fast fashion and short-term clothing. The trouble is, it really does all come out in the wash."

"The “mountain chicken” frogs on the Caribbean island of Montserrat are in a perilous and seemingly irredeemable situation. It’s worth questioning whether attempted recovery is even worth the effort. After all, this species, one of the world’s largest frogs, will have to recover from just two individuals.  Hunting, habitat destruction from the 1995 volcanic eruption, and the arrival of the recent fatal fungal infection, Chytridiomycosis (or “chytrid”), has devastated these frogs. Rarely has any species naturally recovered once reduced to a few individuals, without some sort of human assistance. The Seychelles kestrel is one exception. Species declines are largely caused by human activity, whether that be through direct killing, destruction of natural habitats, or the introduction of species like cats, rats or the chytrid fungus.  Sadly, even in recent times, extinctions occur in plain sight. China’s last Yangtze River dolphins, a male and a female, were separately held captive without being bred. Australia’s Christmas Island pipistrelle bat was confirmed extinct, frustratingly, during delayed attempts to rescue the last individuals. Similar late efforts failed to rescue the Po’ouli, a unique forest bird on Maui, Hawaii.  The lack of action in these cases was caused by bureaucracy, aversion to risk, politics, misplaced priorities, and professional bias; human rather than biological factors. Thankfully, other examples demonstrate a better way. North America’s black-footed ferret was thought lost in the 1980s until several were discovered in Wyoming, which inspired a recovery programme. The California condor was reduced to 27 individuals sparking a controversial, but successful, captive-breeding initiative. In New Zealand, the Chatham Islands black robin was rescued from a single breeding pair.  On Mauritius, once the island of extinction, the local kestrel was considered a lost cause until the arrival in 1979 of Carl Jones, a biologist who has just been awarded the Indianapolis Prize – the “Nobel Prize” of conservation – in recognition of his outstanding work. These cases required pioneering innovations, such as double-clutching (removing eggs to encourage pairs to breed again), using more common species as adoptive parents, and training captive-bred animals for wild release. Leaders such as Don Merton, Tom Cade, Noel Snyder and Carl Jones shared ideas with like-minded colleagues across continents, fuelling knowledge and experimentation. Actually getting on with the work is important. For Jones, too many people “talk about conservation…but we’ve got to do it rather than talk about it”. Rare species are not just an interesting entry in the catalogue of life. They have a function in the natural world. Amphibians are important in controlling insects and other invertebrates. In Montserrat, for instance, some farmers have noticed increased levels of crop pests since the frogs disappeared. In practice, action first means setting short-term goals. For the mountain chicken frog, this involves moving the female into the male’s territory, building artificial nests, and protecting locations from threats.  The work must also pursue a long-term vision. A sustainable wild population of frogs means that captive-breeding, already undertaken in bio-secure facilities, is not the sole answer. Threats like chytrid need to be understood first to inspire possible solutions. The disease will not disappear just by increasing the numbers of frogs (though frog population is of course critical).  Fieldwork requires painful attention to detail, literally sitting with the animals to prevent disturbances, then monitoring offspring survival, assessing and carefully improving habitats, and moving individuals to new, safe locations. Conservationists need patience and determination to overcome disappointments. They must seek to understand changing circumstances, keep open to ideas and be willing to develop new approaches if things do not go well.  Fortunately conservation interventions can achieve extraordinary success. Carl Jones has worked with the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and Durrell (the wildlife charity founded by popular naturalist Gerald Durrell) for nearly 40 years. Jones’ work on Mauritius is responsible for saving five bird species, three reptiles and several plants, and restoring nine off-shore islands. These achievements are not a mere drop in the ocean. His results represent 19% of avoided bird extinctions worldwide. Overall this is nearly 10% of all bird, mammal and amphibian species downlisted on the IUCN Red List. Jones’s international recognition is richly deserved. Jones himself suggests that recovery requires about 20 breeding cycles. That means 20 years for species that breed just once a year. Improved understanding can however, accelerate recovery. Recent efforts in the US with the California Channel Islands fox restored a handful of surviving individuals to a thriving population in just a decade. The near-extinct Mauritius kestrel bounced back to a free-living population from just four birds. India’s unique pygmy hog was reintroduced after successful breeding of a few animals taken from the wild. Conservation is getting smarter and more effective. So on Montserrat, people must act fast while hope remains. A sustainable frog population must be a priority. If people carefully use their knowledge, this extraordinary giant, the mountain chicken frog might withstand threats of disease and habitat pressure on its tiny, volcanic island home."
"These are extraordinary times for energy policy in the UK. After years of resigned acceptance that the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station would be built no matter how much of a basketcase it was, the government has surprised everyone by calling a halt to the process until the autumn. The proposed Hinkley Point C would have two European Pressurised Reactors (EPRs), providing around 3GW of electricity or about 7% of the UK’s total usage. The construction would be paid for by French energy firm EDF and Chinese nuclear companies, but the expense of building it would be underpinned by long-term supply contracts with the UK government, as well as a series of other financial undertakings designed to reduce the financial risks for the developers. Few people argue that Hinkley Point C makes sense. The project’s budget has grown from original estimates of £16 billion to £24.5 billion today. Even this might be an underestimate given the experience of cost overruns similar reactors under construction in Finland, France and China. The long-term supply contracts – known as Contracts for Difference (CfDs) – are designed to guarantee a set income of £92.50 per MegaWatt hour of output, regardless of the actual price of electricity in the market. Since the contracts were agreed, the wholesale price of electricity has fallen, meaning that the estimated subsidy for the lifetime of the project has risen from £6.1 billion to £29.7 billion, a huge burden for UK electricity consumers. And the CfD subsidy is complemented by a suite of other UK taxpayer subsidies and guarantees designed to mitigate investment risks for the French and Chinese investors and to guarantee costs for dealing with nuclear waste or paying compensation for nuclear accidents. Putting all of these subsidies in place has required the UK government to essentially redesign the electricity market over the past few years in an effort to create a situation where investment in a new plant looked attractive. Pretty much every major policy design has been geared towards creating a perfect environment for Hinkley Point C. That’s why it’s such a surprise to see the government has now stepped back – a bit – from the brink. The contracts to put many of the subsidy structures are not yet signed – that was meant to happen today, as part of the official approval process – so the government could still pull out. Obviously that wouldn’t please the French and Chinese, but risking their short-term displeasure could avoid locking the UK into the extortionate project for decades to come. Once the contracts are signed the legal and financial ramifications are so high that the project will go ahead, whatever the evidence against it.  The UK has form on this, notably the THORP nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield, which began operation despite the case for it collapsing on every front. But without those contracts in place the project can still falter at the last hurdle. So why the delay? There is all sorts of speculation going round: the new Theresa May administration is not ideologically linked to new nuclear plants in the way that Cameron’s administration was – and therefore has had an attack of common sense about the costs of the project. The government also has security concerns over allowing significant Chinese investment in the UK electricity system – in a post-Brexit world the government is worried about the level of overseas ownership of UK electricity assets – most are owned by European rather than British companies. Then there was the less than ringing endorsement of the EDF board (which reportedly voted only 10-7 in favour of going ahead, following a couple of high-profile resignations) which has rung alarm bells in both the UK and French governments. The real reason behind the decision may emerge over the next few weeks as the government mulls over the pros and cons of the project. That will be fascinating. Equally fascinating, though, will be the debate that must take place at the same time about what an alternative might look like. What might the UK energy landscape look like without the project that has shaped it for so many years? Energy policy is often seen as a bit of a backwater – little tweaks to existing approaches tend to be preferred to massive shifts in strategy. The latest decision has the potential to change that. Without Hinkley Point C, the potential to have a real and considered debate about the future shape of the electricity system has loomed into view. Now is the time to start considering the sorts of options being considered widely around the world, with measures to encourage more flexible, smaller-scale, renewable systems incorporating demand-side measures and new technologies such as storage. A system that is the absolute antithesis of what Hinkley Point C represents. Suddenly UK energy policy has become very exciting indeed."
"Sweden’s central bank said on Wednesday it had sold off bonds from Western Australia and Queensland, and the oil-rich Canadian province of Alberta, because it felt that greenhouse gas emissions in both countries were too high. The Riksbank deputy governor, Martin Floden, said the bank would no longer invest in assets from issuers with a large climate footprint, even if the yields were high.  “Australia and Canada are countries that are not known for good climate work. Greenhouse gas emissions per capita are among the highest in the world,” he said in a speech at Orebro University in Sweden. “As a result of the new investment policy, we sold our holdings of bonds issued by Alberta in the spring. For the same reason, we have recently sold our holdings in bonds issued by the Australian states of Queensland and Western Australia.” Alberta’s government on Wednesday insisted that the province “has the highest environmental standards in the world,” and said the energy industry is continually improving its environmental footprint. “If the Swedish central bank is really concerned with making a difference on climate change they need to be investing more in ethical producers such as Alberta, which have shown dramatic gains in reducing emissions,” said Christine Myatt, spokeswoman for the Alberta premier, Jason Kenney. Queensland and WA have not yet responded. Floden, who did not give details, said Sweden had invested around 8% of its foreign exchange reserves in various kinds of Australian and Canadian bonds. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said in September that the financial sector had to transform its management of climate risk, warning that global warming would prompt reassessments of the value of every single financial asset. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Central bankers aren’t your typical tree huggers, so Canadian politicians should take note when they start blacklisting government bonds over climate concerns,” Keith Stewart, the senior energy strategist with Greenpeace Canada, said in an email on Wednesday. The Bank of Canada said in May that climate change continues to pose risks to both the economy and financial systems. Analysts say the valuations of fossil fuel companies could be at risk if governments move to spur stronger action. This could pose more problems for Alberta, which is already hurting from five years of low crude prices and pipeline constraints. A number of major firms have sold their Canadian assets or scaled back investments. Alberta’s reserves exist in the form of tar-like bitumen, which must be heated with steam before oil can be extracted. The process is highly energy-intensive. There are already widening splits between Alberta and Ottawa over climate change. The Liberal prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has pushed through tougher environmental policies since winning power in 2015, saying the energy sector needs to do more. But the Alberta premier complains the new measures are so harsh that it is impossible to build energy projects."

"On July 6, a two-year-old male Eurasian lynx named Flaviu escaped from his enclosure less than 24 hours after arriving at Dartmoor Zoo in Devon, south west England. He has been on the run ever since.  Zoo officials are confident Flaviu will remain nearby, and consequently the drones, sniffer dogs and humane traps baited with meat that are being used in the attempt to recapture him have focused on woods and farmland surrounding the zoo. Benjamin Mee, the zoo’s owner, believes the lynx will not venture far as there is plenty of easily accessible food in the form of rabbits and birds.  But I want to suggest an alternative possibility: perhaps he’s heading home.  Prior to arriving at Dartmoor Zoo, Flaviu lived with his mother, Klementyna, at the Port Lympne Reserve in Canterbury, Kent. He has been branded a “mummy’s boy” because of the close relationship he had with Klementyna. Consequently, Dartmoor zoo is planning to use bedding from his mother’s enclosure and a recording of her call to try and lure him back. Mee himself has acknowledged that Flaviu’s attachment to his mother may have been his motivation for wanting to escape, stating “we think he is really missing his mum. That is why he could have escaped last week, because he was trying to get back to her”.   Despite recognising Flaviu may have been motivated to escape because he missed his mother, zoo officials and others responsible for conducting the search are not seriously entertaining the possibility that he now might try to return to his previous home. Lynx are typically solitary in the wild and so the expectation is that as a two-year-old male, he would be more interested in finding his own territory.  However, having been born in captivity, Flaviu may not behave as a typical wild lynx. Animal welfare organisations such as the Blue Cross and Cats Protection emphasise that moving home is a very stressful procedure for domestic felines and consequently advocate keeping them indoors for at least three weeks following a move. The internet is full of stories of domestic cats travelling long distances and ending up back at their former residences.  Port Lympne is just over 275 miles from Dartmoor Zoo. Given the documented distances covered by wild lynx, Flaviu could feasibly turn up at his mother’s home some time in late August. The most recent sighting of Flaviu was on July 15, 12 miles north of Dartmoor zoo. If he is heading home his progress is slow, but this is perhaps unsurprising for a young animal experiencing freedom for the first time. A petition is calling for Dartmoor Zoo to return Flaviu to Port Lympne (if and when he is recaptured) so that he can be reunited with his mother. Certainly if Flaviu makes his own way back to Port Lymphe then this argument would be strengthened considerably. And there is precedent for animals who escape from captivity or slaughter against the odds being granted a reprieve. For example, in 1998 two Tamworth pigs escaped from a slaughter house and went on the run for five days before being recaptured. The considerable media attention their escape received resulted in the pair being transferred to an animal sanctuary.  However, the reality for most captive animals belonging to endangered species is that they frequently get moved between zoos and other institutions according to the requirements of international breeding programmes. Flaviu and Klementyna cannot breed together, and so Flaviu’s fate if he is recaptured may well be determined by the value of his genes. There is, of course, the risk that Flaviu will meet a sticky end if he is not recaptured. Certainly, many escapee carnivores end up being shot, or hit by cars, and trophy hunters are reportedly trying to “bag” the runaway lynx.  At some point, Flaviu may encounter the mythical “Beast of Dartmoor”. While local folklore speaks of various demonic black hounds, the “beast” is more frequently assumed to be a big cat or cats whose existence is corroborated and contested in equal measure by regular sightings and inconclusive photographs. Mee himself claims that in the 1980s, before he took over the zoo, it released three pumas. Academic research into sightings and predations suggests they are indeed flesh and blood creatures. For example, forensic tests conducted by a former colleague found that the tooth marks on sheep carcasses brought to her by confused farmers in Wales could be traced to multiple sources including foxes but also medium sized cats such as lynx or leopard. During my own research in Wales, which consisted of interviews with over 60 individuals who had claimed to have seen or encountered big cats, I also found myself face to face with what I can only conclude was a big cat.  In the south west of England, and Dartmoor specifically, sociologist Adrian Franklin has conducted extensive interviews with individuals who have encountered big cats and discovered that there was historical precedent for big cats in private collections being released or escaping in the vicinity. If any of these escapees are still alive, and if any were lynx (as descriptions often suggest), then there’s a possibility Flaviu may not head home and chose instead to settle in the area and start his own family.  Finally, if Flaviu is not caught then his story might also become an interesting case study which could inform discussions surrounding the rewilding of lynx in the UK. If he remains at large, stays out of sight and doesn’t eat too many sheep or domestic pets, then UK residents might be more inclined to feel positive about coexisting with these creatures who were once native to the UK but were wiped out by human activity more than 1,300 years ago."
"The Paris agreement on climate change calls for a global responsibility to cooperate. As we are often reminded, we urgently and drastically need to limit our use of one shared resource – fossil fuels – and its effect on another – the climate. But how realistic is this goal, both for national leaders and for us? Well, psychology may hold some answers. Psychologists and economists have long explored the conflict between short-term individual and long-term collective interests when dealing with shared resources. Think of the commons dilemma: the scenario in which a field for grazing cattle works well when everyone cooperates by sticking to one cow each, but which leads to the so-called “tragedy of the commons” if more selfish drives take over. It is useful to think about overuse of fossil fuels and its effect on the climate as a similar dilemma. If we were to think of this from a purely economic perspective, we would likely act selfishly. But psychological research should make us more optimistic about cooperation. Are you more likely to overuse a shared resource when it is framed as an ethical concern or a business transaction? Research shows people behave less selfishly when it’s framed ethically, or if we emphasise what people will gain rather than lose by reducing their use of fossil fuels. Using the phrase “global warming” rather than “climate change” also engages us emotionally and makes us more supportive of the issue. We also need a balance of good and bad news if we are not going to be overwhelmed by the enormity of the challenge and feel like running away. So wording when communicating to the public as well as in international agreements can make a difference, and we shouldn’t be afraid to appeal to people’s moral sense of what the right thing to do might be. Social norms in behaviour around climate change include things such as “most people recycle”, or “it’s not acceptable to take too many flights”. It’s been shown that communicating these norms can make people adjust their behaviour.  When behaviour is phrased as the default – for example, “my neighbours don’t use too much electricity” – people are also more likely to behave in that way, as we found in a series of experiments.  Research also shows that we need to believe that others sharing the resource think fairness is important if we are to act fairly, or cooperate, ourselves. So we also need a sense of shared identity, which in turn means we are more likely to think others share our values. Shared national identity could be emphasised through communication from government and media; and at a more local level by encouraging more community involvement. When we communicate with fellow users of a shared resource, we trust each other and cooperate more. We also keep communicating. Feedback about how much we’ve used a resource (like household electricity using a “smart home app” or a carbon footprint calculator) makes us use it less. This also works for institutions who use fair decision-making procedures, such as the local council aiming to conserve water.  We also need to know how many people are using a resource, and what its capacity is. And, as we showed in recent studies, we need to know on which information we should base our behaviour and what follows from this information. So countries and local authorities being transparent about their fossil fuel usage is key and, even better, easily achieved. Rewards and sanctions can work well to improve cooperation, from lower tax for buying an environmentally friendly car to a carbon tax for businesses. One potential problem is that this approach can make us feel as if we can’t be trusted and need incentives to do the right thing. But, like schoolchildren with an enlightened teacher, if we get to decide on the incentives and appoint our own leaders to monitor them, then a sense of trust can be rebuilt. We don’t identify and act just as individuals but as members of social groups. We may belong to a family, a community, a nation and the planet, and behave in ways that benefit the group rather than the individual. A shared group identity (such as identifying yourself as a member of your nation or the local school community) can increase cooperation, especially if we believe that group shares our values about the environment. If you strongly identify with your community you don’t need an incentive to cooperate. But at what level should this shared identity be emphasised? Emphasising national identity can prevent cooperation between nations, by increasing competition between them. However, this can be used to an advantage, since nations care about their reputation. So perhaps they could compete to be better than others at meeting climate change goals? Local competition (like a clean city award) can incentivise, too. But we also need to strengthen our sense of being part of the planet – a better global identity could motivate us to empathise with other countries and even future generations. Implementing the Paris agreement will involve big top-down decisions about how much each country is going to reduce their fossil fuels by. This reduction is essential to meet the goal to drastically limit the temperature increase to 2ºC. But how should the amount of fossil fuels used in different countries be reduced when proportions vary between them? For example, half of the remaining gas and oil reserves are in the Middle East. One analysis shows that to keep the planet’s atmosphere below the target of 2ºC, 94% of Europe’s gas reserves can be used but only 30% of those in the Middle East. Given that the Middle East has a larger share, should it be expected to use less than other countries? Should the level of development, population or wealth of a nation also be relevant? And what about how much fuel they have already used? Myles Allen has argued that we don’t have the right to stop countries such as India from using its coal. He suggests instead making companies that use fossil fuels responsible for burying an equal amount of carbon to reduce net emissions.  But there is also scope for appealing to the ideals of international cooperation. We should be optimistic in light of the above psychological research about the capacity of the human race to put the long-term needs of the many above the short-term needs of the few. Big decisions could be facilitated by many of the psychological processes we have described, that focus on global identity, long-term gain rather than short-term loss, intergroup competition and reputation, rewards, shared norms, providing sufficient and clear information, and instilling trust and transparency.

"The death of Annie Hall, the former high sheriff of Derbyshire who was swept away by floodwater last Friday in Darley Dale near Matlock, was the saddest and most shocking consequence so far of the destruction wreaked across northern parts of England over the past week. While cameras in recent days have been trained on and around Doncaster, where dramatic pictures from the village of Fishlake and suburb of Bentley showed people being towed along red-brick residential streets in inflatable boats – and where the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, paid a visit – the affected area stretches south along the course of the river Don through Rotherham and Sheffield, and on to Lincolnshire and Derbyshire, where the river Derwent burst its banks last week. Road closures, buildings underwater so that residents who have chosen to stay are stuck upstairs, thousands more homes evacuated while gardens are turned into lakes, transport chaos (Rotherham’s railway station, for example, currently resembles a canal), volunteers ferrying neighbours and journalists around, police standing guard to ward off looters – the chaos creates a kind of spectacle while it lasts, and opportunities for generosity as well as danger. But one resident, Sue Marshall, surely spoke for many when she said that she feared becoming old news very fast. “What we need to know is that in two months’ time, the MPs will look at what has been done to stop it happening again.” It is in the nature of an election campaign that politicians seek to capitalise on events such as the past week’s record-breaking rainfall (114mm fell in Derbyshire in 24 hours – more than a normal month’s total) to expose their opponents’ weaknesses. Boris Johnson’s decision to convene a Cobra meeting on Tuesday came after the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, suggested that floods in Surrey would have been more likely to prompt the declaration of a national emergency. But while the reaction of Doncaster council has been criticised by residents – health and safety concerns having prevented officials from joining rescue efforts – and local flood defence schemes, as well as land use and planning decisions, will rightly be scrutinised once the waters have retreated, there is no suggestion that government agencies or the emergency services failed to respond appropriately. Spending on flood defences was cut by David Cameron, despite research showing that increased flooding is the greatest threat to the UK from global heating. In 2013 the number of officials working on national adaptation was cut from 38 to six. Since then, climate scientists’ predictions appear to have come true with the frequency of floods increasing, and the two wettest winters on record in 2013-14 and 2015-16. Funding has again been increased, and natural flood prevention schemes such as tree planting and moorland restoration are being tried – although not yet on the scale that will be needed if future disasters are to be averted. Those residents who have seen homes and possessions destroyed, particularly those who lack insurance, deserve sympathy and assistance. But, as with the catastrophic fires currently raging in Australia, the only rational response to these floods is to redouble every effort to treat increasing climate chaos as the global emergency it is."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s a lot of excitement flaring up, especially on the alarmist side, because of a possible super El Nino occurring later this year – one that could push global temperature to a new modern high.
That of course is entirely possible. However, it isn’t going to really matter, and possibly may only be the last death convulsion of planetary warming. Everyone knows that a cooling La Nina follows an El Nino event. Indeed a number of solar physicists are now warning that we may in fact be on our final days of warmth for a number of decades to come.
Geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt tells us why in their latest essay. 
================================
Will the solar doldrums of the coming decades lead to cooling? A look at the latest scientific publications
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by NoTricksZone)
Seldom has the sun been as strong as we have seen it over the last 5 decades. Is it just a coincidence that the largest warming of the last 500 years occurred during this phase?
Just a few years ago the tide changed when the sun ended its hyperactive phase. Few people had anticipated this, and so it was a surprise for many. Solar physicist Leif Svalgaard of California’s Stanford University expressed it as follows at the American Geophysical Union last December:
“None of us alive have ever seen such a weak cycle. So we will learn something.”
And so science commenced to consider and think about what all this could lead to. The latest works on the subject include Qian et al. 2014 (“Secular changes in the thermosphere and ionosphere between two quiet Sun periods“), Zhao et al. 2014 (Modulation of galactic cosmic rays during the unusual solar minimum between cycles 23 and 24) and McCracken & Beer 2014 (Comparison of the extended solar minimum of 2006–2009 with the Spoerer, Maunder, and Dalton Grand Minima in solar activity in the past).
After a number of studies it has become clearer: It’s only the beginning! It is expected that the sun will continue becoming quieter over the coming decades. This has pretty much become the consensus among solar physicists. The latest studies on the subject come from Roth & Joos 2013, who assume a decline in solar activity to normal levels will occur during the 21st century. Salvador 2013 goes further and anticipates a solar minimum for the coming 30-100 years. Read the original abstract:
Using many features of Ian Wilson’s Tidal Torque theory, a mathematical model of the sunspot cycle has been created that reproduces changing sunspot cycle lengths and has an 85% correlation with the sunspot numbers from 1749 to 2013. The model makes a reasonable representation of the sunspot cycle for the past 1000 yr, placing all the solar minimums in their right time periods. More importantly, I believe the model can be used to forecast future solar cycles quantitatively for 30 yr and directionally for 100 yr. The forecast is for a solar minimum and quiet Sun for the next 30 to 100 yr. The model is a slowly changing chaotic system with patterns that are never repeated in exactly the same way. Inferences as to the causes of the sunspot cycle patterns can be made by looking at the model’s terms and relating them to aspects of the Tidal Torque theory and, possibly, Jovian magnetic field interactions.
In the Journal of Geophysical Research a study by Goelzer et al. appeared in December 2013 and also foresees a decline in solar activity.

What climatic consequences could this have? In our book “The Neglected Sun” we assume that temperatures could be two tenths of a degree lower by 2030 as a result, which would mean warming getting postponed far into the future. Russian scientists foresee an even more dramatic situation, as described in Germany’s leading national daily Bild of April 4,2013:
AND NOW THIS! Russian scientist sees next approaching ice age
It will get colder beginning in 2014 +++ Human migration cannot be ruled out”
Just a month earlier The Voice of Russia reported:
Planet on the verge of an ice age
Russian scientists are predicting that a little ice age will begin in 2014. They refute the claims of global warming and describe them as a marketing trick. Global warming is indeed happening. The earth has been continuously getting warmer since the second half of the 18th century, the start of the Industrial Revolution. This is why the process gets connected to an anthropogenic impact. Mankind increased CO2 emissions, which caused a greenhouse effect. But Russian scientist Vladimir Baschkin categorically disagrees. He claims that the climatic changes have a cyclic character and are not at all related in any way to human activities. Together with his colleague, Rauf Galiullin, of the Institute for Fundamental Problems of Biology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, he points out that the current warming is merely the continuation of the post Little Ice Age and that, measured on a geological scale, the occurrence of a new ice age is approaching.”
Continue reading at Voice of Russia.
Other scientists share this view as well, among them Professor Cliff Ollier of the School of Earth and Environmental Studies at the University of Western Australia:
Professor Cliff Ollier of the School of Earth and Environmental Studies, the University of Western Australia, recently presented a paper in Poznan, Poland,  in which he described the sun as the major control of climate, but not through greenhouse gases.”There is a very good correlation of sunspots and climate. Solar cycles provide a basis for prediction. Solar Cycle 24 has started and we can expect serious cooling.”
H.S. Ahluwalia of the Department of Physics & Astronomy of the University of New Mexico sees it in similar way, as he describes in an article in the journal of Advances in Space Research in February 2014. Ahluwalia expects a Dalton-type minimum and reminds us that the last minimum of this kind back around 1810 resulted in a cold period.

"The director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, Thomas Jordan, made an announcement recently that would have sent a chill down the spine of every Californian: that the San Andreas fault appears to be in a critical state and as such, could generate a large earthquake imminently. Of course, the reiteration of the seismic hazard to Californians will be nothing surprising, but what is new is the warning that the southern portion of the fault “looks like it’s locked, loaded and ready to go”. Why is this eminent seismologist making these alarming statements? Well, the fact is that there has not been a major release of stresses in the southern portion of the San Andreas fault system since 1857. In simple terms, the San Andreas is one of many fault systems roughly marking the border between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. Both plates are moving in an approximately northerly direction but the Pacific plate is moving faster than its North American counterpart, meaning that stresses between the plates are constantly building up.  In 1906, some of these stresses were catastrophically released in the San Francisco Bay area in a 7.8 magnitude event and again, in northern California, during the 6.9 magnitude 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Events of these magnitudes, however, have not occurred along the San Andreas fault in the south of the state – the 1994 Northridge event was associated with a nearby, but separate, fault system – leading to the suggestion that one is imminent and, given the amount of stress that might actually have accumulated, when it arrives it will be the “Big One”. So just how big could this potential earthquake be and is it possible that the destruction demonstrated in the film San Andreas could actually come to fruition?  In short, Californians will be (reasonably) pleased with the answers to these questions. In the film, the San Andreas fault produces an earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0. While not unheard of globally, earthquakes of this size are generally confined to regions of the earth where subduction – where one tectonic plate is being forced below another – is happening, for example in Chile and Japan. The tectonic situation in California is different. Here, two plates are sliding past each other.  As such, recent predictions limit the possible maximum earthquake magnitude along the San Andreas fault system to 8.0, although with a 7% probability estimate that such an event could occur in Southern California in the next 30 years; over the same period, there is a 75% chance of a magnitude 7.0 event. While magnitudes of 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0 might sound negligibly different, the energy that such events would unleash varies significantly, with a magnitude 9.0 event releasing 32 times more energy than a magnitude 8.0 and 1,000 times more energy than a magnitude 7.0. Obviously, however, be it a 7.0 or an 8.0, damage is inevitable, but the whole sequence of events, as depicted in the film, is unlikely. For example, the San Andreas fault is not beneath the ocean and as such, any slippage along it could not displace water to the extent that a tsunami would be generated. The opening up of a massive chasm is also from the land of fantasy, as the plates are sliding relative to each other, not away from each other.  What is realistic, however, is that a great amount of destruction is likely. While the building codes in California are stringent, recommending retrofitting of seismic protection measures to older buildings and preventing the construction of new buildings near to known fault lines, there is no way to make a building 100% safe.  In an attempt to understand the effects of a large, southern San Andreas earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey modelled a 7.8 magnitude event, with slippage of 2-7 metres, to represent the stresses that have built up in the area since the last large event.  From this model, it was found that damage would be most severe to constructions straddling the fault. Fortunately, constructions of this sort are few and far between following the 1972 Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act. What would be affected by this slippage, however, are the 966 roads, 90 fibre optic cables, 39 gas pipes and 141 power lines that cross the fault zone.  The total cost of damage to buildings was estimated at $33 billion, with modern buildings faring well but older buildings being particularly susceptible. Fires would rage – as they did following the Northridge earthquake – as gas mains, and mains water pipes, become severed; in fact, the damage from resulting fires is estimated as more costly than that resulting from the initial shaking.  The overall death toll is estimated at 1,800. And just when things don’t look like they can get any worse, the main event will have destabilised the tectonics of the region to such an extent that a series of potentially powerful aftershocks will begin. For example, in 2011, Christchurch, New Zealand was struck by a 6.2 magnitude event and since then the city and surrounding region have experienced more than 10,000 aftershocks.  Fortunately, the film San Andreas is pure fiction, featuring the levels of exaggeration we are all used to from film makers who are, ironically, also based in southern California. Even so, in all probability, the San Andreas is likely to generate a significant earthquake in the not too distant future. When it arrives, the damage will be significant and southern California will be massively affected. But Californians are no strangers to these events and the infrastructure of the state, in recent times, has been designed with earthquake protection in mind.  Forget tsunamis and deep chasms opening up, but do expect violent shaking, building damage, fires and widespread economic impacts as the region is out of action for potentially a long period of time."
"Can fracking be safe? A new study suggests how fracking – the process of extracting oil and gas trapped in rocks deep underground by blasting water into the rock at high pressure – can be conducted without causing earthquakes, which is one of the most well known concerns. While this kind of research can help produce guidelines to reduce the risks associated with fracking, ultimately, it makes no sense to talk of fracking being entirely “safe”. You might as well ask whether you can ensure your journey to work is safe. There are rules designed to reduce the risks, such as speed limits and the highway code, but there will always be the chance of human error or equipment failure. Venturing onto the roads is an inherently unsafe business. Of course, that doesn’t mean we should never do it. The risks involved in any industrial activity mean that we need to think carefully about how to manage them, rather than trying to claim it is safe or not. Fracking or hydraulic fracturing involves pumping up to 16 Olympic swimming pools’ worth of water, chemical additives and sand into shale rocks lying between 2km and 3km underground. This creates a dense network of small fractures in the rocks, releasing gas or oil that moves into the water stream and is pumped or carried to the surface. Earthquakes can occur when fracking takes place near a geological fault. It’s a bit like how a hovercraft works, by pumping air to produce a cushion so it can slip more easily over the land surface. If frack fluid is pumped into a geological fault, it can also slip more easily. Fracking can also change the stress on the fault, causing it to release, and a big enough fault shift will be felt as an earthquake. The new paper, published in Geomechanics and Geophysics for Geo-Energy and Geo-Resources, tries to predict how far from a geological fault it is safe to frack a well without causing an earthquake. Such research is important as it could lead to areas of land being ruled out for fracking, prevent earthquakes and, of course, save the fracking industry from a PR disaster. To make this prediction, the researchers from Keele and Birmingham universities ran 50 models of a fracking operation based loosely on a site in north-west England and modelled the extent of the expected change in underground stresses. They combined this with an estimation of the smallest stress change that geoscientists think could trigger an earthquake. The results show any fracking site needs to be at least 63 metres away laterally from any fault, and perhaps as far as 433 metres. They haven’t estimated by how much this would reduce the chance of an earthquake. Fracking has been going on since the 1950s and on a large commercial scale in the US for the last 15 years, so it might seem surprising that there aren’t already guidelines that cover this kind of risk. But it partly reflects our limited knowledge of the complex underground landscape and how fracking interacts with it. Because of the complexity and variability, a detailed understanding of the geology of what’s below the Earth’s surface is very incomplete. We know the layers of rock beneath the Earth’s surface are extremely complex because we can see this in the rock outcrops at surface level. In the 1970s, exploration firms started to use soundwaves that bounce off underground rock layers to create acoustic images of the subsurface. A borehole can then verify what the images correspond to and the properties of the rock layers. But the resolution of a seismic reflection is low, each at best representing ten metres of rock. This variability and complexity in the rock – and our blurred understanding of it – means that when fracking is carried out for the first time in any location there are uncertainties and risks. How far do the rock layers continue for? What will actually happen to the fracking fluid? Could it travel further than expected into a fault? To try to get answers to these questions, geoscientists carry out experiments in laboratories, build computer models and examine empirical evidence from the thousands of fracking operations that have been carried out in the US. But, even then, we cannot be sure of the answers. For example, in 2012 I led a study into how tall fractures become and so how close to the surface they can get. We used thousands of measurements of fractures from the US. An obvious uncertainty is whether the full extent of the fractures was detected using the well-established method of deploying microphones in a nearby well and detecting the cracks as they grow. We found fractures caused by fracking are unlikely to extend beyond 600 metres vertically. This evidence is now the basis for the UK law that prohibits fracking within 1km of the earth’s surface. Similarly, the new research on earthquakes could one day inform a law on where exactly drilling can take place. But all these results are preliminary, using empirical data, modelling and various assumptions. Only by drilling and closely monitoring more wells will we learn whether the science is robust.  There are plans for monitoring the first fracking sites in the UK. This will give us data we can use to put more accurate parameters into our models and learn if the existing guidelines are too lax or too conservative. One day we could stream live environmental data from many sites and automatically detect abnormalities, potentially allowing us to spot environmental damage early. The more we learn about fracking, the more we will be able to manage and reduce its risks. The debate around fracking needs to start with some honesty. Very little of our everyday lives are completely “safe”, and fracking is no exception."
"The UK’s Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) is no more. New prime minister Theresa May has decided to merge it with the business department into an expanded Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Even given the breakneck speed of events in British current affairs since the EU referendum, this stands out as one of the most radical changes. But what impact will this have on climate policy? Before joining academia in 2015 I spent the previous 12 years in DECC, the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and their predecessors, so I watched these latest restructurings with great interest.  Many green groups have already decried the perceived downgrading of the climate agenda with it taking a back seat to business and industry. And they have a point: the obvious downside is the loss of a single, visible, Whitehall department which had a clear remit to tackle climate change. The formation of DECC in 2008 by Gordon Brown’s government was celebrated at the time because it provided a focal point for action on climate change. Perhaps the clearest example of this was during the 2014 negotiations to decide the EU’s 2030 targets, which would inform the bloc’s position going into the UN climate discussions in Paris.  Ed Davey, then Secretary of State, used his position and the firepower of his department to garner support across like-minded European member states. The EU’s headline 2030 target – emissions reduced by 40% from 1990 levels – was in large part to Sir Ed and DECC civil servants. DECC’s work was therefore key to the recent climate negotiations which culminated at COP21 last December where 195 countries adopted the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal. There are benefits to this new arrangement, however. A focus on business is necessary if the UK is going to continue to reduce its emissions: the switch from coal to low carbon sources means electricity supply is doing its bit, but other sectors – notably heat and transport – need to up their game. The country needs new policies, and the restructuring should help move low carbon thinking into the business and industry mainstream. The business department has traditionally championed key sectors, including the aerospace, automotive and construction industries.  Aligning those sectors with the low carbon energy priorities could ensure greater progress on electric vehicles, zero carbon homes or alternative aviation fuels. The merge could also offer greater progress on decarbonising heavy industry and other big energy users. This work was already a joint effort between DECC and BIS who had commissioned a series of roadmaps for sectors such as steel or cement in an attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency. The new department’s “industrial strategy” remit should help address the UK’s significant infrastructure challenges. Shifting government policies have unnerved the energy sector which in turn is resisting investment decisions on what infrastructure to build – for example, the curtailed £1 billion carbon capture and storage (CCS) programme and the lack of proposed new gas plants.   Steady energy policies coupled with a more interventionist approach to infrastructure and technology investment could reap rewards. This could mean the deployment of modular nuclear reactors, far smaller than those at the planned Hinkley plant but in need of government support for the development and design stage, and to progress through the necessary safety approvals. It could mean CCS is dusted off and new transport and storage infrastructure such as pipelines and injection wells are built. It could even see British cities shifting their heating from natural gas to hydrogen – an idea already being explored in Leeds. The DECC-BIS merger also means the low carbon and innovation portfolios now operate under the same roof, which should strengthen the cross-government Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group – though hopefully the move won’t affect DECC’s significant £500m innovation fund. The first statement by Greg Clark, the new business secretary, was encouraging: he clearly stated the importance of clean energy and tackling climate change. That should be followed with further clarity on the UK’s approach to the EU 2030 climate targets, and ratification of the Paris Agreement. This will keep up momentum, confidence and commitment going into COP22 in Morocco."
"As many as 90,000 people were evacuated from the Canadian town of Fort McMurray and its surrounds, after a massive wildfire endangered the lives and homes of residents. It is thought that 2,400 buildings have been destroyed by the flames, while between 80% and 90% of the town has been saved. Gas and power have been cut, and the water is currently undrinkable.  In fact, the outcome could have been much worse. If it weren’t for the efforts of firefighters, the entire downtown area of Fort McMurray could have been destroyed. What’s more, there have been no fatalities as a direct result of the blaze – although it is reported that two people lost their lives in a car accident, while fleeing the city.  It seems like other cities could learn a thing or two from the events in Fort McMurray. Whether the threat comes from a fire or a flood, a few basic principles can be applied to ensure that residents are safely evacuated. For instance, it’s crucial to have a plan for evacuation in advance, to warn people in the affected areas ahead of time and to coordinate the response of emergency services, residents and local authorities.  The most serious consideration when planning an evacuation is to be able to identify which evacuation paths are available, and how these paths could change as the threat develops. Organised, city-wide evacuation is only used in very rare circumstances – instead, most evacuations are initiated by individuals or households. This makes it especially important for residents to have access to up-to-date information about the range of the disaster, the location of safe zones and official advice.  New technology has the potential to play a significant role in all of this – especially in areas where emergency services aren’t as well resourced or organised. There is a demand for tools to help with the planning and management of evacuations, especially at a household level, which digital technology can fulfil. In particular, smartphone apps and Internet of Things technologies provide ideal platforms for these purposes.  One tool called “FLOODsite” – which focuses on evacuation modelling and traffic management during floods – was tried in three sites recently: the Thames Estuary in the UK, the Schelde Estuary in the Netherlands, and the Gard Region in France. And at Loughborough University’s Emergency Management group, we have been exploring past experiences of natural disasters, to develop our own real-time evacuation planning tool, which can be updated as the threat spreads.  We considered the damage inflicted on parts of the UK and the Netherlands, due to storm surges in 1953 and 2013. During the January 1953 event, 307 lives were lost in the UK, and 1,800 in the Netherlands. Over 32,000 people were evacuated and most of the infrastructure, including power stations, railways, sewage services and water services were damaged. Physical damage in the UK at the time was estimated to be approximately £50m. By contrast, in December 2013, thousands were evacuated in the same region, when another tidal surge reached higher levels than the 1953 event, and only two casualties were reported in the UK, one in Sweden and one in Denmark. This time, early warning and planned evacuation took place. For example, in eastern England about 10,000 homes were evacuated in Norfolk and Suffolk. We found that the inability to warn people in time was one of the main reasons for the heavy casualties in the earlier surge.  Using storm surges from recent years – including the 2013 event – as case studies, we developed a tool which can identify designated assembly points in the affected region, and find the user the shortest path from each assembly point to the safe areas for evacuees.  In collaboration with regional partners and the UK’s National Environment Agency, we are now extending our work to other areas near the North Sea. For instance, the city of Kampen, in the Netherlands, runs a flood defence exercise every year. We were lucky enough to witness members of the “high water brigade” – a well-organised voluntary team under the supervision of the city’s emergency services – build a temporary wall to protect the city in case of high water levels.  They also successfully demonstrated how authorities can communicate with local residents about the threat, via text message and voice alert. A live map with geo-tagged photos and text shared by volunteers was also created during the exercise, allowing the coordinators an overview of the situation on the ground. We hope that these new technological developments will enhance cities’ ability to respond to disasters, and increase the resilience of affected communities. The risks posed by natural disasters – whether wind, fire or flood – aren’t going away; in fact, they may get more serious, along with climate change. That’s why it’s so important that we develop new ways to respond quickly and efficiently to unexpected events. With it’s capacity for instant updates and location-based guidance, personalised technology is truly the way forward for disaster management."

Video by The New American
Models are faulty…no coming catastrophe
In Lüning’s view, the dire climate warnings are all based on models and the history of climate needs to be taken much more into account for extrapolating into the future. He thinks it’s no surprise many of the predictions are turning out wrong, and he reminds us that the earth’s climate has always seen wide fluctuations and that today’s climate is not unprecedented. “It’s not a catastrophe we are headed to.”
Hockey stick has been discarded
On the manipulation of past data, Dr. Lüning thinks the hockey stick was an error involving poor statistics and methods, with a “wish” for a certain outcome, reminding us that even Michael Mann has revised his charts. The Medieval Warm Period has also been put back in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report.

IPCC claims “not true”
He agrees there have been political efforts to push through false scientific data. “That’s true. And a lot of the articles that are proposed or published by IPCC affiliated scientists; one really has to look twice and three times at them to understand what has happened. And a lot of the claims are just not true.”
Germany’s renewable energy program in chaos
Lüning agrees there should be development in alternative energies, but describes Germany’s renewable energy push as being “in complete chaos“, and is a system where everyone is crying for subsidies and that the system is now on “shaky grounds”. He says some media are already backtracking. “The tide is changing, I think.”
Climate issue way beyond its best-before-date
In Lüning’s view the climate movement reached it’s peak in 2007, and that more and more people are taking a closer look at his own views. He credits his high profile co-author of the book ‘The Neglected Sun‘, Fritz Vahrenholt, for getting the climate science skepticism ball moving. “Step-by-step we are winning them over and a realism is beginning to take place“. He then describes how moderate scientists in Germany and in Europe are becoming more receptive to their non-alarmist message and states that more and more papers on the natural cycles have been coming out.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s popular daily Bild here reports on a pair of English environmental activists from the University of East Anglia in Norwich who have a novel idea on how to cut back on water consumption: Urinating while taking your early morning shower rather relieving yourself in the toilet bowl.
Also read here in English.
Bild writes that Debs Torr and Chris Dobson calculated that if their 15,000 classmates all did the same, enough water to fill 26 Olympic-size pools would be saved each year.
This is a rather strange idea for a country where rain and water are hardly in short supply. Let’s not kid ourselves. This is just the latest nutjob idea to regulate humans back to prehistoric lifestyles.
The activist students would like to see their “GoWithTheFlow” water savings initiative implemented nationwide across Britain. Thankfully the two leakers are not calling on making it mandatory. Bild writes:
Chris requests to be considerate of others. “When students share the shower stalls, then you should only do it when it’s okay for everyone.”
Thanks for asking.

My God, can you imagine how the shower would smell after a few months time? Who brought up these two slobs?
To me it’s truly mystifying as to why there would be any urgency at all “to save water” in a rain-drenched country like Great Britain, as if water is some kind of disappearing resource. Is civilization now at “peak water”?
Even here in wet, damp Germany there are constant calls by enviro-lunatics to not waste water. Granted some places have seen the local groundwater table drop due to agriculture and industry, and so I suppose in some areas there are legitimate arguments to do so.
However at many municipalities, city officals are begging for an end to all the water-saving madness. Wastewater from homes and businesses has dropped to dangerously low levels and put city sewage systems at risk.
Waste water levels are so low that solid waste material in wastewater systems ends up stalling and plugging the system. The water is simply too inadequate to keep everything flowing. Indeed municipalities are pleading: How about a “GoWithTheFlow” initiative for sewage systems!
A number of German public utilities are forced to regularly pump millions of gallons of additional water just to keep the system from breaking down, clogging up and rotting out.
And don’t expect this kind of proposal to be the last. Look for calls for composting as a way to save water for the “other business”.

"The wealthiest nation on the planet is facing a sudden experience of what poverty might be like, if relationships with its neighbours are not restored. Though Qatar has an extraordinary per capita income of US$130,000, compared with around US$57,000 in the US, it has a glaring weakness – the small desert peninsula imports around 90% of its food.  This has come to a head as a result of the blockade placed around Qatar by neighbouring members of the Gulf Co-operation Council, who accuse it of supporting militants. It furiously denies the claim. Because most of Qatar’s food had previously arrived across its only land border with Saudi Arabia, the blockade created the potential for imminent shortages, food inflation and unrest. Severe food shortages have only been averted thanks to urgent new deals with Iran and Turkey, which  are flying and shipping food in. Qatar is an important example of a nation potentially made complacent by its wealth. Why cultivate your own food when you can simply buy it in? The country also has a major food waste problem exacerbated by a regional culture of social extravagance. It appears to have given little attention to securing resilience within its food supply chains.  The blockades have exposed Qatar’s lack of domestic food production. Its hot, dry climate means most land is unsuitable for agriculture, and costs are high. The local food industry therefore does not have the knowledge, expertise or infrastructure to compete with cheaper, sometimes “loss leader” ranges of food imports that are seeking to create an anchor presence in anticipation of other food ranges to follow. Huge economic inequality also plays a role: wealthy, status-conscious Qataris prefer higher quality imported food, while at the other extreme a cost-conscious imported workforce cannot afford to be choosy.  So what can be done? The connections between food, water and energy are at the heart of security issues in many parts of the world – and Qatar is no different. Huge oil and gas reserves mean the country is obviously rich in energy, but it needs secure supplies of all three to underpin its development. Qatar at least has the financial resources to invest, reducing its reliance on others in respect of food and water. Desalination plants have been used since the 1950s in the Middle East to convert seawater for drinking and agriculture. But the financial and environmental costs are unsustainable: it has been estimated that the 30 desalination plants in Saudi Arabia rely on around 300,000 barrels of crude oil each day. Solar-powered desalination plants look to be the future as they are capable of producing a litre of water for around 2 cents (compared with US$1 for a litre by conventional desalination plants), but it still isn’t certain whether these plants can be deployed quickly and cheaply at the sort of scale required. To get its food industry going, Qatar needs to promote new generations of “agro-preneurs”. They’ll need to be backed with subsidies, business-friendly start-up policies and the necessary capital for facilities. The fledgling enterprises will need an ecosystem of knowledge and expertise in agriculture to demonstrate how they can become established in local markets and be more attractive than imported goods. Limited land mass and already large numbers of small individual plots means that creating some sort of “Qatar National Food Corp” would not be easy – but not impossible. Current legislation tends to encourage rather than limit food waste – and this needs to be reversed. Qatar has a system of strict expiry dates, with no “best before”. This affects consumer attitudes and, in a more major way, that of retailers. Any expired products are often sent to landfill as this is cheaper than returning them to distant manufacturers. Smart marketing and widespread education is needed to change “normal behaviour” among consumers who currently reject “non-perfect” foods, see excess food as rubbish, and prefer luxury global brands as a definition of status. A culture of good hospitality and buffets for every social occasion and event isn’t helping the food waste problem. In particular, Qataris will need to learn to accept the lower standard (at least initially) of food produced locally by an immature industry but one with much potential for enhancement. A combination is needed of new enterprise, new regulations to limit waste and new technologies. Here, Qatar should develop its own research, and become a leading innovator in technology designed to grow, transport and store food even in an arid climate – it certainly has the resources."
"The world’s thirst for oil will continue to grow over the next two decades, with climate-damaging emissions climbing until at least 2040, the global energy watchdog has warned, pointing the finger at the growing appetite for gas-guzzling cars. Growing demand for SUVs in the US, China, Europe and elsewhere could negate all the environmental benefits of the increased use of electric cars, the International Energy Agency (IEA) says. Because of their size, SUVs are harder to electrify than smaller vehicles.  The IEA’s annual global industry forecast also cited mounting demand for plastic, increasing plane travel and the upcoming population boom in cities across Africa and Asia as key contributing factors in increasing demand for oil. This year’s World Energy Outlook, used as guidance by oil companies and governments, was released on Wednesday. The watchdog had already revealed some of its findings ahead of publication, warning that a “grand coalition” of governments and investors was needed to end the upward march of record energy emissions rising beyond 2040. This year’s forecast took a stronger than usual stand on climate change, amid growing pressure from young activists like Greta Thunberg and others for tougher action on emissions. It celebrates a growing boom in solar and wind power, and urges governments to work together on changing the way we fuel our lives. And it singles out gas-guzzling SUVs for criticism. SUVs “were the second biggest reason for global emissions growth in last 10 years, after the power sector and more than all the industrial sectors put together”, IEA director Fatih Birol told reporters in Paris on Wednesday. Energy-intensive SUVs and pickup trucks account for about two-thirds of car sales in the US and only about a third in the EU, though they are steadily growing in demand in Europe, according to industry reports. Worldwide, about 42% of cars sold last year were SUVs, Birol said. The World Energy Outlook, which focuses on forecasting energy needs over the next 20 years, is increasingly important to governments because of its relevance to climate policy. Environmental advocates said the IEA still was not doing enough to encourage renewable energy. Oil Change International notably criticised the IEA’s “over-reliance” on natural gas as a replacement for coal, saying that would lead to “climate chaos” because gas too contributes to emissions. The report comes as Venice struggles with floods hitting their second-highest level this week, inundating St. Mark’s basilica and grounding gondolas, which the city’s mayor has blamed on climate change.  The IEA said that almost 20% of the growth in last year’s global energy use was “due to hotter summers pushing up demand for cooling and cold snaps leading to higher heating needs”. Based on current emissions promises by governments, the IEA forecast a global oil demand of 106.4 million barrels a day in 2040, up from 96.9 million last year. Global oil demand is due to slow in the 2030s and coal use to shrink slightly. Emissions will continue to rise, if more slowly than today, and will not peak before 2040. The US is central to whatever happens next. US consumers and businesses were a leading source of growing oil demand last year, the IEA said. Also, the US will account for 85% of the increase in global oil production by 2030, thanks to the shale boom. Asked about president Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the 2015 Paris climate accord, Birol said: “As a global issue, it’s important to have concerted efforts to address climate change.” The report lays out a more ambitious forecast if governments are to meet the goals in the 2015 UN climate accord. That would require a big boost in wind and solar power, the IEA said, and a push for energy efficiency, which has slowed in recent years. The more ambitious scenario would also require work on new coal plants in Asia to capture their emissions, or closing them early. All that would lead to a big drop in oil demand — with repercussions for oil-producing countries that depend heavily on hydrocarbon income. The report came as Thunberg announced she will return to Europe soon from North America on a catamaran that leaves nearly no carbon footprint, part of effort to call global attention to individuals’ impact on climate change. While the IEA said such movements and individual decisions by companies and investors “can make a major difference,” it insisted that “governments must take the lead ... the greatest capacity to shape our energy destiny lies with governments.” "

Last month the sun was variably active: The first ten days of the month were eventful, whereas the middle of the month solar activity was very calm with the negative high point occurring on July 17, when zero sunspots were recorded at a time during the maximum. At the end of the month activity picked up again with mean sunspot number for the month was 72.5. Once again the most activity took place in the southern hemisphere. The numbers: 47.1 as opposed to 25.4 for the northern hemisphere. This is 73% of the activity that is usual for this month into the cycle.

Figure 1: Monthly sunspot number for the current Cycle 24 (red), which began in December 2008. In comparison to the mean value of previous cycles 1 – 23 (blue) and the similar Cycle 1.
For a comparison of all cycles, the anomalies of each cycle (i.e. the difference between the monthly SSN data and the mean value) are plotted in the next chart:

The diminishment of solar activity in the current millennium can be clearly seen. Between 1945 and the mid 1990s we witnessed a profoundly long protracted period of activity. This unusual development is confirmed by a recently published paper by Finnish scientist Ilya Usoskinvon of the University of Oulu appearing in Astronomy and Astrophysics (A&A Volume 562, February 2014). The paper shows that the height of solar activity from 1945 to 1995 was a rare event over the last 3000 years. Pronounced minima such as the Maunder Minimums (from 1645 to 1715) on the other hand are much more frequent.

Figure 3: Sunspot number reconstructed by Usoskin et al. (2014), from 1150 BC until 1950 AD. The red curve depicts the directly observed sunspot count since 1610.
A Chinese paper by the Center for Space Science and Applied Research der Chinese Academy of Sciences in Peking (ZHAO X H, FENG X S., Chin Sci Bull, Chin Ver., 2014, 59: 1284: “Periodicities of solar activity and the surface temperature variation of the Earth and their correlations”) goes a step further in its conclusion:
“During the past 100 years, solar activities display a clear increasing tendency that corresponds to the global warming of the Earth (including land and ocean) very well. Particularly, the ocean temperature has a slightly higher correlation to solar activity than the land temperature. All these demonstrate that solar activity has a non-negligible forcing on the temperature change of the Earth on the time scale of centuries.”

"Out of all the EU’s policies, the Common Agricultural Policy has consistently received the worst press in the UK. Politicians and papers of both the left and the right have variously attacked it for being too costly, too restrictive, targeted at the wrong people, or for failing to protect the environment.  Unsurprisingly then, that getting rid of the CAP is overwhelmingly seen as a positive consequence of Brexit. Farming minister George Eustice said it was the “real prize”, Zac Goldsmith called it “a bonanza for the environment”, while a group of leading NGOs including the National Trust and the WWF said leaving the EU provides “an unprecedented opportunity to revitalise our countryside in a way that balances the needs of everyone, for generations to come”. But delivering on that promise is not going to be easy, as agricultural policy brings together a variety of highly divergent interests. Within the UK, farmers in some regions (like Northern Ireland) or sectors (cereals) are more reliant on public support than others, and thus will have different demands. The entire food industry supply chain has a whole other set of complaints about the CAP, as do consumer and health and environmental organisations. All of the above have different visions for a new agricultural policy after Brexit. These tensions are laid bare in a new House of Lords EU committee report on Brexit and agriculture. Reading this report, it becomes evident that the government will need to strike a difficult and highly political balance between different interests in three main areas: on the purpose of the policy, on whether agricultural policy is central to the Brexit strategy, and on whether common UK rules are worth unsettling the devolution settlements. Farms cover more than two thirds of the UK and the country grows 61% of its own food. An agricultural policy is therefore also a policy for food and land use. It’s true that, after Brexit, Britain would be free to pursue a cheap food policy by allowing more meat imports from North and South America, where environmental and welfare standards are lower. But, while this would reduce prices in supermarkets, it would also undermine the UK agricultural sector’s competitiveness.   Farmers facing increased competition may be less inclined to increase their environmental efforts and ask instead for reduced environmental and welfare standards. As the House of Lords points out, it will be extremely difficult “to reconcile the government’s wish for the UK to become a global leader in free trade with its desire to maintain high quality standards for agri-food products.” British farming is too closely linked with Europe to cut ties overnight. About 80% of UK food exports currently go to the EU, and the sector is heavily reliant on EU labour, both permanent and seasonal, both highly skilled (such as vets) and less skilled but highly specialised (such as workers in slaughterhouses or fruit pickers).  This means agriculture is particularly exposed to restrictions on access to the single market and migrant labour. Unless Britain strikes a strong deal with the EU it can expect food exports to be severely reduced, thanks to both high food tariffs under the World Trade Organisation and “non tariff barriers” such as regulations on labelling and rules of origin. In the Lords report, the Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, argued “trade opportunities in food related areas may fall by around 70–90%”. This makes a “no deal” option extremely damaging for agriculture – no wonder the National Farmers Union has called for “business as usual” in terms of access to the EU. A constitutional crisis is also brewing: who will be responsible for agricultural policy in the UK? It’s currently a devolved matter. As things stand, the various governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, along with the UK government for England, each implement a common EU policy in a different way, based on the types of farming in each of the regions but also diverging political priorities (such as how much funding should be spent on the environment).  What happens after Brexit is far from clear. Most agree some kind of UK framework will be needed – on chemicals or animal welfare for example. But there is a sharp disagreement between the UK government, which says it will reserve itself the right to decide which parts of agricultural policy should remain central and which should be devolved, and the Welsh government (echoed by its Scottish counterpart), which argues all agricultural policies are devolved and common frameworks should be “collectively developed and agreed, based on common consent by all four governments within the UK, and not imposed.” British critics of the CAP should be careful what they wish for, as replacing it with something better requires a lot of things to fall in place. Any solution will involve finding common ground between consumers, farmers, and the environmental movement. It will require the development of new trading links with the EU and the world, and a rethinking of the inner workings of the UK.  This is a tremendous challenge. And it’s not clear whether the Westminster government and civil service (already overstretched pre-Brexit) will be up to the task."
"At the Paris climate summit in December 2015, 195 countries adopted the first universal, legally binding, global climate deal. Impressive stuff. A major success for the United Nations and met with much congratulatory fanfare. Now world leaders are gathered in New York to actually sign the agreement, which is due to come into force in 2020. The targets are worthy – limiting global warming to “well below 2℃” – but will collective action really live up to such ambition? A colleague of mine recently likened ratification of the Paris agreement to signing up to run the a marathon. You feel very good about it. You collectively pat each other on the back and bask in a moment of self-satisfaction. But then you realise that this will be your very first marathon, you have done no prior training, you have no coach lined up and, what’s more, you have committed to set a new world record. Will you achieve it? Probably not. We almost certainly won’t be able to keep global warming close to the much-heralded 1.5℃, and neither will carbon emissions peak as soon as is necessary to achieve this target. Is success in the climate marathon slipping from our grasp before we have even started training? Let me explore this further. Global warming is closely linked to energy use. There are some significant long-term energy trends, which form an important backdrop against which to consider our preparations. Global demand for energy continues to rise as a direct result of growth in the world economy, increased levels of activity – especially in emerging economies – and population growth. Global GDP is expected to double in the next 20 years. However, reforms in the Chinese economy, coupled with ever-increasing energy efficiency, will help limit growth in energy use to around 35% during the same period. The type of fuel used to generate all this energy is also changing. Use of coal, with its high carbon emissions, is declining markedly. Gas is the fastest growing fossil fuel, supported by an abundance of shale gas with its relatively lower carbon emissions. Oil holds steady. Renewables are undoubtedly the fastest growing sector worldwide, with an expectation that they will quadruple in the next 20 years, albeit from a very low starting point. Finally, the growth rate of carbon emissions is already slowing sharply. This is the expected result of the trends noted above and indicative of an important decoupling of carbon emissions from economic growth. It reflects a marked decline in both energy use per unit of GDP and in carbon emissions per unit of consumption. So, optimistically, the trends seem to point towards a transition to a lower-carbon energy system. This has been backed up by the individual pledges of participating countries prior to the Paris meeting last year, which will be ratified at the signings. But, good as this may seem, it is in fact nowhere near sufficient to meet the International Energy Authority’s 450 scenario. IEA 450 is a plan to limit carbon dioxide atmospheric levels to 450 parts per million, which would limit the increase in global temperature to 1.6℃. Tackling climate change is quite rightly seen as an international effort, requiring a combination of governmental, industrial and individual action. Significantly, it requires sustained and increased effort if we are to have any chance of success. But many countries are already falling short. Take the UK, for instance. The country should be working extra hard to boost renewables. Yet the government has recently dramatically cut subsidies to the renewable industry. The UK should support an increased use of natural gas as the preferred fossil fuel. Yet the government refuses to support much-needed research into the viability and efficiency of shale gas. British engineers should be pioneering work on carbon capture and storage (CCS) in underground reservoirs. Yet the government has recently reneged on its commitment to make available £1 billion capital funding for fully commercial CCS projects. Such obfuscation and lack of action is unhelpful and goes against Britain’s track record of creating innovative solutions to society’s needs. Nowhere is this more compelling now than at the climate-energy nexus – not only for renewables, clean gas and carbon storage, but also in the realm of improved energy efficiency and storage, increased recycling and minimising waste."
"Each year, fires rage across northern India, as farmers burn off their unwanted straw. The impact is enormous. From October into November, massive clouds of smoke streak across Punjab and neighbouring states, blown by the prevailing winds in the direction of Delhi.  Every year, ministers demand action – in 2016, they were joined by India’s supreme court. And every year, NASA publishes new satellite photos showing the extent of the burning. People die on the roads as the smoke limits visibility, while heart and lung problems are exacerbated.    The fertile fields of Punjab produce about 20% of India’s rice and 40% of its wheat. Rice is grown from May to October, followed in the same fields by wheat from November to March. The turnaround between rice harvest and wheat planting must be quick, as any delay badly affects wheat yields.  The 11m tonnes of rice grown in Punjab leaves behind about 21m tonnes of straw – the inedible part of the plant. Farmers typically have just 20 days to clear it away before the wheat season begins. The straw is usually burned openly in the same fields where it was grown, in spite of regulations and knowledge of environmental and human damages. This has been part of Punjabi culture for decades (neighbouring Haryana and Western Uttar-Pradesh follow the same crop cycle in comparable quantities). India is not unique – the state of California burnt residue as recently as the 1980s and straw burning continues in many parts of Southeast Asia and Africa today. Burning is doubly wasteful as the straw is lost to the flames. Each year, the soil loses more carbon, nitrogen and other nutrients. Every acre of paddy yields approximately 2.5 tonnes of straw. Burning that straw sends approximately a tonne of organic carbon into the atmosphere (in the form of gases such as CO2, CO and others) along with other nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. There are lots of alternatives to burning, but all have their problems. Paddy straw isn’t nutritious enough to make good animal fodder, and its high concentrations of silica can damage traditional farming equipment.  As rice is typically grown in small fields, it also isn’t always possible (or affordable) to use the high-powered machinery necessary to till the straw deep into the soil prior to planting wheat. Other solutions like using straw for biomass power or to make paper all require lots of new infrastructure.  Straw is already collected and baled today in a few of Punjab’s large farms, and other areas near biomass power plants. But baled straw is difficult to handle, and bulky to transport and store. Expensive power plants often sit idle for weeks, surrounded by fields of damp straw that cannot be used until dry. Straw burning is illegal but, as the alternatives are either impractical or expensive, most farmers still do it. They’re making a rational decision. Therefore, irrespective of government policy and wider environmental considerations, any solution must give farmers themselves a good incentive not to burn. To resolve some of these problems, we have developed EnergyHarvest. First, paddy straw is compressed into small pellets using technology normally used to produce animal feed. An oxygen-free heating process known as pyrolysis then converts these pellets into energy outputs: heat and “bio-char”, a form of charcoal.  These pellets transform paddy straw into something useful. Each pellet contains lots of energy for its size and weight. They’re easy to handle and store, and less expensive to transport than big bales of straw. The bio-char that the pellets are turned into after pyrolysis captures most of the carbon and nutrients present in the original straw. When returned to the ground it makes the soil healthier and retain more water.  Meanwhile the heat given off during pyrolysis can be captured and used to produce hot water, or mechanical or electrical energy. It could also be converted into refrigeration for food at half the price of conventional electric cooling. It’s important that these pellets can be used in lots of different ways because different farming areas will present unique requirements and opportunities. We’ve set up a demonstration of the EnergyHarvest technology at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) and a series of three-year randomised field trials are underway. The cooling is integrated with the cold-storage demonstration systems at PAU’s food science department. Our work on converting straw into pellets, and processing these pellets into useful products, won’t solve open field burning – or Delhi’s air pollution – overnight. But it does mean that small-scale farmers, the majority of farmers in Punjab, can now do something useful with their leftovers. M.S. Mavi and O.P. Choudhary from the Department of Soil Science at Punjab Agricultural University also contributed to this article."
"As Jess Phillips’s still much mourned parliamentary colleague Jo Cox once asserted, there is very often far more that unites us rather than divides us. How right Phillips was to effect a meeting with the citizen who had attacked her office when she might have been forgiven for never having wished to see or hear of him ever again (“Fighting for progress from within the party is the only way to do it”, Focus). To give up on him or anyone is to give up just a little more on essential efforts at inclusiveness and mutual understanding.  A sharing of common human experience and respect for often uncomfortable differences are signs of strength and resilience in our, at present, far too divided communities. To exchange contrasting and even conflicting visions of how life should be lived is the hallmark of any mature society. A constant striving for inclusivity and tolerance is a crucial building block.Malcolm FowlerKings HeathBirmingham Rachel Botsman writes about trust in politics and cites the “letter of last resort” that the prime minister has to write to the Trident nuclear submarine commander (“Trust is a rare commodity in today’s politics. How can we rediscover it?”, Comment). The human race faces two existential threats: nuclear annihilation and climate crisis. The only sane response to the former is the abolition of all nuclear weapons, starting with Trident, which create insecurity for everyone. Then the question of the “letter” would never arise.  This is one issue where I would unequivocally trust Jeremy Corbyn, who has rightly said that he would never “press the button”. Frank JacksonFormer co-chair, World Disarmament CampaignHarlow, Essex Despite being enshrined in legislation, the right for patients to receive treatment within 18 weeks has increasingly been forgotten. The target of 92% of patients receiving appropriate treatment within 18 weeks of referral was last met nearly four years ago, in February 2016. Recent figures show that only 84.8% of patients were seen within 18 weeks, a position that is likely to worsen over the winter. Up to 90,000 people also waited more than 18 weeks for trauma and orthopaedic surgery. The waiting-time targets for this speciality were last met five years ago. The 18-week standard is vital for people waiting for many types of elective surgery, including those waiting in pain for hip, knee and other joint replacements. In those months of waiting, people’s physical condition can deteriorate, they can become depressed, suffer pain or struggle to stay in work. The impact on both them and their families can be devastating. As we approach the general election, we are calling on all political parties to commit to an 18-week maximum waiting time in their election manifestos and in the next parliament.Liam O’TooleCEO of Versus ArthritisProfessor Derek AldersonPresident, Royal College of Surgeons of England In answer to Robin McKie’s question: “Climategate 10 years on: what have we learned?”, (Focus), first, that environmentalists have treated the ecosystem for too long as almost independent of the dominant economic system, one based on deregulated, globalised finance. Second, that there will be no chance of protecting Earth’s life-support systems unless we at the same time escape from the hold that those running the globalised financial system have over all our lives. We have a capitalist system that ignores the most vital capital of all: that provided by nature, which is being exploited parasitically and used up at a reckless rate.David MurrayWallington, Surrey Your editorial was too lenient on George Osborne (“Celebrate the end of austerity. But the new cash must be spent wisely”). Admittedly, he did have “important support” from the International Monetary Fund and the OECD when he declared in 2010 that austerity measures were “the only way to bring the deficit under control”, but by January 2013 things had changed significantly. It was then that the IMF’s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, told the then chancellor of the need for a “reassessment of fiscal policy”, less than two months before the March budget. His recent work on fiscal multipliers had shown him the devastating effects tax and spending cuts were having on the wider economy, but did the arrogant Osborne take any notice? What we saw was the growth forecast for 2013 halved, and debt as a share of GDP increase from 75.9% to 85.6%, while government department budgets were cut by 1% in each of the following two years, £11.5bn further cuts were earmarked for 2015-16, corporation tax cut to 20%, and the 1% cap on public sector pay extended for another two years. Osborne ignored expert advice and continued with his callous austerity policies, so that now billions have to be spent to “repair pretty much all of the fraying fabric of public services, infrastructure, amenities and welfare provision”. Most certainly, history will not forgive Osborne. December’s voters should not forget, either, which parties and politicians supported Osborne in his duplicitous scheme.Bernie EvansLiverpool In her understandably humorous review of the film Midway, Wendy Ide says: “The US is on the back foot after Pearl Harbor. The Japanese are better equipped; the American fighter jets are creaky crates…” Although the film is a dramatised portrayal of historical events, it is an indisputable fact that the Americans did not have “fighter jets” at Midway. No US design was ready in time for deployment in any theatre before the end of the Second World War. If the US had been able to benefit from the deployment of reliable jet aircraft early on in the Pacific theatre of war they would almost certainly have brought Japan to its knees very rapidly and the use of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki would probably have been averted.Paul F FaupelSomershamCambridgeshire It is great to see new advances in producing animal-free meat (“How do you like your beef – old-style cow or 3D-printed?”, News). It’s time for meat without compromise, meat that does not exacerbate climate change or undermine the effectiveness of our antibiotics. Hunger is increasing across the globe, in part because of the climate crisis. Despite recent advances, we still have a long way to go to shift all meat production to plant-based and cultivated steaks, sausages and fillets. Given all that is at stake, governments should back research and development for plant-based and cultivated meat. By making better meat production a priority, publicly funded research will not only improve and protect public health but also increase food security and self-sufficiency, issues especially important for the UK.Jessica AlmyThe Good Food InstituteWashington DC"
"I have been a member of the Wytaliba community near Glen Innes for 40 years. We lost two of our community members in last Friday’s bushfires, and the father of my great-grandson is in Royal North Shore hospital being treated for severe burns while trying to save his house and his dead neighbour.  Nearly 50% of our able adults are members of the Wytaliba RFS, a figure envied by many other brigades. Over those 40 years on our 1,400-ha property, we have had more than a dozen out-of-control bushfires that were successfully controlled, most of them in recent years. Over the past three years, in cooperation with NSW forestry, national parks and the RFS, we have had very extensive controlled burning in the state forest and national park on our perimeter. On 14 September, after an outbreak of fires across the northern tablelands, high winds caused embers to spot more than 10km on to the centre of Wytaliba. After an initial emergency the fire weather abated, but over the next week the fire spread across much of the property. In a large operation more than 20 RFS trucks, more than 100 firefighters, bulldozers and waterbombers were successfully deployed to help defend our homes. All were saved. Much of Wytaliba was blacked out. Carol – the mayor of Glen Innes with a 20-year RFS service medal – and I have a large cleared area around our double-brick house. The September fire burned to our perimeter. This was just two months ago. Everything that should be done was done, and lots more. The fire that came last Friday was of another order of magnitude altogether. A crown fire roaring in from the west on a hot afternoon with an 80km/h wind – it wasn’t on the ground. It was a firestorm in the air – raining fire. There was no fuel on the ground; it was already burned. The heat ahead of the fire front ignited nearly everything in its path. Before he saw any flame my neighbour’s car exploded. They just escaped with their lives. You can see the live footage on Monday’s ABC 7.30 program. Our house was severely damaged but not destroyed. We weren’t home. Others were not so lucky. Wytaliba has lost two lives and more than half our homes, our school, our bridge, our wildlife and 40 years of work to build a community. What was our paradise is now ash. Thanks to the heroics of Wytaliba RFS and residents, and the Reddestone RFS who incredibly crossed the burning bridge to help us, some was saved. “Today is not the day to talk about climate change.” No, yesterday was, or the day before, or the month before, or the year before. But it didn’t get a mention. Now we have the reality, and the mention it gets is: “Don’t talk about it now.” So the politicians (and the media) turn the talk to hazard reduction burns, or the lack of them, as something else to blame on the inner-city raving lunatics. We had a bushfire two months ago that burned most of our property. It didn’t matter. It burned again. This is climate changed. We’re in the worst drought recorded. A million hectares of bush has burned. Barnaby says it’s Greens voters and the sun’s magnetic field. Pray for rain. Pray harder for leadership. • Badja Sparks is a longtime resident of Wytaliba.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUnbelievable but true: Political science Phd and former Greenpeace activist tailors Wikipedia climate entries to suit IPCC line
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
Recall the Wikipedia scandal where an IPCC follower heightened the alarmism in English-language articles in the well-known online encyclopedia (See our blog report “Climate-falsifier Connolley: The man who revises our world view“). Also German climate alarmists have been very busy writing along.
In the early phases here there was an well educated political sciences major named Nils Simon, who was very energetically at work. He’s a former Greenpeace activist. For example the following German Wikipedia articles were “considerably tailored”: EU-emission trading – Consequences of global warming – Consequences of global warming on the Arctic – Glacier melting – Global warrming – Controversy over global warming – Kyoto-Protocol – Sea level rise – Ocean acidification. Moreover numerous other Wikipedia climate entries were posted by the activist (list here). Even though today the 32-year old Phd has very little knowledge about the natural science fundamentals, it does not keep him from writing away, now currently under a second name: “Hadern”.
In an article at the website of the Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP) in 2011 Simon made his IPCC climate apocalypse leanings very clear:
Whoever desires to promote the transformation of the global economy, must first overhaul the UN Commission, say Nils Simon, Marianne Beisheim and Steffen Bauer. Rio 2012 is the only chance for this and the state leaders must not pass it up.
The snail’s pace of the climate negotiations, the UNEP’s impotence or the failure of the UN Commission for Sustainable Development to even agree on a final declaration at their annual meeting in May 2011 poignantly demonstrates how urgent a fundamental institutional reshuffling of the United Nations in the area of environment and sustainable development really is. A strengthened mandate paired with strong political leadership as cover, more effective negotiating processes and implementation instruments as well as comprehensive and secured financial means are essential elements of such a reform.”

At Simon’s personal Wikiversity website one finds exclusively links to climate alarm organizations such as the PIK, Real Climate, James Hansen’s earlier GISS Institute and the IPCC. In the Wikipedia user profile the climate science suboptimum qualification profile of Nils Simon is even well highlighted by himself, perhaps an attempt to rehabilitate his earlier activist years. He quotes an assessment on him from a Wikipedia user:
‘Again and again I am amazed by the tenacity of people who have not the least of background knowledge yet think they are in a position to argue because they maybe once viewed ‘An Inconvenient Truth’ and ‘The Day After Tommorrow’ and now believe they know everything there is to know about climatology.“’– a user about me [Nils Simon]”
Interestingly Nils Simon is still listed in the number one place as an employee of the Wikipedia-Project “Climate Change”. The project page serves to coordinate the work on Wikipedia articles on the topic of global warming. The group forthrightly describes its aims on the site:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




At Wikipedia there is a series of articles that deal with these complex phenomena. Up to now there has not been any central location where all employees have been able to coordinate. Moreover, due to the open structure of Wikipedia, the articles are prone to vandalism, and, more importantly, the dissemination of often scientifically unsupported minority opinions from so-called climate skeptics.”
In short it boils down to assuring the alarmist IPCC opinion purity at Wikipedia and to actively suppress other interpretations. Climate realist views are in short degraded off hand as “scientifically baseless, minority opinions”. This judgment is adopted by the ideology and its Wikipedia friends – even though they themselves cannot have any real grasp of the subject due to their lack of training in natural sciences and especially geology. Instead the IPCC/PIK opinion is crudely parroted, and everything else if regarded as false and is promptly deleted. This is nothing less than censorship and is highly dubious.
According to talk in the Internet, a few years ago Nils Simon was barred from Wikipedia because of his activist and rabid revisionism. But as of late has been allowed back in once again (see comment at diepresse.com by FragenderIn, 7 July 2011 12:31).
As an example at Wikipedia the following entry on Fritz Vahrenholt was made by the circle of activists:
“He [Vahrenholt] claims that a 16-year stop in the rise of global temperature has been observed and that the reports from the IPCC were influenced by by environmental organizations like Greenpeace and the WWF.”
Here  by employing the word “claims”, they wish to imply that his facts are wrong. Yet in the meantime there’s hardly a person who seriously doubts the pause in warming. That data speak clearly and loudly. Even the IPCC now openly admits the missing warming and in its doubt offers up a full bouquet of possible explanations on how this unexpected development could have occurred. Also the involvement of Greenpeace and WWF workers in the IPCC reports is confirmed black on white, thus showing that the word “claim” was totally incorrect. One could have also written: “Vahrenholt claims that the day has 24 hours and that the earth is round”. Therefore we suggest a change for the better:
Vahrenholt points out that a 16-year stop in global temperature rise has been observed and that the IPCC reports were written with the involvement of environmental organizations such as Greenpeace and the WWF.”
That formulation would be much more honest and correct. Dear Mr. Simon, it’s time for a correction.

"Animals and plants are seemingly disappearing faster than at any time since the dinosaurs died out, 66m years ago. The death knell tolls for life on Earth. Rhinos will soon be gone unless we defend them, Mexico’s final few Vaquita porpoises are drowning in fishing nets, and in America, Franklin trees survive only in parks and gardens.  Yet the survivors are taking advantage of new opportunities created by humans. Many are spreading into new parts of the world, adapting to new conditions, and even evolving into new species. In some respects, diversity is actually increasing in the human epoch, the Anthropocene. It is these biological gains that I contemplate in a new book, Inheritors of the Earth: How Nature is Thriving in an Age of Extinction, in which I argue that it is no longer credible for us to take a loss-only view of the world’s biodiversity. The beneficiaries surround us all. Glancing out of my study window, I see poppies and camomile plants sprouting in the margins of the adjacent barley field. These plants are southern European “weeds” taking advantage of a new human-created habitat. When I visit London, I see pigeons nesting on human-built cliffs (their ancestors nested on sea cliffs) and I listen out for the cries of skyscraper-dwelling peregrine falcons which hunt them. Climate change has brought tree bumblebees from continental Europe to my Yorkshire garden in recent years. They are joined by an influx of world travellers, moved by humans as ornamental garden plants, pets, crops, and livestock, or simply by accident, before they escaped into the wild. Neither the hares nor the rabbits in my field are “native” to Britain.   Many conservationists and “invasive species biologists” wring their hands at this cavalcade of “aliens”. But it is how the biological world works. Throughout the history of the Earth, species have survived by moving to new locations that permit them to flourish – today, escaped yellow-crested cockatoos are thriving in Hong Kong, while continuing to decline in their Indonesian homeland. Nonetheless, the rate at which we are transporting species is unprecedented, converting previously separate continents and islands into one biological supercontinent. In effect, we are creating New Pangea, the greatest ecological pile-up in the Earth’s long history. A few of the imported species cause others to become extinct – rats have driven some predator-naïve island birds to extinction, for example. Ground-nesting, flightless pigeons and rails that did not recognise the danger were no match for a deadly combination of rodents and human hunters.  But despite being high-profile, these cases are fairly rare. In general, most of the newcomers fit in, with limited impacts on other species. The net result is that many more species are arriving than are dying out – in Britain alone, nearly 2,000 extra species have established populations in the past couple of thousand years. The processes of evolution also continue, as animals, plants and microbes adjust to the way humans are altering the world around them. Fish have evolved to breed when they are smaller and younger, increasing the chances that they will escape the fisherman’s nets, and butterflies have changed their diets to make used of human-altered habitats.  Entirely new species have even come into existence. The “apple fly” has evolved in North America, thanks to European colonials bringing fruit trees to the New World. And house sparrows mated with Mediterranean “Spanish” sparrows somewhere on an Italian farm. Their descendants represent a brand new species, the Italian sparrow. Life on Earth is no longer the same as it was before humans arrived on the scene. There is no doubt that the rate at which species are dying out is very high, and we could well be in for a “Big Sixth” mass extinction. This represents a loss of biological diversity. Yet, we also know that the Big Five mass extinctions of the past half billion years ultimately led to increases in diversity. Could this happen again? It seems so, because the current rate at which new animals and plants (such as the apple fly, the Italian sparrow and Oxford ragwort) are coming into existence is unusually high – and it may be the highest ever. We are already on the verge of Genesis Number Six – a million or so years from now, the world could end up supporting more species, not fewer, as a consequence of the evolution of Homo sapiens. The ongoing ecological and evolutionary success stories of the Anthropocene epoch require us to re-evaluate our relationship with the rest of nature. Change is ultimately the means by which species survive and turn into new species. So, perhaps we should not spend quite so much time bemoaning the losses that have already taken place, and trying to recreate some imagined past world. We cannot rewind history. It might be more effective for us to facilitate future biological gains even if, in so doing, we move further away from how the world used to be.  This does not let us off the hook – species are genuinely dying out – but it does mean that we should not regard change per se as negative. We should perhaps think of ourselves as inmates and moulders of a dynamic, changing world, rather than as despoilers of a formerly pristine land."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA reader/professor has sent me an internal memo he recently obtained from a meteorologist and member of the Deutsche Meteorologische Gesellschaft [German Meteorological Society], abbreviated as DMG. Clearly grave concern is emerging over a large swath of the broader German meteorological-climatological community in the wake of the Lennart Bengtsson witchhunt.
The memo was authored by a group of dissenting DMG-member meteorologists and intended to be published in the DMG reports, but never saw the light of day.
It reveals a growing and widespread worry over the suppression of scientific views among German Meteorological Society members. One of the authors of the memorandum wrote an e-mail to the reader who provided the copy to me. He writes:
A circle of mostly older colleagues of the Free University of Berlin, who very much reject the tone one finds in today’s field of climatology, has asked me to draft a memorandum on the subject and to publish it in the Reports of the German Meteorological Society. Shortened by a half and totally watered down, the memorandum appeared in the last issue. I now take the liberty to bring the original version to your attention.
Greetings and cordial asscoication yours, ************”
I’ve deleted the name to protect the source. What follows is the original, un-watered down version of the memorandum – translated in English:
=====================================
Memorandum
On the situation in the field of meteorology-climatology
Based on observations made for quite some time, and due to the current occasion (IPCC 5), colleagues in the meteorological circles have been witnessing with worry how certain developments are becoming cemented into their scientific fields (foremost climatology) which from a scientific point of view simply cannot be accepted and do not comply to their professional ethics.
These developments involve first of all something in the lines of a democratization of science: Everyone is allowed and should have a say in it. In meteorology-climatology every one includes a highly visible army of organized, little known persons; in Germany this is almost the entire public! The changes that have taken place in science as a result have in our opinion (and that of others) led to very negative impacts on the quality standards of science. For example expressed and disseminated meteorological flaws can hardly be contained and cannot be corrected publicly at all. Yet our meteorological scientists do not speak up.

And it is hardly perceived that behind these developments – admittedly – there is also a political objective for the transformation of society, whether one wants it or not. Currently global sustainable change is the same thing.
Meteorology-climatology is playing a decisive role this political action. The – alleged – CO2 consensus here is serving as a lever within the group that consists of known colleagues who deal with climate, but also consists of a large number of climate bureaucrats coming from every imaginable social field. Together both groups consensually have introduced a binding dogma into this science (which is something that is totally alien to the notion of science).
This is not the first time such a thing has happened in the history of science. Here although this dogma came about through democratic paths (through consensus vote?), in the end it is almost dictatorial. Doubting the dogma is de facto forbidden and is punished? In climatology the doubt is about datasets or results taken over from hardly verifiable model simulations from other parties. Until recently this kind of science was considered conquered – thanks to our much celebrated liberty/democratic foundation!
The constant claim of consensus among so-called climatologists, who relentlessly claim man-made climate change has been established, attempts to impose by authority an end to the debate on fundamental questions. Thus a large number of scientist colleagues end up being ostracized, and thus could lead to the prompting of actions that would have considerable burdens on the well-intended society. Such a regulation and the resulting incalculable consequence it would have for all people would in our view – and that of many meteorological specialists we know – be irresponsible with respect to our real level of knowledge in this field.
We must desire in general, and also in our scientific field, a return to an international scientific practice that is free of pre-conceptions and cemented biased opinions. This must include the freedom of presenting (naturally well-founded) scientific results, even when these do not correspond to the mainstream (e.g. the IPCC requirements).

Clearly a number of scientists and experts in Germany worry that dogma has engulfed meteorology and climatology, and that history risks repeating itself.

The media went crazy, and so did some “experts”.
Immediately the high priests of climate and end-of-world theoreticians immediately seized upon the bad weather and linked it to man-made global warming and human environmental sins. And again they are calling for human sacrifices to be made at the alter in a bid to appease the angry gods.
UN IPCC Mojib Latif here connected the local German bad weather directly to man and “climate altering Greenhouse gases”.
For me the weather of the last few days was another piece of the puzzle: Climate change and its impacts are becoming increasingly detectable. Germany is feeling the impact of global warming. There are increasingly more hot days with temperatures far above 30°C. And also the phases of heavy precipitation are rising. This is precisely what the models for the case of increased atmospheric greenhouse gases have been predicting.”
Unfortunately, Latif neglected reading even his own IPCC report, which dismisses the link of bad weather to greenhouse gases. At the end Latif says that the international community must act quickly to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.
At Sciblogs here, not even ultra-alarmist and AGW-dogmatist Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) is ready to go as far out on a limb as Latif. Rahmstorf writes that more frequent severe thunderstorms as a consequence of global warming is plausible, but grudgingly concedes the IPCC has no data to support it. He adds in a reader comment:

I also think it’s not appropriate to connect every weather event to climate change.”
Such weather patterns are “nothing new”

Chart right: www2.wetter3.de.gif
Veteran German meteorologist Klaus Eckart Puls of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) dismisses a linkage to man-made CO2. In an e-mail response to my inquiry he writes that such an idea only comes from people who either know little about the weather statistics before 150 years ago, or people who are attempting to misuse seldomly seen weather patterns for political climate-alarmism purposes.
The weather service archives show: Such weather patterns have occurred and do occur in June over Europe time and again – fortunately not every day. Why? First of all we are now at the time of the year where the sun is at a peak and so we have about 15 hours of sunshine in Central Europe with clear to almost clear skies. So was the case in the days leading up to June 9, 2014. As a result the air over Central Europe heated up day after day. Moreover a stalled low pressure system positioned for days over the Bay of Biscay with a trough extending deep to the south pumped hot air from North Africa and into Central Europe. As the hot air swept over the Bay of Biscay, it picked up a lot of humidity and led to the formation of a strong weather front, which in turn spawned extremely powerful thunderstorms. What happened on June 9 meteorologoically was nothing new, but it’s fortunately seldom.”
Puls reminds us that “even the alarmist-leaning UN IPCC finds no trends to more extreme weather. Not only in its earlier reports, but also in its latest 2013 report.”
For readers who do not know, Mojib Latif is Germany’s version of David Viner. He too also predicted that winters with snow and ice would soon be a thing of the past.

"Like Henry Ford before him, Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk is taking a new approach to car making. Where Ford focused on manufacturing a car that the mass market could afford, Musk is keen to build a vehicle that the environment can bear. Much has been made of the use of solar power at what is to become the largest factory in the world, the Tesla Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada, which will produce battery packs for cars and other applications. The “end-to-end” vision of using renewable energy sources to generate electricity for product manufacture and use is compelling, and one that has been forcefully made by Elon Musk. At an estimated cost of $5 billion (including $1.3 billion in tax incentives) and with factory floor-space intended to grow to some 1.2m square metres by 2020, on four square kilometres of land, it is a monumental project. Look beyond the hype, however, and there are major environmental questions that need to be answered, as the rhetoric and reality of green production are very different. Just look at the embodied energy of the factory alone, that is the energy required to create and maintain it. It takes substantial sunk energy costs and carbon emissions to build the solar panels, and all associated cables, that will power the Gigafactory, and to make and transport the concrete, steel, glass, plastic and other materials needed to create more than a million square metres of factory floor space.  Some studies of office buildings have suggested embodied energy can be as much as 30 times the annual operational energy use. For Tesla’s factory, the use of zero-carbon energy during production makes the energy cost of construction even more significant. For example, cement – more than 60,000 cubic yards of concrete were poured to form the base of the factory – has embodied energy of 4.5 megajoules per kilogram, and an embodied carbon value of 0.73 kilograms of carbon dioxide/kg.  Some 70% of solar panel lifecycle carbon emissions also occur in manufacturing, with a typical total figure of 40g in CO2 emissions per kWh. This means that upward of 50% of the lifecycle carbon emissions associated with the Gigafactory could occur just in building the plant. There will also be additional energy running costs due to the factory being located in the Nevada desert. Significant power will be needed for air conditioning, to keep the 6,500 workers in a healthy ambience, in addition to the usual lighting, heating and powering of production equipment. Is this the best use of available solar power? The issue is simple: renewable does not mean infinite. Many electric vehicles of are of dubious efficiency, and the carbon emissions benefits of each car depend crucially upon the means by which the electricity used to power the car is generated. Even then, compared with an efficient diesel or petrol car, the net reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions is likely to be only in the region of 25-30% – given their promotion as the eco-friendly car, some might expect this figure to be much higher. There are other environmental burdens, too: solar panels are traditionally produced using large quantities of materials such as copper, silver, lithium, and rare earths such as tellurium, or indium for which there are scarcity concerns and very large environmental burdens during extraction and refining including significant human toxicity. In addition, manufacturing processes for panels may involve caustic chemicals such as sodium hydroxide and hydrofluoric acid, for which recycling options are currently limited. The desert Gigafactory is also in a region of the US with recurrent concerns over long-term water supply. Debate over water concerns around Reno was heated even before the announcement of the Gigafactory, and the direct use of water by the plant has undoubtedly added to this. It is expected that the majority of the water used will be captured, if necessary treated, and then returned to the water supply system. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that the facility will need up to 3m cubic metres of water by the time it reaches maturity. Moreover, all those workers, a substantial number of which may be recruited from outside the immediate area, along with their families, will add to the indirect water consumption burden. At an average US household size of 2.8 persons, the factory could see an influx of a further 18,200 people into the Reno area. At an average local consumption rate of 741 cubic metres of water per household per annum, that means a potential additional demand of just over 4m cubic metres per annum in total – more than the factory itself. Tesla certainly is taking a commendable step in the right direction to make its plant as eco-friendly as possible, but there is still room for development. However, where one leads others can and will follow, and the future of manufacturing can only get greener. That has to be good news."
"In December 1973, when the Opec countries cut back supplies of oil to the west, the UK and the US introduced a maximum national speed limit of 50mph on all roads in order to reduce petrol consumption (Netherlands lowers speed limit to comply with pollution court ruling, 14 November). This remained in force until March to May 1974. Maximum speed restrictions, aimed at reducing energy consumption, were again introduced from December 1974 through to May 1977. When the speed of a petrol-engined car is reduced from 70mph to its optimal speed of 55mph to 60mph, its petrol consumption falls by some 17%. Given that demand for road transport fuels is around 44m litres of petrol and a little over 81m litres of diesel per day, that brings petrol consumption down by 7.5m litres and diesel by 13.75m litres per day. The 1970s restrictions were introduced to save energy. But they also brought down pollution and carbon emissions: every litre of petrol consumed produces 2.3kg of carbon dioxide (diesel produces 2.68kg).  In 2016, road transport contributed nearly 21% of the EU’s total emissions of carbon dioxide. There is an urgent need to cut greenhouse gases. The government could bring down emissions rapidly by reintroducing maximum speed restrictions – while we wait for petrol and diesel-engined vehicles to be phased out altogether. The adoption of electric cars could be incentivised, perhaps by exempting them from such speed restrictions.David WalkerSheffield • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago Austrian social critic and rap musician Kilez More produced and posted a climate science skeptic video. I reported on this awhile back, see here and here. The video also has English subtitles to help get the overall message across internationally.

The video, watched mainly by young people, has surpassed the 100,000 views milestone. Congratulations to a musician who is surely reaping lots of scorn for getting young people to question what they are told.
What follows is a short interview with Kilez on the video’s success so far:
How do you feel about the video getting over 100,000 views so far?
I’m glad to see the video climbing over the 100,000 views mark – and it shows, that there is a need for a critical point of view on this topic! It’s still one of the most viewed (and of course most discussed) videos of mine.

Have you gotten a lot of criticism or any threats because of the video?
Indeed the video has brought me a lot of criticism. Some bad articles have been written, some nasty insults have been made, some artists even refused to work with me because of that. Really unbelievable how the massive propaganda works on people’s mind – and especially with this topic the mass media does its best to manipulate the thinking. It’s just too important for too many things – like lots of taxes, many many laws, etc. – to let it go. 
But the reactions were not just bad. Also a lot of listeners have been open to the argumentation, starting to dig right through the mass of information. So the video is doing its job! That’s what I want to reach with my music – to get people to start thinking by themselves and searching for information on their own – not through the filtered television-screen in their living rooms.
Do you feel there are attempts being made to marginalize you?
There have been some attempts to marginalize me – and even today. But it’s not only because of the climate-change music video that has been a part of the whole story. A political rapper has his difficulties because the media either first try to black-out my music or insult me and try to marginalize me before they get to the topics. It’s always the same story – try to discredit the speaker to prevent people from listening to the message.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German media are reporting on the massive snowfall hitting Buffalo and parts of New York state, describing the “lake effect” and an “early start of winter”.
Also meteorologist Christian Herold of Germany’s DWD Weather Service writes here how the story begins with the “remains of super-typhoon” Nuri, which developed into a low over Alaska’s Aleutian Islands a week ago and pumped massive amounts of tropical air into the Arctic. This led to an “unusual” air current pattern, with a large high parked over the west coast also pumping warm air into the Arctic. At the same time a powerful low developed over the central and eastern USA and pumped a huge blast of Arctic air deep into the United States.
“Never so cold, so early”
The result, Herold writes, was “a powerful cold wave over a large part of the United States which was as much as 9°C below normal for this time of the year. In some regions it was never so cold so early.”
Natural phenomenon, even occurs in Germany
Herold then describes the Buffalo “lake effect”, how the Arctic cold air mass swept across a relatively warm Lake Erie and picked up huge quantities of moisture and dumping it as snow over New York.  To his their credit, Herold resists the urge to connect it to climate change.
The DWD meteorologist explains that the “lake effect” is a natural phenomenon that is also possible in Germany, but a smaller scale, especially near lake Constance, recalling an episode there in February 2013. It also happens near the Baltic Sea.
Moreover, the DWD warns that thanks to this year’s warmer temperatures over Germany and the relatively warm lakes:
…this winter, thanks to the generally warm water temperatures, we will surely hear about this effect once or more. Something we can look forward to with some excitement.”

"Hundreds of protesters joined the celebrity activist Jane Fonda in Washington DC for her fifth Friday urging radical change to fight the climate crisis. In front of the US Capitol, Fonda spoke of the “urgency of the climate crisis and need for activism on an unprecedented scale”.  “We cannot leave it to young people to fight this fight for their future by themselves,” Fonda said. Donning her signature vivid red coat – which she says will be the last she will ever buy, in an effort to be more sustainable – she swayed and sang protest songs while embracing an anti-war activist, Jodie Evans, the co-founder of Code Pink. Fonda, 81, has been leading protests at her “Fire Drill Fridays” for more than a month, and she has been arrested four times. Her climate action has followed the work of youth protesters around the world who have been striking from school on Fridays, including the 16-year-old Swedish climate advocate Greta Thunberg. Fonda had not been arrested as of 3pm ET on Friday, but she is scheduled to appear in court over previous arrests later this month. This week’s protest theme was about how the war and military contribute to the climate crisis. The US military is one of the biggest emitters of carbon in the world. “I started in the streets with Jane in 1970, 49 years ago. And I’ve never ever seen her lose her passion or energy. Nobody works like Jane. She does put her body on the line and she is not afraid to be uncomfortable,” Evans said. Fonda is a longtime political activist with roots opposing the Vietnam war. She gained the nickname “Hanoi Jane” in the 1970s when she was photographed atop a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun on a visit to Hanoi. A conservative counter-protester, walking alone alongside those who marched with Fonda to the White House, shouted “four more years, Hanoi Jane,” at the group. A large contingent of activists urging the impeachment of Donald Trump also joined the march, as did veterans of the Vietnam war. Surreal moment as protestors supporting DACA dreamers cross paths with the #FireDrillFriday #climate march (merged with the impeach Trump march) and cheer each other on. Sign of the times for political activism in America. pic.twitter.com/vWlmZNPHck At one streetcorner, the Fonda protest encountered a separate group marching in support of undocumented migrants who arrived in the US as children, known as Dreamers. The two crowds sang each others’ chants. Fonda’s protest attracted teenagers and seniors alike. Two first-year college students said they had been introduced to Fonda through her Netflix show, Grace and Frankie, and were drawn to her climate message. “When you read climate studies and see Greta Thunberg and all of these other young activists at work, and then you see someone older also making an effort to try to do something about climate change, it just kind of compels you. You need to be there. You need to have your voice heard,” said one of the students, TJ Boland. But many of the protesters were at the march for more than the climate. They expressed frustration with a system of governance that they see as exploiting the poor and people of color in order to benefit the wealthy and corporations at the expense of the environment. Julie Heffernan and Anne Landsman, two friends in their early 60s, traveled from New York City for the protest. “I’ve been very angry ever since Trump was elected about the fact that we have somebody who is lacking in every quality that I consider as important for a leader, starting off with just basic decency. He’s a misogynist, he’s a racist, he is just everything I despise,” said Landsman, who came to the US from South Africa during apartheid. “The thought that I’d emigrated and moved to a country that I thought was some bastion of decency and just see it just take this dive down has been incredibly upsetting.” Ruth Zalph, 89, who traveled from North Carolina, was protesting against the climate crisis and militarism. She said if money was spent on the “military industrial complex”, it could not be spent on ending poverty and fighting rising temperatures. “I have a great-granddaughter who is six months old, and I’d like to see her grow up in a safe world where people are not having to fight for water and food,” Zalph said at the beginning of a roughly two-mile march to the White House."
"The Conservatives have announced their manifesto will include a pledge to cap the price of energy bills. This comes just two years after Labour campaigned to freeze household energy prices The Tories are yet to flesh out the details of their plan, but it has already drawn strong reactions both for and against. The price of energy stirs deep emotions in part because it is a necessity, one which absorbs a much higher proportion of the income of those in poverty and “just about managing” than of richer households.  But there are two other important features: the first is that electricity and gas are essentially the same whoever supplies it (with a few exceptions for renewable generation or billing services). The second is that many people are paying more than they need to. Around 70% of British households are on the default “standard variable tariff” even though, thanks to competition between energy firms, cheaper prices are available to those willing to switch suppliers.  This raises the question of whether we should worry if people simply don’t take advantage of these deals. After all, what counts as “fair” in the energy market? Is it about equal access to the best offers, or whether we end up paying the same price? Some people may find the process difficult, for example because they have built up debt which they need to repay, or because they don’t use the internet, or find bill comparisons challenging. These people are missing out on the best deals. Most people don’t face such barriers, however – they’re held back by a lack of information, or put off by the time and effort it takes to switch supplier.  The problem is that a competitive market keeps the energy firms on their toes. When customers can easily choose the best deals, suppliers will compete to offer lower prices and new services. If people don’t switch, these firms have less incentive to innovate. An effective price cap would lower the highest prices, but it would also limit the “headroom” for new firms to undercut prices. So while a cap can lower the price for some consumers, it may reduce competition.  Relative price caps, which tie one set of prices to another, are particularly likely to damage competition. We saw this effect when the energy regulator introduced non discrimination clauses between different regions in 2009, which was followed by softer competition between the companies, higher profits – and higher prices. Regulating prices is a good plan if the aim is to ensure fairness ahead of lower average prices. But such a move is likely to sacrifice the benefits of a dynamic energy market, and higher average prices will be felt most keenly by low income households who already spend a much higher proportion of their incomes on energy.   Smart meters, set to be rolled out at considerable cost over the next few years, are intended to help lower bills as people will realise how much energy they’re using – and when. But the benefits depend on people actually acting on this information.  Protecting consumers from making decisions about the energy market now may mean we are all rather lazier about engaging with opportunities in the future. The government could of course go even further than a cap and simply give everyone free energy at the “meter”, or some form of free energy allowance paid for by taxation. But this might encourage people to use more energy, which would harm the environment. And is energy any more essential than housing, food or water, none of which are provided by the state for free? There may be a better way to ensure fairness while also retaining the benefits of competition: hold an auction to supply the “sticky” customers. That refers to the 55% of energy buyers who have been on the more expensive tariffs for at least three years. In a recent investigation into the energy market, the Competition and Markets Authority recommended that suppliers should give the details of those customers to the regulator, who might then make the contact details available to competing suppliers. Instead of encouraging competitors to approach these customers individually, they could be invited to make a better offer to them as a group.  There are many challenges to designing such an “opt-out” auction, but it has the benefit of providing a potentially better deal for the “disengaged” while harnessing the true power of competition. While auctions provide competition for the market itself rather than acting as a competitor within the market, they still give firms an incentive to provide the best offer. In doing so, auctions are less damaging to competition than most forms of price cap, and certainly less damaging than a price freeze."
"A coalition of former fire chiefs have said the government “fundamentally doesn’t like talking about climate change” and that politics is the reason the government was ignoring their advice.  Former heads of the New South Wales, Queensland, Victorian and Tasmanian fire services met in Sydney on Thursday after fires that killed four people tore through the the Australian east coast this week.  They said the climate crisis was making bushfires deadlier and bushfire season longer, and the federal government needed to act immediately. “Just a 1C temperature rise has meant the extremes are far more extreme, and it is placing lives at risk, including firefighters,” said Greg Mullins, the former chief of NSW Fire and Rescue. “Climate change has supercharged the bushfire problem.” “Bushfires are a symptom of climate change,” said Neil Bibby, the former chief executive of Victoria’s Country Fire Authority. “Firefighters are the immune system that gets rid of that symptom. But [the problem is] still there.” Mullins said he and 23 other fire and emergency chiefs had been trying to have a meeting with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, since April because they “knew that a bushfire crisis was coming”. Instead, he said current fire chiefs had been locked out of discussions and were “not allowed” to mention climate change. “This government fundamentally doesn’t like talking about climate change,” Mullins said. “We would like the doors to be open to the current chiefs, and allow them to utter the words ‘climate change’. They are not allowed to at the moment. “The Grenfell fire in London, people talked about the cause from day one. Train crashes they talk from day one. And it is OK to say it is an arsonist’s fault, or pretend that the greenies are stopping hazard reduction burning, which is simply not true. “But you are not allowed to talk about climate change. Well, we are, because we know what is happening.” Bibby, who was in charge during Victoria’s Black Saturday, said politics was the reason the government was ignoring the former fire chiefs’ advice. Other interstate fire chiefs were outspoken about the effect global heating has on bushfires. Lee Johnson, the former commissioner of Queensland Fire and Emergency Services wanted immediate action. “I’m here for my children and grandchildren,” he said. “In Queensland in the last couple of weeks we have seen unprecedented fires.”  Bob Conroy, former fire manager of NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, said: “The fires are impacting on areas that haven’t known fires for millennia.” Mullins said the bushfire emergency was underlaid by a climate emergency. “On the 6th of September, southeast Queensland and NSW experienced record fire weather, never before experienced in September. On the 8th of November, again we had record-breaking fire weather in NSW. “And on the 12th of November, for the first time ever, Sydney experienced catastrophic fire danger. Fires are literally off the scale on this warming planet.” The link between climate change and bushfire risk became a political flashpoint this week. On Monday the Nationals leader and deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said it galled him when “inner-city lefties” raised climate change in relation to bushfires. “We’ve had fires in Australia since time began, and what people need now is a little bit of sympathy, understanding and real assistance – they need help, they need shelter,” he told ABC Radio. “They don’t need the ravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital city greenies at this time, when they’re trying to save their homes, when in fact they’re going out in many cases saving other peoples’ homes and leaving their own homes at risk.” The NSW Nationals leader, John Barilaro, said it was “a disgrace” for anyone to talk about climate change during the bushfires. But on Wednesday the Liberal MP and NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, said climate change “is a real issue” and “requires a decisive response”. He said science was clear that “our changing climate is seeing more extreme weather events”. In an escalating political debate, Greens senator Jordon Steele-John branded major party politicians “arsonists” for supporting the coal industry. “You are no better than a bunch of arsonists – borderline arsonists – and you should be ashamed,” he told the Senate. The former fire chiefs had two requests for the government: more resources for firefighters; take on “the fundamental problem” of climate change. Mullins said he was told the energy minister, Angus Taylor, would speak to him and the water minister, David Littleproud, has set a meeting. “None of us can understand why climate change in Australia is so political,” he said. “In the UK, the conservatives, Margaret Thatcher, said years ago this is a major problem.”"
"Up on the New South Wales mid-north coast, we don’t have many inner-city greenies. What we do have is a community that’s battling the worst fire conditions we’ve ever seen, and looking down the barrel of what might be the hardest week we’ve had to face.As our magnificent fire service works hard to contain the blazes threatening local lives and properties, it is galling to hear the deputy prime minister condemning anyone who draws the link between bushfires and climate change. Frankly, he’s pretty out of touch with how many people in my community are feeling right now. We’re in the middle of an unprecedented dry spell, with river levels sitting at the lowest they’ve ever been. This is not normally a dry area – the hotter, drier conditions that are driving the current catastrophic fire conditions have developed over the last 10 to 15 years. And the science tells us that it’s climate change causing it.To leave climate change out of this conversation is a betrayal of the regional communities that are threatened by these fires. How can we address the very real and growing threat to our safety while ignoring one of the major causes of unprecedented fire conditions?MidCoast Council, along with many other rural and regional councils, recently declared a climate emergency. We are not out of touch city dwellers, or politicians looking to score a strike against our opponents. We are a community that has recognised that addressing climate change is one of the most important ways in which we can keep our residents safe. The future out-of-control fires we feared are already here – this is our “new normal”, and the science tells us it’s only going to get worse unless urgent action is taken on climate change.As my community stands shoulder to shoulder to protect our homes and our bushland this week, I call on our state and federal leaders to put political point-scoring to one side and focus on what needs to be done to support us. And that includes acknowledging that climate change is fuelling the conditions for catastrophic fires, and that we need a new approach to respond to this increased threat. Claire Pontin is the deputy mayor of the MidCoast Council, NSW Bushfires usually aren’t a problem for us in Bellingen on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. However, in the past few months I’ve watched the massive fires on our escarpment grow and the blanket of smoke engulfing our towns thicken. As the mayor of Bellingen, I’m deeply concerned. Despite what Michael McCormack might think, it’s not just those in the inner city who are worried about climate change and bushfires – those of us in regional Australia living through an unprecedented fire season, which has already claimed several lives and many properties, are very worried about what’s in store this week, and over the coming summer. We’ve never seen conditions like this before. Drought and unseasonal heat driven by climate change are creating conditions for fires in forests that have never burned before, including in our forests of Antarctic beech. It’s no longer enough for our communities to be bushfire prepared. We urgently need to address the root cause of the heightened fire threat – climate change. As I write this, more and more communities in NSW are facing catastrophic fire conditions. And while our overworked and under-resourced emergency service teams are doing their best to keep our families and communities safe, ultimately, Australia is not prepared for a year-round bushfire season. We need to talk about climate change and bushfires together. To leave our rapidly changing climate out of the fire conversation is like talking about a car crash without mentioning speeding. Instead of burying their heads in the sand, governments at all levels must commit to meaningful action to drive down Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. We also need appropriate funding for councils and emergency services to do what we must to keep Australians as safe as possible. This increased bushfire threat cannot be faced alone, and as we head into what may be one of the toughest weeks for Australian communities on record, we need our leaders to acknowledge that a new approach is needed. The future of communities such as ours depends on it. Dominic King is the mayor of Bellingen"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe NOAA recently declared several months of this year as being the hottest on record, standing out in stark contrast to other datasets and observed reality.
The NOAA claims seem to be so odd that it has become the target of heavy criticism and ridicule (see here, here, here and here), especially with the backdrop of the cold winters the northern hemisphere has recently experienced and the growing global sea ice levels.
The latest condemnation comes from senior meteorologist Joe Bastardi at his latest Saturday Summary, where he called the seemingly rogue institute a “fox guarding the henhouse“. To back up his claim Bastardi presents charts contradicting the NOAA’s Orwellian hottest August claim. According to the veteran meteorologist other datasets such as UAH and NCEP (under +0.20°C) disagree with the NOAA’s outlier figure of +0.75°C.
Bastardi believes the NOAA is no longer a credible source: “I don’t believe it anymore.” To explain why he thinks the NOAA is fudging a heat record, Bastardi shows the following NCEP chart:

He asks how can 0.165°C be the warmest ever when other months in the past, like May 1998, were far warmer?

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Probably his most compelling piece of evidence pointing to NOAA deception is the next NCEP chart, which depicts a global cooling taking place over the last years, with the current year among the coolest:

Bastardi, no longer able to hold back his laughter at the NOAA’s claim, asks how the NOAA could possibly say 2014 is the hottest when NCEP uses NOAA data? Looking at ocean cycles, Bastardi believes the planet will see cooler conditions like those in the 1970s by 2030.
NOAA claim “seems to be an outlier”
Dr. Roy Spencer here is less harsh with his assessment of the NOAA’s claim, writing that “the ‘record warm’ SST month of August, 2014 seems to be an outlier, with the SSTs being too warm (or the tropospheric temperatures too cool) compared to the usual behavior”.
For the general citizen observer, if August has set a record at anything, it’s probably the discrepancy magnitude between the NOAA claims and reality itself. With a “record hot planet” sea ice does not grow. Right now, especially at the South Pole, the sea ice is telling us a whole different story. Sea ice doesn’t lie.

"In 1900, just 15% of the world’s population lived in cities. Now that proportion is over 50%, which is a lot of people. In fact, it means around 4 billion human beings rely on urban infrastructure to keep them warm, mobile and clean. Technology helps with this of course. Digital sensors, smart phones and smart home appliances allow for a new kind of understanding between citizens and city officials. In this so-called “smart city”, information and communication technologies (ICT) and the internet of things (IoT) are used to enhance city living. Smart cities are a major part of achieving the goal set by the United Nations of making urban environments “inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. Water infrastructure is often overlooked when smart cities are considered or discussed. This seems strange when water services are so crucial for human health and well-being. But water is often seen as an “invisible utility” which is taken for granted. The industry has also been slow to harness the power of new technology.  One thing is certain though – water should be a key element of the smart city concept. And there are two major ways in which smart water technologies will be coming soon to a city near you. Smart meters are already widely used to manage demand in domestic energy. But there is also solid evidence that the same kind of meters could dramatically curb domestic water use. The uptake of domestic metering by the water industry lags behind the energy sector, but this is changing. Water companies in the UK are facing restrictions in availability and increases in demand.  Thames Water for example, Britain’s biggest water company, would face a supply shortfall of 133m litres per day by 2020 (enough water to supply the city of Liverpool for 24 hours) or even 414m litres per day by 2040 (enough for Newcastle, Sheffield and Liverpool together), if the trend for increased demand continues.  As a result they have embarked on a smart metering installation programme that will see 414,000 smart water meters installed in London by 2020. By 2025 they will be dealing with 35 billion hourly meter reads every year. Extracting useful information on water consumption from such vast amounts of data is not easy. One system, iWIDGET aims to analyse usage patterns of individual households. It then presents results, comparisons and feedback, providing households with information about their water consumption. It offers highly customised suggestions on how to reduce use and get better value for money.    Nobody likes to be caught in a flood – especially not a flood from a sewer. Reliable information about the likelihood, the extent and the location of such flooding in a city, is very valuable, but current detection methods can be slow and expensive. Our research demonstrated the use of an alternative approach, RAPIDS (Radar Pluvial flooding Identification for Drainage System), which instead of detecting, actually predicts flooding in sewer systems. It uses computer models to assess very large networks in real-time, and raise alarm of sewer flooding. Results of that work, which was applied to three areas of the UK, shows much higher accuracy in predicting flooding.  Smart sensors, artificial intelligence, big data analytics and cloud computing are finally becoming involved in managing water systems in cities. This is partly due to the emergence of new water industry leaders trained in hydroinformatics – mixing big data with smart technologies to deliver more sustainable water solutions. A new discipline, one of its goals is to empower citizens to engage with water service provision on an individual level.  But to keep the taps running, the hydroinformaticians will need help. A new breed of specialist engineers and scientists is required to work across traditionally separate disciplines and manage the world’s water supply. By 2045, an estimated 6 billion people will be living in cities. That means an enormous amount of showers flowing, toilets flushing, and sinks being filled. So in the meantime, we, and water systems, need to get even smarter."

Yet, thankfully, the big eruption many feared never materialized and signs show that the pressure has been subsiding. Good news, many among us may think.

Yet science journalist and geologist Axel Bojanowski at Spiegel warns that there’s still enough to worry about. According to Bojanowski concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) have “never been higher since measurements began in the 1970s“. The amount of SO2 emitted by the recent volcanic activity is surpassed only by the “largest of eruptions”.
What’s more, Bojanowski adds:
Seldom does so much sulfur gas get into the air. It could even cool the climate.”

Photo number 12 of Spiegel’s spectacular photo series here is a NASA computer model simulation depicting the spread of the sulfur dioxide cloud over Europe. The growing concentration of sulfur dioxide is a reason for “more concern”, Spiegel reports. High concentrations of sulfur dioxide in the air are corrosive and pose a threat to human health. Bojanowski writes:
Gradually it is posing an additional threat: to the climate. The emitted amounts of gas have already reached historic dimensions, reports the country’s environmental authority, the Icelandic Environmental Agency. Daily up to 60,000 tonnes of SO2 are released from the lava chasm.”
Bárdarbunga has already emitted approximately two million tonnes of SO2. Only the largest eruptions surpass this amount.”
Bojanowski adds that although the SO2 haze in the atmosphere is not visible to the naked eye, it is seen by NASA satellite, and it extends over parts of Europe. SO2 is an effective sunblock that acts to cool the atmosphere. Spiegel also describes the Laki eruption of 1783 and 1784, which led to a marked cooling and European crop failures.
According to Spiegel, Bárdarbunga eruption and gas emission is nowhere near on the same scale as Laki, which spewed 122 million tons of SO2 into the atmosphere. But Spiegel compares Bárdarbunga’s 2 million tons of SO2 to other major 20th century volcanic eruptions: El Chichon (7 million), which was enough to cause cooling globally. Pinatubo spewed 20 million tons and cooled the planet by 0.5°C for two years.
Though Bárdarbunga’s SO2 so far has not been shot up into the stratosphere, Spiegel warns that “two factors could make the volcano’s impact detectable: At high latitudes such as those of Iceland, the stratosphere is several kilometers lower than in the tropics, thus allowing the gas to reach it more quickly. Also chasm eruptions such as those at Bárdarbunga produce hot air upward currents over the volcano, which can carry the gases up to the stratosphere.”
Note that the SO2 gas has been carried in the air over to the European continent. Though Bárdarbunga’s SO2 may not have any real impact on cooling the planet, it certainly will not help to warm it either.

"Suburban London is filled with greenery and lush growth; record crop harvests appear possible across Europe, and nothing too scary has been reported on the UK plant health risk register for some time either – so why the doom and gloom about plants? The bleak picture began with a recent report from the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew on the state of the world’s plants. An accompanying newspaper article went further, saying that botany in the UK was dead. Plants, apparently, are uncool. Looking back over a long career working with plants, I tried to remember when students flocked to study botany. Not only could I not recall those halcyon days, but I started to consider the demise of botany and the general pessimism about plant science. The annual Chelsea Flower Show had over 150,000 paying visitors this year, organised as ever by the Royal Horticultural Society, whose own membership nudges half a million. The horticultural industry is worth over £9 billion and employs over 37,000 people. All appears rosy on the garden front. Of course, there is much more to botany than just horticulture; step back into academia and there is no doubt that the study of plants has declined, as students have instead flocked to molecular biology and biotechnology. But botany was never a cool subject, even when prospective students had lots of courses to choose from. My honours class in the 1970s had a mere fraction of those studying zoology. Plant taxonomy was the least popular course. The module on identifying plants, species by family, was notable for its sheer tedium, however worthy and necessary these skills are to maintaining life on earth. The main beef of those lamenting the decline of botany is not that people don’t love plants or value them, but that we’re losing taxonomists. I have some sympathy for this point of view. Without a sound knowledge of plant species and their inter-relationships, we undermine the fundamentals of all living ecosystems. Plants are the bedrock of existence, as many authors have eloquently explored, and we need people to study them. Yet the lack of botany courses in UK universities hasn’t stopped new generations of botanists appearing, keen on taxonomy and skilled in plant identification. Trainspotting of sorts is in our genes. So in what new ways can budding botanists emerge? The decline of botany has been matched if not outstripped by a burgeoning of studies in ecology, biodiversity and all things environmental. I suspect that there are significant numbers of botanists in ecologist garb: the head of Kew’s science directorate is a plant ecologist, for example. Nor is plant taxonomy dead. The RHS has a head of horticultural taxonomy (paid for with private money) and it is clear that global initiatives to map plant diversity such as Species 2000 – which aims to create “a uniform and validated index to the world’s known (plant) species” – continue to thrive. Taxonomists in all areas of biology agonise a lot about terminal decline. The evidence doesn’t always support this bleak view, however. More importantly, the plant debate seems to ignore agriculture. The Kew report sees agriculture as a harmful practice, threatening natural resources, destroying wild habitats and so on. But not everyone grows oil palms, and it is hardly helpful to suggest that there are good and bad plants in assessing the state of research. There are billions of people who grow plants for their livelihoods, so it’s important to look more closely at how botanists view agriculture. Wild relatives of crop plants are as critically endangered as those with more appealing flowers and attractive foliage. Yet it will come as no surprise that the taxonomy of orchids is better known than that of bamboos. Or that in situ conservation of teosinte, a wild relative of maize, is infinitely more challenging than setting up seed banks. Kew’s interest in economically important plants has stuttered over the years. Visitors will struggle to find anything about agriculture when planning their itinerary, although plant scientists behind the scenes continue to study some key groups, such as palms.  Beyond the taxonomy debate, there is a wider concern for the teaching of whole plant biology. Again, I share this worry, although the scope of the concern seems unduly narrow. Despite the rise of molecular biology and genetics, there are still many countries where botany or plant science courses still exist. Want to study taxonomy? Go to Eastern Europe, Brazil, or the US, where plant sciences continue to thrive. People come to plants from many directions. The Brackenhurst Botanical Garden in Kenya was brought back to life by a zoologist who is a more passionate botanist than I ever was. The study of plants has been reinvented and, as scientists, we should take a more rounded view of where plants grow and who grows them. Who knows, maybe botany will one day become cool after all."
"I’m not sure if you had the pleasure of hearing our deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, on the wireless before 8am on Monday decrying the ravings of people he categorised as “pure, enlightened and woke capital-city greenies”. These would be the people daring to link catastrophic bushfires and climate change. In case you missed this sequence, our Michael rose, ate the sensible man’s breakfast presumably, and then fell into a passion in an ABC radio studio. The leader of the Nationals noted that sure, the onset of the fire season this year was “a tad early”, but we’d had fires in Australia “since time began”. He felt people battling a state of emergency needed help and shelter, not “ravings” or political point-scoring from Richard Di Natale and Adam Bandt.  The host of ABC Radio National Breakfast, Hamish Macdonald, then pointed out it wasn’t just Di Natale and Bandt discussing the documented link between climate change and wildfires – it was Carol Sparks, the mayor of Glen Innes, who stitched drought, climate change and fires together after her northern New South Wales town battled a wall of flame at the weekend that killed two locals. Bah. Old news, the Nationals leader offered. “We know it’s getting drier, we know it’s getting ... er, you know, situations in parts are getting very warm,” McCormack said, before indicating the government was taking sensible action on climate change – which was the kind of action that didn’t inconvenience anyone, and particularly not the coal industry. The deputy prime minister also thought Bandt, the bloke he kept name-checking, and those climate protestors in Melbourne, were getting “way too much publicity; they crave for that, they yearn for that”. These people, he asserted, were “inner-city raving lunatics”. There was an election in May, and the raving lunatics lost, so rather than just persisting there post-defeat, occupying 48.5% of the public space, losers should just shut up and let the non-ravers get on with putting the fires out. Because when you lose an election, all alternative policies, ideas and insights, whether informed by evidence or not, are cancelled – a new take on democracy for sure, but Michael is up for that kind of thing. Fresh thinking. Innovation. Given our deputy prime minister is currently less than calm – either because he’s under pressure and identifying an enemy and picking a fight with them creates a pleasing distraction, or because he believes his intermittently coherent “I’m OK and the rest of you are weirdos” sermonising is a political masterstroke – it is probably best that the rest of us remain perfectly tranquil. Let me say this next bit very clearly. The best way to decline Michael’s now rolling invitation to be tribal is to respond with reason, not with emotion. With that basic objective in mind a couple of things can be noted. Dear Michael. It is possible to do more than one thing at once. Perhaps multitasking has never been a particular strength of the deputy prime minister’s, and that’s fine, because juggling is certainly not for everyone, but I’ll venture it is possible for emergency services to extinguish fires and for politicians and various experts to speak informatively about the underlying causes of fires so catastrophic that they have been designated a state of emergency in the middle of November, not in mid-to-late summer. I reckon those things can happen simultaneously – both the analysing and the doing – without anything terrible happening or without anything fundamental being compromised. I think we are that clever. Truly, I do. To nominate just one example of how to do this, Richard Thornton, the chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, did this very successfully on Monday. He was asked whether now was an appropriate time to talk about climate change. Thornton said: “It’s always a good time to have a conversation around … what the impacts of climate change are going to be.” He said it was too early to say definitively these particular fires were the result of climate change, but “what we are seeing, and what we do know, is fire seasons are starting earlier”. “We know that cumulatively over the length of the fire season, there is a higher amount of fire danger during those times, so we’ve got a 1C increase in temperature over the long-term averages. All of the normal variations that we see between good years and bad years, now sits on top of an extra 1C in temperature – and that drives our fire weather that we see.” Another couple of things can be noted. The record of all governments, policy wise, is a relevant consideration. Not just some days, between the hours of 9 and 5, Tuesday to Thursday. But all days, at all hours. It’s not the only thing to talk about in the middle of an emergency, but it shouldn’t be off limits either. Bushfires don’t cancel accountability. Last thing. People worried about climate change, and the Coalition’s lack of policy action in this country, and the lack of action globally on the part of the big emitters, and the cumulative, potentially catastrophic consequences of that lack of action for human existence are not confined to an inner-city cabal. While the Coalition really wants climate change to be a story where an apocalyptic, sneering inner-city cabal is pitted against the sensible ones in just enough electorates to maintain Scott Morrison’s continued occupation of the prime ministership – the reality eclipses the graphic novel. People are worried about their future in the cities and in the region. Farmers hand-feeding their stock in a crippling drought are worried about climate change. People currently preparing their fire plans, and fleeing the flames, are also worried about climate change. Just to be clear. Worrying about climate change, worrying about whether enough is being done, worrying enough to try and do something, is not a manifestation of lunacy. Lunacy is not worrying about it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you’re wondering about the long-term future of the climate doomsday scare, what follows is a clue.
A reader brought my attention to a 2008 paper by Horeis that completely demolished the forest die-off scare of the 1980s.

Here’s an excerpt from the abstract shown above (my emphasis), in case it’s difficult to read:
The starting point were local damages to certain tree species which scientists, journalists and politicians eagerly interpreted as a global threat to all forests. Man-made emissions were seen as the cause of the Waldsterben which was expected to thoroughly deforest the country within a few years. However, none of the apocalyptic prophecies of that time fulfilled. Seen in retrospect, Waldsterben spared the trees. It only seized the minds of the people.”
Expect the same in a couple decades time for the current global warming scare…

"As a professional firefighter, I can tell you that no one likes fighting bushfires. Bushfire fighting is hugely challenging. It’s physically and mentally demanding, with long hours and the need to respond quickly to rapidly changing conditions. At best, it’s unpleasant work. At its worst, frankly, it’s frightening. And we’ve never seen bushfire conditions like those we’re currently seeing in New South Wales and Queensland.  As hundreds of firefighters, both volunteer and paid, battle out-of-control blazes and face up to even more volatile conditions predicted, I’m worried about the toll it is taking for those on the frontline. I’ve been fighting fires for my entire professional life, and I’ve watched fire behaviour change in recent years – and the science tells us that it’s climate change that’s driving the conditions fuelling catastrophic fires. This means more intense fire seasons that start earlier, as we’ve seen play out tragically this year, and last for longer. For those of us who do this day in, day out, the stress can be hard to manage. That can only be more true for those who fight fires part-time or as volunteers. Longer, hotter fire seasons mean that there is more demand than ever on volunteer and paid firefighters, while at the same time resources to support them have been cut. The challenges facing volunteer firefighters is particularly acute. They have lives, jobs and families to support. Many of them simply can’t take five or six months out of the year to fight bushfires, but that’s increasingly what is being demanded of them. These longer, more intense fire seasons will take a huge toll on our frontline services – mentally, physically and financially. What fire services need right now is not empty praise from politicians, or thoughts and prayers. We need on-the-ground support. We need more resources and we need to recognise that volunteers should not be expected to face these enormous challenges alone. We urgently need a discussion about how volunteer labour is expected to meet the demands of longer fire seasons. And we need our national and state leaders to pull their heads out of the sand and acknowledge that climate change is creating fire conditions the likes of which we’ve never had to face. Seeing our nation’s leaders using this week, of all weeks, as an opportunity for political point scoring, and denying the link to climate change, has caused me an enormous amount of stress. To see politicians ignoring the reality of changing fire behaviour while those of us in the fire services battle blazes on the ground leaves me feeling unsupported by our leaders. I have a message for our prime minister, and any other politicians commenting on the fires this week – I don’t need your thoughts and prayers. If you want to reduce the stress on firefighters, we need less empty talk and more commitment to tackling climate change which is driving these dangerous fire conditions. • Jim Casey is a Sydney firefighter, spokesperson for the Australian Firefighters’ Climate Alliance and former Greens candidate for Grayndler"
"Of the 186 countries assessed in a recent survey of climate vulnerability, Chad was rated most in peril. A combination of high poverty, frequent conflicts, and the risk of both droughts and floods means the central African nation is bottom of the list, just below Bangladesh and some way behind Norway, the country least vulnerable to climate change. So why Chad? For a start, it is one of the poorest countries in the world. Around 87% of Chadians are classified as poor, according to the Multidimentional Poverty Index, which factors in health, education and living standards. That’s the fourth highest rate in the world. The percentage who are “destitute” (63%), the most extreme category of poverty, is also the fourth highest in the world. This is exacerbated by the fact that the country has been in civil war or conflict for 35 out of the 57 years since it gained independence from France.  Any poor or conflict-prone country will always be vulnerable, but Chad’s geography means climate change is a particular risk. Chad is bigger than many Westerners may realise. At 1.28m km² it’s larger than Nigeria and twice the size of Texas. Around 90% of its 10m people live in the southern half of the country, as most of the northern half extends well into the Sahara desert.  Most Chadians base their livelihoods on subsistence farming and livestock rearing. The semi-arid rangelands of the Sahel, in the north of the country, provide pasture for livestock during the rainy season, while the fertile agricultural fields in the south produce most of the cash and food crops. When the dry season begins, pastoralists move their herds south to feed on the leftovers of the agricultural harvest. Since the mid-20th century, temperatures in Chad have been increasing while rainfall is decreasing. Ninety percent of the country’s largest lake, Lake Chad, has disappeared over the past 50 years due to a combination of droughts and increasing withdrawals for irrigation. Climate studies project things will get increasingly hot and arid throughout the 21st century, which means lower crop yields, worse pasture, and a harder life for anyone dependent on Lake Chad. Rural areas are most at risk from climate change because that’s where most of the population, and most of the poverty, is found. However, urban areas are not safe either, as the country’s growing cities struggle to accommodate the arrival of new residents. Sanitation services like sewage, storm water drainage and waste collection are poor, according to the World Bank. In the event of floods, as happened in 2010, 2011 and 2012, the infrastructure cannot cope and untreated sewage could infect the water supply, creating a high risk of infectious diseases such as cholera. Chad’s population is mostly young, and high youth unemployment has already caused unrest in the capital N'djamena. Vulnerability to climate is made worse by civil unrest or conflict because people cannot receive the help they need during climate-related disasters such as droughts or floods. Chad also hosts some 300,000 refugees from Darfur on its eastern border with Sudan, according to UN figures, while an additional 67,000 refugees from the Central African Republic are in camps on its southern border. These refugees consume Chad’s limited resources and sometimes compete with the local population. This creates resentment and sometimes violence between the refugees and their hosts. To make matters worse, the Boko Haram crisis in northeastern Nigeria has spilled over to the Lac region of Chad, which now has more than 60,000 displaced people registered there and several thousand more that are unregistered. This is worrying as the country’s unemployed youth, restless and with plenty of time on their hands, could be at risk of recruitment and radicalisation by Boko Haram. Despite these challenges, there are ways to mitigate the effect of climate change. For instance, farmers in Chad’s semi-arid Sahelian zone have been using an indigenous rainwater harvesting technique called Zaï to successfully grow crops. Zaï involves the digging of small pits and sowing crops in them. The pits retain water for a long period of time and are particularly efficient when there isn’t much rain.  The Zaï technique was enhanced by introducing manure and compost into the pits to provide nutrients to the crops. This helped rehabilitate soils that are heavily degraded and significantly increased the yields of food crops. Agroforestry, the combining of crops and trees in the same patch of land, can also help mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Tree roots stabilise soils and protect them from eroding during heavy rainfall, while also restoring fertility simply by producing litter which eventually makes its way back into the earth. Of course, any country would be better placed to deal with climate change if it simply became much wealthier. Chad began producing petroleum in 2003, and it now accounts for 93% of all exports. However, this left the country vulnerable to declines in oil prices. So, when the price did indeed crash in late 2014, Chad suffered a significant loss of revenue. Needless to say, the impact of climate-related disasters such as droughts or floods becomes magnified if the country does not have the resources to combat them. Chad cannot rely on oil forever. Farming is still the mainstay of its economy and, in the longer term, developing sustainable agriculture and livestock farming will be key in providing employment and maintaining food security."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFormer German public television meteorologist anchorman Dr. Wolfgang Thüne has a harsh commentary on the state of climate science communication by journalism.
Photo: Dr. Wolfgang Thüne
In a nutshell Thüne claims journalism has failed in its ethical duty to inform the public on the climate issue and accepted the role of playing useful idiots and stooges on behalf of activist scientists.
Thüne begins by reminding journalists of the importance of being cautious about what they report, and “to not stand on the same the same level as the inventors and propagandists of the greenhouse effect and climate catastrophe“.
He calls on journalists to get back to more investigative journalism instead of swallowing without question everything institutionalized science feeds them.
The veteran meteorologist writes that fighting the weather and climate is a totally a futile endeavor, reminding that it is a natural chaotic phenomenon that cannot be fought by man:
A ‘global transformation’ and the creation of a ‘world government’ will do nothing to change the general circulation and weather variety of the earth.”
When it comes to climate catastrophes, Thüne calls them the Saturnalia of journalists. The climate catstrophe for German journalists was born on January 22, 1986 at the Hotel Tulpenhof in Bonn:
On this day the German Physical Society e. V. had invited journalists in order to present to them the ‘warning of the threatening climate catastrophe’. […]
Explained was CO2’s role as a potential source of danger for global climate changes. The effect of CO2 was compared to the glass cover of a greenhouse that is ‘heated’ only by solar radiation. With a doubling of CO2 concentration, the temperature would increase 2°C in the tropics, 4°C at ‘our latitudes’ and about 8°C at the polar regions and cause a shift in the climate zones. If the ice floating at the Arctic and the ice on the Antarctic continent disappeared, then the sea level  would rise successively up to 60 meters.”
Thüne writes this is where journalists dropped the ball. He writes:

That would have been the ideal hour for critical journalism, however the journalists froze, intimidated by the wisdom of the physical science prominence represented by physics professors K. Heinloth (Bonn) and J. Fricke (Wurzburg). Not a single journalist dared to question the physicists about climate, which is statistically derived from weather and thus only depicts and reflects the historical weather change.”
Here Dr. Thüne writes that journalists in general have three choices when receiving news of an imminent catastrophe from experts:
1. Should they accept the information as is and distribute it, simply playing the role of fetch and carry.
2. Should they look at the supplied news critically, and check it out?
3. Or should they take it, and dramatize it to increase the effect on the public?
Unfortunately, Thüne writes, news magazine Der Spiegel chose the latter option in its August 11, 1986 issue, whose front cover donned a powerfully emotional image of a semi-submerged Cologne Cathedral. Here Der Spiegel grossly crossed the boundaries of responsible journalism in implying an upcoming Biblical wrath of God – brought on by the sins of man. Not only did Spiegel play the role of stooge for a dubious science, but had engaged in an orgy of sensationalistic journalism that would make even the shoddiest of tabloids blush.
The rest of Germany’s media unhesitatntly followed Spiegel’s example. Thüne writes that while the German Physical Society brought us the misnomer of ‘climate catastrophe’, it was Spiegel who popularized it.
To summarise, Thüne cites journalism experts H.-P. Peters M. Sippel:
Not the environmental movement, not the catastrophe – rather it was the warnings of scientists who publicly and politically exposed themselves who were the international godfathers of the climate debate.”
Thüne also adds that the American media also gladly accepted the fetch-and-carry role on behalf of an activist sicence, slamming James Hansen:
In the hot summer months the media over-proportionately reported on the greenhouse effect. Especially the hot summer of 1988 was used by James Hansen (NASA) to dramatize the consequences of the greenhouse effects and to manipulate the psychological climate of Congress.”
Thüne sums up:
More humility by journalists would boost their reputation when it comes to credibility.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Global Warming Policy Foundation recently announced that Professor Fritz Vahrenholt is joining its Academic Advisory Council. Early this year prominent meteorologist Prof. Lennart Bengtsson had also announced his membership, but later resigned amid a backlash from activist warmist scientists.
The Council is composed of scientists, economists and other experts who provide the GWPF with timely scientific, economic and policy advice. It reviews and evaluates new GWPF reports and papers, explores future research projects and makes recommendations on issues related to climate research and policy. Other distinguished scientist members of the GWPF Academic Advisory Council include Robert Carter, Freeman Dyson, Christopher Essex, William Happer, Richard Lindzen, Ross McKitrick, Ian Plimer, Paul Reiter, Nir Shaviv, Henrik Svensmark, Richard Tol and others.
Professor Fritz Vahrenholt was one of the founders of the environmental movement in Germany. In the 1980s his bestseller Seveso ist überall (Seveso is everywhere) triggered a nationwide debate which led to a fundamental reorientation of the chemical industry towards sustainable development.
NTZ inquired with Prof Vahrenholt, asking why he had joined the GWPF Council:
I very much appreciate Lord Lawson who in the GWPF has surrounded himself with scientists who are not prepared to alter scientific findings to suit the political mainstream.”
On the political and academic pressures being applied on dissenters, Prof Vahrenolt wrote in his e-mail response:

The socio-political pressure on those who refuse to hop onto the bandwagon of alarmism is immense. Scientists who reject the simplistic formula of Prof. Schellnhuber (there is a linear relationship between CO2 and temperature change) must create a platform to act as a counter-weight against faulty conclusions in science and politics.”
When asked about where he sees global warming science discussion is heading.
The real climate development over the coming years will unleash the discourse over the dead-ends of climate policy.”
As Vahrenholt shows, dissenting platforms are indeed forming while the real data trends act to rapidly undermine mainstream climate science and global warming policy. It’s only a matter of time.
Dr Vahrenholt holds a PhD in chemistry and is Honorary Professor at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Hamburg. Since 1969 he has been a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). From 1976 until 1997 he served in several public positions with environmental agencies such as the Federal Environment Agency, the Hessian Ministry of Environment and as Deputy Environment Minister and Senator of the City of Hamburg. He then held top management positions in the renewable energy industry.  Vahrenholt is a member of the Germany Academy of Technical Sciences and the Senate of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. His 2012 book The Neglected Sun sparked a broad public discussion in Germany about the dogmatism in climate science. He is currently the Chairman of the German Wildlife Trust.

"Several more decades of increased carbon dioxide emissions could lead to melting ice sheets, mass extinctions and extreme weather becoming the norm. We can’t yet be certain of the exact impacts, but we can look to the past to predict the future. We could start with the last time Earth experienced CO2 levels comparable to those expected in the near future, a period 56m to 34m years ago known as the Eocene.  The Eocene began as a period of extreme warmth around 10m years after the final dinosaurs died. Alligators lived in the Canadian Arctic while palm trees grew along the East Antarctic coastline. Over time, the planet gradually cooled, until the Eocene was brought to a close with the formation of a large ice sheet on Antarctica.  During the Eocene, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere were much higher than today, with estimates usually ranging between 700 and 1,400 parts per million (ppm). As these values are similar to those anticipated by the end of this century (420 to 935ppm), scientists are increasingly using the Eocene to help predict future climate change. We’re particularly interested in the link between carbon dioxide levels and global temperature, often referred to as “equilibrium climate sensitivity” – the temperature change that results from a doubling of atmospheric CO2, once fast climate feedbacks (such as water vapour, clouds and sea ice) have had time to act. To investigate climate sensitivity during the Eocene we generated new estimates of CO2 throughout the period. Our study, written with colleagues from the Universities of Bristol, Cardiff and Southampton, is published in Nature.  As we can’t directly measure the Eocene’s carbon dioxide levels, we have to use “proxies” preserved within sedimentary rocks. Our study utilises planktonic foraminifera, tiny marine organisms which record the chemical composition of seawater in their shells. From these fossils we can figure out the acidity level of the ocean they lived in, which is in turn affected by the concentration of atmospheric CO2. We found that CO2 levels approximately halved during the Eocene, from around 1,400ppm to roughly 770ppm, which explains most of the sea surface cooling that occurred during the period. This supports previously unsubstantiated theories that carbon dioxide was responsible for the extreme warmth of the early Eocene and that its decline was responsible for the subsequent cooling. We then estimated global mean temperatures during the Eocene (again from proxies such as fossilised leaves or marine microfossils) and accounted for changes in vegetation, the position of the continents, and the lack of ice sheets. This yields a climate sensitivity value of 2.1°C to 4.6°C per doubling of CO2. This is similar to that predicted for our own warm future (1.5 to 4.5°C per doubling of CO2).  Our work reinforces previous findings which looked at sensitivity in more recent time intervals. It also gives us confidence that our Eocene-like future is well mapped out by current climate models.  Rich Pancost, a paleoclimate expert and co-author on both studies, explains: “Most importantly, the collective research into Earth history reveals that the climate can and has changed. And consequently, there is little doubt from our history that transforming fossil carbon underground into carbon dioxide in the air – as we are doing today – will significantly affect the climate we experience for the foreseeable future.” Our work also has implications for other elements of the climate system. Specifically, what is the impact of higher CO2 and a warmer climate upon the water cycle? A recent study investigating environmental change during the early Eocene – the warmest interval of the past 65m years – found an increase in global precipitation and evaporation rates and an increase in heat transport from the equator to the poles. The latter is consistent with leaf fossil evidence from the Arctic which suggests that high precipitation rates were common. However, changes in the water cycle are likely to vary between regions. For example, low to mid latitudes likely became drier overall, but with more intense, seasonal rainfall events. Although very few studies have investigated the water cycle of the Eocene, understanding how this operates during past warm climates could provide insights into the mechanisms which will govern future changes."
"Many of society’s energy challenges require gigawatts of power, but many more are small – and some are entirely microscopic. To drive a new generation of tiny micromachines that could deliver drugs or clean traces of pollution, physicists are increasingly looking to biology for inspiration. In work published in the journal Science Advances, my co-authors and I present a simulation of a sort of tiny “windfarm” powered by the natural self-organisation of bacteria. It’s a small step towards harnessing the energy potential of microorganisms. We used computer simulations to model many swimming bacteria, such as the E. coli you find in your gut. A dense crowd of these swimming bacteria isn’t too different from traditional, passive liquid, though there’s one major exception: it spontaneously flows, with internal whirling currents. Physicists have started calling anything that spontaneously flows in this way an “active fluid”. It looks something like this: We first placed a solitary disc-shaped rotor in the midst of these chaotic swirling jets. Since the rotor was pinned in place but free to rotate, the turbulence randomly spun it in all directions, like a weather vane in a hurricane. However, when we included an entire array of closely arranged rotors on a grid, we saw something more interesting happen. Mimicking more complex biological self-organisation, the rotations spontaneously organised, with each rotor spinning in the opposite direction of its neighbour.  Every single rotor in our simulation permanently obeyed the pattern, as long as they were close enough together and a whirl of bacterial fluid was trapped around each one. This orderly spinning reminded us of a microscopic wind farm, powered not by gusts but by the surrounding bacteria. Without the rotors, the chaotic swirls of the bacterial flows randomly whirl in all directions. But when we added the rotors, they got in the way of this disordered mess.  Since the swirls couldn’t really fit well between the two rotors, the bacteria started whirling around and around each rotor. In a way, the rotors became the mechanical heart of each swirling jet of bacteria. They anchored the swirls in place and, in return, the bacteria permanently organised the spinning of the rotors.  The bacteria and the rotors form a partnership and out of that cooperation an organised pattern spontaneously occurs. Physicists call this natural emergence of a pattern “self-assembly”. Self-assembly is when simple building blocks organise themselves into complex structures or self-heal. It is spontaneous but orchestrated action. Nowhere is self-assembly more evident than in developing tissues, where cells move collectively into a part of an organism. Striking examples of this multicellular cooperation include gastrulation, an early step in an embryo’s development from a group of cells into a fully-fledged organism; or Volvox inversion, in which a colony of single-celled algae flips inside out. But these examples are both purely biological.  Our virtual prototype shows one specific case of a biological active fluid interacting with simple, man-made components. The fact that both a biological active fluid and tiny microengineered rotors are needed to get this ordering highlights how nature has already evolved incredibly efficient active materials that we could harness for hybrid bio-mechanical machines.  In fact, many of us physicists are already working on systems that involve both biology and micro-mechanical components that come together to self-organise. For instance, scientists have just developed a ray-like swimming robot with a microfabricated skeleton and a rubber body that is powered by heart muscle cells.  That’s the long-term goal: to build tiny machines that don’t struggle against biology, but instead work seamlessly with or even depend on it. Our ability to engineer the microscopic world is an exciting prospect for the future."
"The Conservative party’s record on tackling the climate crisis has been condemned by leading scientists and former government advisers, as the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, warned that the forthcoming election was the last chance to halt the escalating emergency. Experts accused the Conservatives of copying rightwing politicians in the US by deliberately weakening environmental protections. Meanwhile, analysis by Labour reveals that environmental policies put forward since 2017 and opposed by the Tories would have led to emissions reductions of over 70m tonnes a year by 2030 – more than the annual emissions of Portugal. The climate emergency has become a key battleground in the election, with Labour promising a transformative green industrial revolution, the Liberal Democrats pledging to spend billions on the crisis, and the Conservatives announcing a pre-election moratorium on fracking and pledging to plant 30m trees a year by 2025. On Sunday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Conservatives could not be trusted on the environment. “This general election is our last chance to radically change course, or face the threat of a hostile and dying planet,” he said. “The science is clear – we don’t have time to waste.” He said Labour’s green industrial revolution would create hundreds of thousands of “good, clean jobs that will transform towns, cities and communities that have been held back and neglected for decades”. The Conservatives have come under increasing pressure on the climate crisis during the election campaign and recent analysis shows they are on course to miss several key environmental targets. Boris Johnson is the only party leader to have refused to take part in a TV climate debate, and he drew anger in Yorkshire last week when confronted by people whose livelihoods had been devastated by the floods. In Somerset, Johnson dodged environmental protesters, whom he later dismissed as “crusties”. Leading scientist David King, a key government adviser on the climate crisis until 2017, questioned whether Johnson could be trusted on the environment. He said he would give the Conservatives no more than three or four out of 10 for their record on tackling the climate crisis. “I wouldn’t give them a pass mark. The leadership has simply not been there,” said King, who was Britain’s climate ambassador at the Paris talks that led to the landmark 2015 agreement pledging to keep global heating below 2C, or 1.5C if possible. “The government has completely taken its eye off delivery and it has not been as consistent as it needed to be. If there isn’t support across the board from No 10, then it’s not going to happen.” He added: “The Conservatives are trying to be greener than the other parties, but I wonder just how much we can trust the Conservative party leadership at the moment.” Tom Burke, a former senior adviser to three Conservative environment secretaries, said the government’s record was a disgrace and accused it of aping the libertarian right in the US. “The current government has systematically weakened the capacity of this country to manage its environment. It’s been done by stealth. “They have taken a lesson, I suspect quite consciously, from the libertarian right in the US that you won’t win the argument about weakening environmental standards, so you don’t argue it. What you do is you weaken the capacity to make them effective. “They have completely cut the budgets of the Environment Agency and Natural England and they have systematically reduced their independence,” said Burke, who was a senior adviser to the Foreign Office special representative on climate change from 2006 to 2012 and now runs the environmental thinktank E3G. In a much vaunted announcement, the Conservatives this year committed to making the country carbon net zero by 2050. But their own climate change committee, in its latest analysis of their performance, said there was a growing gap between Britain’s carbon cutting ambition and the policies in place to achieve it. The committee said the government was likely to miss greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets from 2023 onwards, there was still no serious plan for decarbonising UK heating systems, and a tree planting target of 20,000 hectares a year in the UK was not being met. In other key areas, including tackling illegal levels of air pollution – which, the latest government data shows, covers 83% of the country – and water quality, the Conservative government is likely to fail to meet its legal obligations and targets. It is also set to miss targets for boosting renewable energy such as onshore wind and solar, according to a Greenpeace analysis. Carbon emissions from transport, which is responsible for a third of UK greenhouse gas emissions, remain static. Katie Nield, a lawyer for Client Earth, which has successfully taken the government to court on several occasions for its failure to clean up air pollution, said the Tories’ record on tackling toxic air was poor. “We have had these legal limits for nitrogen dioxide since 2010 in place – that’s almost 10 years. Yet they have still not met them. That is despite having a very clear idea of where the problems are, what the causes are and what potential solutions there are. And a failure to act in that context is quite shocking.” The analysis from the Labour party shows that policies opposed by the government on onshore and offshore wind power, home improvements and insulation, tidal power and transport would have led to nearly 70m tonnes of CO2 emissions savings per year by 2030. Luke Clark, from Renewable UK, the renewable energy industry trade association, said the government in the last five years had excluded onshore wind and solar from the competitive market for renewable projects, which had led to an 80% fall in onshore wind installed in 2018, compared with the previous 12 months. “If [we] are not using cheap sources like onshore wind and solar, we are slowing down the process of how quickly we can achieve decarbonisation,” said Clark. “To tackle the climate emergency, we need all these options.” Greg Archer, a director of the zero-emissions pressure group Transport & Environment, in a new analysis of the Conservatives’ nine-year freeze on fuel duty, said the policy had put the equivalent of 2.5m additional cars on the road. “Conservative action to tackle transport emissions has been a story of wrong priorities, little action and missed opportunities, and whilst it has talked green, transport emissions have flatlined for 10 years,” said Archer. “Grants for electric cars have been cut and are scheduled to end in March 2020, stalling progress.” In addition, UK aviation emissions were forecast to continue to rise, but the government was advocating additional runways, including the Heathrow third runway and new terminals, said Archer. Next year will be a critical in the fight to tackle the climate crisis, with the UK hosting the most important climate conference since the 2015 Paris agreement was signed. Experts say that will lead to unprecedented scrutiny of the environment policies of the new government, which will set the tone for the international response to the escalating global emergency. A Guardian investigation earlier this year found Conservative MPs were almost five times as likely to vote against climate action as legislators from other parties. Boris Johnson was among several dozen MPs, mostly Conservatives, who recorded the worst possible score of zero on the Guardian’s climate scorecard of MPs. Theresa Villiers, the environment secretary, said: “The Conservatives have taken world-leading action to tackle climate change – legislating to achieve net zero, reducing emissions by a quarter since coming to office in 2010, and boosting renewables to record levels. “We have set manageable targets that will bring society with us. Corbyn’s Labour would ban people from using their cars or taking flights, and their plans have been slammed by their own unions as ‘utterly unachievable’. “Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives will get Brexit done so we can continue tackling climate change while successfully growing our economy.”"
"Trump’s first 100 days in office were, among other things, marked by a climate march in Washington DC that attracted tens of thousands of demonstrators. No surprises there. Since the beginning of his mandate in January, Trump has signed orders to roll back the number of federally protected waterways, restart the construction of contentious oil pipeline, and cut the budget from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Among the various orders and memoranda, the one signed to overhaul Obama’s Clean Power Plan is probably the most remarkable, along with promoting coal extractions all over the US. A good time, then, to follow up Al Gore’s iconic documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which was released 11 years ago in a similarly discouraging political climate. At that time George W Bush, who is remembered for undermining climate science and for strongly supporting oil interests, was in power. In his own first 100 days at the White House, Bush backed down from the promise of regulating carbon dioxide from coal power plants and announced that the US would not implement the Kyoto climate change treaty.  This summer sees the release of An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power. More than ten years have passed and the documentary looks likely to be released in a very similar context. With republicans in power, war in the Middle East, and regulations on the environment to be reversed, this inconvenient sequel is a reminder that the climate of the conversation about global warming has not changed much in the interim. But the strategies needed to grab the attention of the public certainly have. In the fast-paced, ever-evolving media landscape of the 21st century, knowing how to engage the public on environmental matters is no easy thing. The tendency of the environmental films that have mushroomed since 2000 has been to use a rhetoric of fear. But how effective has this been? Certainly, environmental activism has grown, particularly with the help of social media, but the role of these productions is unclear, and there is a lack of research on audience response to these films. The selling point of An Inconvenient Truth was its personal approach. Although it had a lecture-style tone, this was a documentary that was all about Gore. He told his story entwined with that of the planet. It was extraordinary that people paid to go to the cinema to watch a politician giving a lecture. This was a big shift in cinema. Arguably, this format was enlivened by the way in which Gore opened up about his personal history. The documentary opened with the politician’s notorious quote: “I am Al Gore, and I used to be the next president of the United States.” In November 2000 Gore had lost the presidential elections to George W Bush with an extraordinarily narrow defeat. The choice to run with a very personal rhetoric was certainly strategic – the right time for the former vice president to open up six years from that unfortunate election. Gore told the story of global warming through his personal life, featuring his career disappointments, family tragedies and constantly referring to the scientists he interviewed as “my friend”.  This was a very innovative way of approaching the matter of climate change. We are talking about a politician who decided to offer an insight on his private life for a greater cause: to engage the public on a vital scientific subject. The originality of the documentary led to An Inconvenient Truth scoring two Oscars at the Academy Awards 2006. Today, An Inconvenient Truth is seen as the prototype of activist film-making. Founder of the Climate Reality Project in 2006 and co-recipient of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize (with the IPCC), Gore and his movement soon became the core of environmental activism, gathering several environmental groups that, despite their differences, today march together for the greatest challenge of our time.  Eleven years on, the revolution under Gore’s lead that many expected has yet to be fulfilled. The next decade was beset with disappointments. More recently, the 2015 Paris Agreement has marked a new era for climate action, proving that both developed and developing countries are now ready to work together to reduce carbon emissions. But today there is a new protagonist – or antagonist – in the picture. The trailer for An Inconvenient Sequel shows Gore watching Trump shouting his doubts about global warming to the crowd and announcing his plans to strip back the EPA’s budget. It will be interesting to see how the tone of the film moves off from that of the original. The “personal reveal” tactic won’t work so well the second time round. And a change in the narrative is certainly evident from the trailer. The graphs of the previous documentary are replaced with more evocative images of extreme weather and disasters. While statistics about carbon dioxide emissions and sea-level rises were predominantly used to trigger emotions in the audience, this time round Gore can show the results of his predictions. One example of this is the iconic footage of a flooded World Trade Centre Memorial, a possibility which was discussed by Gore in the 2006 documentary and criticised by many for being a “fictional” element at that time rather than an “evidence” of climate impact. Unfortunately, I am not sure how much this shift will affect the public or whether the sequel will be the manifesto of that revolution that Gore and his followers have been waiting for. The role that the media have played in the communication of climate change issues has changed and developed alongside the evolution of the medium itself and people’s perception of the environment. The last decade has seen an explosion of sensational images and audiences are fatigued by this use of fear.  Many look for media that includes “positive” messages rather than the traditional onslaught of facts and images triggering negative emotions. It has never been more difficult for environmental communicators to please viewers and readers in the midst of a never-ending flow of information available to them."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn the German speaking part of Europe there is hardly a person who doesn’t know the name of Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann.

Jörg Kachelmann. Image cropped from here.
The famous German flagship public television meteorologist became even more famous when in 2009 he was held by German authorities for 132 days long on charges of rape. Kachelmann was eventually cleared of the charges in what later was determined to be a case of the fury of a woman’s scorn and Kachelmann becoming the unfortunate victim of an overzealous media feeding frenzy and betrayal.
But that was five years ago and in the meantime the entrepreneurial meteorologist has put the pieces back together and once again is becoming an increasingly public figure who likes to present himself as a folksy, non-nonsense sort of meteorologist. See his sites here and here.
Refuses to state his position on climate change science
As Kachelmann is a high-profile meteorologist who holds impressive practical knowledge and experience, many followers of the climate debate are naturally wondering where he stands on man-made global warming. Unfortunately he has steadfastly avoided that hornet’s nest.
However recently he gave an interview with the online MünsterscheZeitung – MZ – (Munster News). In the interview the online daily asked Kachelmann about all the rain and thunderstorms Germany had been seeing this summer, trying to prod him to blame it on climate change. But Kachelmann didn’t take the bait. Again he dodged direct questions about the climate debate.
“Usual boring climate question”
Yet, reading his replies in the interview, one sees some pretty clear signals on where he stands. For example Kachelmann plays down the MZ’s claim that this kind of weather “has never been seen before“, and if Germany should start getting used to more tropical-like rains in the future. Kachelmann responds:
That’s the usual boring climate question. Are we all going to die? I don’t know enough about it and don’t have an answer for this. Here you’ll have to ask the usual climate scientists. And depending on who you ask, you’ll get the answer. I’m a forecaster and I deal deal with 5 to 15 days maximum. And that’s it.”
The climate question has become boring, and it depends on who you ask on whether or not we are going to die. Sounds like Kachelmann thinks there’s consensus on the question.
Tornadoes in Germany not as rare as you think
When prodded by the MZ to acknowledge that a recent tornado touching down in Germany is really weird, Kachelmann here too refuses to play along, saying that tornadoes are “not as seldom as one thinks“:
Every year there are a few. They are not always seen, as there isn’t always someone there to record it with his mobile phone. But the weather situation on Sunday was clear: There was the possibility of tornadoes.”
Gradually we get the picture that Kachelmann doesn’t think much of the climate alarmism that gets attached to single extreme weather events.

Long-term seasonal forecasts – “moronic meteorology”
When it comes to long-term (seasonal) weather forecasting, Kachelmann goes on the offensive calling such forecasts “Vollpfostenmeteorologie” which I would translate as something like “moronic meteorology”. In short he regards these forecasts as something from morons. He characterizes seasonal forecasting:
It’s not serious to say in the springtime what the summer will be like. That’s moronic meteorology.”
Here Kachelmann recognizes the huge complexity, and thus the uncertainty that weather involves. Surely he must harbor the same when it comes to making decadal or 100-year climate forecasts for the globe.
Still, on seasonal forecasts I believe Kachelmann is being too harsh on his fellow meteorologists who do put out seasonal forecasts. Is it not a legitimate endeavor?
Many readers here know that Joe Bastardi, for example, makes a living in part by providing seasonal forecasts, and has proven to have a pretty darn good success rate.
Joe Bastardi has a different view of long-term forecasting
Kachelmann’s dismissal of these longer term forecasts prompted me to get Joe’s opinion on the subject. He sent me a reply by e-mail. Here’s what he wrote – speaking in general terms and not addressing anyone in particular. Joe writes:
Judge a tree by the fruit on it.
Here are the facts. I make a living doing this. People pay me to be right, not wrong. Given the amount of private and public competition out there, why would you pay me if I am wrong, not adding value. Those that can’t do, or won’t do, tend to trash those that do. I have a very happy and increasing client base and in the world of competition, people don’t pay money for losers for very long. We let our forecasts do the talking.
I admit when I am wrong. Usually though it corrects me for the next battle (example last year’s hurricane season showed us hemispheric was similar to 17-18 which we added to the winter analog in the states.
However I am well aware of being too cold in Europe last year, after nailing the previous 3 years. We have already used that to help us with this year, which our clients see. Now if I am wrong again, they will get antsy, but they are ahead of the game.. way head in Europe, cause of things before.
In the states. this streak can not get any better. But remember this is the 3rd of 3 winters (granted 12-13 started late) that I opined would be cold back in 2011. Given 16 hours a day looking at weather and not having a day off, the only thing I can say is perhaps I am just lucky.
You be the judge.”
Joe exudes confidence in his seasonal forecasting methods. Looks like he’s found the right tools.

"The Spiny Forest is like nowhere else on Earth, but it’s disappearing fast. It’s a bizarre Dr Seussian world of spiky octopus trees and swollen baobabs, and almost all its species exist only in Madagascar. The strange vegetation teems with even weirder wildlife: there are ghostly white lemurs impervious to thorns, birds that sing communally, and a chameleon that spends most of its life as an egg. Once there were ten-foot tall elephant birds and gorilla-sized lemurs too, but they went extinct just a few centuries ago. Unsurprisingly, scientists have long ranked the Spiny Forest as one of the world’s most important “ecoregions”. Even so, hardly anyone outside Madagascar has heard of it. The tragedy is that the Spiny Forest is rapidly, silently, going up in smoke while the world looks the other way. Southern Madagascar is a dry and impoverished region with little in the way of infrastructure or industry. Most of the population scrapes a living from the land, as cattle herders and farmers, or as fishermen at sea. People also depend on the forest’s essential resources, such as construction wood and fuel, medicinal plants, wild yams and “bushmeat”, among other things. So why is it disappearing so fast? There are two main causes of deforestation – shifting cultivation (also known as slash-and-burn agriculture), and the production of charcoal. Here charcoal is not just a novelty for barbecues, but the fuel that cooks almost every meal. Making it involves baking the Spiny Forest’s precious hardwood trees in makeshift earth ovens, and it’s a gruelling job. Nonetheless, it’s a growing menace. In 2010 my colleagues at the WWF noticed a huge increase in the amount of charcoal being produced in the forest of Ranobe. Ranobe is the richest area in the whole Spiny Forest for lemurs and other wildlife, and it had just been declared a new protected area, so we needed to find out what was going on. I wanted to know what had driven the change, so I interviewed more than 200 charcoal producers to find out. Many had previously been farmers but had given it up – they couldn’t predict the rains any more due to the changing seasons, so their crops failed and yielded nothing. Even areas with irrigation suffered, as the region’s few ageing dams and canals had fallen into disrepair. Nor was it just the farmers who were suffering. Some charcoal makers had been fishermen, but decades of overfishing meant there weren’t enough fish left to catch. Others had been herders, but had lost their cattle to rustlers. With growing families and rising costs of living, money was an issue for everyone, and traditional ways of life just weren’t paying the bills anymore. With nowhere else to turn, desperate communities were descending on the Spiny Forest. The forest, it seems, acts as a safety net. Rural Malagasy people don’t want to produce charcoal or carry out shifting cultivation; they’d rather farm, fish, or find a salaried job. Unfortunately, there simply aren’t many options in the Spiny Forest, and the importance of the forest as a backup seems set to grow as climate change continues to disrupt the region’s weather. The trouble is, practices like charcoal production are tearing huge holes in the forest safety net. However, all is not yet lost. Hundreds of dedicated conservationists are working up and down the island, developing innovative solutions to the nation’s environmental crisis. What’s more, the Malagasy government has spent the past decade creating dozens of new parks and reserves, including several in the Spiny Forest. The tide may be starting to turn, but these efforts need the support of the world. Can we save the Spiny Forest and the safety net it provides?"

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome years ago German “climate experts” were all forecasting hot, dry summers for Germany. But now, after a series of wet summers, they are telling us we have to expect wet summers in the future.
Nobody knows what to believe anymore. One day they say prepare for this, and the next day they say prepare for that.
Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski here reports on the German DWD Weather Service’s summer review, which highlights the heavy rainfalls and severe thunderstorms that hit Germany. Also the DWD hints at what Germans should expect in the future. Suddenly, earlier warnings and prognoses of hot and dry 2003-like summers have given way to forecasts of wetter summers.
Spiegel’s Bojanowski writes (my emphasis):
Precipitation, like that in July, will increase in frequency as a result of the expected climate change, prophesizes the DWD. Simulations [computer models] had shown that a warmer planet at the end of the century could see 10 to 17 days per year more rainy low pressure systems, reported Vice President of the DWD, Paul Becker, on Monday in Berlin.”
Becker loves the media limelight. Here the DWD has made a 180° turn and is now claiming we should expect rainier and wetter summers – so forget all the earlier forecasts of hot, dry summers.
Earlier computer summer climate forecasts
Just a few years ago all the talk was about hot. dry summers and crop damage.
For example FOCUS magazine here warned in 2009 for the eastern part of Germany, citing the DWD itself:
Summers will become hotter, and less rain will fall. Already the changes are visible as people in Brandenburg experienced last summer an acute danger of forest fires. That this is no exception, rather it is a part of the trend and is shown by other datasets of the German Weather Service (DWD), which confirm that the temperature has risen over the last 30 years  – the DWD has reliable data for this time period.”
Moreover in 2007 FOCUS cited Daniela Jacob of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg: “For example in the eastern part of the country summer will be like at the Mediterranean“. She also claimed major rivers in Germany could sink to extremely low levels during the summers. FOCUS added: “While summers will tend to be more dry, winters will be considerably wetter, according to analyses by the meteorologist.”

The German website www.energie-umwelt quoted daily Ostsee Zeitung, which wrote:
According to the model in summer there will be on average 30% less precipitation, whereby foremost the northeast and southwest of Germany will be hit.”
Germany’s flagship daily the FAZ here l presented a commentary by former Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) scientists Friedrich-Wilhelm Gerstengarbe and Peter Werner, who proclaimed:
Over the summer rainfalls in almost all of Germany have decreased. Our winters are becoming wetter. The new Germany is characterized by dry-hot summers and warm wet winters.”
Also Spiegel featured forecasts of warmer and drier summers, writing in 2009: “Computer simulations have yielded that the Mediterranean climate will spread further and further north due to climate change. […] The uninterrupted sequence of warm summer days and extremely hot days will make ‘everything quite uncomfortable’. Never mind the damage for farmers whose fields will dry up.”
The reality: 10 of the last 11 summers have been wetter than normal, or normal
So how accurate were all these German climate forecasts? 10 of the last 11 summers have been either wetter than normal, or normal. In short, the computer simulations got it all wrong.
Now the DWD wants us to believe that future summers in Germany will become wetter and wetter. They’ve forgotten what weather cycles are! That’s how bad the science of meteorology seems to have gotten at the DWD.
Bojanowski summarizes in his recent article:
Simulations from the Austrian ZAMG Weather Service on the other hand have not shown any increase in so-called Vb weather systems from the southeast for the future – that shows how uncertain the prognoses are.”
In a nutshell: you’re better off consulting a tarot-card fortune-teller for your climate forecasts.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLooks like the anti-capitalist, tree-hugging Greenpeace organization doesn’t practice what it preaches when it comes to the evils of capitalism.
A number of newspapers in the German speaking part of Europe are reporting how the environmental activist organization took millions of the money received as private donations and has blown it in high-risk casino-grade investments – instead of using it to protect the environment.
Spiegel here reports, “Greenpeace has been rocked by a finance scandal” and that it has “blown millions from donations“. According to Spiegel:
An employee at Greenpeace Central in Amsterdam lost a total of 3.8 million euros in currency speculation. According to Spiegel information, the money comes from donations transferred to Amsterdam Central from financially sound Greenpeace regional organizations like those in Germany…”
Note how the blame gets shifted to “an employee”, as if Greenpeace management is not accountable. Well, management is responsible and those donating deserves answers as to why their donations were being blown in dubious get-rich-quick schemes.

According to Spiegel, the employee was betting on a falling euro. Mike Townsley of Greenpeace International says the employee has since been sacked and calls the bad speculation “a serious miscalculation”, which was discovered by an “internal control system”. Greenpeace assures that the problem is solved and everything is back in order.
Instead of firing the poor employee, Greenpeace could have taken the socially compassionate step of sending him to training, or perhaps to Gamblers Anonymous. But no, instead they do the cold-hearted capitalistic thing and throw him out onto the streets. Or better yet, they could pay him a huge bonus, and then ask the government for a bailout.
Spiegel writes that the money had been earmarked to set up regional Greenpeace offices. But that money is gone, and the loss is deemed as “substantial”.
I remember Greenpeace activists asking me for a donation on the streets of Rome when I visited last April. Boy, I sure am glad I didn’t give them anything.
As one Spiegel reader comments, “Like everywhere, it’s easier to speculate with other people’s money.”

"Over the past century half of the world’s ponds and wetlands have been destroyed, with many being filled in and turned into agricultural land. However, all is not lost, and it is possible to “resurrect” these buried habitats from the seeds and eggs stored within their historic sediments. A new conservation approach pioneered by the UCL Pond Restoration Research Group can restore aquatic habitats lost to the landscape for centuries. Ponds can be extremely biodiverse. They support more aquatic species than any other freshwater habitat and provide important food sources for farmland birds and bats.  At the start of the 20th century there were an estimated 800,000 ponds in England and Wales – now, it is thought that fewer than a quarter of these remain. Similar levels of pond loss have occurred across farmland in Europe and North America, associated with increasing intensification of agriculture. Pond and hedgerow loss are often linked as hedges are uprooted and used to fill in ponds, before ploughing over the entire area.  Many lost ponds leave behind a “ghostly” mark in the landscape – visible as damp depressions, areas of poor crop cover, or changes in soil colour. Colleagues and I have recently discovered that these buried “ghost ponds” are not completely lost, but can be resurrected from historic seeds lying dormant underneath intensively cultivated agricultural fields.  These ghosts are an abundant yet overlooked conservation resource. Resurrecting them would of course mean more ponds, which in turn links up aquatic landscapes as plants and animals jump from pond to pond and species are able to thrive in larger populations. But the main advantage of a ghost pond, compared to a new pond, is the historic seed bank buried below the surface. This provides a source of local native species, speeding up the process of colonisation, and potentially restoring lost populations or even locally extinct species to the resurrected pond. We already knew that aquatic seeds were able to survive dormant for centuries within existing lakes and wetlands. Scientists recently tested 13 lakes in Russia, for instance, and found stoneworts (a keystone species in aquatic habitats), could grow from 300 year-old spores collected from lake sediments.  However, our recent paper, published in the journal Biological Conservation, is the first to demonstrate this astonishing survival ability within habitats which had been assumed lost to agriculture. In our study, we resurrected three ghost ponds in north Norfolk, eastern England. These ponds were similar in type, location and surrounding land use to the 8,000-plus ghost ponds buried across Norfolk and many more across the UK. While buried, ghost ponds are subject to the typical stresses of intensive agriculture (soil compaction, fertiliser and herbicide use), making the long-term survival of their aquatic seed banks particularly astonishing. Our three study ponds had been buried for around 45, 50 and 150 years. Each was re-excavated down to the pond’s historic level, which was easily distinguished from the overlying topsoil by its dark colour, silty texture, and even its distinctive “pond smell”. This layer of sediment was left mostly undisturbed to provide the source of historic seeds and eggs within each pond. All three ghost ponds were colonised within six months by native plant species. In total, 12 species of aquatic plant colonised the ghost ponds and eight of these species proved to have originated from the seeds that had lain dormant below the ground. To check these plants really had grown from the ghostly remains of the previous pond, and hadn’t been carried in by the wind or seed-eating birds, we kept some of the historic sediment in sealed aquariums. There, even under controlled conditions, the same species still grew out of this centuries-old sediment. Species recolonising from the historic seed bank included stoneworts, which are important for maintaining water quality but are increasingly threatened in farmland, and floating leaved pondweeds, which provide key habitat for dragonflies and damselflies. We also found crustaceans including Daphnia (water fleas), and copepods (tiny invertebrates which swim in a jumpy motion using their antennae), were able to hatch from eggs buried in the ghost pond sediment samples. Although only common species were resurrected from the sediments of our three ghost ponds, these included seeds of all different sizes and types – from a variety of aquatic plant species. This suggests that a wide range of plants, including potentially rare or even locally extinct species, could potentially survive within the buried sediments of ghost ponds. The boost to recolonisation speed and diversity from the historic seed and egg bank may also reduce the risk of invasive species becoming established. Ghost ponds represent abundant yet overlooked biological time capsules. Their restoration could facilitate the rapid return of wetland habitats and aquatic plants into the agricultural landscape. This process could play a significant role in reversing some of the habitat and biodiversity losses caused by the global disappearance of agricultural wetlands – and I urge conservationists to make use of this valuable yet hitherto little considered resource."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSkeptic site Die kalte Sonne here features a video with leading German IPCC critic Fritz Vahrenholt taking part in a heated podium discussion last month. The event was held by the Steiermark Chamber of Commerce (WKO) in Graz, Austria. The topic: “Climate change under scrutiny”.
The video can be seen at the WKO-website and at Youtube:

In his presentation Vahrenholt starts by showing how the IPCC is needlessly spreading panic and how they under-estimate the impacts of natural factors. He reminds the audience of 200 that global temperatures have not risen since 1998.
As Europe and Germany hastily attempt to barrel ahead in switching to renewable energy, Vahrenholt warns that the switch “is not sensible” and is “threatening prosperity“. To underscore the absurdity of Europe’s trillion-euro green-energy project, Vahrenholt tells the audience:
Everything we do, at great cost, to reduce CO2 over the next 15 years, up to 2030, will be wiped out in China in just 6 weeks.”
Vahrenholt’s presentation was then rebutted by climate scientist Gottfried Kirchengast of the Wegener Institute, who claimed IPCC science is well-founded and that the planet is facing “weather extremes, ocean-acidification and mass human migration”, which he supported using colorful models and charts.

Vahrenholt foresees cooler world in 10 years
Near the end of the discussion, Vahrenholt reminds that those who destroy society and jobs in their rush to implement green energies will have to bear the ethical responsibility and answer in the future.
Vahrenholt also foresees a cooler world in 10 years, claiming it’s going to happen because of the natural forcings.
Kirchengast countered, accusing Vahrenholt of spreading false information and indirectly compared skeptics to flat-earthers. “There are some people who still think the earth is flat.”
The narrator then summed up by saying that “audience’s opinion at the end of the evening was divided“.
Unsurprisingly the format overall was stacked against Vahrenholt as the other podium participants were all warmists…the usual attempted ambush.

"When Greta Thunberg began her school strike outside the Swedish parliament in 2018, she was alone. Within months, thousands and then millions followed her example. Some of the most enthusiastic school strikers have been in Belgium, inadvertently launching a national movement that bridges the country’s entrenched linguistic divide.  In the first few months of this year, Belgian teenagers organised 20 weeks of school strikes, events that led to the resignation of a regional environment minister, who had made false claims that the strikes were directed by foreign powers. Last month, two of the young women who led the Belgian school strikes embarked on a transatlantic voyage to South America with the initial goal of reaching the UN climate conference in Chile. But events did not go to plan. Four weeks into the journey, 36 climate activists from across Europe sailing on the Regina Maris schooner had reached Cape Verde, the island nation off the coast of west Africa, when they heard of Chile’s abrupt decision to cancel hosting the meeting. “It’s heartbreaking news,” wrote Anuna De Wever, one of the founders of the Flanders school strikes, who also voiced “full support to the people power in Chile”. She and Adélaïde Charlier, the Francophone voice of Belgium’s school strikes, both aged 18, are the two youngest on board the Regina Maris, which aims to cross the Atlantic by wind power alone. They had hoped to be at the UN meeting “to hold our politicians responsible for their lack of ambition”, De Wever said. With no certainty on where the UN meeting would take place, the group decided to go to South America regardless. The Belgian women wanted to keep a promise to meet South American activists who are working to protect the Amazon. A spokesman for the group said its main aim was unchanged: “Putting the climate impact of aviation on the international agenda.” The day after they left Cape Verde, organisers announced the UN meeting would take place in Madrid. This means the young crew will be on the wrong side of the world just as the meeting is getting under way. Thunberg hopes to get a lift to Madrid, but those on the Regina Maris acknowledge they cannot make it in time. Instead, the activists are rethinking how they will get their message to global leaders in Madrid, as well as putting pressure on domestic politicians. Belgium was the second country to undergo the industrial revolution, but its complicated, decentralised politics are hampering efforts to tackle the legacy of coal and steel. The nation of 11.4 million people and six parliaments is on track to miss climate targets in 2020 and 2030, according to the latest progress report from the European commission. Belgium has some of the worst traffic jams in Europe, energy-profligate buildings and a saturated railway network. The last straw for Belgian young people came when the environment minister, Marie-Christine Marghem, took a private jet to the 2018 UN climate summit in Katowice, while Belgium declined to join “the high ambition coalition” – a group of countries pledging extra efforts to tackle the climate emergency. The text was signed by Belgium’s neighbours, including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the UK. “No, it was not a joke, it was true,” recalled De Wever of Marghem’s flight, in a book about the Flemish school strike movement that she launched with fellow activist Kyra Gantois. “It was at that point, sitting at the kitchen table, that we looked each other in the eye and said: enough is enough.” Launched by the two young women in Flanders, the strikes soon spread to Francophone regions, making them a rare national movement in a country where the linguistic faultline cuts through political parties, newspapers and television stations. “It is Flemish and French,” De Wever said. “Sometimes there are some arguments, especially in politics, but we don’t care about that and we want to unite everyone to fight with us.” Leading the movement must have heaped pressure on the young activists. At a recent climate march, Charlier was surrounded by enthusiastic participants asking her to sign their reusable water bottles. De Wever has experienced the ugly side of being in the public eye: she and her friends complained to the police after her tent was ransacked and they were pelted with urine-filled bottles at a music festival this summer. “It’s a lot sometimes,” she said, sounding buoyant after thousands turned out to the Brussels gathering of the September global climate strike. “You get the good and the bad, but at the end of the day, it is all worth it because it is amazing to see so many people coming on the streets, and you get this result,” De Wever said. One of the school strikers’ champions is the Belgian climate scientist Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, a former vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He helped the young activists draft a manifesto and said they had succeeded in putting the climate emergency on the agenda. “[The results] are not a full success, but they are not done, their determination to continue is clear,” he said. For now, the school strikers are battling Belgium’s highly decentralised political system. Dave Sinardet, a political science professor at Free University of Brussels, said: “The federal level is not competent to overrule the regions if they would not reach certain targets. “So instead of having a dynamic where the different regions push each other upwards, they rather have a dynamic where they push each other downwards: everybody is looking at the other one saying, ‘you should do more’, so that’s clearly a problem.” The political scientist argued the school strikes did not lead to expected gains for climate-action parties at the 2019 elections. While Greens made gains in French-speaking Wallonia and the federal parliament, these were “not as good as expected”, Sinardet said, while in Flanders, “you don’t see much climate ambition”. It remains unclear whether Belgium can find a more decisive response to the climate emergency, following election results that left the country more divided than ever. Flanders moved right with gains for the centre-right Flemish nationalists and the far right, while Wallonia swung left, with victory for the Socialists. More than 170 days after the elections in late May, Belgium remains without a federal government, although the country has signed up to an EU plan for net-zero emissions by 2050. For Van Ypersele, a professor at the Université catholique de Louvain, the 2050 target is inadequate. The climate scientist is calling on the EU to reduce emissions to net zero by 2040 to keep global heating below 1.5C, the threshold for avoiding catastrophic climate change. “We are heading on a train which is moving at a 100km an hour towards a wall … If we only hit the wall when we are travelling at 20km an hour, everyone understands that the damage to the passengers on the train will be infinitely smaller than if we hit the wall at 80km or 60km an hour,” he said. “It would be better to get to net zero tomorrow morning [ie in] 2040 rather than 2050. It would already be so much better [to get to] 2050 than never.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterCalls for rigid and draconian CO2 emissions reduction targets in Germany have been dealt a body blow.
Germany’s Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel of Angela Merkel’s coalition partner the SPD socialists has dumped a load of cold water on the extreme demand for a rapid shutdown of the country’s coal power plants.

German Federal Ministry of Economics Minister and SPD party chief Sigmar Gabriel calls a shut down of Germany’s coal power plants “an illusion” and “mass disinformation of the people”. Photo credit: www.sigmar-gabriel.de
The Berlin based center-left online daily Der Tagesspiegel here reports on remarks Gabriel made in response to a question posed by a Greenpeace activist during a discussion with French economist Thomas Piketty at the Federal Ministry of Economics in Berlin.
Earlier in the day activists had dumped 8 tonnes of coal in front of the Ministry in protest. They request Berlin shut down all German coal-fired power plants. Der Tagesspiegel describes Gabriel’s mocking reaction to the demand (my emphasis):

When the Greenpeace and others demand that all German coal power plants be shut down, that is hardly more than ‘mass disinformation of the people‘ which ‘will not lead to a single tonne of CO2 being saved for the global climate,’ Gabriel added. He is in favor, however, of the European Emissions Trading being set up again so that coal becomes more expensive. ‘I also have nothing against Greenpeace bringing its coal here. ‘We can always use coal here.’ Gabriel ended the exchange.”
The soicialist/environmentalist Tagesspiegel termed Gabriel’s remarks as an “éclat”.
Rapid shutdown of coal power “an illusion”
In the meantime, the online Spiegel reports today that Merkel’s influential Economics Minister is now in a hefty conflict with the country’s Ministry of Environment, which is pushing to reduce Germany’s CO2 emissions 40% compared to 1990 levels by 2020. Spiegel writes that would mean shutting down 15 to 20 coal power plants in a country where the energy supply is already strained. Gabriel is searching for ways to avoid this. Spiegel writes:
Der SPIEGEL quoted Gabriel with the words: It is ‘an illusion to believe that Germany could exit both nuclear energy and coal at the same time.’  Gabriel could imagine a postponement of the climate protection action plan, which is to be introduced in the Cabinet on December 3.”
Say what you want about socialist Gabriel, but this time, as Federal Economics Minister, he sees things very clearly and soberly.

"Growing concern about the climate crisis and the “Greta Thunberg effect” are driving huge increases in individuals and businesses choosing to offset their emissions by investing in carbon-reducing projects in developing countries. NGOs and organisations involved in carbon offsetting have seen as much as a fourfold increase in investment from people who want to try to mitigate their carbon footprints.  Agencies who work with large corporations have also seen a spike in investment in carbon offsetting over the last 18 months. ClimateCare, a company that provides programmes to help organisations offset residual carbon emissions, has seen the amount of carbon offset increase from about 2m tonnes to 20m tonnes in that time, according to its chief executive, Edward Hanrahan. Smaller organisations have also reported massive spikes in offsetting. Caroline Pomeroy, the director of the NGO Climate Stewards, which offsets emissions for individuals and small businesses, said income from individuals offsetting had increased by 156% year on year, and that there had been an 80% increase in income from businesses and charities offsetting. Offsetting means calculating emissions and then purchasing equivalent “credits” from projects that prevent or remove the emissions of an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. Carbon offsetting has been controversial, with some critics saying it allows big polluters and individuals to buy carbon credits in exchange for a clean conscience while continuing to fly, drive and use fossil fuels. But in the past 10 years, highly regulated global carbon and renewable energy markets have been created and participating companies and NGOs are theoretically held to international standards by independent verifiers. The organisation Gold Standard was set up by the environment group WWF and other NGOs to ensure the integrity of projects that reduced carbon emissions and to ensure they contribute to sustainable development. Sarah Leugers, its communications director, said: “Everyone should be looking to reduce their emissions as much as possible first, but for most of us it is impossible at this time to reduce them to zero, so taking accountability and financing the reduction in emissions somewhere else in the world is a way to accelerate the path to a low carbon economy.” Hanrahan said large organisations were being driven to be responsible for not only the emissions that they created as a company, but also so-called “Scope 3 emissions” from the use of their products, by a combination of consumer pressure and governments pushing for corporations to become more accountable for their impact on the climate. Leugers said transformative projects were those that improved cooking facilities in the developing world, for example by providing biogas stoves and projects that improved access to clean water, thus reducing greenhouse gases from burning firewood to boil water. “These are life-changing for people in the developing world and have real impact on reducing carbon emissions,” she said. Gold Standard has  reported a fourfold increase in income from individuals and small businesses paying for carbon offsets through its platform. “People are willing to take action and are looking for ways to take action. We see it as a way that someone can feel empowered and reduce their carbon footprint,” said Leugers. Climate Stewards funds a project in Nepal paid for by the purchase of carbon offsets, where 240 fuel-efficient cooking stoves have been built for remote communities. Each stove saves 6.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year per household and the stoves last for about 10 years. The price for a tonne of CO2 is not set globally, and varies between offset suppliers on the voluntary market. The US Environmental Protection Agency in 2015 assessed that for every tonne of CO2emitted into the atmosphere, we sacrifice between $11 and $212 in environmental degradation and negative social impacts. David Hughes, the chair of Climate Stewards, said: “This year, the whole business of carbon offsetting has suddenly taken off. It has been so gratifying to see a lot of individuals choosing to offset over the last 12 months – the numbers have more than doubled. “We are seeing the Greta effect, the impact of Extinction Rebellion, the impact of the words of David Attenborough, the school strikes, all of these coming together.” But Hanrahan said while voluntary carbon mitigation and individual actions were laudable, ClimateCare was clear in its call for mandatory carbon pricing and mitigation for large corporations and industries like aviation. “Our position is that this should not be an optional or voluntary thing. Expecting individuals to be able to make fully informed decisions about such a specialist, complex area is madness,” he said. “What we want is a scenario where corporates are mandated to pay a price on carbon that reflects the societal cost of dealing with climate change and carbon emissions, and to pay for mitigating their emissions.” Flying to and from Malaysia to visit his family each year was causing increasing concern to Shanon Shah, a freelance writer from London. Through his partner, an Anglican priest, he was introduced to Climate Stewards, and began to see a way in which he could compensate for his carbon footprint. “But then I thought, it isn’t enough to offset the flights that I am going to take in the future, as I take them. I sat down and tried to remember all the flights I had ever taken in my life. “And bit by bit I accounted for my flying in the past. Every few weeks when I got a paycheck I offset a few of the past flights that I had made over a particular period. Over the course of six or seven months, I managed to offset all the flights I can ever remember taking. That was around 35 flights.” Shah is continuing his mission to reduce and mitigate his own emissions. “From now on, every time I book a flight I offset it.” But Shah thinks the airline industry itself has to be made accountable for its emissions. Emissions from international aviation are not included in national inventories of their emissions, and under the Kyoto protocol – something there is growing pressure to change – aviation is not subject to VAT or fuel tax. “It has excluded itself from all these environmental protocols, and there should be more pressure to make their emissions accountable,” said Shah. “But in the meantime I think that this is something I can do as an individual.” In Stoke-on-Trent, Daniel Charlesworth, 24, who works for the police, has made a similar decision. He has chosen to offset all his car travel. “I have been researching electric cars for months, but there is a lot of life left in my car and I cannot afford an equivalent electric car,” he said. “So I have begun offsetting my journeys each month and set up a direct debit, I think it amounts to about £7 per month. “I know that even if you have thousands and thousands of individuals like me doing the same it is not going to make a huge difference, but I feel I have a personal responsibility to be accountable for my emissions. And if what I am doing leads others to do it as well, it can help to drive change.”"
"Floods are often presented as human interest stories of stranded grannies and rescued pets, but their impact on hidden infrastructure is just as severe. In late 2015 for instance, a number of power systems and phone exchanges were inundated in Leeds and York which cut off thousands of homes, businesses (who were unable to process card payments), bank machines and even police and hospital services on Tyneside, 100 miles away.  But it’s not just floods and it’s not just phone lines. In fact, a major new peer-reviewed report highlights how, across the UK, the country’s infrastructure – services such as energy, transport and sanitation that are essential for modern society – is already experiencing significant impacts from severe weather related to climate change. Unchecked, the projected increases in flooding will lead to more disruption of infrastructure.  Furthermore, gradual changes in our climate, such as a rise in average temperatures, will reduce capacity and increase running costs.   The Climate Change Risk Assessment report, published by independent advisory body the Committee on Climate Change, is the result of years of collaboration by hundreds of leading experts. I led on the infrastructure strand of the report. Some of the key risks colleagues and I found include: A significant proportion of Britain’s infrastructure is already exposed to coastal, river, groundwater or surface water flooding. This includes more than 40% of the power stations, and nearly one fifth of railway track in England. Across the UK, the number of infrastructure assets exposed could double under expected changes in climate by the 2080s. Warmer weather will place additional pressures on the rail, road, water and energy sectors. Higher temperatures create a risk of buckling on the rail network, causing electricity cables to sag and operate less effectively, and road tarmac to soften and rut. Components such as signalling equipment can overheat and fail. Extended periods of low rainfall, and associated low river flows and groundwater levels, coupled with population growth, are projected to lead to water supply deficits across England and in some other parts of the UK by the 2050s. Widespread water shortages are projected by the 2080s. Nearly 10% of the UK’s transport and road network is already at medium to high risk of disruption from landslides. It’s likely the UK will see extended periods of rainfall in future, increasing the risk of slope and embankment failure. Infrastructure networks are increasingly reliant on each other – for power, control (through digital communications) and transport access for deliveries or servicing. Climate-related risks to infrastructure can now have far wider impact on the economy and people’s health and well-being as a result of this interconnectivity. Extreme events, including the summer floods of 2007 and the storms of the past few winters, have exposed the vulnerability of Britain’s infrastructure and our limited understanding of how it all plugs together. The Yorkshire phone exchange example above is one of many such incidences, and an increased reliance on “smart” technologies will increase our exposure to this particular risk.  Our analysis also identified other emerging risks from interconnectivity. For example, if a shortage of rain means rivers are running low then drinking water will obviously be affected – but also electricity supplies. Almost a quarter of the energy generated in the UK uses water from rivers to cool power plants. Problem is: no one seems to quite realise just how interconnected our infrastructure has become, and no one seems to be in charge of dealing with this risk. Most infrastructure sectors are already taking significant steps to manage these risks. Electricity companies have committed to invest around £400m to protect their most vulnerable sub-stations and power lines from flooding, for example. However, many of these adaptation actions are only sufficient for the next decade or two and, while this may seem far away, it can take years to plan and build major infrastructure like bridges and railway lines which might be expected to last 50-100 years, or several hundred years in the case of London’s sewers. Climate risks should be considered in all infrastructure decisions – after all, retrospective action decades from now would be more expensive and disruptive than getting it right first time. The UK needs a common and coherent framework for assessing risks from climate change, to guide everyone from road builders and town planners to power companies and sewage works. It won’t be easy. Such a programme will need to draw upon the very best that industry, government and academia has to offer to deliver something that is collectively owned and maintained.  We all know the climate is changing. We know infrastructure will be affected. But without a significant effort to develop a coherent way of assessing the risks from climate change, our response will continue to be reactive and ad hoc."
"The Greens’ electoral alliance with the Liberal Democrats (and Plaid Cymru) risks throwing their eco-socialism out with the remain bathwater (Report, 8 November). Greens have far more in common with Labour. Unlike the Lib Dems, Labour and the Greens support the radical transformation of society. Labour’s target is decarbonisation by 2030, the Lib Dems’ is 2045. Like 56% of voters (Majority of UK public back 2030 zero-carbon target – poll, 7 November), Greens are more likely to support Labour’s policy.  It is no coincidence that only Labour and Green MPs are contributors to Extinction Rebellion’s handbook This Is Not A Drill. Back in April, protesters chained themselves to Jeremy Corbyn’s gate, not Jo Swinson’s, saying he was the “best hope this country has got” to meet the challenges of the climate crisis. Furthermore, it is Labour’s shadow chancellor who promises to use every lever of government to fight the climate emergency. Like the Greens, Labour would never enter a coalition with the austerity-creating Tories. On Europe, the Greens and Labour support the most democratic solution (a second referendum) and their politicians play active and influential roles in the pro-remain leftwing Another Europe is Possible campaign. The climate emergency is the most important issue facing us. For this reason, tactical votes in marginal seats should be for Labour. The risk – in this uniquely important election – is letting in the hard Brexit Tories. And like Labour voters, Greens understand how destructive this will be in the fight against the climate emergency.Magi YoungExeter • Almost 33 years ago, in January 1987, you published a letter from Nina Fishman, the Labour and trade union activist, calling for a tactical voting campaign for the coming general election. She was hoping to at least offset the coming third victory of Margaret Thatcher to some extent. That letter led to the first significant organised television campaign. Sadly, Nina died in 2009 (you published an excellent obituary of her by Donald Sassoon). She would have been frustrated to see that electoral reform has still not been introduced for UK elections, and sad about the Labour party’s failure to understand the value of tactical voting. Among other things, that gave us a majority Tory government in 2015, and hence the Brexit crisis. But she would have been delighted by the historic pact between Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru. This is the first proper application of tactical voting by established parties. It could well deprive the Tories of a majority on 12 December. If Labour was able to enter a similar agreement it could do far more.Tim JohnsonLondon • It is ironic that Unite to Remain, founded by Heidi Allen when she was an Independent MP, has become a three-way deal between the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru, excluding the only grassroots pro-remain independent with a chance of winning: Claire Wright in East Devon. Claire won more than 21,000 votes (35%) in 2017 to the Tories’ 29,000, while the Lib Dems gained less than 1,500. Independents also won by far the largest share of votes and seats in this year’s council elections.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust a few days ago, the IPCC WG III report claimed that CO2 emissions could be curbed with little pain involved. Well, go tell it to the more than 300,000 Germans who have had their power shut off in a single year because they no longer can afford skyrocketing electric bills. And these people live in a rich country!
And imagine what expensive power means for poor, developing countries. In such countries it’s nothing short of widespread catastrophe and grinding misery.
The online site of German news television station NTV writes of a threatening energy poverty taking hold in Europe and that”more and more people are unable to pay for the electricity that they consume. More than 300,000 German citizens are going to have their power shut off each year.”
Hat tip: DirkH
NTV cites a report from German nation daily Die Welt, which writes German power companies turned off the power for 321,539 people because of non-payment in 2012, up from 312,500 people in 2011.
The reason for the high prices? NTV writes:
A reason for the increased number of power shutoffs is the rash expansion of renewable energies, which lead to higher energy prices.”
Two years ago NoTricksZone reported on an article also from Die Welt who claimed that 600,000 households were getting their power cut off. The figures on power service cutoffs vary broadly. Whichever figure is correct, the scale of the social disaster is immense no matter how you look at it.
It’s time to make energy affordable and attractive for every socioeconomic level, and not a luxury good for the upper classes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere are lots of claims on how successful Germany’s renewable energy program has been. Feed-in tariffs mandated by the government guaranteed profits for windpark investors and operators. You couldn’t lose. So it seemed at first.
Unfortunately outputs promised by wind turbine manufacturers and proponents have fallen short of expectations. Moreover, high maintenance costs have in many cases eliminated profits and resulted in losses for investors. As generous as the subsidies may be, profit from wind can be elusive.
So it comes as no surprise when we here how a group of 60 limited partners near Ettenheim southwest Germany have decided to dissolve the wind turbine operating company they had set up in December, 2000. Story in German at www.windwahn.de here. It lost money.
The 60 limited partners unanimously voted on Wednesday to shut down and liquidate the Windpark Ettenheim GmbH & Co. According to Windwahn, the wind turbine had been supplied by Nordex and “did not yield the expected performance“, so says managing director Andreas Markowsky.

It stood still for years, and finally it was taken down in the summer of 2013. In the meantime the concrete pad has also been removed. After the liquidation is completed, the area where the turbine stood will be re-naturalized under the supervision of forest authorities. …The wind turbine did not pay off.”
Windwahn writes that the turbine had been supplied by Nordex and came with a 5-year maintenance contract. But in the end, the turbine remained plagued by technical problems and the 60 partners all had to take a moderate loss on the investment: a bit more than 1000 euros per 2500 euro share.
Markowsky says that the turbine had serious technical problems from the start. For example when winds were strong during stormy weather, the turbine stood still instead of producing maximum output. The limited partners even had to take Nordex to court in bid to be awarded compensation in the amount of 1.8 million euros. Windwahn writes that the case dragged on for 5 years, during which the turbine remained idle and did not deliver any power. Finally, the court awarded the limited partners 1.4 million euros in compensation.
The limited partners had the chance to reduce their losses by taking advantage of the re-powering bonus offered by the German government. Under the scheme turbine operators are paid a bonus to trade up their old turbines for newer, more efficient ones. However, the bonus has been scrapped by the German government, effective August 1, and the offer ultimately was passed up.
The 60 limited partners have had enough of the wind energy business.

"“An electric ute would be great,” Rhys Jones says from the driver’s seat of his ute while waiting out the front of the work site. “I don’t know how much it would cost in terms of set up and all that, but I’ve been on jobs where I’ve seen electric cars. They sneak up on ya. There’s no motor in them, so the engines run silent.” Three months ago the 28-year-old South Australian carpenter bought a brand new 2019 Nissan Navara, NP300 dual cab ute. It cost $42,000, before he installed a new canopy to protect his tools, an upgraded suspension system, a winch, a bulbar and a scrub bar. With all the extras, the final price came to $58,000. It was a decision Rhys says he made for work, though the set up meant he could also go camping, fishing and four-wheel-driving on the weekends with friends. That said, the job often makes it hard to get away. He works six days a week for his dad’s construction company, Monday-through-Saturday, and is usually on site from 7am every morning. On engine preference, Rhys says he doesn’t know what the fuss is about. He doesn’t care so much what’s under the hood, so long as it does what he needs it to do – though anything that would help cut fuel costs would be welcome. A read-out on the dash of his ute tells him he’s been burning diesel at a rate of 11.4 litres every 100 kilometres. It doesn’t help that Australian fuel is of such low quality the average person is paying $500 a year just to drive the country’s roads. “It’s not fun paying for fuel,” Rhys says. “You’re basically burning money. Some people have different views on electric cars. On the way they were built, or how much energy they consume in that process.” “I don’t mind ’em. I’m not out to save the world or anything, but I like trying to do the right thing by trying to stop fuel emissions and trying to stop global warming and all that. Little things that if everyone did them, would help.” To date, however, the problem is that the choice in what vehicle to buy hasn’t been much of a choice at all, thanks to the lax Australian regulations governing fuel efficiency, CO2 emissions and fuel quality. Combined, these have worked to preserve the dominance of petrol engines in the market, while turning the car a person drives into an unlikely political issue. Back in April, Scott Morrison broke a tenuous bipartisanship on electric vehicles (EVs) in the lead up to the federal election when he slammed the innovations as a “threat to the weekend”. “I tell you what,” Scott Morrison said as the early April sun bore down on those gathered for a press conference in North Richmond. “[An electric vehicle] is not going to tow your trailer. It’s not going to tow your boat. It’s not going to get you out to your favourite camping spot with your family. “Bill Shorten wants to end the weekend, when it comes to his policy on electric vehicles. When you’ve got Australians who are out there in their four-wheel-drives, he wants to say ‘see you later’ to the SUV.” Those who might have otherwise excused such comments as brash rhetoric ahead of a do-or-die federal election thought better a few days later when the then environment minister, Melissa Price, announced the Coalition government would wait until 2027 to lift standards governing the quality of the country’s petrol. Australia has no ongoing emissions testing program of its own. Together the two events are indicative of the Coalition’s approach to road emissions. All told there are 19.5m cars on Australian roads but the strategy for managing their CO2 emissions may be best described as “hands-off”. The strategy has been to let other countries do the heavy lifting by relying on the passive transfer of technology as newer, more efficient cars are imported into Australia. On the face of it, the official stats lend credence to the idea, showing average CO2 emissions from the cars on Australian roads have been falling modestly over time. The catch, according to recent research by Robin Smit, adjunct professor at the University of Technology Sydney, is that those figures do not reflect lived reality. “Australia has no ongoing emissions testing program of its own,” Smit says. “In fact it hasn’t conducted vehicle testing since 2008, so we don’t really know how our fleet performs in the real world.” “Emission figures are therefore increasingly based on those in Europe, where lots of real-world testing has resulted since the Volkswagen scandal. The main issue is there is a gap between what happens in the laboratories and what happens in the real world.” When Smit corrected the difference to take into account real-world conditions, he found that CO2 emissions from passenger cars in Australia had hardly been trending down until 2014 and began to grow from 2015. “That directly contradicts the statement that our fleet average emissions are steadily going down on a per kilometre basis,” Smit says. The reason is the “double whammy” of a rising population – meaning more kilometres are travelled – and a growing number of heavier, thirstier SUVs on Australian roads. In fact, a separate study conducted by progressive thinktank the Australia Institute found vehicle emissions had risen 10% over the past decade as Australians had increasingly opted to purchase larger diesel vehicles. Report author Hugh Saddler, an energy expert and honorary associate professor with the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, found annual carbon dioxide emissions from burning diesel increased by 21.7m tonnes between 2011 and 2018. Diesel vehicles – mostly utes – have doubled their share of the light commercial vehicle market, and from a lower base tripled their share of household passenger car sales. Saddler said governments and industry had improved fuel efficiency of heavy road freight vehicles but done little to lift the efficiency of light vehicles such as the work ute or family car. One of the culprits for the uptick in purchases of these larger, dirtier vehicles may be what is known as the “leakage effect”. The effect was first seen in the US, where some states, led by California, introduced strict regulations governing fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions. Carmakers in the US responded to the regulatory changes by splitting their product range, sending cars with newer, more efficient engines to those highly regulated states, while the older and dirtier models in the product line went to those those without. The result was any beneficial CO2 emission reduction was cancelled out. Industry groups warn that Australia is at risk of similarly becoming a dumping ground for inefficient cars, if that hasn’t already happened. As a means of reducing transport emissions, regulating the trifecta of fuel quality, vehicle emissions standards and fuel efficiency represents a tried and tested strategy. The interaction between the three creates incentives for technological development while transitioning fleets to lower or zero-carbon status, but Australia appears to be failing on all three counts. On fuel quality alone, Australia ranks 66th in the world and the worst among developed nations. Its record on fuel efficiency and emissions standards is worse. Standards may cover 80% of the global car market, with the US having first introduced regulations back in 1975, but Australia has never had regulations for mandatory fuel efficiency or CO2 emissions – despite multiple calls for action. In July, a Senate select committee recommended standards be introduced, along with a national electric vehicle strategy as a way to transition the fleet. An earlier edition of the Coalition government created a body called the Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions to set standards on fuel-efficiency standards, fuel quality and CO2 emissions. Though the forum barely met in an official capacity, the research underpinning its work was performed in wide consultation with carmakers, industry bodies and a pantheon of relevant experts. As the 2019 federal election approached, however, its work stalled entirely, says Behyad Jafari of the Electric Vehicles Council. “We’d spent a number of years proactively working with the government for a long time,” Jafari says. “Then the government dropped it. Today it’s sitting there with no one working on it. It’s sitting on the top shelf, untouched.” Jafari says the international investors he regularly speaks to have been shocked by Australia’s total lack of regulatory standards. While he says companies are continuing to invest in Australia, the country has fallen further down the priority list when it comes to deciding what cars get sent where. It’s high-school science. Rubbish in, rubbish out To date the federal government has been attempting to plug the policy vacuum by having a team within the environment department write a National Electric Vehicle Strategy. The strategy will help manage the uptake of electric cars ahead of 2027 when they are projected to reach a tipping point in the market – the same year Australia is now pegged to get better-quality fuels. It will help, says Tony Weber, the chief executive of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, but without critical investment in basic infrastructure, Australia won’t catch up to the rest of the world. “We cannot run the most advanced engines in the world that are coming out of the latest R&D because of the fuel quality,” Weber says. “Even in the transition to electric, people will buy plug-in hybrids first, which won’t run properly on Australian fuel. “We can deliver the best-quality engines to Australian consumers, so long as we have the fuel to run them, but we don’t have the fuel. The two are interrelated. Better CO2 emissions are driven by better-quality fuel, so it’s high-school science. Rubbish in, rubbish out.” Weber says the situation is “enormously frustrating” for car companies, especially as the government appears attuned to lobbying efforts run by the petrol refining industry which have “kicked up a fuss”. It is a situation Weber says doesn’t need to exist, as the government could act any time, but so far it has simply decided not to. When asked why he thinks that is, Weber pauses for a moment before answering with a sigh. “You’re asking the wrong bloke,” he says."
"British Airways has pledged to review its practice of making aircraft carry tonnes of excess fuel to avoid filling up at destination airports, which saves money but drives up CO2 emissions. Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA’s parent company IAG, admitted that using the method – called “fuel tankering” within the industry – was “maybe the wrong thing to do” despite the financial incentive behind the practice, because of its environmental impact. Critics said the widespread use of fuel tankering called into question airlines’ commitment to reducing their impact on the environment. The information of excess fuel carriage came from a BA insider during a BBC Panorama investigation. IAG recently tried to burnish its environmental credentials with a commitment to become the first airline group worldwide to commit to net zero emissions by 2050. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  However, documents seen by the BBC showed a recent BA flight to Italy took on board nearly three tonnes of extra fuel: a cost saving of just £40 but which meant an additional 600kg of CO2 was emitted. Speaking to analysts last week, Walsh said BA often did fuel tankering in order to save money, citing the example of Glasgow airport where jet fuel is 25% more expensive than at Heathrow. However, Walsh said BA was now considering its position on the practice. “We continue to do tankering today. We’re challenging that, we’re asking ourselves whether this is sustainable, and whether we should be pricing in the environmental impact of that. “Clearly the financial savings incentivise us to do tankering. But maybe that’s the wrong thing to do.” BA said that its fuel tankering generated 18,000 tonnes of additional CO2 per year – less than 0.1% of its overall emissions – and that it accounted for 2% of tankering in Europe. A report from Eurocontrol, which coordinates air traffic control for Europe, estimated that airlines save a total €265m (£229m) a year through using the practice within Europe – but at the cost of an additional 901,000 tonnes of CO2. John Sauven, Greenpeace UK’s executive director said it was a “classic example of a company putting profit before planet … they’ll happily pour extra fuel on the fire for a small boost to their profit margin.” Meanwhile, a climate expert described a carbon offsetting scheme offered to customers by Ryanair as “woefully inadequate”. Passengers can pay a voluntary €1 donation when booking. Simon Lewis, professor of global change science at University College London, said that tree planting schemes funded by Ryanair in Ireland and Portugal would offset just 0.01% of the airline’s emissions. He said: “To me, that’s a green gimmick.” Michael O’Leary, Ryanair’s chief executive, told Panorama: “From little acorns grow mighty trees.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: Read meteorologist Joe D’Aleo: Should you trust NOAA claims about May and June records?
And: Who needs Antarctic data or temps near ice.
********************************
Some government scientists, it seems, are so obsessed and convinced with their global warming theory that they’d rather alter the observed data to suit their theory than to alter their theory so that it agrees with the data.
Over the last day or so reports have been appearing, e.g. here and here, claiming June 2014 globally was the hottest ever recorded. However data from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) show it’s not true (never mind all the cold reports coming from places ranging from Alabama, to the Alps, to Antarctica).
Unfortunately, some journalists are either too lazy or just too incompetent to check the facts.
At Twitter meteorologist Joe Bastardi has also posted a graphic comparing two charts from NCEP: June 2006 vs June 2014.

As NECP shows, June 2014 is significantly colder than 2006.

In fact, Joe provides a useful link that allows comparison for every year and every month.
Here are the NCEP CFSR global temperature results for June for the last 15 years with the ranking (warmest 1, coldest 15).
2014: +0.059 (12)
2013: +0.057 (13)
2012: +0.089 (9)
2011: +0.003 (14)
2010: +0.075 (10)
2009: 0.137 (6)
2008: 0.064 (11)
2007:  0.137 (6)
2006: 0.305 (2)
2005: 0.296 (3)
2004: 0.115 (8)
2003: +0.144 (5)
2002: 0.346 (1)
2001: 0.148 (4)
2000: -0.037 (15)
The data above illustrate a couple of things going on. Firstly, June 2014 is nowhere near “the warmest on record”. It is among the coldest of the 21st century.
Secondly the colder mean global June temperatures have occurred during the recent years, and the warmer ones earlier in the century (exception 2000), thus indicating that Junes have been cooling off. In fact, 4 of the 5 coldest Junes this century occurred in the last 5 years.
Indeed it’s little wonder that many areas are recording increasing number of cold events and the polar ice caps have been rebounding…all while dubious scientists have been claiming that the earth is heating up, backing such nonsensical claims with altered and tampered data. And at the rate the data fiddling is taking place and the earth is cooling off, we soon will be able to expect little ice age conditions at “record high” temperatures.
The only way the activist scientists will be able to save face, it seems, will be for the government to step in and declare climate data as official state secrets whose access will require special security clearances.

"The world’s most destructive mud volcano was born near the town of Sidoarjo, on the island of Java, Indonesia, just over 11 years ago – and to this day it has not stopped erupting. The mud volcano known as Lusi started on May 29, 2006, and at its peak disgorged a staggering 180,000 cubic metres of mud every day, burying villages in mud up to 40 metres thick. The worst event of its kind in recorded history, the eruption took 13 lives and destroyed the homes of 60,000 people. But although the mud is still flowing more than a decade later, scientists are not yet agreed on its cause.  The debate is whether the eruption of Lusi was due to an earthquake several days previously, or down to a catastrophic failure of the Banjar Panji 1 gas exploration well that was being drilled nearby at the time. Given the huge impact of the volcano on the communities nearby and the fields that were their livelihoods, why are we still unsure of the cause? Mud volcanoes are extremely common on Earth, with thousands of examples known worldwide. They come in many shapes and sizes and behave a little like their molten-rock counterparts, going through long periods of inactivity with periodic violent eruptions. Mud volcanoes, however, spew out not molten hot lava from the Earth’s mantle, but usually a cold mixture of gas, water and solids.  Some of the most spectacular examples of mud volcanoes are in Azerbaijan where they can range from a few metres across to the size of a small mountain. They are commonly found at tectonic plate boundaries, and also underwater at river deltas where sediment is buried rapidly, causing unusually high pressures to build up underground. The muddy mix is also pushed to the surface by the buoyant gas it contains. Usually mud volcanoes grow slowly, through layer upon layer of mud. What happened in Sidoarjo in 2006 is unique, with Lusi by far the fastest growing mud volcano we know of, having drowned surrounding houses, factories, places of worship and schools in a foul-smelling, emulsion-like mud. The journal Marine and Petroleum Geology is publishing a special issue that examines the ways this amazing phenomena is developing. It includes one paper by geoscientists Stephen Miller and Adriano Mazzini (“[More than ten years of Lusi: A review of facts, coincidences, and past and future studies”) that exhumes the debate of what caused the eruption, offering strong support for the earthquake as the trigger and dismissing the idea the borehole was responsible. The explanation implicating the drilling is that water from surrounding bedrock entered the 2,834 metre-deep Banjar Panji 1 well, which for its lowest 1,743 metres was unprotected by steel and cement casing. The pressure the water exerted was enough to fracture surrounding rock or pre-existing faults. Mixing with underground mud from the Kalibeng Formation, which makes up part of Java’s geology, this pressurised water and mud rushed to the surface through a fault, forming the Lusi mud volcano just 200 metres from the drilling site. The alternative explanation is that despite its proximity the drilling well was coincidental, and that the 6.3 magnitude Yogyakarta earthquake on May 27, 260km away had sent vibrations into the Kalibeng Formation’s mud layer, causing it to liquefy and rise to the surface under pressure.  That earthquakes can trigger eruptions has been documented as far back as Pliny’s Encyclopedia in the first century. It’s also the case that the eruption started as a series of small eruptions, all aligned along a geological fault, so the role of the earthquake certainly deserves full consideration. But in comparison with other eruptions triggered by earthquakes such as in Azerbaijan, Pakistan and California, the Yogyakarta earthquake was very far away given its size. More compelling still is that there have been bigger and closer earthquakes that have not triggered eruptions, while other earthquakes have caused greater shaking and vibrations right at the site of Lusi, yet nothing happened on those occasions. If the earthquake caused liquefaction we would expect to see the widespread release of gas from the liquefied layer – but a study by Mark Tingay and colleagues in 2015 showed this did not happen.   The well was drilled by the Indonesian company PT Lapindo Brantas, which blamed the earthquake. Information on the borehole was passed to us at the time, which showed there was an influx of water that we estimated was sufficient to cause the rocks around the uncased borehole to crack. So the new paper by Miller and Mazzini doesn’t bring any new information or reasoning to the debate, which will now probably remained mired unless new data from the borehole or from the critical period at the end of May 2006 comes to light, and this is unlikely.  Distinguishing between two hypotheses for a unique event can be a challenge. We cannot go back in time and collect the ideal set of data and samples to test the hypotheses, nor can we make direct comparisons with other similar phenomena for which we know the cause. There are other major disasters that we still cannot be certain had a man-made cause, such as earthquakes potentially triggered by filling dams with water.  In the case of Lusi, we very strongly favour the argument that the drilling was responsible, but neither of us were at the site of the incident almost two kilometres underground at the time to witness it, and more than ten years on it’s clear the data and reasoning behind our argument have yet to convince everyone."
"On the six-hour boat ride down the Iriri river to Manolito, there is almost no other traffic and only a handful of small homes. At its widest and calmest, the vast expanse of water is a flawless mirror of blue sky and green canopy. At its narrowest and roughest, the water churns around boulders eroded into the shapes of battlements and breaching whales. Parrots fly above the treetops. Fish feast on fallen blossoms. Kingfishers perch on riverside branches while herons await their prey on midstream rocks with their wings outstretched. White and yellow butterflies stumble across the river at remarkable speeds. It is in this idyllic setting, deep inside the Amazon rainforest, that a nascent alliance of traditional communities, climate activists and academics is re-imagining what the world’s greatest forest was, what it can be and who can best defend it. The gathering in Manolito, a riverine community of half a dozen wooden buildings in Terra do Meio (Middle Earth), contrasts sharply with what is happening elsewhere in the rainforest. Manmade fires continue to ravage swathes of Brazilian land. Scientists say the forest must be protected if the world is to avoid dangerous levels of global heating, yet the government of the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro has given the green light to farmers, miners and loggers to enter the region and cut down trees. The results will be apparent on Monday, when the government releases the latest annual deforestation figures. The forest’s traditional guardians – indigenous, riverine and quilombola (descendent of rebel slaves) communities – are expecting the worst and starting to fight back. Forging new alliances with young activists from Europe, they hope the connections will lead to more international support and greater overseas prominence for their long struggle to defend their land against invasion. The line-up in Manolito is eclectic. Extinction Rebellion organisers from the UK and school climate strikers from Belgium have worked alongside Nadya Tolokonnikova from the Russian feminist punk band Pussy Riot, learning about the forest’s history and role, and sharing ideas on how to defend it. Although it is 12 hours by bus and boat from the nearest city, this stronghold of nature is no longer far from the frontline of devastation. Most of Terra do Meio (a mosaic of conservation areas, indigenous territory and reserves) is inside Altamira – the huge municipality that has suffered the most fires, the worst deforestation and the highest murder rate in the Amazon. To get here, the participants travelled through the indigenous territory of Cachoeira Seca, which has been invaded by so many land-grabbers and illegal miners that the small population of Arara Indians are outnumbered 10 to one in their own land. This leaves them powerless to stop further intrusions. Anthropologists say they are now among the most endangered tribes in Brazil. There are other traditional forest dwellers looking for new allies, as they face the most hostile government since the military dictatorship that ended in 1985. The indigenous shaman and figurehead Davi Kopenawa Yanomami sees hope in the youth climate movement that has spread across the world in the past year. “It’s a new way of thinking and it’s very strong. The young from the cities are listening to the cry of the Amazon. They see the fire and the deforestation and they know that you can’t keep killing trees,” he said. All the world is talking about the Amazon. It’s very good. The new generation wants to save the life of the forest and the planet.” The event’s name – Amazon: Centro do Mundo – is a mission statement as much as a slogan on the participants’ T-shirts. The message is simple: if humanity is serious about dealing with the climate crisis and the collapse of natural life-support systems, the priority should be protection of the world’s biggest rainforest and its guardians in indigenous, riverine and quilombola communities. A key objective of the gathering – which is seen as a Forest COP – is to show that much of what the outside world believes about the Amazon is wrong. That it is more central to planetary life-support systems than most people realise. As well as being home to the richest biodiversity, and sequestering more carbon dioxide than any other land region, it is also a vital part of the planet’s cooling system. The meeting room doubled as a classroom. Conditions were basic – half a dozen wooden benches, four tables and a blackboard – but the lessons were cutting-edge: several of Brazil’s leading academics shared groundbreaking research on climate science, anthropology and archeology that upturned the popular history of the Amazon as an uninhabited, disease-ridden wilderness civilised by European colonialists and their descendants. The rainforest functions as the heart of the world, according to Earth scientist Antonio Nobre. Even more than sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere, the forest’s most crucial role is to pump water – the blood of the planet – through rivers and across the skies in the form of vapour, he says. This is done by the transpiration of billions of plants. Over time, satellite data of the world’s photosynthesis (essentially the green areas seen from space) shows the most regular pulse across the tropics, with by far the most vibrant beat in the Amazon. “When we are hot, we sweat. The forest does this – pushing 20bn tonnes of water vapour into the atmosphere each day. It’s part of the cooling system of the world,” said Nobre. “The relationship between the forest and water is extremely important.” This is nature at its most vibrant and super-diverse – but the forest is also far less wild than many realise. Brazil’s leading archeologist, Eduardo Neves of the University of São Paulo, came into the gathering with a ceramic fragment and a handful of black soil he had picked up outside. This, he said, was a sign the forest in this area was cultivated. The Amazon rainforest is made up of 360bn trees from at least 16,000 species (compared with just 72 species of trees in all of the United States, according to the scientists at the meeting). But just over 1% of the species account for almost half of the trees. Many of this super-dominant group were trees used by humans, such as acai (the most common tree in the forest), which is a primary source of nutrition in the Amazon. This is unlikely to be an accident, according to Neves. “This shows that the forest is not just the product of natural forces, it was nurtured by indigenous knowledge.” This was remarkably sustainable. For about 10,000 years, the indigenous residents of the forest cleared less than 0.5% of the Amazon while planting productive trees that enriched the soil and increased biodiversity, Neves said. The population thrived, reaching at least 8 million before European colonialists arrived, bringing diseases such as malaria, influenza and measles that – along with slavery and violence – wiped out 90% of the Amazon’s indigenous population. Over the past half-century, it is the forest that has suffered. A fifth of the Brazilian Amazon has been lost. Mega-projects are a major threat. Bebere Bemarai, of the Xikrin people, said his community at Trincheira Bakaja was affected by a series of new mega-projects as well as the centuries-old threats from land-grabbers and miners. The Amazon’s biggest dam, Belo Monte, which goes into full operation next year, has already devastated the Xingu river, killing fish and ruining livelihoods, he said. Next he fears a renewed push for a giant new Canadian gold mine, Belo Sun, in the same region. “Every day is a struggle. In every region it’s the same,” he told the group. “Our people will go to fight with you. Let’s help our families.” Tribes that were once enemies are now allying with each other and joining hands with two other former enemies – ribeirinhos (descendants of rubber tappers from the northeast) and quilombolas (descendants of rebel African slaves). These traditional forest dwellers share a common threat of encroachment by companies, government authorities and land-grabbers as the Amazon opens up and economic and political pressures increase. Maria do Socorro Silva, a quilombola leader from Barcarena, is opposing a mine – powered by the Belo Monte dam – and a Norwegian-owned alumina processing factory. “The company destroyed everything. They took my past and my future,” she told the meeting. “The river is poisoned. Future generations are born dead. The people of the forest aren’t protected. We decided to sacrifice our generation. We eat our poisoned food, but we don’t sell.” Without them, the forest is more vulnerable. More than cattle or soy, the biggest single driver of deforestation is land-grabbing for property speculation. Scarcely a tenth of the cleared land is put to use. Clearing forest increases the value of land 50- to 100-fold. With so much at stake, anyone standing in the way is dangerous, which is perhaps why only those with an attachment to the land are willing to risk their lives. Mauricio Torres, a social scientist at the University of Pará, said it was no coincidence that deforestation stopped at the borders of indigenous territory and the extractive reserves of indigenous people. It’s not because the state is protecting those areas but because the residents defend their land. That’s also why these areas have the highest murder rates,” he said in a talk after a dinner of locally produced food. “The only reason this area is still beautiful is because of the victories of the local riverine people who fought for it. I’ve been studying this most of my life, and what I have learned is the best way to protect the forest is to support the traditional families who live there.” To do this, some participants at the meeting proposed an international boycott of products that degrade the Amazon, such as soy and beef, and greater promotion of sustainable native fruits, such as acai and cupuaçu. Others said nature – particularly the rainforests – should be put at the heart of discussions at the United Nations climate talks that will be held in Madrid next month. Other plans will be discussed at greater length at a bigger civil society meeting in Altamira. Some of the European visitors said they were already revising how they see climate action. “The people of the forest and the forest itself completely depend on each other. This has changed the way I think. It’s not man and nature. They depend on each other. They can thrive together. That’s the big thing I will be taking back. The problem is not humans, it is the system,” said Alejandra Piazzolla, an XR Youth campaigner who recently graduated from university. Others said it made them appreciate that only focusing on emissions reductions can hurt some of the poorest communities, who are left with destructive dams and mines that provide the minerals for wind and solar farms. “We need to rebuild the forest because it is our heart. But we need to learn from the people here how to do that. It’s not just about new technology. It’s about the way we live. We can’t just focus on climate change. We have to focus on climate justice,” said Adelaide Charlier, an 18-year-old climate striker from Belgium, who spent six weeks on a sailboat to reach Brazil to keep her carbon emissions as close to zero as possible. Tiana Jacout, an Extinction Rebellion organiser from Somerset, said she would urge the organisation to include global justice among its demands. “The Amazon now feels really, really personal. It’s impossible to come here and not fall in love with the forest and the river and the people. And it is impossible to think that anyone would destroy that.” The biggest single driver of deforestation is property speculation. Wealthy individuals from faraway cities such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba hire grileiros (land-grabbers) to invade and clear the forest, then bribe officials to secure ownership rights. The value of the land increases 50- to 100-fold. Most of it goes unused. Tens of thousands of garimpeiros (illegal miners) clear forest and poison rivers while prospecting for gold. Even greater damage is done by corporate mega-mines, such as the one being planned at Belo Sun. The vast majority of timber in Brazil is cut illegally. The forest trails opened by loggers are often later used as access routes by land grabbers. Farming Cattle ranching has devastated the Amazon as trees are cut down to create pastures. Soy monocultures are an increasing threat, particularly in the south. Many of these products are sold in Europe, the US, China and Japan. Since the military dictatorship began building the Trans-Amazonian highway in the 1970s, deforestation has increased. As well as other roads, hydroelectric dams are submerging more forest and bringing more people to the region."
"The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, issued a plea last night to set aside public debates about climate change while communities are fighting for their lives and homes in the face of unprecedented bushfires. Speaking at the beginning of ABC TV’s Q&A program last night, Butler said his political colleagues on all sides should stick to an unwritten protocol of “putting political disputes aside” while people were in harm’s way during emergencies.  Butler’s comments came the evening after the morning of an incendiary statement from the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, who said anyone linking climate change to Australia’s ongoing bushfire disaster were the “ravings” of “pure, enlightened and woke capital-city greenies”. Fire authorities in New South Wales and Queensland are warning of horrific conditions for bushfires on Tuesday and Wednesday, with some areas seeing warnings hit “catastrophic” levels for the first time since the new category was added to the top of the fire danger index in 2009. Butler said while McCormack had appeared to have been reacting to statements from the Greens MP, Adam Bandt, the deputy prime minister should have “stayed above it” instead of entering into a public fight that was “beneath the office of the deputy prime minister”. Butler said instead of covering the impacts of the bushfires and the responses of communities to them, television news bulletins were concentrating instead on a political spat. There would be a time for a serious debate on the impacts of climate change, he said, but “that time is not right now”. If Butler’s plea to keep the climate change debate out of the bushfire response was meant to calm the Q&A audience and his fellow panellists, then it worked. But ignoring Butler’s request, the panel showed it was able to walk and simultaneously chew the climate change gum with a debate that never looked like teetering into the gutter of McCormack’s earlier “ravings”. The NSW firefighter James Lavery asked if fire services could be properly funded “particularly in the context of the growing threat of climate change?” A student, Poppy Burton, was part of a group that was “more inclined for direct action” to help regional communities with food and donations, rather, she said, than the “thoughts and prayers” offered by the prime minister, Scott Morrison. Moments later, the Liberal MP Jason Falinski responded with “our thoughts and prayers” for people in harm’s way. Does climate change cause bushfires? The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.  What is the evidence on rising temperatures?  The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. What other effects do carbon emissions have? Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.  So is climate change making everything dryer?  Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. What do recent weather patterns show? The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires? Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists. NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work. The former Rudd-era federal government climate adviser, the economist Ross Garnaut, remembered fondly the bipartisan support he said existed when he was commissioned to compile his landmark government review on climate policy in 2008. Back then, Garnaut said, the science “told us if we did not change the trajectory of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere” then the conditions for “difficult bushfires” would become more frequent. “Unfortunately, it looks like the science was right,” Garnaut said. The host, Tony Jones, handed Falinksi an audience question on whether the Liberal party had ever moved on from an era when its former leader Tony Abbott was describing the science of climate change as “absolute crap”. “Tony Abbott did not deny climate change,” offered Falinski who, with the gentlest of prods, decided not to prosecute his point. Sarah McNamara, the chief executive of the Australian Energy Council that represents electricity and gas companies, said there would only be progress when “politics and ideology” was taken out of the debate, segueing neatly to an audience question suggesting that energy policy should be removed entirely from political hands and given instead to regulators. Butler was pressed by an audience member and Jones on Labor’s climate policy, the latter wanting to know if the party would change its targets. While Butler would not rule out a change to better fit target years – based, for example on the year 2035 rather than 2030 – he said the party would have targets that kept the country on a “pathway to net zero emissions by 2050”. Garnaut drew on his new book, Superpower, to give the audience a glimpse of a future where the politics on energy had once again become bipartisan, and Australia’s economy was forging ahead on the back of some of the world’s cheapest power prices fed by its embarrassment of solar and wind resources. On that point, Jones asked Falinski if his party was still looking to subsidise a new coal-fired power plant. “No, it’s not an option we are considering,” said Falinski – a response that surprised Jones and, perhaps, might also surprise the Nationals senator Matt Canavan, who has been pushing for that outcome in north Queensland."
"A prominent former activist has accused Greenpeace of betraying its original ideas for supporting trophy hunting of polar bears. Paul Watson, now founder and director of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, made the claims in a lengthy Facebook post which has been shared 60,000 times.  Yet Watson misrepresents Greenpeace, Inuit hunting practices and polar bear trade data. He also demonstrates an adherence to an outmoded environmentalism in conflict with the human inhabitants of environments at risk. Watson’s post came days after the US announced it will no longer pursue an international ban on commercial trade in polar bear hides, a move welcomed by Inuit organisations, some polar bear specialists and environmental groups who had argued for years that climate change poses the greatest threat to polar bear populations. An ongoing campaign against trophy hunting affects Inuit livelihoods and diverts attention away from the bears’ real enemy: climate change. Most of the world’s 25,000 or so polar bears are found in northern Canada. Under the 1973 multilateral Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, the country has a legal and scientifically managed polar bear hunt. Only Inuit and trophy hunters guided by Inuit can hunt polar bears. On average, the quota allows for the killing of around 600 bears each year, and the number permitted is continually refined based on up-to-date scientific evidence. The largest part of the quota is used directly by Inuit. Polar bear meat is eaten by humans and dogs, and pelts are transformed into clothing and bedding, or sold at auction in southern Canada, where they enter international markets. A large bear pelt in good condition can fetch CN$6,000 or more (about US$4,700). In some communities Inuit choose to divert part of the quota to trophy hunters. In 2006, 153 bears were taken by trophy hunters. However, in 2008 the US Endangered Species Act listed polar bears as “threatened” and commercial importation of bear parts into the US was outlawed. As US citizens formed the largest trophy hunt market, by 2010-11 just 26 bears were killed for trophies. Contemporary Inuit live in a mixed subsistence economy. The prohibitive cost of snow mobiles, boats, fuel, firearms and ammunition prevents many from participating in traditional hunting and fishing activities. Those who earn money through wage labour often lack the time to hunt, and those with time often lack the money.  Diverting a small portion of the polar bear quota to the trophy hunt allows Inuit hunters, in culturally appropriate ways, to earn money that is then reinvested in their traditional hunting practices. Rather than the greed-driven Inuit portrayed by Watson, the CN$3,000-7,500 earned by one hunter once a year guiding a ten-day trophy hunt supports large extended families and helps indigenous people protect their culture. And while Watson claims there is nothing “traditional” about guiding trophy hunters, such work provides Inuit with opportunities to use their land skills and environmental knowledge in ways they cannot when employed at gold or diamond mines or in construction work. Since the US trophy hunt market closed in 2008, more Inuit have opted to sell their bear skins at auction, in order to mitigate the loss of trophy hunt income. The claim made by Watson that 300 bears will be killed by trophy hunters this year is a misrepresentation of trade data. According to the Canadian government, parts from around 300 bears do enter international markets from the country each year. Yet only a small proportion of these have been killed by trophy hunters. The remainder, including pelts from bears killed up to 30 years ago, come from the Inuit hunt and generate much needed revenue for financially insecure families. Whatever one’s feelings about the polar bear trophy hunt, neither an international ban on the commercial trade in polar bear parts nor an endorsement by environmental organisations will have any impact on the legal and well-managed polar bear hunt that exists in Canada. A ban on trade would only be to the economic and cultural detriment of Inuit. Greenpeace has never endorsed polar bear trophy hunting. It has, however, started to work more closely with indigenous peoples in Canada. It recognises, as does the WWF, IUCN and others, that small scale and culturally appropriate hunting by indigenous people does not threaten biodiversity. Indeed, it has developed a more nuanced understanding that biodiversity and cultural diversity go hand-in-hand.  Unlike more single-issue environmental groups, Greenpeace now recognises the need to collaborate with Inuit in the fight against climate change – a common foe that threatens both polar bears and humans."
"To mark Earth Day, Apple has launched Apps for Earth: a one week fundraiser for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) involving 27 popular gaming and utility apps that have developed special paid-for content and an environmentally themed front page to the App store. This partnership between Apple and WWF is symbolic of the rise of consumer environmentalism in our technological age – the idea that environmental concerns can be integrated into the production, purchase and use of consumer products and services. The first Earth Day, held at the height of the US counterculture movement on April 22, 1970, expressed a new environmental consciousness that galvanised a rapid and high-level political response. An estimated 20m people attended demonstrations and rallies calling for an end to polluting industries and making the point that healthy environments and quality lifestyles are interlinked. It lead to many of the environmental laws and institutions that we nowadays take for granted. Over the decades Earth Day has had a number of successful refreshes and now claims to be the largest secular observance in the world, involving more than a billion people every year. Maintaining and broadening engagement with the environmental movement is what it is all about. Apps for Earth certainly has the potential to build support among Apple’s tech-savy, global, middle-class customer base, but the direct financial contribution to WWF maybe more modest: Apple’s partnership with the Aids charity (RED) has raised US$100m since 2006. While this is a significant sum for any NGO it equates to just 0.18% of Apple’s US$53.4 billion net income in 2015. Carter Roberts, CEO of WWF-US, sees Apps for Earth as an example of the rich creativity and the big ideas with big impact that will enable it to succeed in its work. I am not so sure. From a business sustainability perspective this is a conventional deal: all parties benefit in terms of growth, productivity and risk management. Apple gains WWF’s endorsement for its efforts to green its supply chain along with a new “product” to offer its loyal customers, thereby enhancing and protecting its brand and motivating its environmentally-minded employees. WWF gains Apple and the tech media’s endorsement as the world leading conservation organisation and access to the tech-savy, middle class customer base of Apple’s App Store.  When it comes to saving the planet, big impact requires synergies between supporters and expertise. In a modern conservation organisation these imperatives are split between two professional “tribes” working in different departments and with different educations, career incentives and ways of working. At issue is the need for fundraisers and campaigners to communicate complex issues fast and in simple and appealing ways. This may not help build the deeper understandings required to generate support for the pragmatic solutions being developed by technical colleagues in programme departments, who engage with the messy and complex realities of the world over the long-term.  A case in the point concerns the massive investments in proposed new rail lines and roads that cut across protected natural habitats. Behind the scenes, conservation policy experts are generating frameworks, metrics, financial mechanisms along with the insider trust and influence needed to reduce environmental impacts, secure compensation where destruction of areas is unavoidable and identify win-wins where they exist. It’s a world of negotiation and compromise, of mitigation hierarchies and complex offset mechanisms, of shaping the future of the natural world as well as protecting the past.   This is modern conservation in practice, and it doesn’t translate easily into simple sound bites. It is increasingly at odds with the dominant fundraisier-campaigner narrative of “wonderful animals and landscapes which we will protect from the ills of the world for a small amount of your money, time and voice”.  Consumer environmentalism, such as Apps for Earth, aligns conservation with modern consumer culture. This offers fundraisers and campaigners the prospect of reaching new people and generating new funding streams, but it also carries the risk of ever more shallow public engagement and digital activism where masses of people get behind “solutions” that simply make themselves feel good. For a decade or more those in conservation with the grounded, technical know-how have been working with tech giants such as Google to develop open access tools that that enable and empower better environmental management. One of the best examples is the Google Earth Engine that allows sophisticated analysis of geo-spatial information and the development of open-source alert and decision support tools such as Global Forest Watch. Such tools are extending the reach of environmentalism into everyday corporate and investment decision making. Apple and Google have very different corporate ethos. Apple is founded on a belief in design and that simple things work, whereas Google believes in the power of data, is more collegiate and the engineers are king. Conservation fundraisers are attracted to Apple, while their more scientific colleagues are working with Google. Such alignments are understandable but they could also widen the gap between the popular and expert voices of environmentalism, creating a disjointed movement.  Earth Day needs to more than an opportunity for environmentalists to spread the word. It needs to be a day of coming together within the professional environmental movement. After all, the impact of half a million people marching down Fifth Avenue in April 1970 came from their demonstration of unity."
"The recent earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador happened within hours of each other, killing several hundred people. While both quakes were equally devastating for the countries and people involved, neither disaster has reached the scale experienced by Nepal last year. On April 25 2015 Nepal experienced a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that was followed 17 days later by a magnitude 7.3 earthquake. More than 5m people were affected and more than 8,500 killed. Between 1900 and 2015, there have been over 2.5m fatalities globally due to earthquakes, 30% of these have occurred since 2000.  The period 2000-2009 was the worst decade for earthquake fatalities on record, with more than half a million people killed. The current decade (2010-2019) is already on track to exceed that, with more than 350,000 people killed in earthquakes to date.  Of the five most deadly earthquakes in documented history, two have occurred since 2000; the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake that killed more than a quarter of a million people and the catastrophic 2010 Haiti earthquake – which has the highest death toll for an earthquake ever officially recorded (316,000). The 2000s also saw earthquakes in China, Pakistan, Iran and Japan take a combined total of more than 200,000 lives.  While the scale of these numbers is often shocking and highly emotive, it’s important that debates on the underlying science and appropriate mitigation are undertaken with care. Global population growth and urbanisation, especially in Asia, is certainly one factor influencing the high death toll. Asia currently has the highest number of mega-cities in the world, most of which are growing fast, with some expected to grow by more than 46% by 2030.  The number of people living in earthquake zones is now greater than ever before. This includes those living on the Pacific Ring of Fire – a long chain of volcanoes and other active structures surrounding the Pacific Ocean – and along the Alpine-Himalayan belt. This means earthquakes that would previously have killed hundreds now kill thousands or tens of thousands as a result of increased exposure. But increased exposure is by no means the only factor. The adage that earthquakes don’t kill people buildings do, highlights a key challenge in increasing resilience to earthquakes.  The scale of the problem is apparent when we consider that a 2007 study estimated that 90% of buildings in Iran and Nepal – two countries known to have high earthquake risk – had limited earthquake safety. But this problem isn’t unique to Asia. The same study estimated 60-80% of buildings in Austria, which is notably earthquake prone, were similarly vulnerable as a result of low earthquake awareness among professionals. While the knowledge needed to construct earthquake safe buildings is available –  even in some of the world’s poorest nations – its implementation remains challenging. A combination of weak governance, limited capacity and resources leaves this task seemingly insurmountable.  This is further exacerbated because earthquake disasters in any one location are actually quite rare – before 2015, the previous major earthquake in Nepal was 81 years ago – and so memories of just how catastrophic earthquakes can be quickly fade. Our research is taking a new approach by using “scenarios” based on observations from previous events to simulate the hazards that result from an earthquake. These are then implemented using civilian or military simulations that help to test the abilities of first-responders during a disaster. Scenarios are designed to simulate the consequences of an earthquake without having to experience one firsthand. They help to demonstrate the potential scale of earthquake impacts but also quantify how proposed mitigation – such as enforcing earthquake safe building codes – can have major positive effects.  By simulating changes to the current building stock, we can estimate how many lives could be saved as a result of efforts to increase resilience to earthquakes, for example. We know that buildings made from mud brick and earth are particularly vulnerable to earthquakes and replacing these could lead to substantial reductions in earthquake fatalities.  While our findings could aid decision makers, one criticism of this scenario approach is the focus upon a single event – which is by definition not the event that will happen next. However, we can explore multiple scenarios and assess where repeated losses recur – irrespective of the precise nature of each scenario tested. Major losses in different scenarios can then be identified and prioritised for mitigation. This approach allows us to consider how to address future earthquake losses, but it’s by no means a perfect solution.  In all earthquake prone nations seismic risks are just one of the many areas in need of investment. Consequently, it is often the nations with weak governance and the most limited resources that see the biggest loss to life from earthquakes. In these countries efforts to reduce such risks are superseded by the need to address livelihood demands such as clean water.  For countries like Nepal, where seismic risk is considered to be particularly pervasive, this approach can help ensure earthquake risk is considered and prioritise where to deploy the limited resources that are available.  As well as this, we need to continue to explore new ways to make buildings more resilient to earthquakes, but this needs to be coupled with methods to make these efforts sustainable, cost effective, and prioritised by decision makers. So while we can’t eliminate earthquake fatalities entirely, we can certainly work harder and smarter to reduce the losses and devastation that seem to go hand in hand when an earthquake hits."
"Energy, the environment and climate change were barely mentioned during the EU referendum campaign, and Theresa May has since spent little time worrying about how Brexit will change things. One reason for this oversight is that energy and environment policies are often regarded on the international stage as “low politics” – technical and unimportant issues, compared to the wars and conflicts that represent the “high politics” of statecraft. Yet the prime minister cannot avoid the environmental consequences of Brexit, as a new report from the House of Commons’ business, energy and industrial strategy committee illustrates. The report, produced by a cross-party group of 12 MPs, points out the UK’s participation in the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) and EU energy market has generally been a success. But May’s insistence on leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has major unintended consequences for nuclear power, while the committee also notes that Brexit has created investment uncertainty in the energy sector, and may lead to less ambition in UK climate change policy. The UK is currently a member of Euratom, an organisation established in 1957 to develop nuclear energy cooperation among the member states. It shares the institutional structures of the wider EU and therefore comes under the auspices of the ECJ. It has developed over time to encompass safety and regulation of the nuclear power sector, which provides 21% of the UK’s electricity.  Nuclear power has support from across the political spectrum. A range of people, from left-wing commentator George Monbiot to Conservative minister, Greg Clarke, agree it is an important source of “bridging” energy while the UK switches from fossil fuels to renewables.  Yet when Britain leaves the EU, more specifically when it removes itself from the ECJ’s jurisdiction, it will also leave Euratom, which currently provides the regulatory framework for the country’s nuclear power sector. It will take more than two years (the Brexit negotiation timescale) to develop new regulations, according to witnesses who gave evidence to the MPs’ committee. Without rapid agreement or a transition arrangement the UK’s nuclear power may grind to a halt. The committee also points out the uncertainty engendered by Brexit has implications for future investment in energy infrastructure, again noting the many positives that have emerged from EU energy policies. Industry actors have called for a range of policies and product standards to be retained in order to ease their continued trading relationship with EU partners. The energy labelling directives are identified as proving useful information for consumers, for instance, while EU energy efficiency rules have provided an extra push for the UK’s efficiency agenda. The report also notes the risk that the UK could go from being a policy-shaper in this field to a policy-taker. This risk is perhaps most relevant in the field of climate change where the UK has carved out a reputation as a leader by example, but may increasingly find itself having to follow the EU’s lead.  The future relationship between the UK and EU in relation to the Emission Trading System (ETS) is particularly problematic. The ETS caps the amount of greenhouse gases that a company is allowed to emit, but enables them to trade their emissions with others. On the one hand it is well established that the ETS has struggled to function effectively. However, it will be complicated, although not impossible, for the UK to disentangle itself from the ETS to establish its own trading system (one possible recommendation from the report). Finally, the question of Northern Ireland yet again rears its head. Northern Ireland and Ireland are part of a Single Electricity Market (SEM), which has been singled out for praise by the EU as “an exemplar of regional cooperation”. Yet this shining example may be at risk post-Brexit. The energy committee report has therefore added further urgent items to May’s to-do list for Brexit negotiations, just when European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker rated the likelihood of a successful agreement at less than 50%. It also serves as a useful warning to politicians: ignore “low politics” at your peril. Energy and environment policy might not be “sexy” but it is essential for the successful functioning of the UK economy and the future of its low carbon transition."
"Power to the people might remain a political pipe dream, but changes taking place in the energy market across Australia are making suburban homeowners the unlikely disruptors in an Uber-style revolution that promises to change how we all live. Despite a toxic political debate about energy that cost the last prime minister his job, thousands of households are showing Canberra the way forward as they group their individual solar systems together to form local networks that help to slash bills, stabilise the electricity grid and cut carbon emissions. Alan Hedges, a retiree in South Australia, is part of one so-called “virtual power plant” (VPP), hailed this week by the energy commission as the way of the future. With solar panels feeding a 10kWh storage battery at his house in Gilberton in Adelaide, Hedges is close to self-sufficient in power and has seen his bills fall to fraction of what he used to pay. The VPP means that electricity stored in his battery – and from others on the network – flows into the national grid at times of peak demand to balance the system and prevent outages. So not only is he reaping the financial benefits, he is also doing his bit to stave off the mass blackouts that brought the state to a standstill in September 2016. “I received my first bill the other day and it was $46.57 for 57 days, which works out at $1.68 per day,” he said. That’s 84% cheaper than his old bills of more than $1,000 a quarter. “I thought ‘wow’, they must have made a mistake. But I’ve read it through and it’s right. It’s amazing.” Hedges was helped by the South Australian government’s home battery scheme, and received $6,000 off the cost of his Tesla battery – about half the total cost. But the revolution is going on elsewhere, Elon Musk or not. Patricia Harris lives with her husband in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. Their panels and battery system have enabled them to become one of 237 households who are part of a scheme run by Ausgrid and a Canberra software company called Reposit. She welcomes the money they save – “we’re miles ahead on the deal,” she says – but there is another motivation at a time when the world is threatened by a climate crisis. “The system works and it works well. We are making a profit,” she says. “We’ll get the money back for the battery and panels, but we just liked the idea of it. We thought ‘we’ll do our bit for the environment’.” This empowerment lies at the heart of the matter, according to Rob Amphlett Lewis, chief customer officer at Ausgrid, which sees itself as facilitating sweeping changes that he likens to tech disruptors such as Uber and Airbnb. “It’s very much like Uber where the individual shares his car,” he says. “Here the individual shares his or her battery and they make money. “When we have high demand we can call on all that power stored in people’s batteries and ease constraints in the grid. The traditional way to fix this would be to build more infrastructure, but having batteries means we don’t have to build that infrastructure. “This really is the future and it’s coming very quickly.” Reposit has been creating such systems in Australia for six years. Its chief executive, Dean Spaccavento, says the company now has thousands of customers up and down Australia’s east coast, from Queensland to Victoria. It adds one megawatt of capacity every month, which is the equivalent of 100 households with a 10kWh battery, and hopes to add 5,000 customers in the next 12 months. The particularly smart part of the system – and others like it – enables the battery to think for itself so that it can be set to control household appliances according to when they are cheapest to use. This reduces demand at peak times and means there is more power from home batteries to be diverted into the grid. Amphlett Lewis says: “Home energy systems mean appliances such as aircon can be controlled to stay at a certain temperature. It means we consume less. If lots of people turn down their aircon slightly, it doesn’t inconvenience anyone but it can make a big difference and facilitate the use of renewable energy.” The scheme has been so successful that Ausgrid is planning a community battery scheme in Sydney and is looking for would-be participants to register. This would allow anyone with solar power to connect to the battery and deposit and withdraw electricity. “It means less infrastructure so more savings,” says Amphlett Lewis. “It’s a win, win, win for the community.” And while it might not fix Australia’s energy woes overnight, it appears to be an important step forward and one in which many people will be able to take part. “There is no one silver bullet to fix the problems with the Australian electricity market. But these sort of ideas will deliver the future of energy. Customers are taking a big, big role and our role is to facilitate it.”"

Part 4/4. The Iron Age to the Present
Research by Ed Caryl
Climate historians usually recognize one Holocene Climate Optimum, from the end of the last ice age to about 4000 years ago. But as we have seen in this series of articles, there were three major warm periods, the first in the Upper Neolithic from 11,000 years BP to the 8.2 KY event, another from 8.2 KY to the 5.9 KY event, then the Bronze Age from 5.9 KY to 3.2 KY before present.
Each warm period resulted in a rise in sea level, the first melting most of the remaining ice from the ice age, the second finishing off the last ice in Canada and northern Europe. Each of these warm periods gave rise to a surge in population and technology. Each warm period advanced civilization. In the Bronze Age, empires arose in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Anatolia. At 3200 years ago, all this came to an end.
At 3200 years BP, cold dropped sea levels by over 2 meters. Populations went on the move in response to crop failures. The Egyptian, Hittite, and Mycenaean Greek empires collapsed. Piracy (the Sea People) reigned supreme in the Mediterranean. No one knows for sure who the Sea People were because their incursions did not result in their establishing another empire, they simply looted and destroyed most of the cities around the Mediterranean. This was the Greek Age of Heroes. The time Homer attempted to record in the Iliad and the Odyssey. The history of this period survives as myth. This was also the time of Moses as recorded in the first four books of the Bible.

Figure 1 (from upper to lower trace) is sea level, Greenland ice core, and Antarctic ice core temperatures, with the orange Alpine Recession time line at bottom. Some notable events are indicated on the Greenland temperature trace.
Trade was interrupted during this period, so tin imports for bronze were cut off. Bronze continued to be recycled, but the shortage encouraged the use of iron. This was the beginning of the Iron Age. The Iron Age should probably be called the steel age because pure iron is nearly as soft as bronze. Early blacksmiths learned quickly that working carbon into the iron made it much harder. Doing so results in steel, but making steel requires high temperatures making it more costly, so steel edges were welded to iron axes to produce an edge that would remain sharp with use while the whole tool remained less expensive. This is sometimes still done today.
Cool periods brought on plagues and death
The Greek Dark Age lasted for 300  years. Other areas recovered a bit more quickly, but Greece even lost their written language during this interval, only recovering it in the Greek Archaic Period. The Archaic Period began during a warm period seen in a 200-year period of Alpine Recession, sea level stabilization, and southern hemisphere warming. In this period, architecture, art and literature of all kinds flourished. Population increased. Greek colonies were established all around the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts. All this came to a halt in another cool period.
In 430 BCE, the Plague of Athens struck. It has not been determined what pathogen caused this plague. Typhus, typhoid, the Ebola virus, Marburg, Small Pox, and Measles have all been suggested as possibilities. It killed a third to two-thirds of the population of Athens, including their general at the time, Pericles. It weakened the Greeks to the extent that the Macedonians, and then the Romans, dominated Greece until the middle ages. Population and trade growth at this time exacerbated the spread of disease across the then known world. If the Plague of Athens was caused by the Ebola or Marburg virus, import of animals from Africa, as well as overcrowding and poor sanitation, was the likely cause.
Temperatures and sea levels were rising after this time. Alexander the Great conquered most of the Middle East, but after he died, his generals couldn’t hold that territory. Rome began to flourish, and by 100 Common Era (CE), had conquered most of Europe and a large part of the Middle East. The glaciers in the Alps were in recession for 300 years, 150 years before, and 150 years after, the birth of Christ.

Figure 2 is a map of the Roman Empire in the time of Emperor Trajan. (Wikipedia Commons)
A period of cooling then began in about the year 150 ACE. The Hatepe/Taupo Lake VEI 7 eruption took place in 186 CE. The dust and sulfates may have precipitated more cooling, and the effects were seen in Rome and China. Sea levels began to fall. Crops in northern Europe began to fail. Disease began to take a toll.
The Antonine Plague struck Rome in 165 CE, lasting for 15 years. It killed up to one million people and devastated the Roman army. A few years later, the Plague of Cyprian in 250 to 270 CE repeated this devastation. These plagues carried off several Roman Emperors and caused manpower shortages in agriculture and the Roman army. During this period, germanic tribes began moving south across Europe, putting pressure on Rome at a time when Rome could least resist.
As the temperature dropped from the high of the Roman Warm Period, conflict and migrations stirred Europe and the middle East. Plagues and warfare continued to impact populations. For example, the population of Rome went from one or two million at its hight in the 2nd Century to as low as 100,000 in the 6th Century. The Plague of Justinian struck the eastern Mediterranean in 541 CE. Over the next few years it killed perhaps 25% of the population. As many as 25 million people died over the next three centuries. More migrations took place. This population summary is taken from Wikipedia here. The population levels of Europe during the Middle Ages can be roughly categorized:[1]
•       280–400 (Late Antiquity): population decline.
•       400–1000 (Early Middle Ages): stable at a low level.
•       1000–1250 (High Middle Ages): population boom and expansion.
•       1250–1350 (Late Middle Ages): stable at a high level.
•       1350–1420 (Late Middle Ages): steep decline
•       1420–1470 (Late Middle Ages): stable at a low level.
•       1470–onward: slow expansion gaining momentum in the early 16th century.
Notice how this description follows the global temperature as seen in the sea level curve in Figure 1. During the Medieval Warm Period, 950 to 1250 CE, and the resulting population boom and expansion, the construction of large cathedrals began all across Europe. The Vikings expanded across the Atlantic to Iceland and Greenland, even briefly establishing a colony in Newfoundland. All this came to and end, again because of climate. Mt Rinjani in Indonesia, erupted in a VEI 7 event in 1257 CE. This event may have precipitated the Little Ice Age. There was a famine across Europe in 1315, caused by bad weather triggered by another volcano, Mount Tarawera in New Zealand. The Black Death struck in 1346, beginning in the Crimea. It is estimated that 30 to 60% of the European population died. The Spörer Solar Minimum from 1460 to 1550 contributed to low temperatures. 
Figure 3
The low-stand in global temperature in the Little Ice Age is reflected in the CO2 level as seen in the Antarctic Law Dome ice core data, Figure 3. This is because of lower sea surface temperatures. Low temperatures span the Maunder Minimum and end at the Dalton Minimum of the early 19th Century.
If the solar minimums of the 15th and 17th centuries contributed to the Little Ice Age, then the Modern Maximum must contribute to our current higher temperatures. As one can clearly see, high temperatures drive increasing populations, increasing crops, increasing innovation and technology.
Low temperatures drive famine, disease, social unrest, and declining populations. In the last 10,000 years, There were many times when the temperatures were higher than today. These were times when mankind expanded in many ways. We have had times of cold in the recent and far past. These were times when humanity declined.
We need not fear warmer temperatures. We do need to prepare for cooler temperatures, whether those arrive next winter, decade, century, or millennium.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman center-left, climate alarmist daily Die Zeit here writes about the latest report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) which states atmospheric greenhouse gases have reached “a record high”. The results are based on data from 2013.
Chart Source: www.c3headlines.com
What is interesting about the Die Zeit piece is that it now talks about the oceans’ role on climate, which is getting more and more attention from climate scientists and the media lately. Die Zeit quotes Wendy Watson-Wright of the UNESCO Ozeanography Commission:
It is high time that in climate discussions the oceans become a central element as the driver of the global climate and dampener of climate change.”
Granted the spooked scientists are now conjuring up ideas to explain how the absorption of CO2 by the oceans could later lead to even worse climate scenarios, but here we see they are no longer able to deny the oceans’ role as they had always done before.
Die Zeit also writes that efforts by the global community to curb greenhouse gases have been fruitless so far and blames the “growing global economy” for the rising levels of CO2. Here we see the glaring paradox: More CO2 is leading to more prosperity, yet climate alarmists are always telling us the less CO2 would lead to better living when in fact it just doesn’t.
“Minimal willingness to really reduce emissions”

There’s also another reality that can no longer be denied. Die Zeit, perhaps unwittingly, confirms that the global community has lost interest in the futile pursuit of attempting something that is simply unachievable. It quotes a climate expert (emphasis added):
Also climate scientists such as Martin Claussen, Director of the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology and Professor at the Meteorological Institute of the University of Hamburg, are not surprised by the results of the report. ‘In view of the political situation and the minimal willingness to really reduce emissions, we expect nothing other than a further incrse in CO2 concentrations.'”
The movement has definitely lost steam. There’s probably reasons other than economic ones as to why politicians have lost interest in punishing voters with painful mandatory CO2 reductions. One reason seems to be that politician are increasingly becoming aware that CO2’s impact on climate had been grotesquely inflated in the first place (see chart above). Depending on the dataset used, global temperatures have not risen in over 18 years, and have actually been cooling over the last several years.
Obviously politcians are having doubts about the sustainability of the global warming scare, and are probably even relieved that they no longer have to deal with the unpopular politics of demanding that people make do with much less.
Die Zeit quotes WMO General Secretary Michel Jarraud:
The greenhouse gas report shows us that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is long way from going down. We have to reverse this trend, and reduce the emsissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases across the board. We’re running out of time.”
Obviously many politicians have stopped listening. Almost two decades of no warming tends to have that affect.

"Glastonbury, Britain’s largest and most famous music festival, is a great symbol of the many faces of the global climate change debate. It’s full of people enjoying life and relying on technology, easily available energy and consumer goods, yet it’s also deeply rooted in environmental and social justice concerns. And, of course, it’s also hugely exposed to extreme weather.  If the party is to keep going, can all these be reconciled? And what will it look like in the future – will it need to adapt to survive? The climate is of course already changing. When Glastonbury’s founder Michael Eavis was born in 1935, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was not far above 300 parts per million (ppm). It’s now above 400ppm and rising, due to the emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities. Around the time of Eavis’s first festival in 1970, early efforts at climate modelling were predicting that the world would warm by 0.6°C by the year 2000. The actual observed warming was around 0.5°C, and again this is still rising. The wider effects of this are beginning to emerge. Spring is occurring earlier, and there is generally more green vegetation worldwide due to rising CO₂ itself and also the warmer weather it brings. Average sea level is rising. There are more extremely hot days, fewer cold nights, more rain coming in heavy downpours, and more severe forest fires. The overall trend is clear: a changing climate, and the potential for increasing risks in future. This year is the 47th anniversary of Glastonbury. By the time of the 100th anniversary in 2070, the high emissions scenario studied by IPCC implies a global warming of between 2.5℃ and 4℃ relative to pre-industrial levels, exceeding the 2℃ limit that most of the world’s countries have agreed to try to stay “well below” in the Paris Agreement. Even current pledges on emissions still imply warming above 2℃. A warmer world inevitably means further rises in sea level, due to melting land ice and the expansion of water as it warms. Global average sea level could rise by between about 30cm and 50cm, possibly more if large ice sheets collapse. In a 2.5℃-4℃ warmer world, much larger rises in sea level would be locked-in for centuries to come – a cause of deep concern for small island states and low-lying coastal regions. Exactly what this means for south-west England, and Glastonbury, is hard to pin down. Climate models tend to project milder, wetter winters, and hotter, drier summers (although some models suggest summers will be slightly wetter). But even if summers do become drier overall, when it does rain we can expect more intense downpours, as already happens in hotter climates elsewhere in the world. Therefore we can expect increased flooding risk in both winter and summer. Glastonbury is of course famous for its mud and occasional floods. Nearby are the Somerset Levels, a coastal plain also famous for widespread flooding both from rain and, occasionally, from the sea. The plain is around six metres above sea level, so would not be permanently underwater anytime soon, but rising sea levels will leave the area more exposed to temporary coastal flooding. The two sides of Glastonbury perfectly illustrate the challenge facing society in reducing our impact on the environment. One the one hand, the festival has strong environmental traditions – the site at Worthy Farm has a fair amount of solar panels, and sustainable transport and recycling are strongly encouraged. On the other, there is no escaping the fact that the many stages have huge power demands, many festivalgoers will be keeping a concerned eye on their smartphone battery life, and private car and air travel are still prominent. At least one company offers customers the chance to beat the traffic jams by arriving via helicopter. (I mention this not in a judgemental way – I’d love to fly in myself if I could afford it – but just to point out that this is a reality of a huge party popular with people from all walks of life.) All this easily-available energy is part of modern life that we take for granted, but it is also influencing the environment. For decades, we’ve been burning fossil fuels to power our worldwide increase in welfare and living standards, deforesting land to make way for food production, and producing cement to build our houses and the infrastructure that supports our enjoyable way of life. These advances have had huge benefits for global society. How can we keep the benefits and share them more widely while reducing the collateral damage to the climate before it becomes too severe? Frankly, how can we keep the party going without trashing the place? Glastonbury is a pioneer of green thinking, but is the received wisdom of relying on renewables enough? It is increasingly argued that we need to consider a full toolbox of solutions, including some options that go against Glasto’s hippy traditions. At the other end of the Somerset Levels is Hinkley Point, site of an existing nuclear power facility with expansion in the pipeline. Can a major power-hungry festival survive and thrive in a UK energy system without the nuclear option? What risks can we accept, both from climate change itself and the potential solutions that may be required? Can we minimise these risks in clever ways?  These are the conundrums we need to debate, and the challenges we need to address, illustrated by 200,000 people enjoying themselves for a few days in Somerset.

"Further heavy rainfall has been forecast for the UK this week and more flooding is expected as communities already affected struggle to cope. Seven severe “danger to life” flood warnings remain in place in South Yorkshire in areas along the River Don. The Met Office also issued 41 active flood warnings and 94 flood alerts, and said a weather system moving across Europe would bring a “fair amount” of rainfall to England and Wales. Widespread flooding affected towns across the Midlands and northern England on Thursday and Friday. The body of Annie Hall, the former high sheriff of Derbyshire, was found in the River Derwent on Friday morning after she was swept away by flood water in Darley Dale near Matlock. Parts of the village of Fishlake near Doncaster in South Yorkshire were still cut off on Sunday, and under a metre (3ft) of water from the nearby River Don. Only tractors were able to get in by road. The local council called on residents to evacuate their homes. A rest centre was set up on at nearby Stainforth community centre for evacuees. Among visibly shaken arrivals from Fishlake were Chris Davies and Lorraine Healy. The flood waters rose so quickly on Friday evening that they were only able to grab two small plastic bags of clothing, and their three animals, a rabbit and two parrots, they said. “My whole car was under water. It took 30 minutes for everything to get flooded,” said Davies, 33. His rabbit Amber and parrot Jojo were safe but his other parrot, Ruby, had died of stress, he said.. He thought his house must be under four or five feet of water. He and Healy had borrowed money to stay at a local hotel in Lakeside, he said. Dan Greenslade, also from Fishlake, had been trying to get back to his flooded house after his girlfriend gave birth to their daughter on Friday. “I know it’s under water. A neighbour sent some pictures of the outside of it. But that was yesterday, and they say the waters are rising,” he said. “We’ve just decorated it and we moved in three weeks ago to get ready for the baby.” They were staying with his girlfriend’s parents in a nearby village, and friends had donated a Moses basket and baby clothes. “So the baby’s OK. But all of her stuff is at our house.” Nigel and Stephanie Roberts, who moved to Fishlake two months ago had been staying with their son in neighbouring Hatfield since the early hours of Saturday. They were hoping to hitch a ride to their home with a food convoy to rescue their parrot, Del Boy, who was stranded on the top floor. Stephanie said: “The garage started to flood about an inch and within two hours we had a foot of water. Then it entered the house and the kitchen. It was bubbling up through the floorboards.” About half of Fishlake’s 700 residents had already left, some spending Saturday in the Hare and Hounds pub, and others seeking shelter and company in the church. Others were staying in the upper floors of their homes. Some remaining residents have criticised Doncaster council for leaving them stranded. The council said it was unable to provide “on-the-ground support” because the area was covered by a severe flood warning and the advice was for residents to evacuate. Roselyn Jones, Doncaster’s mayor, said the Environment Agency had warned the water level could rise further. “The recommendation is to evacuate. Our first priority is preserving life,” she said. The Hare and Hounds were supplying food to those stranded in their homes, but the landlords, Angie and Scott Godfrey, tsaid on social media on Sunday that they were “fuming” that Doncaster council had not kept them supplied. “We have been inundated with calls, messages from people wanting a HOT MEAL. These people have no electricity & are living upstairs. We have the equipment to cook the lunches, we just need the food!!” they wrote on Facebook. South Yorkshire police said it had extra officers working in Doncaster to patrol and protect the evacuated areas. The Environment Agency said water levels on the Don had peaked in most places and were receding, but warned of more wet weather that “rivers may respond quickly to” on Monday and asked people to sign up to flood warnings. Sophie Yeomans at the Met Office said it was going to be an “unsettled week in terms of rain”. The forecast was for rain to reach Northern Ireland on Sunday evening, before affecting Wales and north-west England later and then spreading across the rest of the UK into Monday morning. Northern Rail said disruption in South Yorkshire could continue until Tuesday morning in some areas and that a significant amount of work was required before the tracks were cleared. Flood waters continued to subside, but tracks in several locations remained under water and debris and damage were surfacing as they receded, it said."
"Fly out of Delhi and you can see it: a band of grey smog, so thick it blots out the sun. Tune in carefully and you’ll hear it, too: a subtle symphony of snorts, coughs and wheezing. To the untrained nose, Delhi’s air is a potent bouquet. High notes of charred biomass mingle with sulphurous remnants of Diwali bonfires, with base notes of subsidised diesel, burned plastic and coal. I moved there in early 2017. To me, a relative outsider from south-east India who spent her 20s trying to draw attention to injustices in India’s coal belt, Eau de Delhi smelled a bit like justice. It was only fair that the city’s most powerful and privileged breathed a fraction of what they extracted from communities who relied on land and forest. I hoped that this toxic air would waft down the same corridors where environmental safeguards had been rapidly undermined by the Modi government. I was wrong. Jet-setting politicians almost never shared the same airspace; they keep office windows closed with air purifiers on. Barely a year of bloodshot eyes and blocked sinuses later, I left Delhi, conscious of the privilege to be able to do so. For my wisest counsellors – the city’s auto-rickshaw drivers who didn’t wear masks, and chain-smoking environmentalists – leaving for good was not an option. What is it like to live and love in a city that shoves two packs of cigarettes down your throat every day without your consent? How did Delhi get here? Its geography doesn’t do it any favours. Delhi is a land-locked city-state of 29 million. In winter, low-speed winds bring dust from the Gulf and cold-air inversion keeps pollution close to the ground. Delhi borders the wheat-bowl states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana, which were the laboratories for India’s green revolution – a revolution that rescued India from famine, but the city is now facing the fallout from industrial farming and climate change that’s changing rainfall patterns. Farmers have an extremely short window to clear their land for the sowing of winter crops. There’s not enough machinery to go around, little demand for biomass power plants and no assurance that early maturing seeds will ensure high yields. Farmers confess they have no choice but to set fire to their fields, but the smog affects them, too. Delhi also has 13 coal-fired power plants within a 300km radius, and hundreds of cement plants and smaller factories to cater for the construction of a new urbania that knows no seams. Throw in the waste of a metropolis and you have a steady toxic baseline, summer and winter, that is said to shave seven years off your life. The inertia around the capital’s killer air, however, owes a lot to a unique political deadlock. Delhi is host to the Narendra Modi-led government, the Aam Aadmi party (AAP) at state level, and a municipality administered by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP). Ask for accountability and things get tricky. Crop-burning spans multiple state borders and ministries. Communication breakdowns have bordered on the ridiculous in recent years, with the state’s chief ministers trying to set up emergency meetings via public spats on Twitter. In charge of Delhi is Arvind Kejriwal from the AAP. His “common man’s party” was formed on the back of a powerful, nationwide movement in 2013 that promised to clean up politics. AAP came to power in Delhi in January 2015 promising cheaper electricity, a transition to renewables, and an end to the city’s pollution and water woes. Months later, key environmentalists in AAP were ousted, including activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who took on coal oligarchs in court, and pro-farmer Yogendra Yadav, prompting another prominent activist, Medha Patkar, to quit. In Kejriwal’s first winter as chief minister, he announced an odd-even traffic scheme as an emergency measure on a trial basis: drivers with odd-numbered plates could drive on odd days of the month and vice-versa. It was met with disbelief, valid questions of who it let off the hook and attempts to subvert it. Single-SUV households became double-SUV households to circumvent the ban. Studies show particulate matter levels did go down at choke points. But activists say shutting down Delhi’s more than 40-year-old Badarpur power plant in 2018 was far more effective in easing the city’s airways. Cut to a few weeks ago. The AAP government announces free public transport on the city’s buses for women, but this is dismissed as an election gimmick by the BJP. AAP rolls out odd-even again and a defiant BJP MP rides into the heart of the city in an odd-numbered car on an even-numbered day in protest. Delhi’s coal plants fail to meet emission standards that the BJP authored four years ago, but a BJP leader wonders aloud if Pakistan and China were releasing noxious gases. Which takes us to this week, when India’s supreme court ordered “the entire police machinery to ensure that not even a single incident takes place of [crop] burning henceforth”. The directive has brought temporary relief but is also deeply unsustainable and classist. What the highest court has done is force poor people, once again, to shoulder the burden of environmental accountability, while putting them at risk of punitive action. It’s a pattern that environmental movements know well. The past five years have seen vicious reprisals against indigenous defenders, bright lives reduced to statistics in Global Witness reports. These indigenous people resisting encroachments, such as large-scale deforestation by big coal, are on the frontlines of the battle against climate breakdown. Many of their strongest advocates have allegedly been spied on. While big polluters can fund political parties using electoral bonds, which are effectively anonymous, organisations such as Greenpeace have been crippled by Modi-imposed funding restrictions. But urban climate movements are wising up. This week, Delhi mothers and sanitation workers stood together with banners screaming #BullshitNoMore. And, faced with storm surges that could wipe out the city, Mumbai’s well-heeled stood with Warli tribe elders to save the Aarey forest, the last of the city’s lungs. On the hallowed steps of Bangalore’s town hall, the city’s de facto protest site, I spotted hundreds of new faces at this September’s school strikes. “A for apple, B for ball, climate change will fuck us all!” screamed eighth-grader Greta-believers at their first ever protest. Seven of the 10 most polluted cities in the world are in India. If the nation is to breathe better and survive the crises at its door, it could use a whole lot more irreverence and unlikely alliances – holding to account governments that do not consult the worst-affected on decisions that affect us all. There can be no climate justice without equality – locally, intergenerationally and internationally. Will politics ever catch up? • Aruna Chandrasekhar is an independent journalist from India.

"The science now tells us that diesel vehicles cause more than four times the pollution than petrol cars. Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London Diesel cars have recently become subject to considerable negative publicity thanks to the amount of toxic emissions they produce. Some governments are planning to discourage their use or even ban them from urban areas altogether. Yet some diesel car owners have reacted angrily, arguing they bought the vehicles because they were supposedly the environmentally friendly option. Diesel was promoted as a more environmentally friendly fuel as part of the EU’s response to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide (CO₂). Diesel engines are “lean-burn”, meaning they use less fuel and more air to get the same performance as a petrol engine. So, while diesel fuel contains slightly more carbon (2.68kg CO₂/litre) than petrol (2.31kg CO₂/litre), overall CO₂ emissions of a diesel car tend to be lower. In use, on average, this equates to around 200g CO₂/km for petrol and 120g CO₂/km for diesel.  But even when governments were promoting diesel cars, we knew there were issues with toxic emissions (those immediately harmful to humans, not CO₂). Heating air in an engine produces nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) which include the toxic nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N₂O) and nitric oxide (NO), which reacts with oxygen to form NO₂. In a petrol car, these can be cleaned up by a three-way catalytic converter so that it emits on average around 30% less NOₓ than a diesel car, without after-treatment. We know that long-term exposure to nitric oxide can significantly increase the risk of respiratory problems, and so these emissions have been regulated for some time. The fine particulate matter (PM) that diesel engines produce also causes cancer and can have acute respiratory effects. Particulate filters in car exhausts can reduce PM emissions by more than 90%, but they require good operating conditions and regular maintenance. They can also produce more nitrogen dioxide, making diesel one of the main sources of this toxic gas. For all the differences between petrol and diesel cars in the past, current EU emissions standards for new vehicles of both types are quite similar. But there are still many older cars on the road that conform to earlier emissions standards. Plus, in order to achieve these standards, diesel engine manufacturers have had to resort to technologies such as particulate filters, which tend to clog up when used mainly for urban driving. And the latest emissions technology requires the owner to regularly add a urea mixture such as AdBlue to the engine. By contrast, petrol emissions systems regulate themselves, needing less driver input. The problem is that governments often fail to grasp that focusing on one issue at a time, such as CO₂ output, inevitably leads them to ignore others, such as toxic emissions. It seems likely that to tackle both problems, governments will eventually have to start banning vehicles with internal combustion engines altogether, initially in urban areas and ultimately more generally.  For most cars built over the past 20 years that may still be in use, petrol is likely to be less polluting overall than diesel. Petrol cars also require less maintenance to keep them performing at that level. But new, well maintained diesel cars, built to the latest standards have similar emissions to new petrol vehicles. Aonghus McNabola, associate professor in civil and structural engineering, Trinity College Dublin Overall I find this a fair reflection on the topic of diesel cars. Some points are worth elaborating further. From a health impact point of view, the public should also be particularly concerned about the fine particulate matter emitted from diesel engines because it is associated with poor heart health. Research has proven that increases in background concentrations of particulate matter result in more hospital admissions and deaths from heart attacks, particularly among those already at risk. The near EU-wide plan to encourage people to buy diesel vehicles in the past number of years is another example of the lack of connection between air pollution policy and climate change policy, and the difficulties of considering CO₂ emissions separately to the many other thousands of compounds that human activities emit. Replacing petrol cars with diesel ones does result in lower CO₂ emissions and climate impacts but it has clearly been worse for human health. This article rightly sums up the outlook that new, well maintained diesel vehicles have quite similar levels of particulate emissions to petrol cars, although they are still higher. However, most vehicle fleets are dominated by the older and considerably more polluting, earlier emission standard vehicles. It will take many years for these vehicles to make their way out of operation. During this time, human health will continue to be damaged by diesel emissions.

The fact is that the debate is just getting started and that the climate issue is very much undecided. The fact that warming has not occurred in 18 years, Antarctic sea ice is at record high levels, and that more than 97% of the climate models have been dead wrong have made life difficult for those insisting the debate is over.
Yesterday German skeptic site Die kalte Sonne here featured a debate in Holland between international skeptics and warmists. Clearly the debate is NOT over.
====================================
A new climate dialogue: How will the gaining solar inactivity impact the climate?
By Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Lüning
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Dutch science journalist Marcel Crok is far more successful at bringing climate scientists to a debate. He brings scientists from both camps regularly into discussions at the Climate Dialogue platform. On 15 October 2014 a new debate started on the question of: How much impact would a decades long pause in solar activity have on the climate?

What will happen during a new Maunder Minimum?


According to the latest IPCC report, AR5, the influence of the sun on our climate since pre-industrial times, in terms of radiative forcing, is very small compared to the effect of greenhouse gases.
According to some more skeptical scientists such a small solar influence is counterintuitive. The Little Ice Age, the period roughly from 1350 to 1850, in which winters on the Northern Hemisphere could be severe and glaciers advanced, coincided with the so-called Maunder Minimum, a period of supposedly low solar activity. In their eyes, the sun therefore still is a serious candidate to also explain a substantial part of the warming since pre-industrial times.
Sunspot records since 1600 suggest there has been a considerable increase in solar activity in the 20th century leading to a Grand Solar Maximum or Modern Maximum. However recently these sunspot records have come under increasing scrutiny and newer reconstructions show a much ‘flatter’ sunspot history. This challenges the idea of a Modern Maximum.
The current solar cycle 24 is the lowest sunspot cycle in 100 years and the third in a trend of diminishing sunspot cycles. Solar physicists expect cycle 25 to be even smaller than Cycle 24 and expect the sun to move into a new minimum, comparable with the Dalton or even the Maunder Minimum. Studying such a minimum with modern instruments could potentially answer a lot of the questions surrounding the influence of the sun on our climate.
We are very pleased that no fewer than five (solar) scientists have agreed to participate in this exciting new Climate Dialogue: Mike Lockwood (UK), Nicola Scafetta (US), Jan-Erik Solheim (NO), José Vaquero (ES) and Ilya Usoskin (FI).

Cooling climate in 21st Century
While warmists Lockwood, Usoskin and Vaquero stick to the position that the sun plays only a minor role in modulating the earth’s climate, the skeptic scientists have a very different view:

Most of the warming in the 20th century is due to the sun.
According to the latest IPCC report, AR5, the influence of the Sun on our climate since pre-industrial times, in terms of radiative forcing, is very small compared to the effect of greenhouse gases. Figure 1 in the introduction (SPM.5 in AR5) is quite misleading, since it compares the TSI at solar minimum around 1745 with TSI around minimum in 2008. They are apparently the same. This covers the fact that the Sun has changed quite a lot in the time between.”
And he adds at his conclusion:
The sunspot cycle will be longer in 21th Century, indicating a cooler climate (Fig 5).”
Nicola Scafetta:
Figures 1-4 provide a strictly alternative message to the one proposed by the IPCC. The Sun must have contributed significantly to climate changes and will continue to do so.”

By Ed Caryl
First, I must apologize for an error. In How Much Global Warming, I made an assumption about the old GISS file from 1999 that it was a global temperature file. I had missed the clear label on the file itself that it was surface stations only. As Bob Tisdale pointed out, I was comparing apples to oranges.
But when I found the correct land-only file to compare, I found the situation was even worse than I thought. Here is the correct comparison.

Figure 1 is the comparison of land-only (surface stations) data from 1999 and the current data.
GISS has more than doubled the warming trend in their published data in the last 15 years. This has been done by ignoring the years before 1880, cooling the readings before 1965, and warming the measurements after 1965. They basically shifted the measurement period 14 years to the right, doubling the warming trend. Here is the difference plot:

Figure 2 is a plot of the difference between the plotted data in Figure 1.
It doesn’t take much data manipulation to radically change the temperature trend. Truncating the early 14 years and adding the recent 14 years was half the change, and “adjusting” the station records slightly furnished the rest.
Surface station data is subject to many error sources. First, when thermometers are read by eye, the readings are in whole degrees, and a judgment is made on the spot on whether the reading is the lower or the higher number. The condition of the weather shelter and the thermometer is a factor. Then when the reading is recorded mistakes can be made.
More mistakes can be made when that recording is transcribed at the central office. Then higher authorities get involved with adjustments for missing records and UHI. For all these reasons, trends of less than one degree per century should be taken with a whole shovel-full of salt.
My thanks to Bob Tisdale. His expertise and experience in analyzing ocean temperatures and GISS records allowed him to instantly recognize the data I used. This is an example of open peer review in the climate blogosphere.

Off topic but for some readers this could be a real game-changer when it comes to your precious health.
I’ve been on a low-carb, high fat, lots of meat diet for about 6 weeks now. I’ve lost about 15 lbs. and my belt has moved to the last hole. I no longer get the bloated feeling and the trousers fit nicely again. My research on the best way to lose weight led me to the video below.
If even just half of what this doctor says is right, and I believe he is mostly right, then the population has been the victim of a huge nutritional and pharmaceutical scam of monumental proportions. It’s 90 minutes long but well worth listening…I couldn’t stop listening. THIS COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE! The interview starts in earnest at the 7 min. mark.

Like the guy says at the end…what’s going on “is mind-blowing”. Like Dr. Davis says (like climate science) it’s going to take years to unravel the mess that the decades of disinformation has produced.
But wait, it all gets much much worse…the following presentation will blow your socks off!

Another expert, Dr. Sally Fallon, even calls it “genocide”. The tragedy is that millions have died horrible deaths at the hands of what I now believe to be a sinister industry…call it the abortion-of-adults industry. Again, all worth taking the time to watch.

"Red deer are the largest surviving native land mammals in the British Isles. Over the centuries, wolves, bears, elk and wild cattle have all been driven to extinction, but deer have persisted. Though they are now limited to the margins of the modern world, in the past these animals played a central role in human life and, somehow, unlike other large mammals, endured.  It is easy to understand how deer arrived at some of the remote places on the British mainland where they now thrive, but questions arise over how the animals on the distant Scottish islands of Orkney and the Outer Hebrides got there. Deer are known to be good short distance swimmers, but the isles are thought to have been separated by wide and deep sea channels from the mainland for as long as Britain itself has been an island. Today, other than deliberate introductions, these outer isles still have only a few terrestrial species, such as otters and rodents. The archaeological record shows that deer appeared on the Scottish isles at the same time as humans arrived, so could there be a link between the two? Evidence for the first insular human and deer populations on these islands dates back to the Neolithic, some 5,500 years ago, a time when the first farmers were establishing themselves in Britain. These farmers spread across to the islands, taking with them domestic cattle, sheep, pigs and crops, as well as wild deer. By releasing the deer, settlers developed a new, less labour intensive food supply that could supplement farming, and provide valuable antler – but just how did they do it? In our recent study, we combined archaeological skills with genetic research, to understand how our ancestors moved deer to and from the islands. The results were unexpected. We attempted to match DNA sequences from ancient deer bones found across Scotland from different times, with the populations of deer living on other nearby places, such as the Scottish mainland, Norway and Ireland. By including deer from the Bronze, Iron and Viking Ages we also explored if they were introduced to the islands once or many times. Though we found that deer from mainland Scotland and the Inner Hebrides were all close matches with the Irish and Norwegian deer, only a single specimen of ancient deer from the outer isles matched any deer population, modern or ancient. These animals actually came from much further afield – but from where did they originate? There are some other enigmatic island introductions we can compare the deer to. One study suggested that the Orkney vole, a species only found on mainland Europe and on Orkney, which also appears at the time of the first farmers, most closely matches historic voles in Belgium. Research is also shedding new light on our understanding of the movement of early people as well as their relationships with wild animals. While sea-going prehistoric boats are rare in Britain, there is increasing evidence that people travelled and traded over long distances, so it could be that they came from even further afield than first thought. The deliberate introduction of deer to the islands suggests that early farmers diversified, employing a sophisticated land and stock management system. The deer provided meat, fat, hides and sinews, while antler, shed and regrown each year, was a vital sustainable resource used to make tools and other items. Bones left by islanders suggest that, in the absence of predators, ancient deer numbers were managed by culling the young animals. This close management allowed humans and deer to both persist on the small islands for centuries, and provides a model for our understanding of how and why deer, unlike other large mammals, were not hunted to extinction. Today, deer are big business. Britain is home to some 350,000, the largest population in Europe, and deer stalking is estimated to be worth over £100m a year to the Scottish economy. However, the animals no longer have any natural predators and conservationists are worried that their huge numbers are damaging the natural environment, forestry and agriculture, as well as compromising road safety. As these remote deer populations are still managed by humans, and their genetic line remains free from interbreeding, we can ensure the ancient deer lineages are protected. And by comparing modern deer with their ancestors, we can conserve and manage our herds today to ensure their continued survival in the future. But the search for the source of the original Scottish island deer continues. We will now be looking further afield for the source populations and testing ancient and modern deer across southern Britain and into Europe. In particular, whether there is a link with the Orkney vole. Questions are still outstanding, however: where did these mysterious island deer come from? What does this tell us about the people that they lived alongside? And what other mysteries are there still to discover about this ancient human wildlife relationship?"
"It’s hard to believe that just a few hours drive from Rome, a small population of bears has survived in isolation for thousands of years. They live in the Apennine mountains that run along the centre of Italy, where high peaks merge into woodland, lakes and pasture, with humans scattered in villages throughout.  These are brown bears (Ursus arctos), the most common and widespread of the eight bear species. Brown bears can be found from the coldest coasts of Alaska to the relatively warmer mountains of Turkey, and right across Eurasia from Japan to Scandinavia.  With such a big geographical range, there are obviously some differences between certain groups. I specialise in skulls and skeletons, and have personally measured the huge skull of a Kodiak bear (estimated weight for that individual was 748 kg) – the largest brown bear of all, found in islands off Alaska – and the much smaller head of its relatives far inland. Ecologists say these sorts of differences are adaptations to local diets and climate. Kodiak bears grew so big as they have no competitors for the islands’ abundant salmon, for instance, while bears at higher latitudes are also generally bigger in order to retain heat. These sorts of differences mean we can further divide the brown bear into subspecies – 14 at the last count – though scientists using molecular data are constantly challenging this number.  In 1921, an Italian surgeon and amateur zoologist, Giuseppe Altobello, identified some peculiar traits in a population of brown bears from the Apennines: the Marsican bear (Ursus arctos Marsicanus) also known as the Apennine brown bear.  Through the years, the Marsican bear became the symbol of the local Abruzzo National Park and lent its name to pan dell'orso (bear bread) and other traditional regional foods. Thanks to its presence, ecotourism improved in the whole Abruzzi region, though conflicts with shepherds and honey farmers are still reported. In prehistoric times, hundreds of bears would have lived in these mountains. Today, the latest population estimate is around 51. The small – though stable – numbers of Marsican bears give rise to an important conservation question: how much of a species should we preserve? According to the IUCN the brown bear is classified as “Least Concern”, which is to say that it does not require urgent conservation actions. But that is the species as a whole. What about each subspecies? The Marsican bear is still completely isolated from its nearest neighbours, a population of Eurasian brown bears in the Italian Alps. It could expand its range though, as there is suitable habitat throughout the Apennines. Colleagues and I wanted to investigate what made the Apennine bear different from other brown bears. In particular, our study focused on its peculiar mandible (lower jaw) which has a thick portion below the teeth to generate the power needed to crunch through the nuts the bears like to eat in autumn. This isn’t the only example of a brown bear subspecies adapting its jaw to its environment – in the Tibetan plateau, another isolated population, the Isabelline bear, has evolved unique slender mandibles in order to catch burrowing rodents. The Marsican bear appears to have changed relatively quickly, at least on the sorts of geological timescales over which evolution usually occurs. Given there is no fossil evidence of ancient Marsican bears, its distinctive jaw appears to have developed only in the past 600 years or so, if genetic estimates are correct.  The change could have been down to the climate, but our data did not support this. Instead, ancient DNA points to the existence of one massive European population of brown bears with high genetic flow from country to country. At this time, bears would have been fairly similar across all of the continents. But after the most recent ice age ended and the Holocene began – and humans and their habitat changes cut off bear populations from one another. At the point in relatively recent history when bears in the Apennines were no longer able to breed with the wider brown bear population, they began to evolve their unique jaws. Bears are making a comeback across Europe as a whole. One study reported a happy 17,000 brown bears living and re-colonising all over the continent. Within this context, what is the future of the unique isolated Apennine bear?  Initiatives promoted by Rewilding Europe and local groups are providing more pragmatic solutions to prevent increasing human-bear conflict – in 2007 three Marsican bears died due to eating poisoned carcasses. Since then seven individuals are reported to have died of natural causes, which given the small size of the population is also of concern. On the positive side, a more recent census  identified six reproductive females in the Apennine central range of Marsican bear with an estimate of ten pups produced during 2016. It’s now up to us to provide a brighter future for this new generation."
"As Greta Thunberg departs the US to sail across the Atlantic for the second time in a few months, she is leaving behind a simple message for those who care about the climate crisis: you must vote. The 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who ignited a youth movement with her Friday school strikes has traveled across America since arriving via racing yacht in late August. She will now brave the bitter cold to get back to Madrid, after a change in venue for international climate negotiations. Her plan had been to make her way to Chile, where the talks were meant to be held before the country descended into civil unrest. “My message to the Americans is the same as to everyone – that is to unite behind the science and to act on the science,” Thunberg told the Guardian on Tuesday. “We must realize this is a crisis, and we must do what we can now to spread awareness about this and to put pressure on the people in power. And especially, the US has an election coming up soon, and it’s very important that for everyone who can vote, vote.” Thunberg is heading back to Europe on a catamaran with Riley Whitelum and Elayna Carausu, a YouTube celebrity couple known as Sailing La Vagabonde who live on the boat with their baby. They have heating, solar panels and a water turbine. The journey from Hampton, Virginia, could take around three weeks, depending on weather. Thunberg asked for help getting to Spain on social media, and said she got only a few responses because of the time of year. In a statement, Whitelum said he and Carausu “have seen the beauty of this planet first hand and think that it is something we should all strive to protect. It is something I have considered even more since having a child.” The same release said six people would be aboard the boat, including Thunberg’s father, Svante Thunberg, and Nikki Henderson, a British professional sailor. As she reflected on her visit to the US, Thunberg urged people to spread awareness of the climate crisis. “Even if the politics needed doesn’t exist today, we still need to use our voices to make sure that the people in power are focused on the right things. Because this is a democracy, and in a democracy, people are the ones who run the country. I know it doesn’t seem that way, but if enough people were to decide they have had enough, then that could change everything. So don’t underestimate that power.” Thunberg routinely issues stern warnings to international leaders and has become a target for criticism by opponents of climate action. Critics alternately dismiss her because she is young or ignore that she is a teenager. Preparing for her journey, she said she was homesick and tired of traveling. She said she misses her family, her school and her dogs, Moses and Roxy, a golden retriever and a black labrador. “I really miss having a routine because now I’ve been on the road constantly for several months,” Thunberg said. “I like routines, so it would be nice to get those routines back.” While in the US, Thunberg has met fellow protesters, people who have lost their homes to wildfires and advocates for native Americans. She has learned a lot, she said, but the “basic problem is the same everywhere”. “Nothing is being done to stop the climate and ecological emergency from happening and to secure the future wellbeing for future generations,” she said. The US is officially withdrawing from the Paris agreement, the international deal to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases which raise temperatures and exacerbate dangerous extreme weather and are projected to intensify poverty worldwide. Donald Trump has rejected climate science, backing the expansion of the fossil fuel industry in the US and abroad. In September, Thunberg’s reaction to seeing Trump at a United Nations meeting in New York went viral. She said her expression then “probably speaks for itself”, but added that it was a “very, very strange experience” because she wasn’t expecting to see the president, who declined to attend climate meetings. Thunberg often deflects attention from herself and toward the climate crisis. She said in many places, people focus on her as an individual instead of focusing on her cause. But, she said, she would still encourage others who are able to leave school or their jobs to start raising awareness, because the strategy has been effective. Asked about a mural being painted of her in San Francisco, she said the artists were talented and she was honored and amazed. “But as I’ve said,” she added, “we should be focusing on the climate and ecological emergency.”"
"“Spreading out into space will completely change the future of humanity,” says Stephen Hawking. It “may be the only thing that saves us from ourselves. I am convinced that humans need to leave Earth”. The world-famous physicist was talking at a recent science festival in Trondheim, Norway. And his keynote speech to the Starmus Festival about giving humanity a sense of purpose raises some very important questions about our views of positive futures. For Hawking “a new and ambitious space programme would excite (young people), and stimulate interest in other areas, such as astrophysics and cosmology”. Humans have to leave Earth, he explained, due to an array of threats including asteroid strikes, resource depletion, overpopulation, deforestation, decimation of animal species, and the effects of human made climate change (particularly rising temperatures and melting ice caps). Yet hearing such a viewpoint in response to the challenges we face leaves me cold. We cannot flee the apocalypse forever, leaving a chosen few to flourish on other planets; we need positive visions for humanity here on Earth. I am not a physicist, I research and teach in a business school about how people and organisations go about taking action to address sustainability challenges, such as the global ecological threats mentioned by Hawking.  The concept of sustainability has been traced back to ideas that emerged in forestry about 300 years ago to sustain yields. The general implication of this expansive and slippery concept is that we need to work out ways to sustain both the social (including economic) and ecological processes that enable us to live in ways that we value.  Key questions are raised by Hawking’s speech and we can use these questions to briefly explore Hawking’s ideas about a future for humanity: What is being sustained? Hawking’s suggestion is that by establishing colonies on the moon or Mars we are helping to guarantee that some form of human life will continue beyond Earth being humanly habitable. What is being sustained is a protected bubble of a small selection of humans in artificially created Earth-styled environments somewhere in space. How long is it being sustained? Given his background in research into how the universe began – and will end – it is perhaps no surprise that in Hawking’s vision for humanity the time horizons are very long. His intention is for another million years of human life, with our space colonies enabling us to live even beyond the life of Earth itself. In whose interest is what being sustained? We can identify a range of core interests who would benefit from Hawking’s idea of humanity spreading out into space, including astrophysicists, astronauts, space agencies (science-related areas of work) which tend to be much more appealing to men and the members of the future space colonies. The problem is that such a purpose or vision for humanity involves, and is relevant for, very limited groups of people. They will generally do certain types of jobs, and will be citizens of, or live in, those few countries that are putting serious money into space exploration. It’s easy enough to imagine a colony on Mars with the same sort of demographic makeup as a Silicon Valley tech giant. It’s much harder to imagine a colony populated by people with little financial wealth from less wealthy countries – the very people most affected by the environmental threats Hawking refers to. I don’t have any particular objections to space travel itself. Interplanetary tourism doesn’t come cheap of course, and isn’t great for the carbon footprint, but if people want to leave planet Earth they are welcome to do so. My concern is that such visions are being presented as a benefit for all of human society. After Hawking’s speech to the Starmus Festival, audience members put it to him that it would be better to spend our money on solving the problems of this planet. Hawking’s view is also one that is likely very enticing for a few, but alienating for many. This is partly because of the hopelessness of the apocalyptic vision for planet Earth, which is his starting point. This gloomy scenario can foster ambivalence by belittling what we can each do in the face of such enormous problems. Hawking also puts too much emphasis on technology. The problem with sustainability visions that rely on tech advancements is they rarely factor in the complex task of sustaining conducive social-ecological relations. Yes, humans may eventually invent nuclear fusion, or a great way to suck carbon out of the atmosphere. But we’ll invent harmful things too, providing even more ways to trash the planet. Which sets of technologies are more significant will be a question of politics, not science. It can be very difficult to face up to the social and ecological challenges that scientists have outlined and still develop some enthusiasm for positive “approach goals” instead of negative “avoidance goals”. New technologies are part of the positive picture, but too much tech talk is a distraction.  As we each develop our own view about what a positive future would look like, it’s clear that the real innovation must be in the ways we organise ourselves and live together on Earth – as there’s not much hope in only aiming for a life on Mars."

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecently the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Bremerhaven, Germany released a press clipping about polar sea ice, obstinately refusing to acknowledge that there is a trend change happening in the Arctic. It wrote:
The area of sea ice in the Arctic fell to a summer minimum of around 5.0 million square kilometres this year, which is about 1.6 million square kilometres more than the record low in 2012. However, according to sea ice physicist Marcel Nicolaus from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) and Lars Kaleschke from the Hamburg Cluster of Excellence for Climate Research (CliSAP) this confirms the long-term downward trend in the Arctic.”
For what is considered to be a leading institute on the research of polar sciences, it sure seems to have a very poor understanding of the relationship between polar sea ice and other major external factors, such as ocean cycles, e.g. AMO and PDO, and the impacts of other natural cycles.
Note how the scientists seem to naively assume the general trend is linear and downward:

To me it is astonishing that sea ice scientists today are taking the linear trend of just a few years data and simply straight-line extending it out decades into the future, something we’d expect to see from a 9-year old primary school pupil. Yet they do point out that weather phenomena led to a particularly large reduction in sea ice the negative-record years of 2007 and 2012.
So just how sure are the scientists about their claims Arctic sea ice is headed downward? Let’s find out.
My bet is simple: I predict that the mean September Arctic sea ice extent for the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 will be safely above the September mean of the years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. This offer is open to the first scientist from any of the following institutes: AWI, PIK, NSIDC, MPI, CRU, NASA, or other alarmist institutes clinging to alarmist scenarios.
My e-mail address, in case you’re naïve enough to believe your models: pierre.gosselin@t-online.de
I’ll bet 1000 USD to go to a charity.
Listening to these scientists, it should be a hands down no-brainer bet. The consensus says the planet is heating. How confident are you really in your science?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis sunny, warm, spring Sunday morning in Germany brings us yet another spectacular scandal…one that shows how the Environment Ministry of the German government is not really interested in climate science after all, but in using the climate issue as an instrument to generate hundreds of millions of euros for funding pet environmental programs.
Daniel Wetzel of the online Die Welt brings us a story titled: “The Brazen Report-Falsification of Climate Tricksters“.
The story today is about how the conclusions the UN IPCC report released last month apparently did not satisfy the expectations of a series of German government agencies within the German Ministry of Environment, and so they made some major changes in their own German language four-page summary for the public and media. The four-page summary contains outright contradictions and falsifications of IPCC recommendations, Die Welt reports.
Wetzel first explains how condensing the monster size IPCC report into a summary that is only a few pages long (one that can be easily digested by the public) is a daunting task. More than 1000 pages of technical gobbledygook gets summarized into a 33-page Summary for Policymakers – in English. But that too is also too tough for an increasingly lazy German media and groups to get through. Die Welt writes:
And so the journalists, speakers and environmental groups were thankful that the German federal ministries and authorities responsible for climate protection provided a very clear four-page summary of ‘key points’ of the IPCC report.
Responsible for the German summary were four high-ranking institutions: led by Ministry of Environment, and involved were the German IPCC Coordinating Office in Bonn, the Environment Agency in Dessau, and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.”
This is where the scandal begins. The government agencies, obviously unhappy with the recommendations of the IPCC, simply ignored and changed some of the IPCC key findings in order to say the opposite in their 4-page German summary.
For example the German Ministry of Environment was not pleased that the IPCC report was sharply critical of the practice of maintaining a renewable energy subsidy system alongside an emissions trading system. Die Welt:
The UN declares emissions trading an effective instrument that makes subsidies for renewable energy unnecessary. But the German government reverses the conclusion and makes emissions trading the culprit that supposedly ‘constricts the impact of other measures’.”
Also the German report reverses the sense of an emission trading scheme. Wetzler at Die Welt explains:

Emissions trading is by definition a system in which a number of freely tradeable emission certificates is prescribed so that free market prices can result for the emissions certificates. From this system of a fixed certificate number and flexible prices, the German translation turns it into a system of flexible certificate numbers to force the highest possible price for emission rights.”
When asked by Die Welt to comment, the Environment Ministry simply shuffled the matter off to the German IPCC Coordination Office, who in turn played it down, claiming that the “core messages” were “not a literal or even official translation of the IPCC report.” and that it was “a first presentation of the report in an intelligible form.” and that “that elements of the report can be reflected only in highly abbreviated form. ”
Yet, it was good enough to use for informing the media and public?
“Not what we wrote”
When confronted, the IPCC responded by insisting that the German version “is not what we wrote.” Die Welt also asked the IPCC scientists concerning the German translation of their core messages. writes that they “reacted with surprise”. Die Welt quotes Edenhofer:
That’s not what we wrote in the IPCC report,’ declared Ottmar Edenhofer who as Co-Chair of Working Group III played a leading role in formulating the original IPCC report. ‘Fundamentally the purpose of an emissions trading system is not to generate high prices.’ ‘Only the original English version is important,’ says Edenhofer. […] What ‘the ministries or other agencies do with it is not in my hands.'”
Gross misinterpretations “a scandal”
Meanwhile the German Association for Emissions Trading and Climate Protection (BVEK) views the (mis)interpretations of the IPCC report as “a scandal. Die Welt quotes:
‘Essential statements of the UN IPCC were simply reversed to say the opposite,’ criticized association director Jürgen Hacker: ‘The demand for the highest possible CO2-prices have nothing to do with that statements of the UN report, but they do correspond very well to the interests of the German Federal Ministry of Environment.'”
Die Welt then writes that indeed the German Ministry of Environment was banking on high CO2 certificate prices. The auctioning of emission certificates was supposed to “feed a billion-euro ‘energy and climate fund’ which in turn would finance a number of environment programs of Ministry, led by Barbara Hendricks.” Now that certificate prices are so low, the German Ministry has to go begging for money, Die Welt writes.

How Much Global Warming?
By Ed Caryl
We are told over and over again that the globe has warmed by 0.8°C since 1880 or 1850. Lately we have seen article after paper after publication that states this number in Fahrenheit, 1.44°F, because that sounds larger. But is this number correct? What is it based on?
GISS and Google “way-back machine”
Recently, a file from GISS in Google’s “way-back” machine came to my attention. This file of global temperature dates from 1999, before James Hansen became more rabid in promoting global warming. Here is a plot of the 1999 data, along with the current file from GISS:

Figure 1 is a plot of global temperature as published by GISS is 1999 versus the current publication.

Note that GISS has removed the data from 1866 to 1880, placing the beginning of their published data closer to the bottom of the early 1900s cool period. This changes the trend from 0.42°C per century to 0.66°C per century, a 50+% increase in the trend. This alone changes the warming from 0.6°C from 1866 to the present, to 0.8°C from 1880 to the present, resulting in the higher trend. Here is a chart of the difference between the two files.

Figure 2 is a plot of the difference between the two plots in Figure 1.
In Figure 2 we can see that the cool period around 1910 was cooled further by 0.2 degrees, but the cool period around 1970 was warmed slightly. They also minimized the cool 1880s and ’90s by warming those years by 0.1 to 0.2°C. So what was the real global temperature from 1866 to the present? I took the 1999 file and spliced on the satellite data from UAH from 1979 to the present, using the period of overlap from 1979 to 1999 as a baseline, avoiding the recent GISS adjustments. The result is this: 
Figure 3 is a plot of GISS global temperature from 1999 with UAH satellite TLT global temperature spliced on from 1979.
The trend in Figure 3 is half a degree C per century, with a total rise since 1866 of about 0.6°C. Because of the year-to-year variation, and the sparse station data in the early years, both the trend and the total rise have errors that are in the neighborhood of ±0.3°C. So the bottom line is that the warming since the mid-19th century is about 0.6°C ±0.3°C, or somewhere between 0.3°C and 0.9°C. Much of that warming, about 0.4°C ±0.2°C has taken place since 1980. But some of that is due to the cyclic nature of temperature.
The cycle from 1866 to 1940 had an amplitude of about 0.3°C, which, if extended to the present, means that the present temperature is at the peak of a cycle, or 0.15°C too high. This puts the total rise between 0.15°C and 0.75°C, or from almost nothing to something less than has been stated, with a center at 0.45°C. The recent solar maximum has also inflated the temperature. In the next 30 years, decreasing ocean cyclic temperature and a waning solar input will likely reduce the global temperature by about 0.4°C ±0.2°C, either back to the 1990s or to the 1960s. If the latter, there will have been no warming in the last 160 years.

"Extreme temperatures that helped drive historic 2018 bushfires in north Queensland were four times more likely to have happened because of human-caused climate change, according to a study to be published next month. Scorching conditions in November 2018 sparked Queensland’s biggest ever firefighting response as 1,250 fires torched 1.4 million hectares, destroying nine homes and causing widespread impacts across multiple farming industries.  The peer-reviewed study, led by University of New South Wales climate scientist Dr Sophie Lewis, is one of the first in Australia to demonstrate the influence of extra greenhouse gases in the atmosphere on a single bushfire event. To be published in a major US journal next month, the study examined the conditions leading up to the fires and, using models, tested whether those conditions were more likely under the enhanced greenhouse conditions that now exist in the atmosphere. “We tried to pull apart the key ingredients in those conditions and then see if they were influenced by climate change,” Lewis said. “In that one bushfire event, there were so many people affected and it has had huge negative outcomes on their lives. We are finding that some of the elements that contributed to the fires are being influenced by anthropogenic factors.” Fire authorities and governments use the forest fire danger index (FFDI) to understand bushfire risk. The index combines heat, rainfall, humidity and wind to deliver a score where above 75 means the risk is “extreme” and above 100 means conditions are “catastrophic”. The study looked at the components of the index, as well as examining the background weather conditions. According to Lewis’s findings, the number of days of very high FFDI ratings in the fire region was unprecedented in data going back to 1950. Lewis said: “Temperature is a very important aspect in the forest fire danger index and we really do think that the enhanced temperatures is what differentiated that 2018 event from previous years.” The study found that the November temperatures in the Queensland region affected by the fire were more than four times more likely to occur because of human-caused climate change. The study co-authors included scientists from the Bureau of Meteorology and the University of Melbourne.  The study says: “The 2018 conditioning heatwave event was more severe and persistent than previous analogues, with no event of this scale previously occurring at such northerly locations. “Events that are unprecedented in a given region, such as the 2018 event, reveal that firefighting preparation and training cannot rely on previous events as guidance for the most dangerous conditions they can expect in the current and future climate where large-scale fires occur more regularly.” Lewis said the study found that human-caused climate change had probably also influenced the drier spring conditions in the area affected by the fires, but this link was much less pronounced. The Queensland government responded with a recovery plan after the fires, using $30m from a joint commonwealth and state funded disaster recovery scheme. Some 4,202 fire personnel, including more than 100 from interstate, responded to the fires at their peak – the largest firefighting response in Queensland’s history. More than 14,000 people were asked to evacuate. In October, the National Environmental Science Programme released new scientific guidance on bushfires, stating that human-caused climate change had “already resulted in more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires in recent decades for many regions of Australia”. Increasing greenhouse gas emissions would further accelerate the trends towards more dangerous conditions, the guidance said. Two studies published in recent months – one in the journal Geophysical Research Letters and another in Scientific Reports – have found that climate change will increase the risk of the most extreme bushfires. These pyrocumulonimbus fires – named after the clouds they create – can push hot air many kilometres up, creating their own unpredictable winds, storms and lightning, presenting a dangerous challenge for firefighters."

"In Britain and other developed countries, disposing of unwanted things is taken for granted. There is (lots of) legislation in place to ensure waste is collected, transported and treated safely without having an impact on either health or the environment. But waste management is a costly business, increasingly seen by organised criminals and opportunists alike as an easy way to make quick money.  Two recent instances of waste crime, in my local area, show how this can happen. In the first, a deserted factory, used for the illegal storage of 5,000 tonnes of partially treated waste was deliberately set alight using an accelerant. It contained combustible materials, such as plastics and decomposing food, making it particularly fire prone. The police investigation looking for the source of the waste, as well as the reason it was set alight, is ongoing.  Illegal waste dumps such as this are becoming an increasing problem, both in open countryside and hidden in rented buildings due to the potential income available from these crimes. Estimates from waste industry experts put illegal profits from this one operation somewhere between £400,000 to £500,000 for the cost of just two weeks rental on the building.  This kind of thing appears to be a victimless crime, but it isn’t. The building owner in the case of the illegal storage fire (who appears not to have been involved) faces losses. And we are all victims: burning this illegally stored waste has polluting impacts on both local air quality and local watercourses. The incineration of waste is one of the most highly regulated waste management processes, and rightly so.   Fire services managed to control the fire, so estimate that only 10-15% of the waste present was burnt. This leaves the problem of moving what remains to proper treatment facilities – who pays for this? Or the cost of the 65 fire service personnel it took to control the fire?  In the second incident, a large quantity of asbestos was dumped. Asbestos was widely used in the UK in buildings for insulation, flooring and roofing until it was discovered that it can cause serious lung conditions, including cancer, asbestosis and pleural disease. It is now banned in the UK, but is still present in buildings built before 2000.  The removal, transport and disposal of asbestos is highly dangerous, heavily regulated and consequently expensive. This makes it attractive to criminals. Charging high rates for removal and dumping for free generates an easy profit. Again, wider society is the victim: there are serious health implications for anyone coming into contact with this waste, including the people that dumped it.   The bill for clearing this incident will be paid by local council tax payers. Nationally, clearing fly-tipping (leaving waste on land that doesn’t have a licence to accept it) costs tax-payers in excess of £200m a year. Clearance of fly-tipping on private land falls to the landowner, be that a private individual or charity such as the Woodland Trust, who report an annual clearance bill in excess of £350,000. These waste crimes are taking place in plain sight. There are underlying causes to these crimes, which are allowing waste crime to flourish. Correct, legal waste disposal is expensive, with landfill and incineration charges now around £100 per tonne. This is why the profits of these crimes are high.  It seems that the traditional deterrents for these crimes, fines and prison sentences,
are not working, or are not tough enough. It is too easy for criminals to obtain documentation that makes their operations appear compliant. For example, waste carrier’s registration and waste exemptions, can be easily and quickly obtained online. These make waste operations - on the surface - appear legal. It is also too easy for criminals to gain access to waste. On a small scale “scrap men” informally remove white goods and other metal objects from housing estates across the country. They have the implied consent of the householder who leaves unwanted items out and does not report their disappearance as a crime. Parts of these items which don’t have a resale value are often fly-tipped meaning the householder also, unknowingly, commits a crime themselves. There are more complaints to the local authority about the noise these collectors make with their bugles and loudspeaker appeals for “any old iron” than about the removal of items. These informal or bogus collectors do not restrict themselves to scrap metal iron items. Used, unwanted textiles are worthwhile waste stream targets too because of the high prices they command in both secondhand markets and as a scrap.  Here, different tactics are employed, from the small-scale individual “fishing” for the contents of textile banks in car parks (with some fatalities) to the organised collection of bulk unwanted textiles from households. This is done either by the distribution of bogus collection bags to all households in a defined area, or the kerbside collection of bags distributed by a reputable charity before their own collection teams can retrieve them. Either way, it deprives honest charities of a much-needed funding source.  On a larger scale, the offer of cheap waste collections can be quite tempting. Waste is removed, the service paid for and then the waste is fly-tipped or stored at illegal, unregulated, waste sites leading to an immediate profit at a cost to us all. Assets of almost £1m have recently been recovered from one such waste crime through the Proceeds of Crime Act. The Environment Agency and local councils respond to these crimes when they take place. They also work with other agencies, such as HM Revenue and Customs and the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency to “disrupt” waste crime. Householders should make use of local council waste collections and check their local council’s website for information on the disposal of larger items. Bogus collections of textiles can be avoided by checking with your local council’s trading standards team, or checking the charity register.  Across the UK illegal waste management practices are now a multi-million pound problem, with some serious underlying problems that need to be addressed. Apart from the associated criminality, fly-tipping damages the environment, poses risks to human health here and abroad, undermines legitimate businesses, reduces tax income so others have to pay more, and just looks really ugly. With the potential for easy, high profits - waste crime is joining the ranks of organised crime alongside drugs and human trafficking, cyber-crime and child exploitation and this has wider implications for society. We must remember that many environmental regulations have been put in place as a response to serious incidents and resist the prospect of further deregulation. This may stand to cost us in terms of damage not only to the economy and environment – but also to human and public health."
"Mercedes-Benz plans to save €1.65bn (£1.4bn) by cutting more than 1,000 jobs in the latest sign German carmakers are struggling to make big investments in electric car technology. Carmakers around the world are spending billions on developing battery-powered electric vehicles but at the same time sales of internal combustion engines are slowing in the face of economic weakness and scandals over emissions. Mercedes-Benz’s premium cars division will bear the bulk of the job cuts, its parent company, Daimler, said on Thursday, with cuts of €1bn from its wage bill expected by 2022. Management and contractors will be particularly affected, while the vans and trucks divisions will together cut €650m in staff and other costs. Daimler said it would cap investment in property, plant and equipment and in research and development at current levels, with plans in place to reduce investment in the medium term. Carmakers are on the verge of a key period in the transition away from reliance on fossil fuels, with strict rules on carbon dioxide emissions coming into force on 1 January. Manufacturers will face heavy fines if the average emissions of cars sold in the EU are above 95g of CO2 per kilometre. Ola Källenius, the chair of Daimler’s board, said: “The expenditure needed to achieve the CO2 targets requires comprehensive measures to increase efficiency in all areas of our company. This also includes streamlining our processes and structures. “This will have a negative impact on our earnings in 2020 and 2021. To remain successful in the future, we must therefore act now and significantly increase our financial strength.” Daimler shares fell by 3% in early trading on Wednesday, to €51.97. It made earnings before tax of €10.6bn in 2018 but has given repeated profit warnings during 2019 and analysts forecast earnings before tax of about €6.3bn for 2019, according to average estimates from S&P Global Market Intelligence. As well as the global race for electrification, Daimler faces the prospect of further legal costs in relation to alleged breaches of emissions regulations. The scandal over diesel emissions cheating technology has also dented the rival German carmaker Volkswagen."

Today’s English-language online Russian news site RT here reports that a “freak summer snow” has struck areas of Central Russia in the cities of cities of Chelyabinsk and Sverdlovsk just north of Kazakhstan – in the middle of July! Hat-tip Alexander Hamilton at FaceBook.
“Snowdrifts”
Here we are not talking about high up in the mountains, but down in low country. The RT writes:
Snowdrifts piled up on the roads of Russia’s Ural region on Saturday as an abnormal summer snowstorm hit the region, bringing the area into the spotlight once again after last year’s meteorite fall. Siberia also witnessed a downpour of giant hailstones.”
The RT website adds (my emphasis):
Residents of the cities of Chelyabinsk and Sverdlovsk, located in Russia’s eastern Ural region, were taken aback when it suddenly started snowing in the middle of summer on Saturday.”
Also the Siberian city of Novosibirsk was hit by a heavy hailstorm, captured on video and posted at Youtube (hat-tip: RT):

"When heavy storms brought Malta’s world-famous Azure Window crashing into the sea earlier this year, the loss of one of the world’s natural wonders prompted strong emotional reactions. From stunning photographic tributes across social media to the ever prevalent memes, countries united in memorialising this iconic piece of the Gozo coastline. While Maltese prime minister Joseph Muscat tweeted that it was “heartbreaking”, he rightly confirmed it was unavoidable. Humans tramping across the arch may have sped up its collapse, but its demise was, sadly, inevitable as global sea levels rise. The transient nature of cliffs and beaches has been evident in the loss of many beautiful features in the last few decades. Arch Rock in Freshwater Bay, on the UK’s Isle of Wight, formed through centuries of coastal erosion, collapsed in 1992, while an enormous section of cliff near Lulworth in Dorset, UK, disappeared without warning in April 2013. This loss of a large section of the South West Coast Path saw tens of thousands of tons of chalk disappear into the sea overnight. Even more recently, a sandy beach returned to Dooagh on Achill Island off the west coast of Ireland as suddenly as it was removed 33 years previously.  As Britain’s coast evolves in response to sea level changes, there are many spectacular features at risk from sea erosion. The changes in coastal geomorphology are also likely to be more rapid and drastic as sea levels rise and storms intensify due to global warming. Consequently, it is difficult for geologists or geomorphologists to predict when a major change will occur, so it might be wise to visit some of the wonders of our coast now before they disappear forever. Here are my top five must-see UK sites from the most endangered list. Orkney’s legendary Old Man of Hoy is Britain’s tallest sea stack and stands at an imposing 137 metres above sea level. In geological terms, it is relatively young and maps indicate it was still part of the headland in 1750. Yet this sandstone column that is coveted by climbers and wildlife, began its evolution more than 400m years ago on the margins of Lake Orcadie, an enormous freshwater lake that covered the area from the south coast of the Moray Firth to Shetland in the north.  Dark basalt lava from the lake’s floor now forms the structure’s base, with horizontal beds of red and yellow sandstone creating the layered overhung profile for which it is famed. So how quickly should we visit this iconic structure?  With a 40-metre vertical crack in the top of the south face and daily battering from the sea on its narrow 30-metre base, The Old Man of Hoy faces constant erosion from gale force winds and high energy waves. Over 100 years ago, the stack looked very different with an arch at the bottom of a far wider base, giving rise to its name. Evidence of the arch’s collapse is visible in the large rocks scattered on the shoreline.  Bow Fiddle Rock is a natural sea arch located near Portknockie on the northeastern (Moray Firth) coast of Scotland and resembles the tip of a bow fiddle. It is composed of resistant quartzitic sandstone – hard, non-foliated metamorphic rock, which was originally pure quartz sandstone – from the Neoproterozoic age (1,000-541m years ago). It forms the coastal cliff backdrop between Cullen and Buckie and lies exposed to the erosional forces of the North Sea. The Jurassic Coast of south Dorset, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, beautifully displays the progressive and deleterious effects of sea level rise. Durdle Door is a naturally formed arch resulting from coastal erosion that exploits fractures within the Portland and Purbeck limestones. Just a couple of kilometres east, the spectacular crescent-shaped Lulworth Bay shows what happens when the resistant limestones are removed to expose the softer Cretaceous (Wealden) sediments to the full onslaught of the English Channel. Also part of the Jurassic Coast, Chesil Beach is one of just five major natural stretches of shingle in Britain. This spectacular feature is 29km long, 200 metres wide and 15 metres high in places. The shingle, comprising flint, granite, chert, quartzite, porphyry and tourmalised rock varies from the size of a pea in the northwest to the size of an orange in the southeast. Legend has it that smugglers landing on the beach could tell their location by the size of the shingle underfoot. Often described as a tombolo (or spit) connecting an island to the mainland, Chesil Beach evolved as a barrier beach which originated in the English Channel at the time of the last major ice age when sea levels were 125 metres lower than at present. It then migrated eastwards as sea levels rose in response to glacial melt, before eventually joining the mainland with the Isle of Portland. A further rise could potentially see the beach breached, marine connection reestablished and Portland becoming an island once more. Regularly gracing the pages of tour guides and textbooks, the Green Bridge of Wales is a stunning example of our evolving coastline. Composed of a thick Carboniferous limestone, including a proportion of chert – a dark, hard and opaque rock made up of silica – the coastline has been chemically eroded over the centuries as the limestone has been dissolved. Pebbles have been thrown against the rocks, stormy winds have weakened its structure and sand particles have grazed the surface. The Green Bridge of Wales has been eroded from both sides of the small headland, which resulted in caves forming that eventually met to create the arch that is visible today. The constant stress the arch is under means that, like the Azure Window, it will fall one day. A visit is highly recommended before it becomes a stack. A third of a metre rise in sea-levels could push the shoreline back by 610 metres in low-lying areas, having an enormous effect on the beaches of the world in general. The increased rate of sea-level rise would also counteract the effects of uplift experienced by Northern Britain due to post-glacial rebound – the rise of land masses that were once depressed by the enormous weight of ice sheets from the last ice age – even threatening the world-renowned Scottish links golf courses.  As the sea level is expected to rise significantly over the next century, other wonders of Britain’s natural world could be at risk, including the Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland and its Scottish counterpart, Fingal’s Cave in the Inner Hebrides. Sculpted by erosion, some of these extraordinary formations may be gone in years to come, but they demonstrate that what we love and revere today is very different from a century ago. While we may mourn the loss of much-loved geological features on our coastlines, the evolution of each natural treasure and the creation of new ones does at least hold the promise of bringing new wonders for future generations to appreciate."
"When James Shaw’s zero-carbon bill passed with bipartisan support in parliament on Thursday, New Zealand became one of the first countries in the world to enshrine its climate change targets in law. But for someone at the centre of a landmark piece of legislation, Shaw is a reluctant politician. Although the Green’s co-leader has been a party member since his teenage years, inspired by the French bombing of Greenpeace’s Rainbow Warrior in Auckland Harbour in 1985, he responds to a question about whether he is a career MP with, “No. I can’t. I couldn’t,” and then adds “no” a few more times for emphasis.  The former management consultant – now climate change minister – sits at the centre of government, but he doesn’t like parliament much, and has to let the “weird stuff” wash over him, he says. Shaw doesn’t have an office. He works, surrounded by staff, in his open-plan ministerial suite, where he has “taken out a bunch of walls.” It took him four months to convince parliament’s building services that he should be allowed to do it. “I actually had to go to the Speaker and say, look, where is the rule that says the ministers can’t sit with staff?” Shaw says. “And he said there actually isn’t a rule. It’s just a tradition. So I said, can I change it?” It improves coordination and “speeds things up,” he says. If he needs to concentrate, he puts on headphones. When he left the world of management consultancy and became an MP in 2014, politics was a means to an end, he says: “Even some of the largest, most powerful, most moneyed-up companies in the world still operate within system constraints.” “And the place where those constraints occur are actually things to do with regulatory and pricing and tax and that kind of stuff. In other words, it’s political.” Now he’s at the centre of New Zealand’s zero-carbon push as a key coalition partner in Jacinda Ardern’s government. It’s no coincidence that Ardern’s opening speech at the United Nations climate summit in September, closely echoed his views. The world faces a “stark” situation she said, urging those listening that with the necessary changes, progress was “within our grasp.” “I wrote a lot of it,” Shaw says. Shaw, 46, is – unlike Ardern – an unknown on the world stage, but he is he is the architect behind some of the most ambitious climate policies that anyone in the world is trying to enact. “I think sometimes a domestic audience undervalues or underestimates the impact on global action of action by other countries,” he says, of the oft-cited fact that New Zealand is responsible for just 0.17% of global emissions. “Part of what we’re doing is we’re role modelling for other countries. And actually, countries do look at each other and go, where are we relative to the pack?” On whether global heating can be curbed, he says: “I think the chances are slim.” But there’s no reason for not trying, he adds. “In fact, that’s all the more reason to try.” It is an optimistic view for a man who is reluctant to use the word “optimism.” As well as being New Zealand’s climate tsar, statistics minister and associate finance minister, Shaw, has co-led the Green party since 2015. The party’s eight MPs support Ardern’s governing Labour party, giving her the majority she needs to stay in power, along with New Zealand First. Together their climate agenda is ambitious: the zero carbon act — passed Thursday and loosely modelled on Britain’s 2008 Climate Change Act – legally enshrines a framework for New Zealand to keep global heating within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels. A plan to tax farmers for their emissions from 2025, or earlier if they are not making progress on reductions, was announced earlier this month. A proposed law that would force businesses to declare climate change risks to their shareholders is also on the cards. But at each turn – due to the three-party deal the Greens are a part of in government, and Shaw’s efforts to get cross-parliament support for his bills where possible – there were concessions and compromises made. On the day he announced New Zealand’s farmers would – in a world first – begin to pay for carbon emissions from 2025, Shaw sparked a furore inside his own movement. Farmers were broadly supportive of the move, because it gave them a grace period to work on the problem themselves, although some did not want to be taxed on emissions at all. But environmental groups, the Green party’s traditional allies, accused him of caving to agricultural interests. Analysts speculated on whether Shaw had gambled with his party’s fate at next year’s election. Does the climate change portfolio feel like everyone is perpetually slightly unhappy with him? “It feels like that every day. That’s exactly it,” he says. But with all eyes on New Zealand – particularly those of other agricultural countries – the government had to do something. “For 30 years, we’ve been involved in this Punch and Judy show, and it’s resulted in nothing,” Shaw says. “And so one side simply winning over the other, which has been the record of the last three decades, just isn’t going to cut it. We’ve got to get started.” Shaw walks to work when he can; he passed his full driver’s license test this year and still does not like to drive. A violent episode in March, when he was punched in the face on his way to work by a man who had targeted him for his political views, did not deter him from going out alone, a luxury New Zealand’s politicians are rare in being permitted. The assault generated a day of frenzied debate in New Zealand about the safety of its lawmakers. Thirty hours later, the nation’s attention was diverted by the deadly terrorist attack in Christchurch, in which 51 people were killed. Shaw, sporting a black eye, arrived in the city the day after the shootings. He was “emotionally pretty thrown” by the attacks, he said, but New Zealand’s response had been “brilliant, not perfect.” “Those kinds of things can tip you into a very dark place, and we didn’t go there,” he says. The political, for now, leaves no time for much else. He draws a blank when asked to name books or music he enjoys; weekends will, if he’s lucky, involve a walk with his wife, Annabel and a craft beer – “one of my greatest pleasures of modern Wellington” – when the work he brings home allows it. The table-top role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons, always a big part of his life, is on the back-burner. He only keeps up with new episodes of Star Trek: Discovery because he is not allowed to read ministerial papers on aeroplanes. “There’s a thing particularly about sci fi where you’re imagining possible futures,” he says. “And so interestingly, there’s a coherence there between what we do here and that.” But he says his move to politics and all has come with it will be worthwhile if “that was the moment when we got on top of our emissions and started to bring them down.”"
"As intense bushfires wreaked havoc across New South Wales and Queensland this week, we asked Guardian Australia readers to share their stories of how they are affected by the unprecedented event. Our open thread revealed a high level of anxiety in affected communities about worsening climate conditions and longer bushfire seasons. The anxiety appears to be exacerbated by a perceived lack of government action on the climate crisis and politicians at state and federal levels refusing to discuss climate change while the country burns. Others reported health issues, especially those with breathing conditions, and worried about access to medical care. Many readers were concerned about wildlife killed or injured in the fires and some returned home to provide water and food for birds and other wildlife.  Below is an edited collection of responses. “Our valley has been evacuated. We sit in our local town staying with fabulous friends but our fingers are crossed that our house and all we own, survives. It’s a strange place to be emotionally.” – valleyman “I feel a bit silly but I am feeling the effects of it all, lack of sleep, running on empty day in and out, picking up branches that drop off the trees in case an ember drops and ignites them. So, pretty emotional today, yet very lucky to have escaped anything drastic like so many others who are suffering. “We are in Tuncurry, mid-north coast ... our 17th day of blanketing smoke. We have packed and unpacked twice. Now packing again as RFS predicted fire path shows that with conditions worsening throughout the day, we could be severely impacted. “People up here say they’ve never seen anything like this in 30-40 years.” – moth76 “Day 18 of the fires around Tuncurry. Our house – just off Lakes Way, surrounded by some huge 8ft pine trees and eucalypts – is still miraculously OK. “My husband and I got woken by the RFS notifications, 22 in all within a 20km radius. So different to the early hours of the morning when there were only five fires within 20km. “Even though we have escaped the worst, it does take its toll, mentally and physically, especially when you have chronic breathing problems.” – moth76 “I have a breathing disease and the smoke in the air affected my breathing. Thankfully it was for only two days as I am a distance away from the nearest fire. My eyes also began to sting and water on one of those days when the smoke was particularly thick. “Minor, but still impacting on me. “My mental stress was impacted too. I was concerned about future events if I was in the midst of this climate nightmare that I would probably need hospital care.” – LovelyDaffodils “Smoke, smoke, and more smoke from the Lindfield Park fire in Port Macquarie that has been burning since LATE JULY. Residents have been putting up with very poor air quality all day, every day for months. “Health department advice is to stay inside if you suffer from asthma or bronchitis. This is completely unrealistic over such an extended period of time. And for those of us who don’t have asthma or bronchitis, we are probably about to develop these conditions, or worse, any day now.” – readingthepaperstill “I have taken an early mark to come home and conduct a welfare check on the bird life. We feed and provide drinking water to a significant number of lorikeets, currawongs and a family of magpies, including this year’s fledglings of all of those species. I said to MrsRGdA the other day that she may look at this place as her home, but it is also their habitat and we have an obligation to make it a sustainable resource for them too.” – randomguydeaustralie “We have a large variety of birds that have been hand fed on/off in the dry periods ... and two beautiful fledgling magpies whose parents have brought their kids to me for the past three seasons that we’ve been here (and then, unceremoniously, chase them away six months later to fend for themselves, breaking my heart). “How these two little ones have survived the past 18 days is beyond me, and worries me to death day and night. “I put out extra water bowls around the front and backyards when the fires began weeks ago, for any birds and wildlife, but I can guarantee that an hour after they’re cleaned and filled and placed all around our tiny acreage, they’re filled with ash and embers.” – moth76 “Watching the tree-tops on fire I thought about the koalas, the possums, the many other creatures that don’t have a chance. How many millions of animals die? Animals that are already at extinction’s door. Will the trees and plants regenerate as they usually do, or has the drought weakened them so much that the fires will finish them off?” – LovelyDaffodils “I am on the southern edge of the Stockyard East fire near Port Macquarie that is still going strong but it blasted through my property on Friday. I managed to save my house and my 75-year-old mum singlehandedly saved hers! “As I look around at all the devastation I am sad but also so angry that our politicians still have their eyes closed to the reality of climate change. This is not normal. This is not just another drought to be explained away as a natural cycle. Nearly 1 million hectares of NSW is burnt, much of that hadn’t burnt for hundreds of years because it was always too wet! And in November. Stop all the stupid denial and do something, Mr Morrison.” – anginpapps “As angry as these people make me, I think they think they are doing a good job … That’s why they talk politics when most sane people talk science (the numbers are in now)!” – cosmos57 “Let’s see if this government changes significantly after this has passed, or whether it is business as usual.” – LovelyDaffodils “This government is heartless, greedy, rude and negligent of its duties to a level that should be made a criminal offence!” – ClosetIntellectual “The idea of not talking about climate change during a climate-related event has been met with derision by the public. “What else are we not supposed to talk about that is uncomfortable for politicians? Don’t talk about war during a war? Don’t talk about hardship while people are suffering through it perhaps? “They have really missed the public mood in parliament and seem to be out of the solar system compared to reality.” – misterwildcard “I live on the mid-north coast amongst the trees. With the help of the firefighters and luck with the wind, we are still here. “Over winter there were very few chances to carry out hazard reduction. This is because for the last few years winter has been a non-event. “There is a yawning chasm of experience between the ‘suits’ and those living closer to nature.” – cosmos57 “So ‘this is not the time to talk about climate change’? Sounds very much like the NRA’s playbook after a mass shooting, doesn’t it? “Stay safe everyone.” – nowheretorun"

Share this...FacebookTwitterRebound and Sea Level
By Ed Caryl
During the peak of the last ice age, enough ice was collected in the great ice sheets that the global sea level was reduced by more than 120 meters. The ice sheets themselves were, in places, more than two kilometers thick. The great weight of that ice depressed the earth’s crust and mantle by hundreds of meters. In some places, ground that is now a hundred meters above sea level, was pressed down below the sea level that existed before and shortly after the ice melted. Because the earth’s mantle has a high viscosity, and the earth’s crust a high bending strength, these areas are still slowly rising after 12,000 years, and will rise for another 12,000, barring another ice age to press them down again. This “isostatic rebound” or “post-glacial rebound” (PGR) complicates sea levels worldwide because it continually changes the sea bottom and coastline shapes. The University of Colorado sea level measurements add 0.3 mm/year to sea level rise to “adjust” for this. Is this adjustment reasonable?
Locally, this rebound can be measured by precision GPS. Geological studies have also determined the prehistoric amount of rebound that has taken place. I will just mention three areas that have been and will be vastly changed by rebound: the St Lawrence Seaway area in Canada and northern New England in the U. S., an island beach in Nunavit, northern Canada, and Finland in northern Europe.

Figure 1 is a world map of PGR from the Wikipedia article on that subject, here.
The present day St. Lawrence River Seaway sits at the edge of the present PGR area that marks the boundary of the great Laurentide Ice Sheet of the last ice age. North of the river, the Provence of Quebec is rising. South of the river, southern New England is rising much slower or falling. This is apparent at Lake Ontario, where the tilting has resulted in the northern shore rising faster than the southern shore, and wetlands on the north draining and drying out, while on the southern shore, beaches are drowning and wetlands are being created from formerly dry land. The whole lake is very slowly rolling southward.
At the end of the last ice age, ice had blocked the St. Lawrence valley and formed the glacial Lake Candona, covering what is now the lower three Great Lakes, Ontario, Erie, and Huron. When the ice dam failed, the water level fell 300 feet (100 meters) in a few days. At this point, Lake Ontario may have been connected to the world ocean through the Champlain Sea. The Champlain Sea covered the whole area that is now Lake Champlain and all the St. Lawrence River Valley up to Lake Ontario. Pierre’s boyhood home in Northern Vermont was under seawater, or at the shore during this period. The Champlain Sea lasted from 12,500 years ago up to 9800 years ago, when the rising land finally cut off Lake Champlain from the waters to the north. The land has continued to rise in the Lake Champlain area, and now the lake is 29 to 30 meters above mean sea level.
In the far north of Canada, where the center of the ice sheet was thickest, the land is currently rising at nearly 2 cm a year. In the past, when the last ice had melted, the rate was even higher, and the land will continue to rise into the future until the next ice age returns. The PGR uplift is constant, without fits and starts, in contrast to land in tectonically active areas like California and Japan, and other areas that are near plate boundaries where earth movements will abruptly change sea level.

Here at Rebound Beach are many fossil beaches, one above the other, preserved because for most of the year the ground is frozen and snow-covered, there is little rain, and very little tidal action. The beaches seen here are like a stereo tape recording (with a stream dividing the tracks) of rising and falling sea levels recorded on a steadily rising, evenly sloped land form. It appears that since the last time the tape was erased, when the ice scrubbed the slope clean over 12,000 years ago, there have been about 20 rises, falls, or hesitations in the sea level, where the rate was different from the steady PGR. A dating of each of these fossil beaches would result in a good record of sea level over the last 12,000 years.
Figure 3 (left) is a map of Finland as of 11,000 years ago. Source. The blue area was water.
Finland 11,000 years ago was mostly sea-bottom with an archipelago of islands. Many place-names in Finland reflect this history with high ground that has island or other maritime feature names. As the land rose, lakes were cut off from the sea, and the Gulf of Bothnia became smaller. The current rate of uplift here approaches 1 cm a year in the northern Gulf. On this map, at the left edge just below center is a narrowing of the Gulf of Bothnia at Kvarken. This narrowing separates Bothnian Bay from the outer Bothnian Sea further south. The water at this point is only about 25 meters deep. Bothnian Bay is already nearly fresh water due to the number and size of the rivers flowing into it. The salt content is now too low to be tasted and there are many freshwater fish species. In about 1500 years uplift will create a further narrowing, reducing the depth to about 10 meters, creating a river flowing south across the Kvarken. At that time Bothnia Bay will be a freshwater lake.
The rising of the bottom of the Bay of Bothnia and the Baltic Sea in general will reduce the volume of the Baltic and force that water into the world ocean, raising the sea level generally. Just to estimate the amount of rise, if the average PGR is 5 mm/year for the Baltic, and the Baltic is roughly 1/1000th of the total ocean area, then the world ocean will rise 0.005 mm/year.
But the Baltic is small compared to Hudson Bay, and Hudson Bay is also rising. The tide gauge at Churchill is rising (sea level falling) at 1.2 cm/year. Hudson Bay is 0.34% of the World Ocean. The PGR here will contribute 0.041 mm/year to general sea level rise. The other waters around the islands of Nunavit in northern Canada will contribute about another 0.004 mm/year, making a total for the Baltic and Canada about 0.05 mm/year.
But the PGR rising is offset by sea bottom sinking. As the earth’s mantle rises, the mantle in the surrounding area must flow down and under to compensate. As can be seen in figure 1, the North Atlantic, the bottom between Newfoundland and Greenland, and the ocean bottom north of Canada, is sinking. These areas are totally under ocean, unlike the rising areas that are mostly land. The sink rate seems to be 3 to 4 mm/year over an area much greater than the rising sea bottoms, which would appear to more than cancel any sea level rise due to PGR. The 0.3 mm/year positive “adjustment” to sea level rise by the UC sea level group does not appear to be justified.

"Hey Bobin, I came home today. I wasn’t really expecting to. I got a call when I was still asleep, asking if I wanted to drive up to see if the house I grew up in still exists. It does. I’m glad I came.We’re reasonably well fire-prepped but the house probably only remains thanks to a well-timed water bomb from the RFS. The cottage I grew up in until I was 12 doesn’t.  It’s an oddly pretty pile of corro, ash and charred logs supported by a couple of stone walls my mum built when I was in utero. The sculpted face of a warrior woman that looked over me from the mantel while I was sleeping in the lounge room as a kid now looks out over a ruined mess. Maybe a fitting end for that place. At least it means we don’t have to decide what to do with it. Bobin, I saw parts of you today that I thought I’d never see. Parts that I probably shouldn’t have seen. I saw the insides of trees as infernos. I saw blackened hillsides with nothing left but rock and ash. I saw rainforest on fire. I saw fucking creek beds on fire. Creek beds completely dry, with water in the few deep pools a foot lower than I have ever seen in my 35 years of knowing you. I saw a country school blackened and twisted and melted to the ground today. After only 136 years. I’m glad the library still stands, and I hope that the relevant authorities have the vision to bring it back. And the hall. We would be devastated without you. I saw a few people today. Some fucking amazing ones. I saw firefighter friends who I’ve known for years, still working after a few hours’ rest following 36 hours of chaos. I saw friends whose houses had been saved looking out for other people. I saw friends who had nearly lost everything, but had managed to escape with their house intact, and their animals still alive, riding the relief high. I saw other friends who had lost everything. Like, everything. Just got out to a neighbour’s house with wallet and laptop and a change of clothes before everything collapsed. Photos lost. Memories lost. The smell of home replaced with the lingering smell of ash. I saw some of those friends still smiling, laughing even. I saw others crying. I met new friends helping old friends with a place to stay, and old friends helping new friends put out spotfires. I saw other friends getting ready for the fire that would be hitting right now, well prepared, but with fingers crossed that their place burns out slowly tonight, because if it isn’t burnt by Tuesday, it will probably burn harder then. I left knowing I have many friends who are prepared, but also knowing you can never be prepared enough. I hope they get it easy. Bobin, you’re fucking gutted. I’ve seen fires run through you. The hall nearly burnt a few years ago. But there was never anything like this. No one expected six houses in the middle of the village, in the middle of open paddocks, to just disappear. What the fuck. But Bobin, if I know any place, and community, that can take a gut punch like that, and stand straight back up, it’s you. You’re a community of amazing people, with an amazing capacity to get shit done. You can pull through this. You’ll probably even do it in style.I really came home today. I felt it so much. I am who I am because of you. I have fallen back in love, and I look forward to helping you back on your feet in whatever way I can.

"What if we could meet the challenges of the ongoing environmental crisis without changing our behaviour and practices in any way? What if, rather than revising our way of life, we could instead propose a few technical fixes that would reduce our environmental impacts while allowing us to go on living as before? Would this really settle the ethical and political questions that are posed by our current moment of climate catastrophe, mass extinction, resource scarcity and industrialised animal slaughter? These are some of the questions that are posed by Netflix’s latest original movie, Okja. The story centres on the eponymous Okja, an animal belonging to a new species that has been genetically engineered to fulfil the developed world’s boundless appetite for meat, while minimising the environmental impact of its production. In the words of CEO Lucy Mirando (played by the always wonderful Tilda Swinton): This beautiful and special little creature will be a revolution in the livestock industry. Our super pigs will not only be big and beautiful; they will also leave a minimal footprint on the environment, consume less feed, and produce less excretions; and most importantly – they need to taste fucking good. The film follows Okja and her young keeper Mija as agribusiness interests compete with animal activists to decide her fate. Okja is a timely intervention into debates about the environmental costs of meat production. For some years now, the United Nations has been suggesting that we need to cut back on meat and dairy production for the sake of the planet – and, more recently, the wildly successful activist documentary Cowspiracy brought this argument to a wider public.  As a consequence, there has been a recognition that livestock production needs to make a case for itself in terms that are more compatible with recent environmentalist thinking – often by drawing on emerging technologies to reduce environmental impact.  Recently, adjustments to cows’ gut flora were proposed as a way to cut methane emissions. More radically, new developments in tissue engineering promise to bypass the living animal altogether by growing real animal flesh through cell culture in the laboratory. Okja deftly satirises this turn from shameless profiteering to an (at least ostensibly) ethically and environmentally responsible agribusiness. Swinton’s CEO is more Steve Jobs than Henry Ford – and her vision for agribusiness owes more to tech-industry utopianism than it does to 20th-century industrial capitalism. Having wrested control of the company from her father (who developed military technology) and her sister (whose tenure as CEO was marred by industrial-ecological catastrophe), Mirando aims to turn “the most hated agrochemical company in the world” into a seemingly beneficent force for good. But in creating Okja’s species as an ecologically sustainable alternative to cattle, has Mirando finally reconciled animal agriculture to its ethical and environmental obligations? Animal activists in the film – and in wider society – would strenuously disagree. It’s worth noting here that the director is sympathetic to these claims, having become vegan during the filming of Okja – and having borrowed much of the film’s visual rhetoric from footage taken by undercover activist documentarians. In order to settle this question, we need to more carefully explore how sustainability functions as an ethical and political ideal. Sustainability is a deeply ambivalent concept. On the one hand, it names a broad desire to take more responsibility for our impact on the planet – and this is clearly a good thing. On the other hand, unless it is directed by an ethical analysis which isn’t easily reduced to technical tinkering, it can quickly become a kind of cynical calculation. In this context, consider the strange paradox of new, more sustainable fishing practices: we save species from extinction in order to better kill them in the future. The shift to thinking about the sustainability of meat production in merely technical terms (“how should we reduce emissions?”) entirely bypasses the question of animal ethics. Instead of asking “should we kill?”, we find ourselves asking “how should we kill with maximum efficiency?” By translating an ethical question into a technical one, this model of sustainability lets animal agriculture off the hook for the violence that it does. Okja pushes back against this by foregrounding the relationship between a little girl and her animal friend. So, yes, Okja is a well-engineered beast who contributes to lower environmental impact, but she’s also an individual animal who loves and is loved – and she has an ethically significant interest in her own well-being.  As Okja and Cowspiracy make clear, the technical debate into the environmental impact of eating meat is critically important. But even if animal agribusiness could be made thoroughly sustainable, routine practices of confinement, forcible reproduction and slaughter remain highly ethically questionable."
"Heeding the advice of fire controllers and decades of scientific reports, Glen Innes Severn council last month declared a climate emergency. As the New South Wales government itself has now declared, those emergency conditions extend far beyond our shire borders and touch every community across the state. Within our borders we have seen a magnificent, humane and unstinting response from the Rural Fire Service, State Emergency Service, Red Cross, Salvation Army, NSW Police, Glen Innes Severn council employees, fellow councillors, the deputy mayor, Dianne Newman, and hundreds of community volunteers who for months now have done everything from sweep gutters to pitch tents to butter bread for sandwiches.  Throughout this time, every effort has been made to prepare and defend both private and public properties in my community of Wytaliba, NSW, which last week succumbed to merciless physics that pay no heed to opinion, nor folklore, nor politics. Members of my family are in hospital. Two community members, my neighbours for decades, are lost to us. We have lost dozens of homes beloved by hundreds of people. An entire community has been all but wiped off the map. In the face of this tragedy already I have received a personal message of support from the NSW governor, Margaret Beazley, for whose humane and wise words I am most humbly grateful, and for whose leadership of the state of NSW we are together all indebted. Alongside everyone in this community, I also welcome the commitment of our state member for Northern Tablelands, Adam Marshall, to the rebuilding of Wytaliba public school, a much-loved school which burned to the ground on the same day that the federal government announced that only private schools will share in $10m of drought support funding. While all this is a personal tragedy for my family and myself, it is but one story within an unfolding statewide and global disaster, about which our community deserves nothing less than the honest and unvarnished truth. There are already those who, following such statements, will aim to shoot the messenger. To those people I say this: take your best shot, for I have already been through hell and there is nothing you can say or do that can touch me now. But for the sake of the future, for the sake of our community and the rising generation who will inherit this scorched Earth, one can only hope there will be enough people remaining who retain the common decency to listen, to heed the cries of those in harm’s way, who will now together take decisive and collective action to save our ecosystem and our civilisation from collapse. Already there are armchair experts ready with free advice about meeting with disaster. Let it be made perfectly clear that all the area that burned has already been a fire ground for two months. There were hazard reduction and backburns under state authority last month and last year. The properties were all well-prepared and extensively defended. People who have lived with fire risk for decades knew exactly what to do, and they did it. The full expertise and advice of fire controllers has been heeded at every turn. I’ll put my 20-year Rural Fire Service medal up against your free advice any day of the week. The anger is real. The anger is justified. Because this disaster was all foreseen and predicted. For decades the link between a hotter, drier climate, land-clearing, excessive irrigation and increased fire risk have all been attested in scientific papers. Equally for decades there have been those who insist they know better. Their ignorance and arrogance have delivered us only ashes – let these now be swept away. Instead, we will turn towards the sober and sensible measures recommended by fire controllers, and by scientists. We will insist that governments at all levels take heed of that advice, for we have seen now up close the result when they do not. We turn to those governments now to seek what support is needed and available to assist these devastated communities to get back on their feet. To protect these communities from future harm by curbing climate change. To commit to a saner, safer world where we measure our progress in terms of sustainability, and our wealth in terms of community. In the face of disaster, everyone learns something about themselves and the people around them. What, I wonder, will be the lesson learnt from this disaster? That remains to be seen. But for now it is the words attributed to Winston Churchill that are salutary: “if you’re going through hell, keep going.” • Carol Sparks is the mayor of Glen Innes Severn council"

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome NTZ readers may recognize the face of a person who appeared at the recent Heartland: Austrian rapper Kilez More, whom NoTricksZone featured on couple of occasions. I’m also proud to say that NoTricksZone had a hand in helping to organize Kilez’s appearance in Las Vegas. So for me watching him at the end the following video is particularly gratifying. I hope you’ll take time to watch his short speech.
 
Kilez gets introduced by the great James Delingpole (1:54:30) and starts his act at the 2:02:55 mark. (Excuse the substantial technical-audio breakdown during his performance). 
So what business would a young rapper artist have performing before a crowd of staid, humorless scientists who probably use slide rules to tie their shoes? I mean dancer/singer types and climate scientists are about as opposite as you can get. Well Kilez produced a skeptic rap song hammering at “climate science”. At Youtube his music video has been viewed close to 120,000 times.
“Manipulation from schools, teachers, universities…”
In his run-up speech at the Heartland Conference before his rap performance Kilez talks about the formidable social and institutional forces acting to indoctrinate the youth with man-made climate change dogma, recalling the “manipulation from schools, teachers, universities and everything“.  He adds, “History shows us that when everyone has the same opinion, then you have to take a second look. And there is an old saying in Austria which says: ‘When everybody says yes, then go ahead and say no. And if everybody stands, then start moving. And most important of all, when everybody is quiet, then speak out loud.'”
What impresses the most about Kilez is the aura of fearlessness, energy, optimism and confidence he exudes, not appearing at all to be intimidated. I like how he tells James Taylor he isn’t yet finished. I wish his speech had been longer, much longer. The fresh energy he offers is sorely needed at times.
Inspired by Climategate

He recounts how he did his own research and realized that what bothered him the most was not that the debate was hidden, but what the climate issue was being used for: “All the taxes, all the laws” and the burning of biofuel was coming at the expense of the poor. Ultimately it was the Climategate affair that spurred him to produce his hit rap music video.
He then tells of the backlash he faced and of how activists even badgered festival organizers to get them to keep Kilez off stage and how he has to fight these battles against activist forces day in and day out. But his cheer and humor are unstoppable, and even infectious…and implies that the trip to Vegas makes it worth it.
Young people won’t buy books on the subject
After the rap performance (unfortunately with audio-technical defects) he emphasizes the importance of the skeptic message reaching young people and that the video acts as a “door-opener” for them as it takes a complex subject and transport it to them. Music and song acts as a first step to get young people to take a closer look, as they aren’t likely to go to the bookstore to buy a book about it. Finally, he praises the impact the video is having because he feels it is indeed opening the doors for open debate among the younger generation.
Kilez could have taken the easy path and opted to play along with the leanings of the showbiz industry, but instead he has elected to go against a powerful social headwind because he feels it is the right thing to do. That’s the mark of a courageous man. Keep it going, Kilez!
Hope to read your comments!

"Ash dieback is back in the news, even though it never really went away. The first confirmed reports were from a few woodlands in East Anglia in late 2012, and urgent surveys soon established a much wider distribution in other parts of England as well as Scotland and Wales. Since then, the disease has spread relentlessly and few areas with ash appear unaffected. The worrying feature of ash dieback is that most trees appear susceptible, dying within a few years. Some survive for longer, but the long term prognosis for ash in the UK is not good. Even as we celebrate the survivors, an insect pest introduced into Europe from Asia is heading our way. Already established in North America, the emerald ash borer has ripped through ash trees in the northern states in the US and threatens to do the same in the UK. The paper that recently returned ash dieback to the media spotlight did so in a general review of the ecological importance of the common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) in northern Europe. The author’s prediction that ash would be driven to near extinction by a fatal combination of dieback and emerald ash borer was not new, even if media reports suggested otherwise: the same prediction was made in the UK in 2012 and in other European countries from the turn of the century.  Ash is a keystone species in the UK, providing a habitat for almost 1,000 other organisms (excluding bacteria). Over 100 species are either completely or highly dependent on ash for survival. So it’s not only ash that is threatened by extinction – if indeed this is what is going to happen. While many reports suggest that the ash tree will eventually disappear from British forests, all is not totally lost. Researchers working together as NORNEX have identified a 200-year-old tree in Norfolk – named “Betty” – that could hold the key to fighting dieback. The tree’s strong tolerance to the disease has helped scientists identify three genetic markers which can help to predict a tree’s susceptibility to the disease. Tolerant trees still get infected by the disease popularly know as “Chalara”, but more correctly as Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. In our experience, all common ash appear susceptible to infection, but their responses differ.  A rate of 3% of trees showing tolerance doesn’t sound high, but ash does seed prolifically so perhaps survivors will eventually fill some of the gaps left by more susceptible individual trees. At the first sites where ash dieback was reported around 20 years ago in Lithuania, many healthy looking ash were left standing, when the badly diseased mature trees were felled. Sadly, almost all of the trees that were left in those first fellings are now either dead or showing severe dieback. The latest research in the UK strongly suggests that Hymenoscyphus fraxineus was already present some years before its official confirmation in 2012. Given the extent of damage caused by the disease, why was it not discovered earlier? A possible reason is that it takes time for a pathogen population to build up sufficiently to become strikingly obvious. It is too late to start agonising about a failure to detect ash dieback. A disease spread by the wind to widely dispersed trees is impossible to stop. We need to think more carefully about research priorities and what we want to achieve. A first priority should be to maintain healthy ash trees in the wider environment in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. This means paying equal attention to the pathogen and the host – and what happens between them. There is good news for the UK, however: the government has already recognised the need for even more and sustained research to avoid such damage to forests. Alongside NORNEX, much research emphasis has been on understanding the fungus that causes the disease and looking for resistance in the host.  The pathogen that causes dieback orginates in Asia, where it invades the tree’s leaves, but doesn’t cause disease – nothing to get concerned about there. When the fungus came to Europe (we’re not sure how), however, it also spread to the stem, killing branches and eventually whole trees. The NORNEX report mentions the second threat on the ash tree’s horizon: the emerald ash borer, an insect which is present on the continent of Europe, having spreading westwards from Moscow. The bright green bug is native to the same areas of east Asia as H. fraxineus, but spread to North America – probably in the late 1990s/early 2000s – where it is devastating all native species of ash. Unfortunately, it is now highly likely that the Emerald ash borer will gradually spread across Europe towards the UK, too.  The ash trees remaining after the effects of H. fraxineus will certainly provide suitable food sources for the borer in the UK. It is essential, therefore, that the rewarding efforts made to understand ash dieback are continued with emphasis on the emerald ash borer. Salvation may be possible, but not overnight. There are some promising paths to pursue but we have to consider whether Asian ash species will provide suitable habitats for the same dependent species as native ash, an ecological question that is hard to answer. Strengthening resistance using Asian ash species holds considerable promise for the future – and not only for ash. The genetic methods employed by NORNEX are relevant to different tree species threatened by other diseases and insects. There is hope ahead to dampen the doomsday scenario that brief bursts of media interest fuel.  It’s not good by any account, but there are glints of hope to lighten the path ahead."

Share this...FacebookTwitterReader Kurt in Switzerland points out that Germany’s Climate Pope John Schellnhuber, Director of the end-of-times Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), has just postponed the timepoint when man’s CO2 emissions must reach a peak and start their (rapid) downward trend.
Two days ago I quoted Professor Schellnhuber, who said:
At the latest by 2030 Co2 emissions must reach their peak and start downward.”
That deadline appeared to be new, so Kurt in Switzerland checked if that was the deadline Schellnhuber had given in the past. Kurt writes:
In 2011, Schellnhuber insisted that the emissions curve needed to peak no later than 2020 in order to meet the 2 degree warming target. http://www.wbgu.de/wbgu_jg2011_ZfE.pdf (See p. 7 of 34).”
Indeed in 2011 here Prof. Schellnhuber wrote:
The global emissions trend reversal must occur no later than 2020 [in order to assure compliance to the 2-degree C limit].”
Three years ago Schellnhuber was warning we had to turn things around by 2020 at the latest, or else we would be doomed. Now suddenly we’ve just been given 10 more years?

Now what could have possibly compelled Prof. Schellnhuber to recalculate a new peak time? Perhaps it was the sudden the realization that his expectation of a possible trend change by 2020 was one of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds? Global CO2 emissions have not even yet started to slow down, and a trend reversal point is nowhere near in sight. Major emerging industrial countries like China and India are still seeing rapid, accelerating CO2 emissions growth.
Even Schellnhuber’s home country of Germany, supposedly a model for cutting CO2 emissions, has not managed to reduce CO2 emissions since 2000 – despite more than tripling its renewable energy capacity at a cost of hundreds of billions of euros, as EIKE shows here today:

 CO2 emissions from electricity are depicted by the red line. Renewable energy capacity by the blue line. It’s not working! Source: BDEW
 The story is the same in neighboring Austria. Die Presse here quotes Austrian Green Party spokeswoman Christiane Brunner:
According to an evaluation by participants of the UN Climate Conference in Lima Peru, Austria has not ‘saved a single gram of CO2.’ […]
In 1990 Austria saw CO2 emissions of 78 million tonnes; in 2005 it was 82 million tonnes. ‘When one calculates the EU2020 taregts, Austria will end up once again at only 78 million tonnes in the year 2020 – and that only if additional measures get implemented,’ Brunner criticizes.”
We can certainly expect Professor Schellnhuber to make yet another recalculation in the year 2018 or so, pushing back yet again the deadline for a trend change to 2040 or even 2050. This of course is as remote from science as one could possibly get. Professor Schellnhuber and his scientists in Potsdam are rapidly making themselves to a laughing stock.

"As bushfire conditions were declared “catastrophic” on Tuesday, New South Wales bureaucrats attending a conference on adaptation to climate change were directed not discuss the link between climate change and bushfires. Bureaucrats from the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment were sent an email soon after the AdaptNSW 2019 Forum began, causing consternation among some attendees who saw it as tantamount to gagging them.  The email said: “For those attending AdaptNSW today, public affairs has issued advice not to discuss the link between climate change and bushfires. “Refer questions in session and plenaries to bushfire reps.” The former NSW fire commissioner Greg Mullins was one of the attendees. But the participants also included scientists and experts who are developing policy and advising the Berejiklian government on adaptation measures the state could take in relation to land use, planning and dealing with the risk of bushfires. “Gagging climate change experts from speaking in the middle of a bushfire disaster is a new low from this government,” the Greens MP David Shoebridge said when told of the email by Guardian Australia. “Right now we need to be hearing more from experts and, to be quite frank, maybe a little less from politicians. “We know there is a link between the climate emergency and these catastrophic fires and the public debate needs the assistance of impartial government experts. This is a vacuum that will otherwise be filled with political shouting and increasing public anger.” According to publicity for the event, “AdaptNSW Forum is a one-day event which brings together climate change researchers and practitioners from government, industry and universities to showcase NSW’s leading research, tools and resources to help minimise the impacts of climate change in local communities.” Other attendees included local government, Landcare experts as well as architects and planners. The theme for the AdaptNSW 2019 Forum was “Actions in adaptation: building resilience in NSW”. The entire rationale for the conference was to bring together experts who could contribute to discussion on adaptation to climate change. It was held, coincidentally, as Sydney was braced for a bushfire threat that for the first time had been categorised as “catastrophic”. But some in the government, notably the Nationals, expressed outrage at people talking about whether climate change is exacerbating the extreme conditions and bushfire risk. On Monday the NSW deputy premier, John Barilaro, said: “It is an absolute disgrace to be talking about climate change while we have lost lives and assets. “For any bloody greenie or lefty out there who wants to talk about climate change ... when communities in the next 48 hours might lose more lives, if this is the time people want to talk about climate change, they are a bloody disgrace.’’ The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, took aim at the Greens and “all those other inner-city raving lunatics” who, he claimed, were politicising the tragedy. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, had a more measured position, saying she did not shy away from discussing climate change but that it was not her primary concern at the moment. The NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, told the Guardian he had attended the AdaptNSW conference and delivered a speech about climate change before announcing a series of grants for projects to support adaptation projects. “Climate change is a real issue that requires a decisive response and all the scientific advice I have been given says that our changing climate will seeing more extreme weather events,” Kean said. “I want to see our best minds debating and discussing what we can do to mitigate climate change and addressing the impacts we are experiencing, rather than silencing debate or scoring political points.” Kean said his speech to the forum had canvassed the fact that “climate change doesn’t respect the division between governments or divisions between departments” and the need for decisive action by governments build resilience to a changing climate."

Harvard Astrophycist Willie Soon asks if hottest year ever claim is “a joke”.
NoTricksZone sought out astrophysicist Dr. Willie Soon’s opinion on the claim that 2014 is the “hottest on record”. What follows is his reply:
2014 hottest year a manipulation
Is this a joke or simply my BAD dream? Prostituting science like this is now consider a virtue. It is no wonder that science writer Lord Ridley said that he has lost his faith on science as an institution.
http://www.rationaloptimist.com.aspx
Why would anyone even bother with claims and insistence of the globe in 2014 being the hottest to a relative colder years all within a few hundredths of a degree Celsius? Poor Anders Celsius should be dancing in his grave.
The claim is based on just one (from a half dozen or so) thermometer-based products whose measurement quality is fraught with uncertainty and with actual error bars at least ten times larger than those claimed “effects”. WMO and others simply pick and choose the “data” that produces the press news they want in time for the Lima, Peru political pow-wow.
In truth the datasets taken as a whole clearly show that the global temperature has been flat-trending for nearly two decades now and that the theory of rising CO2 leading to global warming is sorrowfully exaggerated.

This kind of manipulative science, exemplified by IPCC, WMO, NOAA and what have you, is serving its master in the realm of politics and policy, and is indeed very sickening.
All of them are essentially behaving in ways we would never want any of our school children to behave: cheating and manipulating that are accompanied by careful wording and clever rhetoric.
Of course as a philosophy we all hold science dear. But if we continue to keep silent and do not express outrage like the one I now feel, the notion of science as a philosophy and way of life will soon be reduced to computer games and animation for the mind-controllers and beauty-contest institutions.
If folks reading NTZ still need a bit of fact on how stinky this CO2-global warming ideology has become, you only need to consider reading the blog by Willis Eschenbach on how the UN’s own survey of over 6 million votes show climate change a non-issue.

"Ocean acidification is causing fundamental and dangerous changes in the chemistry of the world’s oceans yet only one in five Britons has even heard of ocean acidification, let alone believes it a cause for concern. Around 97%  of climate scientists believe global warming is principally driven by human activity, yet only 16% of the public know the expert consensus to be this strong. These are just two examples of common misconceptions among the UK public on the science of climate change. When surveyed, many people report feeling unsure and confused about various aspects of the discipline. Furthermore, they lack trust in scientists: in the wake of the IPCC’s fifth assessment report, nearly four in ten people felt that scientists were exaggerating concerns. Are these realities any surprise when we see headlines such as “Planet is not overheating, says professor” and “Scientists ‘are exaggerating carbon threat to marine life’” in the UK’s national media? It was the former article that recently prompted a number of members of the House of Lords, including me, to write a letter to the editor of The Times, John Witherow. We highlighted the newspaper’s recent record of tendentious and misleading coverage of climate science (among many other articles, it must be said, that are worthy of the paper’s name and tradition). The “not overheating” article described a study suggesting there is no statistically valid evidence for man-made climate change – and therefore that the planet will not warm significantly by the end of the century. But the study was not conducted by a climate scientist and it ignored basic physical laws. It did not undergo scientific peer-review and it was funded by a climate-sceptic lobby group, the Global Warming Policy Foundation. The fact that a newspaper of The Times’ standing gave coverage to such a piece of research is both remarkable and deeply concerning. But it is not an isolated example. Instead it typifies a disturbing pattern in parts of the UK national media where there is an apparent determination to systematically undermine climate science and those conducting it – and to amplify marginal dissenting arguments even when they come with no evidence. Our letter was intended to highlight the loss of credibility that inevitably comes with printing such stories. Indeed, it is precisely the failure of papers such as The Times to treat climate change properly that is prompting more informed readers to vote with their feet and turn to credible web-based news outlets such as BusinessGreen and Carbon Brief. The media is changing rapidly and established papers such as The Times are competing for readers, credibility and eventually influence against smaller publications that are often producing better coverage. The Times’ loss of credibility is its own problem. However, such articles raise wider concerns about the misunderstandings generated among the public, and the loss of trust in science. These problems result because, despite the proliferation of new media, the established titles continue to play a very important role in perceptions of science. They form the principal conduit through which the public and politicians access scientific information, they provide a proxy for public debate and help set the tone – and often the agenda – for policy-making. Thus poor-quality or slanted science reporting contributes, either unwittingly or wittingly, to the public misunderstanding of science. Public misunderstanding of science can have serious consequences. In the early 1990s, The Sunday Times persisted in denying the link between HIV and AIDs after most other publications had acknowledged reality. An editorial in Nature described its reporting as “seriously mistaken, and probably disastrous”. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, media outlets gave widespread coverage to the hypothesised link between the MMR vaccine and autism – coverage that has since been criticised as naïve and misleading. It goes without saying that such misrepresentations of scientific knowledge run against the interests of society. People are unable to make informed decisions or to demand appropriate action from politicians. In the MMR case, outbreaks involving more than 2,000 cases of measles in 2012 were attributed to years of under-immunisation following media misreporting of the MMR issue. In the case in hand, The Times’ poor reporting on climate science has the potential to cause real harm. Of course, there are uncertainties in climate science, but uncertainty should not be conflated with doubt. As Naomi Oreskes and Eric Conway have so clearly documented in their excellent book Merchants of Doubt, those who wish to undermine the credibility of scientific evidence, for instance the tobacco industry in relation to cancer and smoking, have systematically tried to turn “uncertainty” into “doubt”. So where does this leave us? Editors must be free to print what they want within the law, as a free press is vital for democracy. It is entirely right that scientists, like everyone else, are subject to questioning. Not all of us are angels – and not all research is good research. We are above neither the law nor legitimate journalistic scrutiny – and editors are quite within their rights to seek out divergent views. But the key word here is “legitimate”. Scrutiny that is carried out in the public interest with the intention of uncovering genuinely bad practice is entirely fair; questions asked and articles slanted with the intention of promoting a specific argument are not. And even opinion articles must acknowledge the evidence, otherwise what are they but fiction? Readers also have rights – and the right to object to distorted or biased coverage is one of them. I would argue that in the case of scientists, this extends far beyond being a right – it is virtually an obligation. In 2014, UK citizens invested about £10 billion in research and development. If research is funded by the public, then it is the public’s right to have findings disseminated accurately. And as both the recipients of public funding and the individuals with expertise in these complex subjects, the onus is on us academics to ensure that research is properly communicated. Engaging with the media is not to every scientist’s taste. The journalist’s world is a lot more feisty and less respectful than ours. But in the end, accurate reporting of science matters. Editors do respond to comments and criticism. Scientists can and indeed must challenge poor reporting on climate change and, if enough of us do so regularly, it will improve – to the benefit of scientists, the public and indeed journalism itself."

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline Spiegel has a piece titled: Preaching travel by rail, but flying Business Class.
It would be natural to expect environmentalist greens and climate activists to take commercial flights very rarely, opting for rail, bus, or bicycle instead. However, it turns out they do not practice what they love to preach.
Spiegel news magazine writes of an unpublished survey commissioned by the Bundesverband der Deutschen Luftverkehrswirtschaft (Federal Association of German Aviation Industry) to find out which voters in Germany fly the most often. Some of us will not be surprised to learn that hypocrisy is alive and well in Germany.
Spiegel writes.
Hardly anyone criticizes air travel as vehemently as the Greens do. An unpublished study now shows: It is precisely the voters of the ecology party who most prefer hop onto commercial airliners.

Green love most flying the carbonated skies. Public domain photo.
 Spiegel writes that the survey was conducted by a “renowned polling organization”.
The results of the survey show that the Green Party voters fly the most: 49% have flown at least once in the past 12 months. They were followed by the communist Die Linke (42%), the conservatives CDU (36%) and lastly by the socialists SPD (32%).
When asked who had never ever flown in a jet, 17% of the communists said they had never flown, 16% of the conservatives, 13% of the socialists and 0% of the greens. All Green party voters surveyed said they had flown at least once in their lifetime.  Flying for me, but not for you.
When asked if they agree that it is good that so people today can afford to fly today, the percentage answering “yes” was 77% for the conservatives, 77% for the socialists, 69% for the communists and only 48% for the jet-setting greens.
Spiegel reports that green voters tend to be younger and hold high-income jobs, and so fit the profile of frequent fliers. What’s strange is that 60% of the flights in Germany are domestic, trips that could easily be done by rail. Apparently railcars are not good enough for environmentalists.
According to Spiegel the survey was conducted in September with 1032 persons interviewed. 77 of those interviewed identified themselves as Green voters.

"Fire chiefs in Australia have warned of “the most dangerous bushfire week this nation has ever seen”, saying New South Wales – the country’s most populous state – faces an unprecedented “catastrophic” fire day on Tuesday Sixty fires are currently burning in across the state, 40 of which are running out of control. There are also nearly 50 fires burning in Queensland, and fires in Western Australia and South Australia. Across NSW, three people have already died, and more than 150 homes have been razed. An extreme and persistent drought has left much of the region tinder-dry. The conditions, combined with temperatures in the high 30s and strong winds, are expected to present about 1,300 volunteer firefighters from across the country with life-threatening fires on Tuesday that will be impossible to stop. Even as emergency authorities were making their preparations, the federal government’s refusal to discuss the role of climate change in worsening the fire risk attracted condemnation, after the deputy prime minister Michael McCormack on Monday dismissed such concerns as the “ravings of … inner-city lunatics”. Earlier, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, took the unprecedented step of declaring a state of emergency that will be in place for a week.  At one stage on Friday, weeks ahead of Australia’s traditional bushfire season, 99 fires were burning out of control simultaneously across the state, including 17 that were considered life-threatening emergencies. Already this year, bushfires have burnt more than 850,000 hectares across NSW – an area more than five times the size of Greater London – and three times as much as burnt all of last fire season. Thousands have been evacuated from their homes and hundreds of schools have closed. The commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Services, Shane Fitzsimmons, said the state faced “the most dangerous bushfire week this nation has ever seen”. And he warned that – beyond the immediate threat this week – the fire threat would only worsen as Australia heads into summer. “We have got the worst of our fire season still ahead of us. We’re not even in summer yet,” he said. In the decade since NSW’s bushfire ratings system was revamped – following Victoria’s Black Saturday fires which killed 173 people – Australia’s largest city, Sydney, has never had a “catastrophic” rating. As well as the greater Sydney region, the areas immediately north and south of the state capital – the Greater Hunter, and the Illawarra and Shoalhaven – are also rated catastrophic. The catastrophic rating is based on a matrix of factors including temperature, humidity, wind and dryness of the landscape. Residents are being warned that fires under these conditions are, in some cases, impossible to suppress, and homes will burn. People in fire-prone areas have been told to leave on Monday. “Catastrophic is off the conventional scale,” Fitzsimmons said. “It’s where people die.” Three people were killed on the NSW north coast over the weekend. Two people were found separately in burnt-out cars, apparently trying to flee fast-moving fire fronts. Another woman, 69-year-old Vivian Chaplain, was found unconscious, and badly burned, at the scene of a fire in Wytaliba. Relatives said she had stayed to protect her home and animals. She was flown to hospital in Sydney but later died. The debate over the early and severe start to the east coast fire season has become acutely political, with politicians repeatedly avoiding the question of whether climate change was a contributing factor. The conservative coalition government has faced consistent criticism over inaction on climate change. Carbon emissions are continuing to rise in Australia, reaching their highest ever levels last year. The government says it will meet its Paris agreement targets, but this is disputed by climate scientists. After the prime minister, Scott Morrison, offered “thoughts and prayers” to those who had lost family and homes, but refused to answer questions on climate change, critics compared his “thoughts and prayers” to those offered by the NRA after mass shootings in the US, as substitute for discussion on gun control. Australia’s deputy prime minister, from the country-based Nationals party, condemned the climate change concerns of “raving inner-city lunatics” when Australians in rural areas were still battling fires. “We’ve had fires in Australia since time began, and what people need now is a little bit of sympathy, understanding and real assistance – they need help, they need shelter,” he told ABC radio. It is not a political thing. It is a scientific fact that we are going through climate change. “They don’t need the ravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital city greenies at this time, when they’re trying to save their homes, when in fact they’re going out in many cases saving other peoples’ homes and leaving their own homes at risk.” But Carol Sparks, the mayor of the Glen Innes Severn council on the NSW north coast, whose house in the hamlet of Wytaliba was severely damaged, said the role of climate change could not be ignored. “Well, I probably couldn’t respond how I really feel on television but I think Michael McCormack needs to read the science, and that is what I am going by, is the science. “It is not a political thing. It is a scientific fact that we are going through climate change.” Sparks, from the Greens party, said of most immediate concern were the houses still burning, and the welfare of those who had lost loved ones and property. “But the overall thing is we are so dry in this country – we haven’t had rain for years in some places. All the dams and creeks and rivers are dry, and we need to look at what we’re going to do about that in the future. To deny climate change is, to me, a very ill-informed and uneducated way of looking at things.” Climate scientist Ned Haughton’s childhood home in the NSW mid-north coast village of Bobin was razed at the weekend. He said with climate change, “it’s going to get worse”. “The state and [federal] Liberal governments are just trying their hardest to shut down any decent action on climate,” he said. “This is just not the right way to act if you care about the planet, if you care about your kids’ future, if you care about other people in your community’s future.”"
"The world’s oldest message in a bottle recently washed up on the North Sea island of Amrum, in Germany. It was one of 390 such bottles placed in the ocean by scientist George Bidder back in August 1906. During the 110-year voyage, the bottle had travelled just a few hundred miles – hardly a Robinson Crusoe-style call for rescue from a far corner of the globe. But nonetheless Bidder was on to something: such messages were and still are vital for scientists seeking to understand ocean circulation patterns. Bidder was an eminent marine biologist who worked across the globe, focused mainly on sponges. While at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, on England’s south-west coast, he became interested in understanding the movements of bottom-feeding animals and so perfected the “bottom trailer” bottle which sat just above the seabed, and was gently bounced along by the ocean’s deepest currents. The bottles were either picked up by trawlers or eventually found their way to the coast. They gave an indication of flow patterns and Bidder managed to prove a much-suspected theory that bottom feeders prefer to move against the current.
Oceanographers have used such methods for many years to study flow, both at surface and near sea-bed – and the return on these messages is surprisingly good. Scientists rely on the public discovering them (usually washed up on beaches) and reporting their final position. To encourage the observer to report the bottle Bidder promised the princely sum of one shilling – which the finder received from the MBA more than a century later.    Thousands of messages, containing everything from photos to wedding cake, are thrown to the sea to be taken on a voyage of adventure – and there is a certain romance in that. Many wash up a few hundred meters along the shore, others take a much longer journey.   I get phone calls most months about such discoveries. I once deployed 1,000 such messages myself in the English Channel to the south of the Isle of Wight. Around 400 were returned, providing invaluable information on the general flow of the region which can then be used to determine how pollutants would move in our coastal seas. However today our knowledge of oceans currents is advanced enough that random individual messages rarely tell us some new facts of the ocean – there are no mystery “supercurrents” waiting to be discovered.   Accidental spills can nonetheless still help ocean science. In 1992, a container of plastic bath toys broke free in the Pacific off the coast of Japan and 29,000 plastic ducks, turtles, beavers and frogs made a bid for freedom. Since then these “friendly floatees” have been studied by Curtis Ebbesmeyer, a retired oceanographer and beachcomber from Seattle. Their arrival at beaches around the Pacific and, more recently, the Atlantic coast of Canada have enabled scientists to understand more about the so-called Pacific garbage patch and how water flows through the narrow Bering Strait and eventually into the North Atlantic.   There was a flurry of interest as yellow plastic ducks started to appear on British and French beaches a few years ago – but when I inspected them more closely they turned out to be distant cousins of the Pacific contingent, probably escapees from a rubber duck race in some local river.  That said, given how long plastic lasts in the environment, there is every reason to expect the friendly floatees to eventually find their way to a beach near you, wherever you live. What these ducks show is that, in time, all the oceanic waters are connected and even the water found 6km down a Pacific trench will, over many hundreds of years, reach the coast of Scotland or Brazil. Scientists still deliberately use the message in a bottle technique these days, though they are more sophisticated now, and significantly more expensive.   Today there is a network of more than 3,800 “Argo floats”, which can adjust their buoyancy in order to travel at any depth of the ocean. Not only do they then go with the flow, they collect data on the temperature, salinity, oxygen and even phytoplankton levels of the oceans. To report their position and transmit data they pop up to the surface every five to ten days before returning to depth to continue their journey. With enough power for more than three years, these robotic messages in a bottle work hard to give us details that really do advance our understanding of the oceans and the changing climate. The Argo network is worldwide – buoys have been deployed by virtually every ocean science nation on the planet and, as with all oceanographic data, the information is open access, with a new app to add the Argo data to Google Earth.   So now we can all enjoy finding messages from the ocean from our computers without having to comb the beaches, though you would lose out on that healthy sea breeze – and, as an oceanographer, I would never want to miss that."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s online Spiegel magazine published a story on how German wind parks are responsible for killing “numerous bats” each and every year – and not only domestic bats, but also migrating birds that are passing through.
According to scientists of the Berlin-based Leibniz-Institute for Zoological and Wildlife Research  (IZW):
Also animals from northeast Europe are killed by the rotor blades when they migrate through Germany on their way to their wintering grounds in November.”
Spiegel writes that more than a quarter (28 percent) of the animals examined came from an area spanning from the Baltic region to Russia, Belarus to Poland and were on their way to Central and Southern Europe. Most of the victims were young and female, which will impact future populations, scientists warn.
Studies show that the number of bats and wildlife killed by German windparks annually could be in the 6-digit range.

"I look out the window to yet another day of smoke haze, dry wind and raised dust across the floodplain I call home. My mood oscillates between profound sadness and rage at the perpetual political obfuscation around the climate science that explains our obviously changing weather. My wife and I crop about 6,000 acres of grain and run a small cattle operation south-west of Goondiwindi. I have just finished harvesting a modest, but profitable winter crop and I am able to agist some of my stubble to a mate desperate for cattle feed.  Against the odds, we have managed to harvest grain, hay and straw and feed our small Droughtmaster stud herd for the year on about a quarter of our average annual rainfall. I am acutely aware that luck played as big a role in our fortune this year as our management. There are many better farmers than me who will not achieve the results we managed and some of them will not survive the year, financially or otherwise. I do not believe anyone owes me, or any individual farmer, a living. However, a prosperous agricultural sector is essential to underpin stable society. It is then a social imperative to ensure the agricultural sector is viable. The current drought discussion in Australia is important because it highlights the fundamental lack of economic and emotional resilience in the sector. This exposes the sector profoundly to disruptions in production by weather and disruptions in markets. This is a fundamental structural problem that will continue to weigh down the sector, stifling innovation and investment. If you listen to the rhetoric emanating from the Canberra bubble, it is apparent that the relevant ministers would prefer to glibly talk up the industry potential and hope it will magically fix itself when it finally rains. They consistently ignore the reasons why structural reform is essential and worse still undermine and discredit the evidence that demands it. This delusion is enthusiastically enabled by the National Farmers’ Federation desperately selling their “$100bn by 2030” plan, which is little more than a pipe dream without the aforementioned structural reform. I get it really, change is hard and denial is easy. The reality at the coalface of Australian agriculture is that the NFF plan and the political posturing is out of touch with reality and a dangerous distraction. The NFF and government’s drought strategy is akin to shuffling the deck chairs on the Titanic. Australian agriculture is now defined by indicators of rising farm debt, flatlining productivity, declining terms of trade and dwindling farmer numbers, suggesting it is not as rosy as the politicians and their sycophantic mates suggest, particularly if it is debt-funded. Overlay this scenario with what we know about the likely impacts of climate change, which is clearly exacerbating the impacts of the current drought, and the picture looks bleak indeed. While our politicians and industry leaders ignore the elephant in the room, it is encouraging and simultaneously worrying that our financiers are taking the issue seriously. The image below is taken from the 2019 Commonwealth Bank annual report. When leftwing nut jobs like the major banks start factoring in the impacts of failing to apply climate mitigation, then it is getting pretty serious. The message is clear for all who care to take note, if we do not start to develop and implement climate adaptation solutions that are backed by research and development, the agricultural sector in Australia will be unbankable. There are strategies and scenarios where Australian agriculture can prosper and provide leadership, opportunity and hope in the face of a changing climate. The travesty is that the institutions that should be pushing hardest for the necessary structural reform are too busy playing in the shallow end of the pool. On the current trajectory, the future for Australian agriculture will make the problems of this current drought look mild. Without courageous and honest leadership we will not achieve the outcomes that are needed. The NFF is promulgating policies that are fundamentally flawed because they are grounded in ideology before evidence, particularly in relation to climate. The proof of this is borne out when the NFF sees climate protesters as a greater threat to agriculture than climate change. Australian agriculture needs something like a National Farmers’ Federation, but the one we have is failing farming communities profoundly. There are some great people working in agricultural advocacy in this country, but conservative institutions are constraining the opportunity for a better future. While we wait for meaningful structural reform, we are forced to erode social, natural and financial capital and further undermine resilience in rural landscapes in the face of unmanageable weather events. • Pete Mailler is a grain and cattle farmer from northern New South Wales.

"Actor Leonardo DiCaprio recently took to social media to demand action to protect the endangered vaquita porpoise, a species native to the Gulf of California in Mexico that is on the verge of extinction. A week later, the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) joined the fray by releasing a document with ten policy suggestions that the Mexican government should implement to protect the mammal. The Mexican government has spent ten years and more than US$60m trying to clamp down on the illegal killing of vaquita, with no success. The message from critics is “double your efforts”.  Yet little is being done to reduce the reason the porpoises are killed in the first place. Vaquita are commonly caught up in the gillnets used to catch the Mexican totoaba fish, which is is highly prized as a culinary delicacy in countries such as China. Focusing attention and condemnation on the supply side of this illegal trade without addressing the demand is reminiscent of the War on Drugs that Mexico has also been fighting for a decade – and has about as much chance of succeeding in. Mexico has implemented several programmes to prevent the illegal killing of the vaquita – with tragic results. These have included a two-year ban on gillnets and the creation of a natural park in the Gulf of California. Despite these efforts, the population of the vaquita has diminished by more than 90% in the last six years and only around 30 specimens are left.  Following the recommendations of the WWF and others would mean more money and policies to fight the fisheries and illegal supply of vaquita. But the demand driving the killing is coming from countries such as China, where there is minimal regulation and a growing elite willing to pay as much as for US$20,000 for exotic seafood dishes. This situation is all too similar to the so-called War on Drugs. Since 2006, the Mexican Government has fought drug production, trafficking and organised crime mainly through a law and order enforcement approach. This has involved mobilising military forces inside the country, as well as intelligence, weaponry and monetary cooperation with the US via the Mérida Initiative. However, drug-related violence is rising yet again in Mexico. The costs are overwhelming both in social and economic terms. Over the last four years, crime related deaths have reached 44,000 and the violence costs the Mexican economy approximately 13% of its GDP. Despite the appalling outcome, the Mexican government cannot be accused of not investing and fighting. Over the last ten years, the country’s defence and security budget has more than doubled, with annual spend totalling more than US$7 billion. Exact figures for the War on Drugs are difficult to calculate but over the period 2006-2012 expenses on drug policies amounted to US$48 billion, with 97% of that  assigned to law and order related efforts. And yet the US government is insisting on more. Recently, the US Ambassador to Mexico said that the government should redouble its efforts – much like the WWF’s recommendations on the vaquita. Nevertheless, there is no indication that the US government is willing to continue bearing the same law enforcement approach, as their policy efforts are shifting towards public health, demand reduction, and regulating the consumption and production of soft drugs like marijuana, which is now legal in several states. South of the border, the number of dead is rising, violence is increasing and production is not diminishing. While in the north, many consumers are enjoying a joint or a line “peacefully”. The percentage of Americans using illegal drugs is increasing, reaching 9.4% – 24.6m people – in 2013. In particular, marijuana and amphetamine consumption has been increasing, which is significant because 40-80% of all marijuana consumed in the US comes from Mexico. And while cocaine use has been slightly decreasing, the US market remains worth around US$35 billion and is one of the main sources of revenue for Mexican drug cartels. Just like climate change and wildlife conservation, drugs and violence are a global challenge, where responsibilities must be shared and where the demand that drives consumption is the key to illegal trade. Globalisation has created interdependence between countries at many levels. But an enormous sea separates China from Mexico and therefore Chinese consumers have the luxury of ignoring the consequences of their actions. US consumers would not have that luxury since they share a border with Mexico and their actions would have social and humanitarian consequences. As an example, only 1% of the revenues related to cocaine reach farmers in developing countries, but illegal trade and increasing demand generates violence that affects local economies. While Mexico has the 15th largest economy in the world, the ingredients for a disaster are looming: rising poverty, corruption and violence. If this leads to social and economic breakdown, Mexicans will knock on the US’s door.  It can’t be denied that the Mexican government has a systemic problem when it comes to enforcing the rule of law. But it also needs to reevaluate the international recommendations and policies that it applies with broad consequences.  Shortly after Leonardo DiCaprio made his plea, President Peña quickly responded with a commitment that Mexico was already working hard. Unfortunately, it is not a simple matter of resources. If Mexico keeps following the same road, the same outcome will emerge: Mexico puts in the effort, gets the international blame and ultimately carries the corpses. This article was amended to clarify that the vaquita porpoise is killed as a bycatch of the totoaba fish."
"Britain’s railways can no longer cope with the effects of the climate crisis, a senior rail executive has warned. Extreme weather events including heatwaves, storms and flooding have damaged infrastructure and halted thousands of services across the UK this year. Alex Hynes, the managing director of Scotland’s railway, said more investment would be needed to future-proof the railway against rising temperatures. “The railway in this country can no longer cope because of climate change,” he said. Calling for more to be done on decarbonising rail, he told the Railway Industry Association conference in London: “We have a vested interest in making this work.” In July, hot weather forced trains to run at maximum speeds of 20mph (32km/h) on parts of the railway network, resulting in many services being cancelled and rail operators telling people not to travel. Trains were slowed due to the risk of tracks buckling in the heat and causing a derailment. Extreme temperatures can also result in overhead electric lines drooping and being damaged by trains. Hynes said the rail industry needed to build tracks resilient at 40C (104F) in the rest of the UK and 35C in Scotland. Steel in rails is currently stress-tested at 28C. More than 1,000 trains were cancelled in Scotland alone due to record temperatures in summer 2018. This was reduced to 200 in 2019 despite an even hotter summer, after a £4m investment in track resilience. Hynes suggested the rail industry should see the commercial opportunity in the climate emergency and tell passengers when they are taking a greener form of transport. “There is money to be made … We need to tell people they are on an electric train,” he said. However, Anthony Smith, the chief executive of Transport Focus, told the conference that according to the independent passenger watchdog’s research, most passengers would prefer an on-time diesel to a late-running electric train. Although railways have long been susceptible to weather-associated delays, from snow in winter to problems with wet leaves in autumn, Network Rail is expecting to invest billions more to mitigate the effects of more frequent and extreme events. Much of its most recent climate change adaptation plan was written in the aftermath of extensive flooding in 2015, including the closure of the Devon-Cornwall line after the track was washed away at Dawlish. Heavy rainfall and flooding remain the most significant problems in parts of the rail network, notably Wales. However, Network Rail data for 2018-19 showed total delays ascribed to high temperatures surpassed the combined total of flooding, snow, fog and cold even before the more widespread disruption in July."

Citizens, they feel, aren’t grown up enough to responsibly operate their own household applicances. They need to be nannied, the EU bureaucrats believe.
So out they come with the European Ecodesign Directive, which originally was intended to regulate electric appliances like flat screen televisions, dishwashers or lamps. But the power to intrude into people’s lives and tell them how to live was just too irresistible – Brussels bureaucrats wanted more. In 2009 the directive was expanded to include all appliances that “can impact natural resources.” All the intrusion and regulation are justified by the need to “protect our climate”.
Last October I wrote about how the EU was gearing up to restrict household vacuum cleaners. Next in line are coffee machines.
The Austrian daily Der Standard here reports that a new European eco-design directive will switch off coffee machines already after five minutes. The directive will go into effect on January 1, 2015. Commercial coffee makers will be exempted.
Already harsh criticism is mounting. Some German conservative politicians say that the EU “should focus more on really important issues.” Moreover, the German business association UV Nord criticizes the “regulation madness” of the EU.
But the EU commission defends the move, claiming that it does not regulate the coffee machines in general, but rather only their warming function.
Der Standard writes:
The manufacturers can decide whether they wish to allow the consumers to decide if they want to deactivate the automatic switch-off function of the hot-plate function.”

High-carb, low fat diet puts the pounds on and makes you sick. This “registered dietician” claims carbohydrates are the way to go! Unfortunately she has been woefully misinformed and the high-carb diet she is peddling isn’t even working for her. Photo cropped from FOX 32.
Even Time Magazine is coming around!
Bryan Walsh writes at leftie-veggie Time Magazine here is waking up to one of the greatest myths ever perpetuated onto mankind. No, I’m not talking about global warming from carbon (that’s the second biggest). I’m talking about the myth that heart disease is caused by fats from meat, eggs, butter, etc.
Walsh at Time writes:

Ending the War on Fat
For decades, it has been the most vilified nutrient in the American diet. But new science reveals fat isn’t what’s hurting our health.
[…] We were only doing what we were told. In 1977, the year before I was born, a Senate committee led by George McGovern published its landmark ‘Dietary Goals for the United States,’ urging Americans to eat less high-fat red meat, eggs and dairy and replace them with more calories from fruits, vegetables and especially carbohydrates.

The progressive, enlightened George McGovern – a Democrat.
And the rest is history. Today we are finding out it was all driven by junk science from greedy Big Food, and pharmaceutical companies who, as of today, have raked in hundreds of billions in revenues from medications for treating “high cholesterol”, diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiac diseases and many many others. They did this by promoting a diet that made us very sick. There are documents that prove they intentionally deceived the public. I wonder if they will ever be brought to justice for the health mayhem the inflicted onto the public.
I suspect that in about 30 or 40 years from now people will also wake up to the “consensus” driven myth of CO2 causing global warming, climate change and extreme weather. You could substitute the word “fat” in the above text with “CO2”, etc. and get a pretty accurate story.
Just as the junk science vilifying fat caused mayhem in human health, the junk science vilifying CO2 will cause mayhem with our economic health.
For me it is already clear. I switched to a high-fat, low-carb diet and lost 20 lbs over the last three months or so. I have more energy, no longer put up with cravings every 2 hours, and I’m off the blood pressure medicine.
Of course I’m still eating a good share of vegetables.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel reports here that Germany’s sole plant for producing electric car batteries, owned by Daimler, is shutting down thus casting doubt Germany will reach its ambitious target of putting 1 million electric cars on the road by 2020.
According to Wikipedia, as of September 2014 a total of 21,256 plug-in electric vehicles were registered in Germany. Most of the plug-in stock in Germany has been registered by corporate customers.
Spiegel reports:
The only German plant that produces battery cells for electric cars will be closed. The company Li-Tec in the German state of Saxony will produce batteries only for one more year. Daimler Manager Harald Kroger told Spiegel that the current production numbers make it far too expensive to produce the batteries.”
Daimler was banking on higher production numbers, which are necessary for producing economically. But the quantities never materialized. Kroger told Spiegel that the company realized that “an automaker does not have to produce the batteries itself.”
Another setback
Spiegel calls the move by Daimler “another setback for electro-mobility in Germany“, and represents the latest obstacle in preventing Germany from reaching its target of cutting CO2 emissions 40% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
One reason Germany is not rushing into electro-mobility, behind the scenes, is because the country’s power grid is woefully unprepared to handle the extra burden posed by 1 million electric cars because it is crippled by the unsteady feed-in of wind and solar power. Already there are profound fears that Germany’s power grid will be overloaded and collapse should a harsh winter materialize.
A look at the last 5 days of electric power production in Germany shows that wind and sun cannot deliver, especially three days ago on November 13.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany today likes to boast a total of 36,000 megawatts of installed photovoltaic capacity and over 30,000 MW capacity of wind power. Theoretically at noon on a sunny, windy day Germany could cover almost all of its electric power demand, which at noon on a workday is roughly 70,000 megwatts.
But anyone familiar with Germany’s climate knows the country’s weather is often gray and sees about as much sunshine as Alaska does. Germany has a fair amount of windy days, but periods of windless days are also frequent enough. They can’t be avoided and must be reckoned with. In a nutshell, solar and wind power production are often AWOL and so conventional power systems (coal, gas, nuclear) always need to be on standby, ready to deliver on a minute’s notice.
To illustrate, the following chart depicts German electric power production and consumption over the 6-day period 14-19 July: conventional power (gray), solar production (yellow), wind (dark blue), hydro (light blue) and biomass (green). German consumption is shown by the red line.

Readers immediately notice the huge fluctuations in solar and wind power outputs. At night there’s no sun and the wind appears only sporadically.

The data from the above chart show, for example, that at 9 p.m. on July 16 total wind power output was a mere 0.334 gigawatts and the day’s last rays of sunlight were delivering only 0.103 gigawatts of power. That means the two sources of wind and solar combined were putting out only [(0.334 + 0.103)/65]100 = 0.7% of their rated capacity. That in turn means the remaining 99.3% had to come in large part from the conventional coal, nuclear and gas power plants.
Germany’s installed wind/solar systems on average operate roughly at about 15% of their capacity.
Moreover the chart shows that wind energy output was close to zero for a period of three days (July 16 – 19). Little wonder that wind and solar have yet to replace a single conventional coal power plant in Germany. No matter how much installed solar/wind capacity the country has, it still has to rely on conventional power on windless nights, which are frequent enough.
The result is that the economics of wind/solar energy are just plain awful. To illustrate, imagine the costs involved in being forced to own two cars: an expensive one that runs on average only 1 random day a week, and a cheaper one that can run anytime. Whenever you want to drive, you are first required to drive the expensive/unreliable one. Only when it doesn’t start up are you allowed to drive the cheaper, always operable car. Obviously such a model of personal transportation (being forced to own, maintain, insure and repair two cars) would bankrupt most working-class households.
Today’s green wind/solar energy makes little economic sense.

"The board of French energy giant EDF has voted in favour of investing in a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, England. However, in a surprise move the UK government has delayed a final decision on the project, sparking new debate on what is the right step forward for energy in the UK. A recent report by the UK’s National Audit Office added to a long-running argument about how much new nuclear will cost in higher bills, higher subsidies or a mix of the two. The deal offered by the UK government had set a price for electricity from Hinkley of £92.50/MWh (in 2012 prices) which is index-linked and runs for 35 years from when the power station starts. That’s roughly double recent wholesale electricity prices. But what’s missing is a fresh discussion on what to do instead of large projects like Hinkley. This requires a challenge to the mindset that’s led the UK to paint itself into a corner. There’s long been a culture of big is better when the UK considers energy – find the next big gas field or build another big power station and the problem is sorted. Locally produced solar and wind energy is now more common. We have all seen how prices for panels and turbines have tumbled with forecasts that costs for solar and onshore wind will fall a further 41% and 60% by 2040 respectively. That’s great news but, as the much-missed David MacKay pointed out, the space for such distributed supplies will become an issue at some point. The big is better culture goes hand-in-hand with a focus on the supply side. Addressing Britain’s energy shortages traditionally meant finding new gas fields or building more power plants, but we’re now seeing a shift in investment to the consumption side with more focus on efficient cars, buildings or industrial processes. Across the world, 32% of energy sector investment in 2015 went on efficiency measures that reduce demand – up from just 17% the previous year. UK policy needs to reflect this shift. For the past eight years the government has had a standalone Department of Energy and Climate Change with a remit that often left transport, construction and industry in the control of other, larger departments. The new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy can aim for a balance between addressing both the supply and consumption of energy. Moving DECC to within the business department raises the interesting question of what role energy might play in any industrial strategy. EDF’s difficulty securing the investment for Hinkley is a reflection of the financial challenges faced by all of the major European power companies. In 2013, Gerard Mestrallet, the then CEO of GDF Suez (now renamed Engie) led a delegation of the major energy firms to the European parliament and said:  European energy companies are experiencing difficulties for which there is no precedent: the impairment of their European assets, the early closure of power plants, and a reduction in investments amongst other problems. The entire sector’s business situation is under severe pressure.   Results since then have merely illustrated those pressures with mounting losses and plans for companies like E.On and RWE to split themselves into “old” and new"" parts. The oil and gas industry faces similar challenges. Its return on capital peaked in 2008, nearly halved by 2013, and now has slumped with hydrocarbon prices that look to be “lower for longer”. The UK’s North Sea oil and gas industry’s net rate of return, a measure of profitability, hit an all-time low of 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015, well below the country’s manufacturing sector at 7.2% or the service sector at 22%. Returns in oil and gas measured this way used to vary between 20% and 60% and consistently outpaced the other sectors. The traditional investors in British energy look smaller and less able to take on very large scale projects than in the past. The evidence from Hinkley is that the UK government won’t invest up front in such projects. As EDF is 85% owned by the French government, the board’s decision will tell us something about the French state’s investment appetite. The UK needs to get over the idea that huge megaprojects are the solution to everything. Instead, it should think of a new mix between smaller and larger, be more joined up in considering consumption as well as supply and think more decentralised than central. That expands the industries, companies, institutions and government departments involved. That calls for an industrial strategy focused on energy."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany outlets are reporting on Greenpeace’s desecration and exploitation of ancient Incan and Nazca historical sites for political and fund-raising purposes. See here.
Photo: Craig Rucker questions Greenpeace spokesman. Photo cropped from C-Fact video.
Today the online Spiegel covers (instead of buries) the story: “Nazca Lines in Peru: Greenpeace apologizes for cultural contamination“. 
That apology of course comes only after a huge wave of negative publicity. When asked by C-Fact’s Craig Rucker at a press conference about what the activists had done, a Greenpeace spokesman seemed completely indifferent about having used the site for their stunt, and even thought that everyone just loved Greenpeace.
Well, I’ve been with them. I’ve been in the village and we were basically in the village for a day and everybody loved them, there was no problem.”
Indeed here it appears that the Greenpeace higher-ups were actually there at the site and aware of what the activists were doing. It seems as if the stunt even may have been orchestrated by the higher-ups. Will Greenpeace officials take responsibility for the actions of their activists members? Spiegel writes:
“On their homepage Greenpeace showed themselves as demonstratively proud about the stunt even still on Thursday morning. […]
However in the meantime Greenpeace no longer considers the spectacular action as a good idea.”

Note how Greenpeace officials quickly backpedalled once the massive backlash became undeniable. Greenpeace higher officials are (suddenly) acting as if they had nothing to do with it, and that it had been carried out solely by the activists on their own.
It’s a pity that Greenpeace officials always distance themselves from the actions of their activists whenever they go awry, but are always quick to collect the cash donations that flow in afterwards when the actions succeed. Spiegel adds:
Also the head of the Greenpeace delegation at the climate conference, Martin Kaiser, said he expects that the activists to always take the responsibility for their actions.”
Unbelievable. What about Greenpeace officials taking responsibility for once?
Greenpeace chief Kumi Naidoo will personally fly into Lima by jet and apologize. But that may be too little, too late. Spiegel writes:
Peru’s Deputy Cultural Minister Luis Jaime Castillo is requesting the state attorney to file charges for ‘the attack on archeological monuments’, a crime that is punishable by as much as six years in prison.”
Of course European governments and other organizations will express disgust at the Greenpeace activists’ action for awhile, but behind the scenes they’ll be working out a deal with the Peruvian government to get them off…probably in exchange for cash and support.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRenowned Swedish paleogeophysicist Prof. Nils-Axel Mörner also has sent his comment to NoTricksZone concerning the termination of the fellowship of Caleb S. Rossiter and the state of climate science.
His comment is also followed by a joint statement sent by German climate scientists Prof Dr. Gerhard Gerlich and Dr. Ralf D. Tscheuschner.
Nils-Axel Mörner:
Ass. Professor, Paleogeophysics & Geodynamics
Sea Level, Paleoclimate, Sun-Earth Interaction
The story of ‘a twinkling blanket of bulbs’ is touching (the words by Rossiter in WSJ). Of course, South Africa should have its new coal-fired power plant. The global hysteria about CO2-emissions is a terrible instrument in neo-colonialism, and has set up such remarkable personal behaviours of inquisition and book-burning.
The issue is surely not founded in science. More remarkable is that it has swept across the world. However its days are doomed, and with the accumulation of new facts and records, it will wither away – but until that day of science liberation arrives, we will continue to face much destruction, inquisition and misconceptions.”
Prof. Dr. Gerhard Gerlich / Dr. Ralf D. Tscheuschner:
The days of this CO2 malarkey are coming to an end – sooner or later. Therefore, Professor Rossiter’s fellowship at the Institute for Policy Studies should be reactivated since he got the point. We have emphasized that there are no atmospheric CO2 greenhouse effects in physics, and climate models are not based on physics. The anti-CO2 campaigners never presented measurements, which show that an atmospheric gas volume warms up in response to a concentration increase of the trace gas CO2. And never it was proven that so-called “fossil fuels” are fossil. The earth ball is a huge repository of resources wrapped into a thin film of mankind. So what? An enlightened, up-powered and industrialized Africa will be a source of our future inspirations and creativity.  IPCC, Al Gore, and their buddies should turn off their light bulbs sustainably. This would solve most of these (pseudo-)problems of our time immediately.”

"Authorities are warning New South Wales residents not to underestimate the damaging effects of smoke as air quality worsens amid the state’s bushfire crisis. About 80 fires are burning across NSW, filling Sydney’s skies with smoke pollution of “hazardous” proportions, according to the environment department. The latest air quality index rating has recorded 221 micrograms of particulates per cubic metre in Sydney’s east, while the lower Hunter’s figure of 306 was the worst in the state. Dust has also contributed to poor air quality in Sydney, Newcastle and the central coast ahead of a southern change expected to hit on Tuesday evening, the Bureau of Meteorology said. The NSW Ambulance commissioner, Dominic Morgan, said the smoke was causing “slightly above-average demand” on services, with almost 100 asthma or breathing-related calls since Tuesday morning. Of those, 39 were from the Sydney area and another 35 were from the north of the state where the majority of fires are burning. In one case paramedics treated a patient who no longer had their reliever medication. Morgan urged asthmatics and others vulnerable to respiratory issues to remain vigilant, or the consequences could be fatal. “To fail to make a plan when you have an asthma condition or respiratory condition and not have reliever medication, this could be a deadly condition for you,” he said. “So make a plan and get medical aid as soon as possible.” The Australian National University population and climate health expert Liz Hanna said everybody should be wary of the smoke’s irritating effects. “Never underestimate how these things can sneak up on you and how damaging they can be, even if you think you’re fit and well,” Hanna said. “Smoke can amplify pre-existing conditions but also trigger responses in people that don’t know that they’re subclinical. “They can have quite a dramatic response and this could be their first time. “That’s when it’s really quite dangerous because they don’t know they’re vulnerable and they tend to not have the medication by their side.” Inhaled heat can also burn people’s throat and lungs, Hanna said. “There’s a wicked tendency for people to get out there in their thongs and shorts,” she said. “That offers zero protection to the radiant heat of a fire. “They should wear thick cotton fabric rather than some of the artificial fabrics that can actually melt and burn the skin.” Hanna echoed the advice of authorities for people to remain indoors and avoid outdoor activity, noting long-term exposure to pollution can lead to problems later in life. “You can have scarring in which case your long-term respiratory function is diminished,” she said. “All this stuff can sensitise [people] and give them lifelong problems with breathing and greater susceptibility to colds and coughs and shortness of breath when confronted with other problems.” Across NSW more than 575 schools were closed on Tuesday after the state premier, Gladys Berejiklian, declared a week-long state of emergency in the wake of devastating fires on the NSW mid-north coast in which three people died and at least 150 homes were destroyed."

"The Turkish military’s attempted coup to topple president Recep Tayyip Erdogan didn’t last long. The government restored control the following day and soon declared a three-month state of emergency, with more than 60,000 people since arrested or placed under investigation. This isn’t just Turkey’s problem. The country’s pivotal position in the transport of oil and gas gives it huge geopolitical significance. Straddling Europe and the Middle East and providing export routes from Central Asia to the rest of the world, Turkey is an important and growing energy transit hub.  Shipping in the Bosphorus straits between the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea was halted in the immediate aftermath of the attempted coup because of security concerns, though it was soon reopened. Although oil and gas flows were broadly unaffected by the coup, the prospect of prolonged instability raises the spectre of disruption to their transit. Two major oil pipelines pass through Turkey to the Ceyhan terminal on its Mediterranean coastline. One begins in Baku, the capital of oil-rich Azerbaijan, before passing through Georgia. The other delivers oil from Kirkuk in northern Iraq and has been affected by fighting with Islamic State and Kurdish insurgents, and disputes between Baghdad and the Kurdish government. When fully operational the two piplines have a combined capacity of 2.7m barrels per day, which is more than three times greater than the UK’s daily production. The country’s location at the mouth of the Black Sea means it plays an equally key role in the seaborne oil trade. Around 3% of the world’s oil and petroleum products pass through the Bosphorus from Russia, Ukraine and central Asia.  Turkey is also an important transit state for the EU’s natural gas imports. The Blue Stream pipeline, which runs underneath the Black Sea from Russia, carried 14.7 billion m³ of gas in 2013 – equivalent to 9% of the total Russian gas supplies to Europe that year. Blue Stream was built in the early 2000s in response to growing disruption of gas flows through Ukraine and Belarus. The recent conflict in Ukraine highlights how Turkey’s importance has grown in recent years. Further into the future, the planned Southern Gas Corridor development would see gas from fields in Azerbaijan flowing through Turkey to the EU by 2018, while the planned Turkish Stream pipeline across the Black Sea would also circumvent Ukraine. Turkey’s key location for energy supplies and regional affairs means the EU has always considered it a strategic partner. The country’s accession process for membership started back in 2005. And this same strategic importance may be useful even today – some have suggested Europe’s timid response to Erdogan and his crackdown after the attempted coup is because of Turkey’s crucial role in supplying the EU with energy. Although European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said Turkey was “not in a position to become a member” following the coup, the ongoing migrant crisis and concerns over energy supplies mean it will be difficult for the EU to take too strict a position. As the EU seeks to become less dependent on Russian gas it will need to develop supplies from Central Asia through Turkey’s Southern Corridor, while also increasing its supply from global Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) markets. At the same time, Russia will continue to reroute its gas exports away from Ukraine, instead increasing flows through Turkey and through the expanded Nordstream pipeline in Germany. It is therefore highly unlikely that the strategic nature of EU-Turkey relations will change in the foreseeable future, even if Erdogan’s government places further restrictions on society. But, given further civil unrest or terrorism could increase political instability and threaten Turkey’s energy sector, Europe is right to be worried."
"Opponents of the Iraq war often highlight the importance of oil when explaining why the invasion took place. While leaders at the time denied it was a motivation there is no doubt the country’s huge oilfields did offer possible post-conflict opportunities for the Iraqi industry and international corporations.  However what is missing from the post-Chilcot Report discussions and debates is a sense of what Iraqi oil sector is actually like today. So, even if the war really was “all about oil” … did it succeed on those terms? For Iraqis dealing with the aftermath of invasion, the development of its oil and gas sector after 2003 is analogous to the nation as a whole: the vaulting ambition of the American occupation; the dysfunctional institutions they bequeathed; and Iraq’s internal rivalries that may lead to its partition. Oil is central to Iraq’s present and future. It accounts for 99% of all government revenue. Along with existing reserves of 143 billion barrels (5th in the world) it is estimated there are 50 to 200 billion barrels yet to be discovered making it the largest unexplored market in the world.     For decades before the invasion, the industry had been in the hands of the state-owned Iraq National Oil Company. “Arab oil for the Arabs” was one of the most popular slogans of the Baathist era (1968-2003), and nationalisation in 1972 was the enactment of a policy that had first been demanded in the 1950s.  But if American post-war planners were aware of this history they appeared to ignore it. Away from Iraq, they planned to open up the nationalised oil industry to international investors and owners, and to the benefits of liberalisation.  By 2003, the Iraqi oil industry was in desperate need of renovation and modernisation. A combination of war and sanctions had shielded it from many of the advances that the industry had made elsewhere in the previous quarter of a century. New techniques in seismic surveying and drilling technologies held the potential to transform current and future production. Iraq could have become a beacon of oil industry privatisation.  However, while external knowledge and investment may have been useful, there was no appetite among Iraqi politicians or people for privatisation. The occupation was also in no position to push through any reform that could unite nearly all the country’s political forces in opposition. In the end, the US-led administration announced in September 2003 that foreign investment was acceptable for the rest of the economy but not for the oil sector. The occupiers never actually resolved how the Iraqi oil sector would be rebuilt and its wealth distributed. Prior to 2003 all oil profits had gone to Baghdad, providing a succession of authoritarian leaders with the means to maintain their rule (Saddam Hussein being the final and most brutal example). Oil was most plentiful in the supergiant fields of Rumaila, near Basra in the Shia-dominated south, and near Kirkuk in the north-east. Yet neither city received the full rewards of their oil as the Shia and Kurdish communities were marginalised in the era of Saddam.  An equitable distribution of oil wealth was therefore key to resolving conflict in Iraq and avoiding the emergence of another Saddam. Everyone knew this. However despite this ambition the governments that have followed the US-led occupation have proved themselves incapable of reaching a fair settlement.   The Iraqi Constitution, agreed in 2005, suggests oil is owned by all Iraqis but does not specify how its wealth would be shared. In an attempt to decide how money will be distributed, a National Hydrocarbon Law was drawn up back in 2007. However various drafts continue to fail to resolve disputes among oil and non-oil producing regions and the law still awaiting parliamentary approval nine years later.  In the middle of all of this the oil industry continues functioning in a complex framework of varying interpretations of the constitution and laws dating back to before 2003. Production has increased as international companies have entered to exploit the established oil fields around Basra and Kirkuk through a series of licensing agreements.  But the legal problems persists, foreign oil firms still employ few Iraqis, and local communities see no benefit from the international presence. The international companies persist using foreign workers and security companies to maintain their production.  Oil is a target for ISIS as a resource to be captured for its nascent state or an industry to be disrupted in the territories it does not control. Oil facilities in Baiji were a site of fierce fighting between government and ISIS forces in 2014 and 2015, and oil pipelines are frequently attacked. Although the sector functions, the chaos surrounding the oil industry mirrors the confused outcomes of the invasion. A different approach was followed in the north of Iraq where the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) divided up its territory into blocks for exploration, inviting international companies in on production sharing contracts. When discoveries were made, major companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron got involved.  The difficulty the KRG faced was that, although oil had been discovered, the lack of an Iraq-wide agreement meant it was unclear how it could be monetised. Baghdad and the KRG have had endless disputes over ownership and budget allocation. The greater the dispute between the two, the more the KRG has pulled away, signing energy deals with the Turkish government and selling its oil on the international market. Getting oil out of Kurdistan was initially a problem, but in 2014 a new pipeline joined KRG oil fields to Turkey. For the leadership of Kurdistan, oil is a key political and economic asset, potentially leading to an independent future, although the recent global fall in the price of oil has called into question if this is financially viable.  The development of oil in Iraq after 2003 is much like the development of the new state. The oil industry is a mix of state ownership and international interests, while the legal framework they work in highlights the continued failure to resolve divisive issues. Kurdistan demonstrates the very real potential of the country dividing.  Divergent interests are joined together by oil but there are few political leaders who can articulate a unifying narrative. This is then played out within a dysfunctional political system left behind by a hasty and ill-conceived occupation, further complicated by the later emergence of ISIS. The invasion of Iraq in 2003 may not have been all about oil, but a settlement on oil is required if the post-invasion conflict is to be resolved."
"An unheralded metal could become a crucial part of the renewables revolution. Vanadium is used in new batteries which can store large amounts of energy almost indefinitely, perfect for remote wind or solar farms. And what’s more there is loads of the stuff simply lying around in industrial dumps. Don’t let the dumpster diving put you off – never mind gold or silver, vanadium may just be the most beautiful metal of all. It’s the 22nd most abundant element in the Earth’s crust, though it’s rarely found naturally in its metallic form. Instead, vanadium can be found in more than 100 different minerals.  Once extracted and dissolved in water, various forms of vanadium turn into bright, bold colours. It’s even named after “Vanadis”, the old Norse name for the Scandinavian goddess of beauty, Freyja.  Vanadium is not only beautiful, but also strong. Adding small percentages of it creates exceptionally light, tough and more resilient steel alloys. Henry Ford was the first to use it on an industrial scale, in the 1908 Model T car chassis, and today the vast majority of vanadium is used in structural steel, mainly to build bridges and buildings. The unique properties of vanadium make it ideal for a new type of batteries that may revolutionise energy systems in the near future – redox flow batteries. Batteries store energy and generate electricity by a reaction between two different materials – typically solid zinc and manganese. In flow batteries, these materials are liquid and have different electric charges. Both are pumped into a “cell” where the electric current is generated. A tiny membrane separates the two liquids, so they are able to react but don’t come into direct contact. Vanadium is used in these batteries as it can convert back and forth from its various different states, which can carry different positive charges. As only one material is used, the risk of cross contamination is eliminated. The liquids have an indefinite life, so the replacement costs are low and there are no waste disposal problems. Also, the battery is extended to a potentially infinite lifetime.    In flow batteries, the energy production and capacity are independent. Energy is stored in tanks, whereas the capacity depends only on the amount of liquid stored. This provides a great design flexibility that other batteries do not allow. They are also safer, as the two liquids don’t mix causing a sudden release of energy. Even President Obama is impressed. Vanadium flow batteries are too big and heavy to replace the lithium batteries found in your phone, however. These batteries are instead used for large stationary long-term energy storage, or to supply remote areas, or provide backup power. They’re the basis for a more efficient, reliable, and cleaner electrical energy market. Energy storage is one of the main factors limiting the spread of renewables. When solar and wind power is produced at the wrong time of day we need to store it to use it during the evening demand peaks. Studies have shown that vanadium batteries can be a sustainable solution. When we can create huge stores of energy to access as required, we will be liberated from the need to maintain rapidly-accessible energy generation such as coal or gas. Vanadium batteries can be a reservoir of energy much in the same way as we use actual reservoirs to store rainwater for later use. The ability to store electricity would reduce reliance on gas and coal. In turn this would increase fuel security and cut CO2 emissions, helping to meet agreed emissions targets. No wonder then that the EU considers vanadium a critical metal for strategic energy technologies.  The metal is mined, and supplies are currently dominated by China, South Africa, Russia and the US. Vanadium has a medium risk of supply shortage and a high political risk.  However, as vanadium can be a byproduct of other sorts of mining, about 70% of the vanadium above ground is unused, left in industrial wastes such as mine tailings, debris or steel slags. In fact, a study I published with colleagues last year estimated that 43% of the annual global production of vanadium could be recovered from alkaline wastes, such as steel slag, red mud, fly ashes from coal energy production, and construction and demolition waste. But there isn’t yet a firmly established technology to recover this vanadium. Certain bacteria and fungi can extract more vanadium from industrial wastes, and various solutions for turning this into useful metal are under development. But we still need to come up with a better way to reach potential sources of this beautiful metal."

"There is a fearful irony to recent news of flooding at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway. This was supposed to be humanity’s most impregnable bulwark against famine, but it is now endangered by global warming, one of the very threats that it was supposed to protect us from. It is estimated that we have to increase food production by 70% by 2050, and achieve this despite changing weather patterns and the spread of new crop diseases due to global warming. The high-yielding crop varieties which we currently depend on were tailored to produce as much grain as possible under ideal conditions, not for resilience if conditions are less good, such as during flooding or drought. In nature, species adapt to changing conditions by natural selection acting upon differences between individual organisms. Crop breeders also need variation to work with and this was how the wheat and rice lines of the Green Revolution (which tripled food production in the developing world) were produced, bringing together disease resistance from some varieties, shorter, stronger stems from others and so on. We now need to produce a new generation of crops suited to a changing world. Seed banks and other stores of plant diversity are crucial for preserving the range of characteristics that we will need for this challenge. This contribution of diversity to food security is illustrated by farmers in China, who have often grown traditional types of rice and maize alongside modern high-yield crops as insurance against poor growing conditions. In some years, the traditional varieties have survived droughts that wiped out the modern plants. These farmers’ seeds have now been used in a cross-breeding programme that has produced six new maize lines combining the best properties from more than 200 traditional and newer varieties. In other cases, a traditional type of rice from Orissa in India was crossed with modern high-yield rice varieties enabling them to survive flooding that would previously have destroyed the crop. A gene for resistance to late blight, the fungal infection responsible for the Great Famine in Ireland, has been found in a wild potato from the grasslands of Argentina and used to make commercial Desiree potatoes resistant to infection. Wild and traditional crop varieties can even guide the most cutting-edge techniques for crop improvement. The gene editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 is being used to make tomatoes with branching patterns that produce more fruit by taking advantage of a gene from one of its wild relations. There are about 1,700 seed banks worldwide collecting and protecting this diversity, ranging from small repositories of seeds run by local communities to larger facilities such as the network of stations run by the Russian Vavilov Institute, and Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank in Sussex, which currently contains ten times more samples than the Svalbard vault. However, two seed banks in Afghanistan were looted for the plastic containers in which the seeds were kept, one of the Vavilov Institute facilities has suffered flooding, and another bank in the Philippines was destroyed by typhoon Xangsane. Because seed banks are being lost to these types of threat – not to mention more mundane reasons such as loss of funding – the Svalbard Seed Vault was established as a global repository and international resource for crop breeders. It has already proved useful. The original International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) seed bank in Syria has been cut off by conflict since 2012. It contained many crop varieties bred for arid areas and their wild relatives from the areas where agriculture began in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Fortunately, these stocks were “backed up” at Svalbard and ICARDA was able to withdraw seed to establish a replacement seed bank in Lebanon, the first such withdrawal. Seeds are a good way to store plant collections because under the right conditions they can remain in “suspended animation” for very long periods. The oldest germinated seed, from a campion flower, was buried in the Siberian tundra more than 30,000 years ago. The previous record holder was a 2,000-year-old date palm seed found at the ancient Jewish fortress of Masada. These illustrate how cold and dryness help preserve seeds. Larger seed banks follow UN Food and Agriculture Organisation guidelines specifying low temperatures and humidities for seed storage. The Global Seed Vault was located at Svalbard because natural conditions there are cold and dry. The Svalbard vault does use refrigeration to maintain a temperature of -18°C but it was thought that deep within the mountains of Spitzbergen and surrounded by permafrost, seeds stored there would remain frozen even without power. Even if civilisation collapsed.  Thankfully, no seeds were lost because of the flooding at the Svalbard vault and there are other well protected stores – Kew’s Millennium Bank is located inside a nuclear bunker. The Svalbard entrance that was flooded will now be waterproofed, but any water would have had to flow uphill to reach the storage areas, which were in any case well below 0°C which means the water would have frozen first. Even then, the seeds are protected by foil packages to maintain low humidity, but this is still concerning. Global warming is affecting the poles more than the rest of the world. The temperature ten metres below ground at Svalbard has increased by more than 2°C since 1998 and continues to rise. It had not been thought that the flooded section needed to be waterproof. Despite global warming, Svalbard will still be a good place to store seed and one of the best places for it to survive a Doomsday scenario in which power for refrigeration is lost. However, in the face of climate change, it may not be as secure as we had hoped."
"The beguiling behaviour of marine mammals in their natural environment is fascinating to us human observers. Watching dolphins leap gracefully through the surf, or whales making waves with their massive tale flukes is the stuff of countless bucket lists and high definition wildlife documentaries. Perhaps part of the appeal lies in marine mammals behaving a lot like we do. They share many of our biological characteristics, such as bearing live young, suckling them with rich fatty milk and investing time and energy into rearing them into adulthood.  Studying their behaviour, what makes them tick as complex social creatures, is essential for their conservation in an aquatic environment which remains almost entirely alien to us. And while it may be alien, it is an environment with a massive human footprint.  For unfortunately mammalian attributes are not all we share with our oceanic cousins. There is arguably now no marine habitat that remains unaffected by human activities. Prey depletion caused by humans, noise, temperature changes, chemical pollution and entanglements in fishing gear have all changed the place in which marine mammals evolved.  Our research shows that this simple reality makes the need to understand their behaviour and social structures all the more urgent, a call which is being echoed by the charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation.  In recent decades there has been a strong emphasis in conservation circles on understanding the population size and distribution of marine mammals, as well as their genetic diversity.  Conservation is principally obsessed with conserving genetic diversity, which is exactly as it should be, as diverse gene pools help ensure resilience against environmental change. But genes may not be the whole story. Marine mammal behaviour, just like ours, is partially determined by genes and the environment in which they live. However there are also social factors at play, and what makes marine mammals behave the way they do is potentially as complex as the processes which drive human behaviour.  In some cases, nurture may play just as important a role as nature for marine mammals. Almost 20 years ago, renowned conservation biologist Bill Sutherland examined how the behaviour of different species could be used to improve conservation efforts. He concluded that behavioural ecology needed to be better integrated into conservation science and policy making. But to what extent has this message from 1998 been taken on board?  Marine mammals exhibit a wide range of fascinating behaviours, from the complex cooperative bubble-net feeding of humpback whales, to ice-cave building polar bears and tool-using sea otters. They also have a great diversity in their social structures and changing social dynamics, which range between the complex third-order alliances of bottlenose dolphins, close relationships between non-related males, to the more solitary lives of beaked whales.  As well as having innate behaviours, which they acquire through their genes, these species, like humans, can learn individually and from each other. Social learning may be of particular importance to conservation efforts, because it can influence the resilience of a population to changes in their environment.  Killer whales learn foraging strategies from their social group and tend to stick to them. As a result, if there is a decline in their preferred prey, they may be less likely to switch to other species, or use alternative foraging tactics. Such a behaviourally conservative species is likely to be more vulnerable to change. But learning is only part of marine mammal social dynamics. Social structure, and the various roles played by individuals may also be important for how a population responds to change. The loss of individuals that hold key information on the location of critical habitat or a food source may have significant consequences. Humans live in many different types of cultures, environments and circumstances. We make important choices about what to eat, who to socialise with, where to live and how many offspring to have. These factors can strongly influence our fertility rates, survival, and even our evolution. It is certainly plausible that many of these factors influence the success of marine mammals as well. A better understanding of the behavioural ecology of marine mammals is therefore hugely important. It is difficult to envision an approach toward conserving a population of modern humans which merely preserved their genetic integrity and did not also consider their socially learnt behaviour.  While there are some attempts to incorporate behaviour, efforts to conserve marine mammal biodiversity still focus strongly on maintaining genetic integrity and diversity. But the emerging evidence indicates that social and behavioural diversity may also be central to individual, group, and population viability. The challenge ahead is teasing out the most relevant factors and understanding how to incorporate this new knowledge into conservation efforts. On the whole, policy makers have been slow to keep up with the emerging behavioural research. More alarming still, from the perspective of the marine mammals themselves, is that the degradation of their environment has continued apace."

Just before the 3-minute mark he comments on the general nonsense behind the claims that global warming causes more cold weather and on how John Holdren, senior advisor to President Barack Obama on science and technology, “was mouthing off on how global warming was causing it to get so cold back in January”.
At the 3:08 mark Joe reiterates his long term forecast for global temperatures:
“I do think the planet is going to be cooling the next 20 to 30 years due to natural processes. But some of these explanations border on inane”

He then reminds viewers that those blaming the cold on warming “obviously do not make forecasts for a living“.
Trapped heat constantly AWOL
And already we see that the earth’s temperature has not risen in almost 18 years. This year’s once forecast “super El Nino” is failing to materialize, which raises the question as to where all “the missing heat” could possibly be lurking.
It’s turning out that the missing heat is wholly theoretical and exists only in climate models, and is nowhere to be observed in reality.
Predictions of it reappearing have failed over and over again.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBritain has the UKIP party; Germany has got the Alternativ für Deutschland (AfD) party, translated: Alternative for Germany. Both are equally hated by the establishment. The media do all they can to portray them as dangerous, right-wing, beer-hall populists.
In a nutshell: they are a threat to the cozy establishment.
Last September the AfD party barely missed reaching the 5% hurdle in Germany’s national elections, and thus just missed taking seats in Parliament. Some claim the results were tampered with in order to keep the enfant terrible party out. No matter the result, the party did send a clear message, and it continues to send such messages today.
In it’s latest press release, the AfD announces its position on Germany’s renewable energy feed-in act, calling for its abolishment.
The energy summit last Tuesday at the federal Chancellor’s Office missed its targets. The planned, low-impact slowdown in the expansion of wind and solar was softened considerably using tricks. The rise in the renewable energy feed-in act (EEG) subsidies will continue to gallop on ahead unhindered, so concluded even a proponent of the transition to renewable energies, Holger Krahwinkel, of the consumer associations. Share prices of wind energy plant builder Nordex at times shot up by 7%.
‘The EEG charges is driving the electricity costs dramatically upwards,’ explains Dr. Alexander Gauland, spokesman for the Alternative für Deutschland. ‘Already they are among the highest in Europe. Since the start of the EEG act, the payments made by power grid operators to the owners of renewable energy plants have totaled to be more than 120 billion euros – paid by the consumers. Just in 2013 the figure was 23 billion euros – the tendency is strongly upwards.’
Gauland summarizes: ‘That’s why every ‘correction’ or ‘reform’ amounts only to a senseless doctoring of the symptoms. The cost burden on the German consumer is already very immense and is no longer bearable for more than 600,000 households. At the same time more industrial jobs are moving to cheaper foreign countries. That number is already tens of thousands, and also here the trend is strongly upwards. This is why the AfD is requesting the immediate abolishment of the EEG act. It has made this request an official position in its European election program.“

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo days I ago reported on German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel’s calling the swift end to coal power plants in Germany an “illusion”.
Germany’s flagship daily Die Welt here has since posted a large part of Gabriel’s speech, where two Greenpeace activists attempted to steal the show from Gabriel on stage. When it was over, the Greenpeace activists ended up being schooled and looking awfully humiliated.
Moreover, Gabriel sent clear signals that the brakes Germany’s “ruinous” rush to green energies were on and that coal power wasn’t going anywhere, anytime soon.
DIE WELT writes:
They appeared with “naïve eco-populism” and the “illusions of the energy transformation propaganda“. Without the need for security, Gabriel rhetorically swept the Greenpeace protesters off stage.”
Driving away “complete value-adding chains”
Before a packed audience of power industry representatives, Gabriel told the Greenpeace activists:
With your energy policy, you are not only driving out the raw material industry, but also complete value adding chains out of the country. You can’t stop both nuclear and coal power at the same time – in any case not if you want to somehow survive economically.”
Gabriel, who is also head of Germany’s SPD socialist party and has strong ties to trade unions, also told the GP protesters:
Afterwards I’ll be at the Estrel-Hotel to meet with the Union Councils of Vattenfall, who are fighting to keep their jobs in brown coal. My suggestion is: See if you dare to show up over there.”
Germany’s energy policy has lost its marbles

Gabriel then calmly dismantled the activists, characterizing their demands as foreign-to-reality and green narrow-minded propaganda.
Gabriel reminded the activists that Germany is already spending 23 billion euros annually on renewable energies and that other countries think the country “has lost its marbles”: at the 7:50 mark Gabriel says that his colleagues in Poland think “we are mad as a hatter“.
Actually they are convinced that the Germans have lost their marbles. What they tell us in the international climate debate is that if you want to go ahead and ruin your industry, then be my guest. But please don’t force us to do the same through the European Union. That’s the perception internationally.”
Gabriel reminded the audience that German industry has to remain strong if it ever wishes to achieve an energy transition over the long term, and that no one will follow Germany’s example should its industry be led into ruins. Gabriel cites German companies moving to other countries where energy is much cheaper.
He also says that the transition to renewable energy in Germany so far has been unsystematic, disorganized, and sloppily planned. Poland, he says, expected something different from the Germans. Gabriel added that the Austrians are laughing because Germany is forced to buy up oil-generated electricty, and they don’t see how this is reducing CO2 emissions.
Phony CO2 reductions
At the 12:40 mark, Gabriel asks what would shutting down all German coal power plants lead to? It would not lead to one single tonne of CO2 being saved because the coal power generation would simply be shifted elsewhere, Merkel’s Vice Chancellor said. He calls Greenpeace’s vision of an immediate shut-down of the country’s coal power plants “phony reductions”. Gabriel called on everyone to “stop mystifying everything and to stop the illusions“.
CO2 reductions can be achieved, Gabriel stated, but have to be done in a way that does not threaten jobs and economic stability:
With the mystification of the green energy transition you have contributed to the underestimation of the challenges.”
At the end Gabriel again requested the activists to “stop simplifying everything … if we continue on this course, where we keeping pushing illusions and in the end wind up with high electricity rates, that is the only way of getting the energy transformation to fail.”

"Note: this article is spoiler-free. The epic television series Game of Thrones makes compelling viewing for many reasons. Exotic locations and cutting edge visual effects have spectacularly translated George R R Martin’s vision onto the small screen. These production values have made the series one of the most expensive ever made and allowed the attention to detail required to build an immersive world of humans, dragons, the old gods and the new.  But as fantastic as this conjured world is, recent research seems to prove the old adage that fact can indeed be stranger than fiction. Because while the lands of Westeros and beyond experience dramatic shifts in weather and seasons, changes in climate here on Earth are even weirder.  Other than constant politicking and backstabbing (not to mention front stabbing, decapitation, and immolation) there are few constants in Game of Thrones. Long running shows typically assure us that our favourite characters will carry on and that their lives will span seasons. But anyone who has been keeping up with the Starks and Lannisters will be well aware by now that playing a central role provides no guarantee of longevity. Remember the Red Wedding? But throughout this maelstrom there is an ever present factor. A brooding menace that belittles all the squabbles and fighting.  The threat of winter’s return. “Oh, my sweet summer child,” Old Nan said quietly, “what do you know of fear? Fear is for the winter, my little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north.” Winter in Westeros is a serious business. The larger towns and citadels survive with stockpiles of food and firewood. Small communities either flee or perish. What makes winters so harsh is that they can last for many years. The opening book of A Song of Ice and Fire – A Game of Thrones from which the television series takes its name – opens with concerns that the winter is due to return after nine years of summer. Such a long summer heralds an equally long winter.  Why the change of seasons is so unpredictable is subject of speculation in the real world and in the books. Some claim it was a consequence of a battle some 8,000 years ago. The scholars, healers, and learned men – the Maesters – discount this as a fable with no supporting evidence. How could humans alter the seasons? What’s intriguing is that this Game of Thrones myth may have some basis in reality. Because something happened here on Earth about 8,000 to 12,000 years ago that could have profoundly affected the Earth’s climate and the history of all civilisations. Glaciations, or ice ages, have been a regular occurrence on Earth for the past 2.6m years, the geological period known as the Quaternary. Due to a combination of orbital mechanics, tectonic processes, and ocean currents, the Earth’s climate periodically is thrown into a reinforcing feedback loop that plunges temperatures lower and lower. The polar ice caps and glaciers expand while sea levels fall as much as 120 metres.   Periods between ice ages – interglacials – have lasted around 10,000 years in Earth’s recent geological history. Given that it’s been more than 12,000 years since the last glacial maximum, one may conclude that a new ice age is overdue. However, that may not be the case. We may have stopped it.  Humans began farming almost as soon as the last ice age ended. Although the numbers of humans were small, land use change such as burning fields and forests would have released carbon dioxide into the Earth’s atmosphere, which along with methane from the increased number of cattle, could have been sufficient to effectively put the next ice age on hold, so delicate was the balance between the two climate states. It’s worth pointing out that the difference in global temperatures between our current climate and the depths of the previous glacial maximum is about 5℃. Consider how different a world that is 5℃ warmer than today would be.  A study published in the journal Nature at the start of 2016 contained the even more remarkable conclusion that human activity since the Industrial Revolution has not only paused but indefinitely delayed the series of ice ages. In fact, it may be that by elevating atmospheric carbon dioxide to levels not seen on Earth for millions of years, humans have ejected the Earth out of the Quaternary ice ages. Think about that for a moment. The process of industrialisation that began some 300 years ago has disrupted a 2.6m-year-old climate state. No more ice ages. But isn’t that good news? The dawn of a new ice age would plunge civilisation into chaos. We may not have intended to, but our actions have avoided such a calamity. Unfortunately, it’s possible to have too much of a good thing. Now we fear not winter, but a period of rapid warming, the likes of which our civilisations have never experienced before. It seems unimaginable that we could effect such significant change over such a short period of time. Harder still to acknowledge is that if we are to avoid dangerous climate change, then we must radically change how we power our industrialised societies.  Such change will not be easy to effect. As Tyrion Lannister once observed:  “Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it.” An adage that could apply to some of those who wish to become the most powerful person on Earth, as much as whoever vies to sit on the Iron Throne."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWarning: This post will not be an easy article for the lovers of birds and nature.
Not only do wind turbine make noise, disturb the surrounding natural environment, and create industrial blight in idyllic landscapes, but they also kill wildlife – especially protected birds.
The latest example is presented by the website of the anti-wind turbine group Gegenwind-Vogelsberg, in English “Against-Wind Vogelsberg”.
Vogelsberg is located in Central Germany and has been a natural reserve since 1956, thus making it one of Germany’s oldest. But that hasn’t stopped Big Wind from deforesting in the area to make way for industrial access roads and many dozens of 200-meter-tall wind turbines. Now this natural park “is the region in Hessen with the highest wind turbine density“.
According to the Gegenwind-Vogelsberg website:
Here there are over 220 turbines – another 40 are now in the permitting and planning process – 75% of all Central Hesse and 25% of all wind turbines in Hesse.
Through the unreasonable, money-greedy mayor and investors, and because of the zeal by energy suppliers to be energy-independent, the Vogelsberg and its surrounding area have mutated step-by-step from a natural park to an industrial park.”
Yesterday at their site, GegenWind-Vogelsberg presents one of the gruesome consequences of the wind turbines: a killed crane. GegenWind-Vogelsberg reports:
Because the wind lobby likes to insist that chopped birds are a fairy tale, we feel compelled to publish these gruesome photos and ask for your understanding.

Also especially because the wind park operator made no effort whatsoever to temporarily stop the turbines even though hundreds of other cranes flew by mistake through the wind park after the accident.”
The Gegenwind-Voegelsberg site provides photos of the “accident”:

“Chopped up in pieces– head and neck of the killed crane.”

Source of photos: here. It’s impossible to say just how many birds are killed each year because fallen birds quickly become the prey of predators on the ground, wildlife experts say.
One thing is clear, the turbines are deadly machines to birds – and that in a place once designated a “natural refuge” area.

"In spring 1984 a whole beach disappeared. Over just two days, the golden sands of Dooagh on the island of Achill, off the west coast of Ireland, were stripped away to reveal bare rocks.  This occurred during a series of southwesterly storms and, importantly, during peak equinox – short periods in spring and autumn when tides are particularly strong due to the nature of the Earth’s movement around the sun. Jutting out into the Atlantic, Achill is exposed to the worst the ocean can throw at it and southwesterly winds (from the south west) can generate substantive waves.  Thirty-three years later, in April 2017, the beach returned and the rocks were covered with sand once again.  Though it may seem baffling to most people, there’s nothing miraculous about what happened in Achill. This “magical reappearing beach” is simply a great example of a process that happens in coastal seas more regularly that you might think. First, let’s consider how Dooagh beach disappeared in the first place. The movement of pebbles, sand and sediment around the coast is caused by a mixture of waves, tides, and what is growing on the seafloor. Waves not only have the ability to stir up the sea bed and to wash beach sand into the ocean, but they can also create longshore drift as they strike a coast at an angle, gradually shifting sediment along the coast.  Rip-currents are created in certain circumstances where water piles up close to the shore and can only exit the beach in narrow and intense flows. These strong currents are best known to humans for causing many fatal swimming accidents, but they can also carry sand and pebbles far offshore. Seaweed can help stabilise those fragile sediments, but its growth is limited in the early months of the year.  When a beach gets unlucky and all of these factors come together – strong tides and abnormally high sea levels, a lack of seaweed – it can suddenly disappear. This is what happened to Dooagh in spring 1984, and had previously happened in a similar incident there in 1890. So, what brought the beach back in 2017 (and in 1927)? Almost the same processes that stole it in the first place. Some of the conditions were identical: April has the highest tides of the year and low algal growth. However this time the beach replenishment occurred during northerly winds. It’s hard to say for sure where the sand had been for the past 33 years but likely it was simply sitting on the seafloor some miles offshore and also in adjoining bays. The strong tides lifted the sand from the seafloor (and from the neighbouring bays that had benefited from the loan), unhindered by algae, and the northerly winds meant the waves carried it onshore.  This didn’t happen overnight. Over the past two years surfers had reported seeing sand offshore. By March 2017 (the second highest tide of the year) local fishermen reported the appearance of a sand bar offshore and a small amount of sand was deposited at the low water mark. The continued northerly winds followed by the exceptional April tides gave the final push and returned sand to Dooagh, depositing it well above the mean water level mark on the beach. People in Achill shouldn’t get too complacent as there’s no doubt Dooagh beach will disappear again at some point in future. It just needs to experience similar conditions to those of 1890 and 1984.  A beach disappearing so quickly is rare but not unheard of. In January 2015, for instance, the residents of Porthleven in Cornwall woke to a rocky shore after a strong southwesterly storm stripped the sand from their beach, again overnight. The bay has the same southwards orientation as Dooagh. It occurred during a spring tide, which is a fortnightly high tidal flow (not to be confused with spring the season). However in this case a shift of the wind (and hence waves) to southeasterly returned the sand just one day later. In 1995 I was involved in deploying some equipment to measure flows on a pebble beach near the town of Southsea on the English Channel. Overnight a strong storm hit, and on returning the following day the beach and all of our scientific equipment had gone, leaving behind a soft, sandy beach with an entirely different shape. Great for tourism, not so for science. In fact, the only science we achieved was through recovering some of our battered and heavy equipment – much of it ten miles to the east – which is presumably where most of the pebble beach had gone (though where the sand had come from is still a bit of a mystery, perhaps it was beneath the pebbles all along). These are just a few examples; I could cite many others. The coastline of the British Isles is constantly in flux for good reason. Each cubic metre of seawater weighs a tonne and Britain and Ireland are exposed to the pounding of Atlantic storms as well as some of the strongest tides on the planet. Predicting where and when the coast will erode is far from simple. There is also the issue that one coastal area’s loss is another’s gain. If beaches are overprotected without careful planning, retention of the beach-line in one location could mean that there is no longer replenishment sand further along the coast, causing a new problem.  The sea has shaped and re-shaped our coastlines since the Earth first had oceans, and will continue to do so for many more years yet. Ireland’s “reappearing beach” is just a tiny snapshot of this process."
"There’s nothing better than a breath of fresh air. Scientists have proven that getting out and smelling the roses can make you feel more relaxed. Spending time in green spaces is associated with lower stress levels and blood pressure too. In fact, research has shown that contact with natural environments can improve our social development and encourage us to make better choices on a daily basis. The way we plan and design villages, towns and cities has a direct impact on our physical and mental health and well-being, yet so many public places in neighbourhoods are being underused and poorly managed. Take Nottingham, for example, where ball games have been banned in a number of areas, and fences were erected to stop neighbours from accessing green spaces.  Parks and squares are regarded as some of the greatest legacies of the Victorian era, used to promote health and well-being in an era of slums and poor sanitation. In Nottingham alone 130 acres of green areas were developed around the city to promote better health – an unprecedented figure for green infrastructure in those times. Inexplicably, however, despite previous experiences green spaces are now being closed off to the general public.    The increase in mental health illness in urban places is a matter of concern across the world, and no less so in Britain. One in four people in the UK suffer from mental health disorders, and almost 20% of the population have been recorded as showing signs of anxiety or depression. Mental health accounts for the largest NHS expenditure: its cost has increased from eight to 11 billion pounds per year in the last decade, and currently costs around £850 per person every year.  But this should not just be a matter for the health service to worry about: the design of the built environment could help solve these problems. Contact with natural elements is a key aspect of well-being. Designing with an emphasis on guiding people into and through the space, providing clear links with navigation cues leading to meaningful places, can alleviate some of the environmental stress in urban settlements.  To achieve improved lifestyles, we need to connect closely with our public and green places. However, for this to happen people must develop a sense of responsibility, which comes with a feeling of ownership and belonging. The most effective way to achieve this is through designing and managing public places to help develop a sense of social identity, and create collective place memories at a neighbourhood level. But opportunities are repeatedly being missed across towns and neighbourhoods to make the most of what the locality has to offer. Small-scale life projects that regenerate or invigorate interest in different areas are often welcomed by schools and universities as they give students the opportunity to learn while providing a valuable service to communities. But these engagement programmes are often isolated events driven by individuals through their personal networks: a more strategic vision is needed. This kind of design requires strong leadership from the authorities and commitment from developers to provide more than just houses – and it’s not as hard a task as it may seem. In Leicester, the new Lubbesthorpe site – built with 75 acres of new woodland and 250 acres of park land – and Hinkley West development, designed with 109 acres of open land, have recently been built to incorporate these principles. The government’s Big Society, launched in 2010, empowered communities to encourage more social action, supporting people to help themselves; to use local networks and resources to make communities more resilient. Yet the UK still has one of the highest indices of loneliness in Europe: people feel less close to their neighbours, and therefore have no one to turn to in a crisis.  The impact of loneliness on health compares to smoking 15 cigarettes a day and imposes higher risks than diabetes or obesity. The strengthening and survival of social support networks in communities is vital to the physical and psychological health of the population, so what better way to help this community spirit than offering open spaces where people can meet and enjoy themselves? Indeed, the devolution agenda could facilitate the creation of management strategies at a more local level, engaging communities in the planning and caring of their local assets. Broader application of neighbourhood plans could also become a vehicle to deliver a stronger sense of local commitment towards green spaces. Furthermore, small scale public places could become hubs for skills development, network bridging, leadership strengthening and building trust. These places could offer a platform to develop local support networks, engage different age groups and battle loneliness. We know we need to live in a more sustainable landscape capable of hosting more positive lifestyles, yet too often, overarching constraints commonly ingrained in multiple land ownership issues, public health and safety and long term management costs, obstruct any prospects of change.  Now is the time to make a greater effort to find alternative ways to deliver well-being above all other concerns: alienating people from their neighbouring public places does exactly the opposite."

"When meltwater breached the global seed bank near Svalbard in May, after unusually warm weather, it served as a stark reminder of the need to safeguard humanity’s future in the face of increasing turbulence.  Buried 130 metres deep inside a mountain, the vault was designed to protect the world’s most precious seeds from disaster, to ensure the future of the global food supply. This secure, carefully configured indoor space for threatened ecologies has now, itself, been threatened by the ecological transformation and degradation produced outside by climate change. Yet for some, the solution is not to continue trying to save the “outside”, but to rework and intensify previous efforts to make new outsides – inside. More and more attempts are being made to create new synthetic environments, which reproduce an artificial “outside” within enclosed membranes.  These controlled environments are seen as a way to overcome the constraints and uncertainties of an increasingly turbulent and unstable outside world. Artificial, synthetic and hybrid ecologies, some of which bear no resemblance to the natural world, are becoming a major feature in urban landscapes across the globe. Efficient, technologically controlled “designer” environments are rebundled and repackaged for food production, plant and animal conservation – and even human occupation.  For example, synthetic environments are being configured as spaces for the production of food, crops and plants as rainfall and temperature changes due to climate change cast uncertainty over future agricultural productivity. “Precision” food production is taking place under technologically controlled “inside” environments, where temperature, humidity, water and light are managed and tailored to facilitate optimal conditions for food production, and alleviate the problems of risky and unsustainable “outside” growing environments.  Vertical farming has taken off in a number of US cities using hydroponic or aeroponic techniques, which require less water and soil than normal farming. Bespoke algorithms and sensing devices ensure growing conditions are tailored and monitored for particular crops – and grow boxes are stacked high to produce crops in dense and confined urban spaces. Disused air raid shelters in London and shipping containers in Boston are being appropriated for salad leaf and herb production. And Ikea now sells a full range of indoor gardening kits for apartment dwellers who do not have access to outside space. Synthetic environments are also being configured as protected spaces for species under threat from a more turbulent climate. Gardens by the Bay, sitting on a 100-hectare site near the commercial centre of Singapore, provides an important example of a protected environment for plant ecologies – it was explicitly designed by the state to exemplify the 21st-century garden city.  The gardens contain thousands of carefully selected plants, most of which wouldn’t be able to survive in Singapore’s natural climate. They are contained within two massive air-conditioned glasshouses, supported by a complex technical infrastructure. One is designed to replicate a cool-dry Mediterranean climate, while in the other, an artificial cloud forest contains a man-made waterfall, planted with species rated as having “high conservation value”  from tropical mountain climates around the world.  Here, ecological conservation converges with tourism, as part of a strategic state project to demonstrate Singapore’s ability to control climate. Indeed, the strategic ability to configure new synthetic environments may be becoming a crucial means for governments at all levels to attempt to deal with a economic and ecological uncertainties. The critical issue is whether these forms of enclosures seek to ensure the protection of premium users and the wealthiest cities, while vulnerable and ordinary cities are left to cope with more uncertain and turbulent conditions outside. Governments and companies are also creating synthetic environments as spaces for consumption. Artificial “natures” are created inside to reproduce, and improve on, the kinds of environments where particular sports and leisure activities can take place. New forms of enclosed, highly engineered interiors can be seen in the expansion of indoor ski slopes, climbing centres and artificial sports pitches. Some premium hotels and apartments now incorporate snow caves, jungle showers and virtual golf courses.  Shopping and leisure activities now come with an environmental experience, in new enclosures designed to allow wealthy consumers to escape from the hostile environment outside. Consider, for example, Khan Shatyr SEC in Astana, Kazakhstan – billed as “the biggest tent in the world”. Or Dubai’s Mall of the World, or the Tropical Islands resort outside Berlin – which recreates Asian villages, beaches and an indoor rainforest within the largest free-standing dome in the world.  The new logic here is to create improved, processed, extracted and intensified environments. These are not simulations or recreations – they are new designer environments in their own right: specialised, productive, desirable and (it is claimed) safe and secure.  Yet the development of these new spaces requires a complex, bespoke infrastructure usually including air conditioning, water treatment, waste processing, heating and cooling and the manipulation of air pressure, as well as incorporating digital technologies and devices. As such, they are very expensive and require vast amounts of energy and resources to produce and maintain. In this way, those investing in synthetic environments actually contribute to the degradation of the outside world, while aiming to create comfortable and secure inside worlds.  Creating new outsides, inside, poses new contradictions graphically illustrated by the flooding of the Svalbard seed bank. Attempts to enclose and secure environments can produce new and unintended vulnerabilities, such as ecological change and technological failures. In this moment, it is critical to pause and consider whether it would not make more sense to develop more collective and global solutions to improve the world outside, rather than continuing on the path to create contained, climate-controlled ecologies inside."
"Gentle groans of cattle gradually woke me from my slumber. It had been another hot, humid night spent shuffling to sleep on wooden slats – my three research assistants had adopted hammocks, but I simply couldn’t stand being surrounded by polyester in 35°C. Even at 4am, it was just too hot. Above me, the deep fiery hue of dawn spanned the sky as far as the eye could see. Swifts swept in among the palms, clearing the skies in a feeding frenzy. I’d been in Cambodia six weeks, and this was one of the last villages left to survey. I was researching the impact of local communities’ livelihoods on a critically endangered bustard species; the Bengal florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis). Fewer than 1,500 florican remain globally, over 60% of which seasonally reside in the grasslands of Kampong Thom province, central Cambodia. Male florican are distinctive. If you’re lucky, between February and April you may spy their beautiful black and white bodies leaping 30 metres into the air; performing to impress shy females. However, opportunities for encountering such moments are increasingly rare. In recent decades florican have undergone dramatic population declines, initially driven by over-hunting, but now by widespread habitat loss, primarily due to rice cultivation. People I’ve met typically assume my time is spent in vast vistas, surrounded by swathes of jungle, spotting exotic wildlife. For me the reality is sleeping on a plank alongside cattle, surrounded by farmlands. I’m a member of the Interdisciplinary Centre of Conservation Science at Oxford University, and unlike typical ecological or biological approaches to conservation, we use a broad range of techniques developed from disciplines as varied as sociology, anthropology, psychology and economics to enhance understanding of complex socio-ecological systems. My research in Cambodia, recently published in Oryx, is reflective of our lab as a whole; instead of spending time in the field monitoring wildlife, we usually work in communities, trying to understand human behaviour. My team and I travelled by motorbike from village to village along dusty dirt roads. We spent a short time in each village conducting household surveys with a wide variety of people in a bid to better understand how communities live, and how their activities overlap with surrounding grasslands. Sometimes we were invited into peoples’ homes; others we sat beneath their stilted houses, perched on wooden beds or plastic chairs. Around our feet scabby puppies and occasionally piglets snuffled, grunted and squealed. Agriculture has long played a role sculpting the landscape of central Cambodia, with rice cultivated on the floodplains since the Empire of Angkor (c.800-1400AD). But over the last two decades the production of rice has intensified. Whereas once rice was only grown for subsistence in wet season, usually in paddies naturally inundated by seasonal floods, nowadays rice is also grown throughout the dry season in newly converted fields, primarily for commerce. Great reservoirs and canal networks sprawl across the landscape, carved where grasslands once were. Across the dusty floodplain, dry season rice fields glow like green irrigated iridescent beacons. Large scale dry season rice production emerged at the turn of the millennium, initially driven by profiteering businessmen. From my interviews I learned that this practice is now widespread among local communities, with nearly half of all households capitalising on the infrastructural investments made by urban elites to cultivate dry season rice. Koyuns, small hand-driven tractors, can be seen dotted alongside channels, extracting water. Plastic, python like tubes pump water back to paddies to grow this perceived “green gold”. It was believed dry season rice was typically grown between December and March. However, my interviews revealed that nearly half of all dry season rice farmers now farm two crops of rice a year, extending the rice cultivation season into June. This is a relatively recent and previously undocumented trend, with significant implications for florican, who visit grasslands from February to July. Expansion of dry season rice not only means less habitat is available for floricans to forage and breed, but it also reduces the time for which it is available. Floricans return to the same large territories each year to mate. This means the miniscule populations that remain are likely returning to increasingly sub-optimal habitat. In addition, around 95% of the dry season rice farmers I spoke to said that they use fertiliser or pesticides on their crop. Many have to borrow money in order to do so, and sometimes if their crops fail or the market collapses, they may find themselves indebted to credit lenders, forced to sell land to clear their debts. There are also considerable environmental and ecological implications. Agro-chemicals not only reduce food availability, but they typically include substances banned in the West, including DDT, a chemical known to cause egg thinning in birds. Fertilisers also filter into groundwater, impacting food webs. This is highly concerning, especially given the proximity to the Tonlé Sap, the largest inland fishery in Cambodia, and the lifeline of many throughout the land. Conservation is complex, and we live in a rapidly changing world. Whereas once people measured their prosperity, health and happiness against that of their neighbours, today the advent of social media and the internet means that people compare themselves to others across the world. Nearly a half of households I surveyed had children that had left home to seek prosperity in the factories and sweatshops of Phnom Penh and Thailand. Priorities have changed. More of my interviewees owned a mobile phone (87%) than had access to a toilet (just 36%). Understanding how these changing priorities affect natural resource use is critical to the success of global conservation efforts. For this reason, we also hosted focus groups in each village, bringing people together to discuss both conservation and options for the future. We asked about local perceptions of conservation work in the area. Some were unaware of conservation activities, whereas others applauded efforts – these were usually communities that had seen some returns from tourism. Others resented the limitations conservation placed on their livelihoods, citing too many costs and too few benefits. If we are to successfully secure both the livelihoods of local people and the future of endangered species, then it is essential conservation is reconciled with development. One such medium is the Sustainable Rice Platform, an industry led initiative that encourages production of rice that meets sustainability standards. These include measures for protecting biodiversity, reducing pollution, gender equality, and supporting fair wages. In return, farmers that are supported to meet the standards receive stable, premium prices for their crop. NGO Wildlife Conservation Society are now piloting this in some surveyed villages. It is clear that typical biological approaches are no longer enough. Too often conservation is filled with doom and gloom; relying on research that counts species to extinction. Instead, interdisciplinary, social research that engages local communities should be the norm. Luckily, I am not alone in this belief: there is a growing generation of conservationists for whom this is and always will be the way conservation is done."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is a modestly abbreviated version in English. The first part is the brief solar activity report, and the second part is about IPCC model failure. 
==========================================
The Sun in September 2014. Attention: X-Flares!
By Frank Bosse and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)The sun in September was considerably more active than in the previous months. The sunspot number was 87.6, which was 89% of what is typical in the 70th month into a cycle. The current solar cycle 24 (SC 24) began in December 2008. Figure 1 shows the current cycle compared to the mean of SC 1-23, and solar cycle no. 1:
Fig. 1: The current SC 24 is shown in red, the mean of the previous 23 cycles is depicted by the blue curve, and the current cycle SC 24 strongly resembles SC 1, which is shown by the black curve.
The current cycle resembles SC 1, and should it continue to behave like SC 1, a trailing off of activity cannot be anticipated anytime soon. Indications, however, do point to a longer than normal cycle. Japanese researcher Hiroko Miyahara and his team examined this in 2013 (Influence of the Schwabe/Hale solar cycles on climate change during the Maunder Minimum). They were able to show that the length of the solar cycle correlates with solar activity. “The mean length of the Schwabe cycle during the Maunder Minimum was approx. 14 years, and during the Medieval Warm Period the average cycle length was only about 9 years.”
The sun today is relatively active, though slightly below normal. On September 10 there was an X 1.6 – flare, a a high category explosion on the sun. Flare are designated as follows: C for common, M for medium, and X for strong. See the following image, Figure 2:

Figure. 2: X-flare on 10 September 2014. Source: solarham.net.
With such powerful explosions, material gets ejected from the sun, what is known as a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME). When such plasma strikes the earth’s atmosphere, it leads to polar lights and other effects. The strength of X 1.6 was too weak to have any massive impact on the earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field.
Models fail to project temperature
Now let’s take a detailed look at the warming scenarios of the earth’s surface temperature, this time taking local particularities into account:

 Fig. 3: The mean surface temperature since 2000 compared to the period of 1950-1980, Source: GISS 
Most of the warming took place in the northern extra-tropics at latitudes between 25°N and 90°N. This is consistent with the expectations one would have with the effects of greenhouse gases.  However, let’s take a look at the temperature series of the northern hemisphere extra-tropic region. Here we also see a “pause” since about the year 2000.

Figure. 4: The temperature curve of the northern extra-tropics as to GISS.
Indeed the trend from 1983 to 2013 differs significantly (0.33 +/- 0.06 °C/decade) from the 2000 to 2013 period (0.09 +/- 0.14°C/decade), which is no longer a significant warming. This hefty deceleration has occurred even though greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise linearly unabated. We reported multiple times on what the reasons could be for thi.
How do models handle the problem of the asymmetry in warming that we observe between both hemispheres? A recent paper from 2013 by 4 authors of the universities of Berkeley and Washington led by Andrew R. Friedman examined the difference between the northern hemisphere (NH) and the southern hemisphere (SH), named ITA, and summarized what the newest models anticipated for temperature:

 Fig. 5: The temperature difference between the NH and SH determined with the CMIP5 models. Source: Figure 2 of the just mentioned paper.
The text of the paper describes: With today’s emissions scenario (close to the IPCC scenario named RCP8.5) there is a highly linear rise of 0.17°K/decade (Point 3, “future projections“ of the aforementioned paper).
But let’s do a reality check and compare it to the actual surface observations since 1900:

Fig. 6: ITA as GISS since 1900, (Data: GISS), Model (thick green curve).
The 1982-2013 period is indeed at 0.165+/-0.04°C/decade, but it has become significantly less. The 1998-2013 period shows a trend of only 0.055+/-0.067°C/decade – not rising significantly – and is barely 30% of what was registered since 1982. No one here can claim that the trend is “highly linear”.
The cause? One cause is offered up by the 2013 paper: The drop in the late 1960s was not replicated by the models and was likely caused by internal variability, very likely by the AMOC (see Fig. 8b of the paper), the authors maintain.
Also the steep rise after 1915 would be due to variability 1915 … and at least for a part of the rise beginning in 1985 – as we have often maintained at this blog.
So it remains: Reproducing internal variability has not been adequately possible by models up to now. The dependency of temperatures on the forcing by greenhouse gases is stronger in models than what it is in reality. The models overblow the anthropogenic impact and thus yield exaggerated prognoses for the future.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s bad enough when the media indulge in sensationalism, but it is totally unprofessional when weather and climate institutes do the same.
In his latest Saturday Summary, veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi at Weatherbell Analytics goes after, rips US weather and climate agencies for poor, and often hyped forecasts.
At the 2:54 mark Joe says:
And that’s one of the big problems we have today. People that are here today are classifying things that happened before and changing everything that was recorded before.”
As an example Bastardi cites GISS in their dubious claim that September 2014 was the warmest on record, when clearly it was not. Bastardi shows that at least 7 or 8 other satellite-era years were warmer, such as 2003.

Satellite measurement shows that September 2014 was a mere 0.195°C above normal. Image from Weatherbell.
On the GISS claim, Joe says:
All I’m saying is that there are several so-called reliable measurements of global temperatures and all you see these people doing that are making, screaming and yelling of the hottest temperature ever, is using one of the least reliable datasets. Their very own NCEP reanalysis shows something very different. So, again, there’s a lot of controversy in this. And what happens is that they scream this stuff out, and then they walk it back.”

Next Joe shows a chart (5:00) depicting global temperature over the last 10 years, which clearly shows it to be in decline.
The veteran meteorologist also calls out the over-hyped El Nino predictions made by the National Weather Service (NWS) last April. Six months later we see that the predictions were totally false. The AGW crowd, Joe says, bought it all up without question and that the predictions made in April were based on “busted models”.
NWS “blowtorches” the US winter
The incompetence of the US weather agencies doesn’t stop there. Other examples Joe presents include botched predictions of cyclone tracks, and the NWS dubious winter forecast calling for a “blowtorch winter”.

Though seasonal forecasts are tricky, Joe lays out in detail his reasoning why he thinks the other models are more reliable and why the NWS model “has troubles”.
Right now, Joe sees a cold winter for the eastern half of the USA, and so does the European model.

"Back in January I wrote an article for The Conversation applauding China’s announcement to close its ivory trade and processing activities by the end of 2017. A shocked but delighted conservation lobby hailed the move as a potential turning point in the protection of wild elephants.  But now the UK Conservative party has quietly dropped a manifesto commitment to ban the ivory trade. I am as concerned today as I was happy back in January.  China’s announcement followed a major global conference in September 2016. CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora – imagine a sort-of UN for the illegal wildlife trade – recommended that its 183 member states “close their domestic markets for commercial trade in raw and worked ivory as a matter of urgency”. In line with the Conservatives’ 2015 manifesto promise “to press for a total ban on ivory sales”, the government also responded positively by announcing plans for a ban on sales of modern day ivory. Britain’s rules would be among the world’s most stringent.   There are more than 2,000,000 pieces of ivory in Britain’s homes, according to an estimate by The British Antiques Dealers Association. They range from the keys of a piano to the handles of knives, small ornaments and boxes. Current legislation means that ivory that has been “worked” (that is, carved) is legal to sell under the so-called “antiques exemption” provided it was worked before 1947, the cut-off date set by the original CITES convention. However, judging whether a piece is pre or post-1947 is no easy task. There are some scientific techniques: the date roughly corresponds with the end of World War II and the era of nuclear testing which released massive amounts of a radioactive carbon isotope (C14) into the atmosphere. All life now carries traces of C14, and it is possible to date any living thing since this point – including ivory. Such forensic testing is prohibitively expensive and invasive though, so the antiques trade still relies on knowledge and experience to judge an item.  Proof of age is important as, even though ivory antiques don’t kill any “new” elephants, new ivory – from illegally poached tusks – can easily be mixed in with old. Expert dealers are wary of illegal ivory, but ivory is also sold more casually, at car boot sales or fairs by non-specialists. This explains the calls from conservation groups for a blanket ban on the sale of all ivory, including antique.  After banning the post-1947 trade, the UK government also set out its intention to consult with interested groups on strengthening proof of age regulation. Intention to introduce a “documentary proof” requirement was announced meaning it would no longer be sufficient for a dealer or auctioneer to simply state that the item is a pre-1947 worked piece and for the prosecution to prove otherwise.  What a difference a year makes. Looking at the 2017 Conservative manifesto, gone is the bold total ban statement and there is no mention of the earlier promises. In their place is a very general commitment “to leave the environment in better condition than we inherited it” and to cooperate with international bodies to protect rare species. The antiques trade, conservation groups and law enforcers were all anticipating a promised consultation which has not materialised. Instead, Brexit has dominated the political landscape, and while government departments have understandably focused on Europe other matters, including the ivory trade, appear to have been put on the back burner.  With the WWF reporting that some 20,000 African elephants are being killed annually for their ivory, the back burner is not a safe place. The Labour manifesto by contrast pledges to “introduce and enforce a total ban on ivory trading”. However this deceptively simple statement has not been well received by some sellers of the older (pre-1947) ivory, who would be hit by the extended ban.  Their argument is that older ivory already exists, and that an ornament changing hands doesn’t involve any further elephant slaughter. For them, a ban would be an attack on their lawful businesses and an act of cultural vandalism. The illegal ivory trade needs to be dealt with both at the macro and micro level. In global terms, we must act with the international community to honour the commitments made in the September 2016 CITES conference. This of course includes international action to help African countries tackle poaching.  However as a signatory to CITES, the UK must also be active and vigilant in the prosecution of its own sellers of illegal ivory. This should include strict rules governing the sale of pre-1947 worked ivory pieces including, at minimum, a requirement for sellers to provide documentary evidence of the age of the items. Research I’ve carried out as part of Portsmouth’s Ivory Project suggests we should go further and only allow ivory to be sold via licensed, specialist dealers and auctioneers."

"You’ve probably seen dramatic images of out of control wildfires that directly and immediately affect people. The news recently followed 200 firefighters tackling a blaze in California, while this May many watched the evacuation of more than 50,000 people from Fort McMurray in Canada.  But, every so often, in regions too remote for the TV cameras, satellite images reveal vast fires covering thousands of square kilometres in smoke. This is what’s happening in Siberia, right now. This all leaves an impression of large-scale destruction and ecological disaster. But are we really right to be worried? Although – wrongly – perceived as avoidable disasters, wildfires have been a natural and fundamental part of many of the world’s forests, grasslands and shrublands for millions of years. Fire is part of a natural rejuvenation cycle in these ecosystems. Attempts to eliminate it can have negative ecological impacts such as loss of biodiversity or increased vulnerability of forests to disease, and simply increase the risk of larger, more catastrophic fires. Although necessary for many ecosystems, wildfires do release vast amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, currently 1.6–2.8 gigatonnes a year, equivalent to a third of the total amount emitted from the burning of fossil fuels. The CO2 emissions from fires help accelerate global warming, which in turn leads to more fire, while soot emitted from fires is often deposited on ice leading to accelerated melting. But that’s only part of the story. While burning vegetation inevitably releases carbon, this carbon is normally taken up again when the forest regrows. And charcoal formed during burning means carbon is “locked up” in soils and sediments. So wildfires in regions adapted to fire can overall be considered “carbon neutral” or in some cases even lead to carbon sequestration in the longer-term. This means naturally recurring wildfires aren’t necessarily a threat to ecosystems or the global climate. What is of wider concern, however, is when they occur in ecosystems that are not well adapted to fire such as tropical forest or peatlands, or where fires are changing in their extent, or in how severely they burn the landscape. While the average annual area burned globally has changed surprisingly little during the last few decades, there are worrying trends in some regions such as larger blazes and longer fire seasons in the western US as a result of land management and a warming climate. Considering all this, what about the current fires in Siberia? Are they really anything out of the ordinary – and what should we make of the concern raised by Greenpeace, that the Russian government’s official figures of area burnt are huge underestimations? Satellite observations can help us answer these two questions. First, satellite data has long shown that Russian government statistics are substantial underestimations of actual ﬁre activity. Second, the annual area burned in boreal Asia (predominantly Siberia) is particularly variable, compared to the world’s other main vegetation zones. On average around 5m hectares have burned every year between 2001 and 2012, but this covered a range of more than than 15m in 2003 to less than 3m in 2005. The area burned so far this year in Siberia is well within that range, but then we’ve only just reached midsummer – the season is not yet over. Just like boreal Canada, temperatures in Siberia are increasing faster than in many other parts of the world and this trend is expected to continue. Rising temperatures lead to drier vegetation, to fuel the fires, and more lightning, which increases the risk of fire. A hotter climate also lengthens the season during which fires occur. These factors combined are expected to increase fire activity in this region. What is particularly worrying here is some of the fires in Siberia and other boreal regions affect peatlands which are gradually thawing thanks to global warming. This has a knock-on effect on the climate. When they burn deep into the ground peatland fires can release carbon that has accumulated over millennia and turn these peatlands from being net carbon sinks to long-term carbon emitters. So irrespective of discrepancies in reporting of fires in Siberia and the fact that fires are a natural feature of boreal forests, we can expect more fires and more associated greenhouse gas emissions in boreal regions in a warming world."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s online flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reports here German CO2 emissions rose 2% in 2013. This marks another setback for German efforts to curb emissions by 40% (relative to 1990 levels) by 2020.
Cold weather hampering fight against warming
Ironically, experts are blaming “cold weather” for thwarting the country’s efforts to combat “global warming” through CO2 emissions reductions. The FAZ writes:
Foremost the cold winter drove up natural gas consumption. Emissions of coal and oil also drove up emissions considerably.
Coal is currently inexpensive because in America it is being displaced by even cheaper natural gas that is pressed out of the ground using the ‘fracking method'”.
According to the FAZ, which cites experts, Germany’s CO2 emissions climbed 20 million tonnes last year.

This is the second year in a row that German CO2 emissions have risen, despite having invested a whopping $250 billion in green energies. Some critics call the green energy feed-in act a “giant capital-destruction machine”.
26 million unemployed in EU28!
Europe, on the other hand, saw its overall CO2 emissions fall by 2.5% in 2013.
But that reduction has a lot to do with Europe’s economic malaise…especially in places like Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and Greece. When jobs are killed off and a major portion of the population becomes idle, reduced energy consumption is the natural result.
Currently Europe’s unemployment rate stands at a whopping 12%. More than 26 million men and women are unemployed in the EU28, according to Eurostat.

"In weeks like this one it becomes quite clear just how much of federal politics is performative. Politicians do things for no discernible reason other than to be seen to be doing something, or to put on a show that will elevate their profile or position. Once the New South Wales and Queensland fires reached a critical level, politicians were always going to do all they could to be seen to be involved.  The problem is that during such a crisis there is very little for a prime minister to do. He actually has no role – the fire services are state based, and anything that will require federal coordination, whether it be Australian federal police or Australian Defence Force, does not really need the prime minister at all. In reality, he just gets in the way. But getting in the way is expected of prime ministers at such times. When an emergency such as this occurs, the PM is expected to be there, touring around, being seen listening to briefings by the local emergency services chief, with a bit of looking at maps and so forth, and showing emotion. Scott Morrison this week was not actually doing anything of note – and to be honest, neither was the ALP leader, Anthony Albanese, who also toured parts of NSW and received a briefing on the situation. About the best the PM could have done this week was made sure the NSW fires services had the phone number of the ADF to contact and then to let them get on with their work. But had he done that, the criticism of course would have been about where was he, why hadn’t he visited the scene, talked with emergency services and so on. Back in 2011, Julia Gillard was accused by Tony Abbott and others for being too “wooden” when she visited the Queensland floods. It was all the usual sexist crud that was directed towards Gillard. She was regarded as not emotional enough compared to Anna Bligh, who was premier of Queensland at the time and had an actual role, whereas Gillard – like Morrison this week – really had nothing to do. Gillard’s failure was not about action, it was about the performance. (And the reality that she could do no right – even when she later cried in parliament. Andrew Bolt wrote a column in which he was at pains to say that while he thought her tears were genuine, “it will seem calculated to some” because she needed to show that she was not wooden.) Morrison, the man from marketing, sure as heck was not going to make the mistake of appearing too wooden – he is very much a politician in tune with the performative nature of the job. We saw this during the election campaign when he would “do things” that made the travelling press pack happy because it gave them something to report about. He also knows how to make use of a crisis. Does anyone remember the crisis of needles in strawberries? In reality the biggest concern was the risk of copycat acts due to the attention Morrison gave the contamination scare, but nevertheless he used the occasion to perform the role of the leader who was tough on crime. He also used the occasion to rush through laws that were neither asked for nor needed, but which show that while we might dismiss the performative art of politics as a sideshow, politicians on their game will use it to push their agenda and get their way. Our media system is driven by what Italian media academic Gianpietro Mazzoleni calls “spectacularisation” – the demand for the spectacle in our political news – and good politicians use it to their advantage. And so Morrison brings in a lump of coal to parliament. Why? The performance – it annoys the left and it is a good spectacle. The ALP this week has tried their best to not provide any spectacle. There was no fightback of any real note against the idiocy of Barnaby Joyce or Michael McCormack – a lot of “now is not the time”. And that might seem the mature and sensible response, and yet with the spectacle and the performative aspect of politics comes the opportunity to sell your policy and push your agenda Australia is burning, and it is burning because of climate change. Scientists and fire chiefs know this – and they have been ignored by the government. That’s reason enough for the ALP to raise the issue with fervour. This week the Swedish central bank sold off Australian government bonds because of our high emissions dependency. That won’t be the last time climate change has a major impact in international finance. We all know it is coming, but the government chooses to ignore it and suggests we put off discussion for another time. We should be talking about it now – no debate on climate change is going to hamper the ability of firefighters to do their job. No firefighter is standing off to the side waiting for Albanese and Morrison to finish their debate so they can go off and put out a fire. It might seem mature to wait for a more appropriate occasion to talk about climate change and bushfires, but politics is about capturing the moment. The conservative side of politics knows this, and uses it again and again on issues of national security and crime. Conservatives want to wait, because they want to wait until a time when the public will be less invested, less angry and less attentive. Next month it will be Christmas holidays and the attention of voters will be gone. Progressives too often cower and take the mature road and let opportunities go begging. The performance and spectacle of politics might be annoying and distracting but it can’t be ignored. The ALP did not need to come out this week going over the top like Joyce and McCormack, but they need to use these occasions to capture the imagination of the public and push for action. Because if you can’t bring yourself to talk about climate change while the country is burning, then you can’t blame voters for thinking it must not be that big of a deal, or just as bad, that the ALP doesn’t really care. • Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is the Arctic part of Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Frank Bosse’s recently posted article: The sun August 2014, the internal variability of the climate and the latest on Arctic ice. Time permitting, I will do the translation of the solar part a little later.
================================
The Latest News On Arctic Ice
By Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Frank Bosse
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
In our column from the previous month, we took a look at the ice volume in the Arctic. Since then summer has come to an end and the data for the May-August period are now available from PIOMAS.
If one computes the loss in ice volume (the melt) for each individual year from May 1st to August 31st of each year, we get a surprise:

Figure 4: Annual Arctic sea ice volume loss (thousands of cubic km) according to PIOMAS (blue) compared with the mean value 1980-2013 (black) and standard deviation (gray).
After the very high melt rates of the 2007-2012 period, the trend reversed in 2013 and especially in 2014 when the melt fell below the long-term average. What could be the reasons for this? Currently one can only speculate. One clue can be taken from a study by Mojib Latif from the year 2013:
It was suggested that the AMOC might be capable of influencing Arctic sea ice on this time scale through the inflow of Atlantic Water into the Arctic Ocean.”

We’ve reported on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) on several occasions, the last time here. Could it be that the AMOC acts as a decisive internal component of variability for Arctic ice melt? Let’s carry out a short plausibility check: The impact of the AMOC can be especially well depicted by the course of the heat content of the upper 700 meters of water in the area of the North Atlantic between 45°N – 60°N and 60°W – 10°W.
And what do we see?

Figure 5: Heat content south of the polar Atlantic until June 2014 (Diagram from Climate Explorer)
We see a real plummet over the last few months, which by the way was anticipated at the beginning of the year as we reported here.
The claims made by Prof. Mojib Latif et. al. have thus withstood this test. Is that the entire explanation? Probably not. In any case, the internal variability of our climate in many ways plays a far greater role than models and some climate scientists claim. Should that be the case, then the following must be assumed: The sensitivity of our climate with respect to greenhouse gases is not as high as some (97%??) have assumed so far.
In other words: The 21st century climate catastrophe is not taking place.

"In the middle of the night, while most residents were sleeping, a devastating fire started at Grenfell Tower in London. The emergency response was rapid and robust: more than 200 firefighters attended the scene, with assistance arriving just six minutes after the first calls were made. Emergency services have confirmed that 17 people are dead. More remain missing and dozens are injured. Already, people are asking how the fire spread so rapidly and why it was so difficult for residents to escape.  Doubtless, in time, a thorough investigation will reveal the full details of what caused the disaster. But from an engineering perspective, there are a number of factors in the design of the 24-storey tower block that may have contributed to the speed and scale of the blaze. Most of the current guidelines across the world contain detailed design requirements for fire safety such as evacuation routes, compartmentation and structural fire design. But Grenfell Tower was built in 1974. At that time, the rules and regulations were not as clear and well-developed as they are now.  The evacuation route is one of the most important design elements when it comes to fire safety. The route should allow occupants to escape the building as quickly as possible, while sheltering them from smoke and flames. Some tall buildings have staircases installed on the outside to prevent people from getting stuck in the corridors and provide access to fresh air while they escape. Other options include installing high-power fans inside buildings, to clear the evacuation route of smoke in the event of a fire. This feature is included in the design of Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world.  It’s clear that residents were not happy with the fire safety of the escape route from a blog posted in November 2016 and the design below would suggest there was only one set of stairs for evacuation. Investigators will need to determine what evacuation routes were available. Another key strategy is to correctly design fire compartments to keep the fire from spreading quickly. This entails placing barriers in the building – such as fire-resistant doors and walls – to confine the fire to a local area, or at least slow the speed at which it can spread. These compartments are designed based on the function of the buildings by architects, so residential and commercial buildings will have different compartment design strategies.  In current design practice, some buildings even include special design measures for fires, such as refuge rooms for occupants in the higher storeys, who could have trouble escaping down stairs. There are also active fire protection methods such as using sprinklers. Though a parliamentary report following the 2009 Lakanal House fire in Camberwell, London, in which six people died, recommended that sprinkler systems be installed in tower blocks across the UK, it’s not clear that these measured were implemented in Grenfell Tower. A local residents action group also claimed that their warnings about a lack of fire safety measures “fell on deaf ears”. The fire risk level of any building also depends on its structural design – that is, the capacity of its materials to resist fire. Different materials receive different fire ratings in each design. For example, steel buildings are normally required to have structural elements such as beams or columns that can stand for one to two hours with the help of fire protection material such intumescent paint, which swells up when heated to protect the material beneath.  According to reports, the key structural components of Grenfell Tower are mostly made of concrete – a material which rates highly in terms of fire resistance. While other materials can buckle in high temperatures, concrete structures can help to prevent the collapse of a building in case of fire, as well as making it safer to use helicopters – which can dump up to 9,842 litres of water at a time – to extinguish the blaze.  There were also reports relating to cladding added as part of an £8.7m refurbishment in 2016. The material used for the cladding was primarily aluminium, which is not fire resistant. What’s more, aluminium has high conductivity – so the cladding itself could have heated up very quickly, failing to prevent the fire from travelling through the windows and up the exterior of the block from one storey to another. In truth, most old buildings do not conform to the latest guidelines for fire safety design, so it is imperative to update them by installing sprinklers, fire alarms and extra fire evacuation staircases. While those affected may have to wait for some time before the causes of the fire become clear and responsibility is taken, landlords and local councils can act now to help prevent another disaster of this scale from happening again."
"My Rare Bird Alert pager bleeped insistently at precisely 2.05pm on Saturday April 29. I read the message with some disbelief: there was a female red-winged blackbird Agelaius phoeniceus at Garso, North Ronaldsay, the most remote island in Orkney. Across Britain the same mega (very rare bird) alert was shouting away at around 3,000 other folk with pagers. By that Saturday night I had taken numerous phone calls from excited birding pals, and even been offered a seat on a charter flight in the coming days. But I had a pile of essays to mark to a deadline and it was out of the question. Fifteen charter planes landed on the island over the next three days, carrying birders/twitchers (the terms are more or less interchangeable) from London, Bristol, Lancashire, and my county of work, Nottinghamshire. Why was this bird so important that some birders were willing to pay upwards of £600 to get it on their British list? First, rarity is both potent and alluring. This is the first ever red-winged blackbird to turn up in Britain, Ireland and the wider Western Palearctic, which includes Europe and northern Africa and Asia. Second, we as birders are fascinated by the mysteries of migration. There is a sense of wonder as we muse on how this bird, a very common species in North America, made it all the way across the Atlantic to end up in Orkney. Was it whipped over by a fast-moving Atlantic depression? Did it hitch a ride on a ship? Did it land somewhere else, then relocate, and finally get found on North Ronaldsay which has a bird observatory? We will never know, but we can marvel and ponder as we adventure to see it. Birders have a unique and intimate geographical perspective of Britain.  Third, to get this bird on your list secures your current position in the UK400Club or British Ornithologists Union list rankings. (Birding like boxing, has competing authorities). If your rivals (like me) don’t go, you nudge one ahead, and they may never get it back on you. That gives bragging rights. There is an appeal in that. Competition and status are at the heart of many a hobby, however egalitarian it is, be it birding, dog showing or pigeon racing. But so, importantly, are excitement, friendship and tribal community. We are kindred spirits.  This particular red-winged blackbird is doomed. It has no functioning ecological value anymore, because it is so lost it will never find its way back to where the rest of its species lives in North America. It is much the same for many rare birds that turn up in Britain every spring and autumn. Birders are in effect driving thousands of miles to watch disorientated, dysfunctional and displaced individuals that will never reconnect with the rest of their species. There is a pathos in that. To be brutal, the only true value that this red-winged blackbird now has is a financial one. Charter plane pilots, accommodation providers in Orkney, ferry companies and North Ronaldsay Bird Observatory can generate valuable income from the presence of this bird. Of course, for those British birders who have ventured far to see it, it has an enduring cultural value beyond comprehension. The finder, Simon Davies, now basks in a sort of birding immortality, his name forever associated with a Yankee blackbird and whispered reverently at future twitches. When I got my RBA pager back in 1997 as a reward to myself for finishing my PhD at St Andrews, I confidently proclaimed that it was never going to rule my life. I have been on a slippery slope since. It is attached to my torso, like an ornithological life-affirming pacemaker. Indeed, my heart often does beat in synch with it. It calls to me like a seductive siren, and I either respond, or try to ignore it during the working day.   Before you think that this is insanity, a life controlled by a small grey battery-operated box, it is worth noting that I am only a Championship twitcher (say, the Bolton Wanderers of birding). The hardcore up in the Premier League, with lists bigger than mine, essentially prosper or fail by messages on their pager at certain times of the year. Some of them are unable to work full-time or hold down relationships. Others can find a balance. Ultimately, personal choices and sacrifices dictate that. Back in the 1990s, a pager was cutting edge technology. Who carries a pager now? NHS staff, politicians, and British birders it seems. As I write this, the red-winged blackbird is still on North Ronaldsay, and I’m still marking 250 ecotourism essays. Feel my pain."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI sent an e-mail to Fritz Vahrenholt to ask his opinion on the Lennart Bengtsson mobbing scandal. Professor Vahrenholt is one of the fathers of the German environmental movement and co-author of the best-selling skeptic climate science book “Die kalte Sonne“.

Climate science critic Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt says doubt on climate science is gaining. Photo credit: Die kalte Sonne. 
My questions to Professor Vahrenholt:
Also having expressed skepticism on climate science and having come under fire for doing so, do you think there is an atmosphere of intimidation that acts to keep people from expressing their doubts on climate science? Do you feel this is also the case in Germany? Do you think the strategy of marginalizing and silencing critics has been a successful one for the warmist side? Or do you think it is failing and is only hurting them?
Professor Vahrenholt’s responded:
It would be a wonder in a country where climate alarmism sets the tone of the energy-political debate like in no other country things would be otherwise.
I still can remember very well when the Academy of Technical Sciences prepared a report on the possibilities to adapt to climate change three years ago. At the time I was one of the three directors of the Working Group. I attempted to add to the report the uncertainties of the climate models, the natural influences on climate development, the decoupling between CO2 rise and temperature development over the last 15 years.

Three scientists threatened to quit unless I ceded the leadership of the WG. But I resisted the pressure to do so. The three scientists (which included the vice president of the German Weather Service) resigned.
Or just think back to the unspeakable report by the Federal Environment Minister in which scientists and journalists who held skeptical views were branded.
My impression, however, is that the marginalization of mainstream alternative positions is no longer succeeding so easily.
The real development is putting the apologists of climate alarmism in their place. And the off-the-rails energy policy, which believes will have an impact on the global climate, is doing the rest.
Doubt over the dogmatic position of the CO2-alone is causing climate change is increasingly getting broader and more public.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a another example of how environmental activists like to beg, plead and claim real excuses when severe environmental accidents happen, yet when an accident is caused by anyone else they demand heads on a plate.
The Cairns Post here has an article: Sea Shepherd guilty of diesel spill that dropped up to 500 litres of diesel into the Trinity Inlet.
Hat-tip: reader Jim
The article is from earlier this year, but it neither got media attention nor the attention it deserves.
What really strikes me is that the environmental organization comes in with its lawyers and fights tooth and nail in claiming that they really acted responsibly and that the accident was not entirely their fault. The excuses they presented are truly sad and pathetic and show an amazing ignorance when it comes to industrial safety regulation and management.
For example, the Cairns Post writes:
A FAULTY switch and instruction manuals written entirely in Japanese have been blamed in court for why a ship owned by conservation group Sea Shepherd dropped up to 500 litres of diesel into the Trinity Inlet.”
Sorry, but using a piece of equipment that you do not understand is gross negligence. Sea Shepard’s motto here obviously was: Let’s just get this thing running (and safety be damned!)

It’s not for nothing that the fundamental industry standard for any piece of such equipment is: Be sure you have read the manual and have UNDERSTOOD it! The crew obviously could not read Japanese, let alone understand it. Here they should have requested a manual in English from the manufacturer, or at least shelled out the money for a translation, before recklessly attempting to put it into operation at sea. They should especially have at least understood the critical technical points dealing with fuel.
The Cairns Times reports that “a crew member named Gabor Nosty failed to manually flick the “low level” switch during a fuel transfer, despite being aware the switch was faulty.”
If that isn’t gross negligence, then I don’t what is. It is management’s responsibility to be sure that its personnel are qualified and trained to carry out the work they have been assigned to do. Most industrial norms and regulations aren’t there to harass companies, but to prevent accidents involving human life and health, property and the environment. The Sea Shepard crew ignored this entirely.
And not only could they not read the vessel’s operating manual, according to the Cairns Times the Sea Shepherd Australia had bought the ship from Japan a week earlier and “had yet to translate signage and manuals or repair the switch“. Again putting a piece of equipment into operation when its crucial safety signs cannot be read is extremely reckless. The crew can count themselves fortunate nothing much worse happened. We are not talking about a TV here, rather a large piece of industrial equipment with lots of power – with people on board – and all around you.
The article also writes that because the chief engineer did not have a manual they could understand, the crew “had to work out the ship’s systems ‘by his own devices’“. This means they were guessing its operational function. This is something you never should do. You wait for a manual you can read, then you read it, and make sure you’ve understood it. Then you can start to use it.
The article also writes that the crew included some Germans. My wife’s company does a lot of translations of German industrial manuals and handbooks. The Germans are gurus when it comes to industrial safety regulation, policy and management. If any one should understand industrial regulation and the importance of adhering to safety standards, it is the Germans. Obviously the Germans on the Sea Shepard crew did not complete a German apprenticeship, or they slept through it.
All the crew members came from an advanced technological country. It’s amazing how activists are always calling for more stringent safety regulations and environmental protection laws, yet they themselves can’t even adhere to the most rudimentary and obvious safety rules. It’s the Japanese manufacturer’s fault!
Despite all the Sea Shepard’s gross negligence, recklessness and disregard for human, property and environmental safety, it appears the crew will get off real easy.

"It’s a tricky thing to grow enough food for a ballooning population without destroying the natural world. And when I say a tricky thing, I mean it’s one of the greatest challenges humanity has ever faced. Luckily for us, it is theoretically possible, and the easiest way to get there is by drastically cutting down on meat. We deforest an area the size of Panama every single year. Across the world, food is the number one cause of deforestation, especially our taste for meat. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Researchers recently modelled how the world could feed itself in 2050 without converting any current forests into agriculture. They tested the outcome under 500 different scenarios that varied according to realistic assumptions on future yields, the area needed for farming, livestock feed and human diets. They found that “deforestation is not a biophysical necessity”. “While a wide range of feasible options to feed a no-deforestation world were found, many only worked under certain circumstances,” said Karl-Heinz Erb, lead author of the study, published in Nature Communications. For example, meat-heavy diets were not compatible with lower yields similar to those under organic farming, or under the potential negative effects of climate change. Of all the variables involved, the feasibility of feeding the world with no deforestation is more dependent on what we are eating, than on how well we farm. “The only diet found to work with all future possible scenarios of yield and cropland area, including 100% organic agriculture, was a plant-based one,” Erb said. Even better: if we all woke up vegan in 2050, we would require less cropland than we did in the year 2000. This could allow us to “reforest” an area around the size of the entire Amazon rainforest – somehow fitting considering 70-80% of deforestation in the Amazon is due to the livestock industry. In second place, the vegetarian diet was compatible with 94% of future no-deforestation scenarios. Going veggie would also save on cropland, allowing for an area around the size of India to return to nature. This land-saving makes sense when considering the conversion rate between the grain that we could have directly consumed but instead feed to livestock. For example, in the US, it takes an astounding 25kg of grain to produce 1kg of beef, pigs require a grain to meat ratio of 9:1 and chickens, relatively less wasteful, are 3:1. As renowned ecologist Hugh Possingham put it: “Just stop feeding grain to animals – don’t eat something that ate something that you could have eaten.” Plant-based diets are particularly impressive when compared to those that are rich in meat, which would require a 50% increase in global cropland area by 2050. In order to achieve this with a chance of no-deforestation, we’d have to convert lots of pasture to cropland and substantially increase yields, likely through using chemicals. But both conversion and intensification generally degrade ecosystems and lead to less biodiversity. Overall the new study found that a meat-eater requires at least double the resources of a vegan or vegetarian. The study also links to the basic availability of food, one of the main pillars of food security. As people, especially in the Western world, eat less meat, the global demand for grain is reduced – for example, the US could feed 800m people with the grain currently fed to livestock. Less meat consumption would mean more food is available in poorer countries which could enjoy becoming more self-sufficient. With other recent research showing that reducing our meat intake could result in two thirds less food-related CO2 emissions, and save millions of lives there are few excuses left to justify having meat at every meal. Most of all, this study brings some much needed good news. In a world where environmental issues are often overwhelmingly depressing, where it seems monopolies that are out of our grasp run the show, here we have a pathway to a healthier, greener and more equitable world. And it’s quite literally handed to us on a plate. As the researchers of the study noted: “We are cutting back on meat, mainly as a result of this study.” And that’s the beauty of this approach, it doesn’t have to be all or nothing, vegan or carnivore. Eating sparse amounts of meat, the path of the “carnesparsian”, can have a huge impact – on your own health and that of the planet. Do the forest a favour. On Earth Day 2016, why not pledge to eat for the planet and challenge yourself and your friends to have a meat-free May. This article was updated on April 26, 2016, to include more recent data on livestock deforestation in the Amazon."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s the title Die Achse Des Guten here bears at its website.
Few countries have spent as much as Germany on measures to reduce CO2 emissions. Today German website Die Achse Des Guten here links to a blurb appearing in German “intellectual” weekly Die Zeit here which unwittingly tells readers what Germany has gained for its 100-billion-euro investment in green energies so far: nothing!
DIE ZEIT writes:
Actually, the German government wanted to decrease the emissions of CO2 – also through the transition to renewable energy. However our chart shows the opposite is the case.
Greenhouse gas emissions have been increasing for three years in Germany, 1.2 percent for last year.”
The DIE ZEIT chart shows Germany emitted 913 million tonnes in 2009 (due in large part to the global financial crisis) with emissions rising steadily to 951 million tonnes in 2013. The lion’s share of Germany’s post 1990 reduction stems from the shutdown of dilapidated communist East Germany and it’s dinosauric industry.
For the taxpayers who may be angered by the lack of return on investment, 2014 may post a slight emissions drop…but not because of anything the government and the 100 billion euros have done, but because of the warm winter Germany saw this year.

"Re recent flooding (Johnson accused of lack of concern amid fears of further rainfall, 13 November), in March 1947, as a bitter, snowy winter gave way to spring, large areas of the Fens flooded. Attlee’s minister of agriculture, Tom Williams, rushed to the area and took personal charge. He dispatched a thousand troops, sent in hundreds of naval and other pumps, had light-gauge railway tracks laid and brought in amphibious troop carriers to fill in the breaches in river banks. The operation succeeded and Fen cabbages and potatoes saved Britons from hunger that autumn.  My father, a Fen farm manager and staunch Conservative, would sometimes declare “there’s no such thing as a good socialist”. But he would invariably add “except Tom Williams of course”. I doubt the present environment secretary will be similarly praised by political opponents living in the Don Valley in the years to come.Gerrard RavenTeddington, London • You say in your editorial (Global heating means a wetter UK, so after the clean-up must come change, 13 November) that “local flood defence schemes, as well as land use and planning decisions, will rightly be scrutinised once the waters have retreated”. A good place to start is the Environment Agency’s 2010 Don catchment flood management plan. One of the key messages for the Doncaster sub-area reads: “We need to make better use of the washlands and flood storage. This involves protecting the storage areas and available floodplain around Doncaster, which provide a route for floodwater during larger floods.” It seems that this advice has been widely ignored. Any inquiry has to establish whether the local authority encouraged building development or was powerless to oppose it.Chris WeeksVirginstow, Devon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"A pro-EU leaflet recently issued by the UK government caused controversy over the use of public funds for a political campaign. But even more scandalous was the fact that the leaflet made only one passing mention of climate change and none of wider environmental policy. The prime minister’s reform mandate was also notably quiet on the subject.  We should therefore welcome the latest report by the cross-party group of MPs who sit on parliament’s environmental audit committee (EAC). Their report on EU and UK environmental policy will do much to inform the debate on the June 23 EU membership referendum.  The environmental benefits of EU membership should be front and centre of any remain campaign: there’s widespread acceptance among experts that the union makes a huge difference. The UK was known as the dirty man of Europe in the 1970s and 80s and the EU is widely credited with helping clean up the national environment.  The EAC report is the third to be published since March reviewing the implications of the referendum for the UK’s environment, with all broadly similar in their conclusions. The Institute for European Environmental Policy think tank argued that the EU has been good for the UK’s environment and expressed concern over the prospects for habitats and birds in the event of a Brexit. A group of independent academic experts, including myself, also launched a report in April which, while not advocating a position, highlighted the risks of leaving the EU and suggested that on balance membership has been beneficial for the UK. The latest EAC report is similarly positive. So there exists a near-consensus on the value of EU membership across relevant environmental experts in academia, NGOs and parliament. But this does not necessarily reflect wider opinion among the political classes: there is no better indication of this than the fact that one member of the EAC, leading eurosceptic Peter Lilley, insisted that a dissenting report expressing his views be appended to the main document.  The calls from the Conservative backbenches for a bonfire of red tape have also often had EU environmental regulations in their sights, and a recent blog in the Economist even suggested that climate scepticism often goes hand-in-hand with euro-scepticism. It seems unlikely then that environmental arguments are going to change the mind of hardened eurosceptics. However these reports may provide food for thought for those who are more uncertain about their voting intentions. One clear finding emerging across the reports is that environmental policy benefits from transnational governance arrangements: pollution does not respect national borders and therefore mitigation of environmental problems requires cooperation across and between states. The EU provides a vehicle for such cooperation.  Dealing with environmental issues also requires clear targets and deadlines. The EU requires its members to set clear policies with strong enforcement mechanisms, which UK citizens can rely upon. For example, the UK government is currently facing legal action over failing to meet European air quality standards. EU policy also provides a degree of long term stability, and a more certain investment climate for the infrastructural development required to boost renewable energy or to secure better water quality through projects such as the Thames Tideway tunnel.   Finally the EAC report notes the degree of scepticism among those giving evidence that a UK government acting independently would maintain the same level of protection for the environment as that provided currently by the EU. Lilley picks up on the same point but is clearly more sanguine than his colleagues on the committee about the prospects of a UK outside the EU maintaining similar standards of protection.  Here then is the nub – and maybe the point upon which those who care about the environment may wish to base their decision on June 23. Who do you trust to keep the UK’s environment safe?"
"Have you ever watched a video of someone dangling far above the ground and found that your own hands started sweating? If not, watch this:  That’s an infamous Ukrainian urban climber known as “Mustang Wanted”. He’s part of a global “rooftopping” craze that has seen daredevils scale everything from The Shard in London, to Shanghai’s tallest building or an abandoned skyscraper-sized radio tower in a Russian forest.  The climbers never use safety ropes, and often dangle themselves off tiny ledges or bars. The videos and selfies they produce regularly go viral, and leading climbers have gathered huge social media followings.  If your palms are already sweating, you’re not alone. There’s even a reddit forum dedicated to these sorts of videos: r/sweatypalms.  People often have a physical response to watching others in peril, even though they themselves are in no physical danger. There are various reasons why your body responds like this in the absence of any real threat. Do you wince when someone is punched in a movie or squirm when someone is shamed or humiliated on screen? These reactions are triggered by empathy: feeling the same thing we believe someone else is feeling. Empathy allows us to put ourselves in someone else’s shoes. When someone says “I feel for you” they might be talking quite literally. Brain imaging studies have shown that there is a great deal of crossover in brain networks when we experience pain ourselves and when we observe others in pain. For instance, people shown videos of patients being injected in the mouth showed activation in many of the same parts of the brain as if they themselves were being injected in the mouth. So when we watch videos of people cycling down incredibly steep precipices or dangling from precarious overhangs, part of our physical nervousness on their behalf is because we are imagining ourselves in their situation and how scared we would be. Another contributing factor might be the fact that the sympathetic nervous system, which co-ordinates your “fight or flight” response, may not differentiate a great deal between real and not-real. Visual information that conveys a threat might be translated directly into feelings of anxiety or urgency, which in turn trigger responses such as muscle contractions or increased heart-rate. This has often been my experience after watching a horror film. Even when the movie itself has been laughable, with poor special effects and unconvincing acting, I often find myself double checking that the doors and windows are locked before going to bed. Tamar Gendler, a Yale University psychologist, has proposed that we have two cognitive states for reacting to events in the world. The first is our beliefs – those things that we explicitly believe to be true. I believe with considerable confidence that the protagonist of the movie will be okay in the end and that zombies will not subsequently come into my house and eat me. Gendler suggests however that there is also a second cognitive state: our “aliefs”. These states are triggered by associations, rather than consideration, and can be either conscious or unconscious. We feel uneasy even though there is no direct threat to us. Although our aliefs may differ from our beliefs, they trigger many of the same physical responses as a real threat such as trembling, sweating and anxiety. This is why I sit rigid on the edge of my seat while watching the climber dangling precariously from the top of the skyscraper with no apparent support. I believe he will be fine and that this video signals no threat to myself, but I alieve that some threat is occurring and my sympathetic nervous system responds accordingly.  Some observers have noted that their palms seem to sweat most specifically when watching climbing videos but not other scary videos where people are equally in danger. There is no real research into this but one possibility, if true, is that our palms sweat when watching climbing videos because of our evolutionary past. Eccrine glands are the major human sweat glands, distributed all over the body but found in highest concentration on the hands and feet (an average of 370 sweat glands per square centimetre on the palm). They provide cooling from evaporation during thermoregulation but also produce “emotional sweating” in response to stress, anxiety, pain and fear, independently of ambient temperature. Sweating in the palms is thought to have evolved as a fleeing reaction in mammals. Surprisingly, it has been shown to increase friction and prevent slipping when running or climbing in stressful conditions. These different theories converge to help explain why your palms might sweat when watching videos of others in perilous situations, particularly if those situations involve climbing or fleeing. The empathy network of the brain allows you to put yourself in someone else’s shoes, imaging how you would feel if you were in their situation. The alief network senses the supposed threat and activates the sympathetic nervous system. This in turn triggers physical threat responses such as nervousness and sweating.  Where the video shows someone climbing, for instance, this sweating may be especially evident on your palms and the soles of your feet, as eccrine glands that evolved to provide extra grip for climbing under stressful conditions are triggered by the alief that some climbing-related threat is afoot."
"The Liberal Democrats have pledged to plant 60m trees every year if they get into government, increasing the UK’s forest cover by 1m hectares by 2045. The party’s leader, Jo Swinson, will make a trip to Hampstead in north London on Saturday to plant a tree and set out proposals for what she described as the largest tree-planting programme in UK history.  The UK is one of the least forested countries in Europe, with just 10% of England covered by woodland, compared with 31% of France and 37% of Spain. According to figures published in June, tree-planting in England fell well short of targets in the previous year. Only 1,420 hectares (3,507 acres) of trees were planted in England in the year to March 2019, against the government’s target of 5,000 hectares. The Committee on Climate Change has said the UK would need to plant 1.5bn trees, equivalent to an area of 30,000 hectares every year, if it was to meet its net-zero carbon target. The Lib Dem initiative is part of the party’s plans to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 and to halve emissions by 2030 compared with today. At its autumn conference, Labour set out plans to work towards a net-zero carbon economy by 2030, two decades before the government’s legally binding 2050 target. Swinson said the party would take bold action to reduce carbon emissions as quickly as possible. “Our plan includes the largest tree-planting programme in UK history, which will green our towns and countryside to absorb damaging emissions,” she said. “This will help us reach net-zero emissions, and will nurture biodiversity, combat air pollution and improve public spaces.“It’s clear that the Conservative party doesn’t take climate change seriously. Only the Liberal Democrats have a radical plan to make a real impact in the fight against climate change and build a brighter future for our planet.” The Lib Dems have pledged to spend £6bn over the next parliament to increase tree-planting levels and to help fund the restoration of other natural carbon sinks, such as peatlands. The party plans to plant trees across the country, including in towns and cities, as well as supporting large afforestation initiatives such as the Northern Forest. Last year the government pledged £5.7m to kickstart the creation of a northern forest that would stretch from Liverpool to Hull. The plans, led by the Woodland Trust, include the planting of 50m trees along a 120-mile stretch of land running next to the M62."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s proof that mainstream media journalism is either sloppy and just too lazy to check the data themselves, or is catatonically stuck in their now 18-year long illusion of global warming.
Recently a number of leading media outlets trumpeted (loudly) scary claims of “accelerating polar ice melt”. For example last May Germany’s leading online financial daily Handelsblatt cited a NASA study appearing in the Geophysical Research Letters and reported: “Polar ice melting much faster than assumed“, and warned of sea levels rising more than a meter.

Antarctica sets satellite-era all time record high sea ice extent. Source: sunshinehours.wordpress.com
It’s obvious that neither journalists and nor NASA scientists have been looking at what is really happening. Antarctica has spent much of the current year smashing one daily maximum sea ice record after another. Today we see that Antarctic sea ice has totally smashed the all-time satellite-era record (see chart above). So far not a peep on that from the German mainstream media.

Instead it’s been all about meltdown. Citing the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Bremerhaven, German news weekly Stern wrote: “The ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are melting at record speed, according to satellite measurements.”
Let’s wait and see if the reality-disconnected Stern will report on the record Antarctic sea ice in the days and weeks ahead. In the meantime we just have to think they and the AWI are really reporting on a different planet, one perhaps made of cheese.
Last month Spiegel here cited a study by Heinrich Miller of the AWI and reported that “both polar caps are melting more rapidly than originally thought“.
Obviously the record high ice extent at the South Pole hasn’t made an impression on Spiegel. To be fair, when the reader wades deeper into the Spiegel article, we find out that the rapid south polar melting they write ABOUT is actually restricted to the West Antarctic Ice Shelf, an area that is only 1% of Antarctica’s total surface area and not representative of the South Pole.
As the chart above indicates, we can expect to see more smashed all-time records in the days ahead. It will be interesting to see if the media and scientists remain in their 18-year long catatonic state of a melting and warming planet illusion.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere Joe is talking about record highs!
Weatherbell Analytics meteorologist Joe Bastardi, a person studying and observing the weather for some 40 years, says in his latest Saturday Summary that global sea ice this year has a pretty good chance of setting a new record high since satellite measurements began.

Image cropped from Weatherbell Analytics May 10, 2014 Saturday Summary. 
At the 8:14 mark Joe starts talking about global sea ice. He shows how the current high Antarctic levels, should they continue, combined with the projected Arctic positive anomaly could result in a new record high.
What’s going to happen if the Antarctic maintains this very very robust anomaly here, and the Arctic actually goes above normal? What’s going to happen? Well, there’s the possibility we’re going to break the all-time global sea ice records.”
I beg your pardon! How can that be? Supposedly we have record global warming taking place. How can sea ice be rebounding with abandon if it’s getting warmer and warmer. It’s not adding up, folks.

Gore about to be humiliated
Joe then reminds his viewers of Al Gore’s 2007 prediction, and chides the former VP:
This is the summer that former vice president Al Gore back in 2007 said that this was the summer that the Arctic ice cap could disappear.”
Also in the summary Joe dumps a good amount of cold water on the probability the earth is going to see a very powerful 1997-like El Nino event, showing that the current circumstances in the Pacific are very different from those of 1997. So the chances of seeing a new annual, global record high temperature, something the warmists have been waiting 16 years to see, are diminishing.
2014 could see record high global temperature – with near record high sea ice?
On a new global temperature record this year, we have to keep in mind that there are a half dozen or so datasets tallying global temperature, and so we have to expect that at least one of them will be corrupt enough to concoct a new all-time record no matter what happens – mark my words. Ironically, this could be the year where we see both a “record warm” planet with near or even record global sea ice. Go figure that one out!
That’s climate science!

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman reggae and hip hop musician Pierre Fox presents a revealing interview (in German) with Prof. Dr. Hans Schellnhuber (28 June 2014).
When it comes to the progress of the green movement and the Great Transformation, the Potsdam Professor appears deflated and demoralized.

No matter what one may think of the German Godfather of climate alarmism, Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber is always fascinating to watch, never failing to deliver comments worth quoting. He’s the professor that once claimed that glo´bal temperature changed linearly with atmospheric CO2 change, and said that the planet would explode with 9 billion people. He also said that a population of 1 billion be an acceptable level.
Like a doomsday “asteroid collision in slow motion”
Already at the 0:14 mark after having said what a unbelievable privilege it is to work at the Potsdam Institute he states:
One day our eyes opened: “Oh! I’m now researching on aspects of the greatest problem facing mankind in the 21st century. And this conviction hardened. Yes, this is the greatest problem of the 21st century.”
At the 1:12 mark Schellnhuber spectacularly piles on the dramatization when it comes to characterizing the seriousness of global warming, comparing it to an approaching asteroid collisions with the earth.
I compare it to an asteroid colliding with the earth in slow motion, yes. If scientists said an asteroid is on a path toward the earth and that we have 20 years to build a defense system, we probably would all start to do everything we could and build away, and wouldn’t care if it cost 50 billion or a thousand billion. But when I say an asteroid is approaching, and that it is called global warming, but the strike will be over 100 years, everyone asks, ‘So what?’. […] Mankind has a hard time planning 20 or 30 years ahead.”
Here we need to conduct a survey of scientists: “Do you believe global warming is as serious as an earth-shattering asteroid strike?” I seriously doubt many scientists would share Professor Schellnhuber’s earth’s doomsday paranoia.
Democracy as an obstacle
On whether politicians are doing enough, Schellnhuber thinks they are moving slowly, but says that new systems of doing things often take time to unfold. But once they are 20 or 30% in place a tipping point is reached, and there is nothing to stop the shift to the new system. As an example at the 3:42 mark he gleefully cites the fact that share prices of Germany’s major power producers have collapsed.

Ten years ago that was unimaginable. …Suddenly this quaint little feed-in act had an effect. It was just a toy from green politicians.”
Schellnhuber places his optimism in system change and not in political progress. He views gradual political movement and compromise as obstacles to progress. No surprise here, Schellnhuber was never a fan of democracy by independently thinking citizens.
At the 4:44 mark when asked what individuals can do, the Potsdam professor says, “We need societal forces that aim to achieve justice…climate change is an extremely unjust matter, yes…forces that are based on values, the protection of creation – if I want to be religious, and so on. Otherwise we just aren’t going to be able to build the political pressure.”
Conferences: most “frustrating and tiring events ” in the world
Prof. Schellnhuber is clearly frustrated that climate policy has bogged down, and says the UN climate conferences are probably the most “frustrating and tiring events in the world”.
Later in the interview viewers can witness the sort of nonsense that is produced when a climate professor and a reggae singer discuss economics in an exchange. Schellnhuber believes that divestment could be an effective strategy, if only it were possible to convince investors that oil, gas, and coal are dangerous to the planet. Schellnhuber doesn’t seem to be aware that investment in wind parks and solar systems have already failed.
Slowly one begins to perceive that Prof Schellnhuber is on another planet (one that is about to be hit by an asteroid and where renewable energy works). His solution to get things moving: Get the population to think like he does, and only then will they invest in green energies. He then blames the “inner laziness” of the population to do the right thing, and says that “perhaps we need regulations, laws…compulsion.”
Resigned and frustrated, Schellnhuber spurned by Merkel
At latter stages of the interview, at the 10:20 mark, having worked himself up, Schellnhuber displays a combination of frustration and resignation…as if the human population were hopeless. At the 10:34 mark Schellnhuber contemplates that if only Obama could be re-elected again, and if “Merkel did not run for fourth term“. Here Schellnhuber de facto confirms what some of us have already began to suspect: Merkel has stopped listening to him and the Potsdam scientists.
The only hope left for the climate movement, Schellnhuber summarizes, is great leadership coming from somewhere. “A few climate Ghandis wouldn’t be bad.”
The warmists are becoming demoralized.

"The Indus is one of Asia’s mightiest rivers. From its source in the northwestern foothills of the Himalayas, it flows through the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir and along the length of Pakistan to the Arabian Sea. The river and its five tributaries together make up the Indus Basin, which spans four countries and supports 215m people.  Yet fast-growing populations and increasing demand for hydropower and irrigation in each country means the Indus is coming under intense pressure.  India and Pakistan, the two main countries in the basin, divided up rights to the various tributaries under the Indus Water Treaty of 1960 (IWT). The IWT has survived various wars and other hostilities between the two countries, and as such it is largely considered a success. Today, however, the treaty is increasingly faced with challenges it wasn’t designed to deal with. For instance, India recently fast-tracked approval for several major dams along the Chenab, a 900km-long tributary of the Indus that was originally allotted to Pakistan under the IWT. This follows several other contentious dams already being built on shared rivers including Kishanganga, on the Jhelum River, which was also allotted to Pakistan.  Under the IWT, India does indeed have a right to “limited hydropower generation” upstream on the western tributaries allotted to Pakistan, including the Chenab and the Jhelum. However, many in Pakistan worry that even though these proposed dams may individually abide by the technical letter of the treaty, their effects will add up downstream.  Because the treaty does not provide a definitive solution, the two countries have frequently sought time-consuming and expensive international arbitration. From time to time, Pakistan has raised concerns and asked for intervention on the storage capacity of Indian dams planned on shared rivers allotted to Pakistan under the IWT. Basin countries have also not been forthcoming in sharing data and announcing planned hydropower projects ahead of time. Other challenges are completely outside the scope of the treaty. First, global warming will raise the sea level and make Himalayan glaciers, the ultimate source of the Indus, melt ever faster. Dangerous flooding is expected to become more frequent and more severe. Climate change is also expected to affect monsoon patterns in South Asia, and could result in less rainfall for India and Pakistan. This could be disastrous as summer monsoon rainfall provides 90% of India’s total water supply. Moreover, the basin’s watershed area has suffered tremendous environmental degradation and massive deforestation on both sides of Kashmir, leading to a decrease in the annual water yield.  The IWT is silent on all this. Currently, there is no institutional framework or legal instrument for addressing the effects of climate change on water availability in the Indus Basin. India and Pakistan also share an important aquifer – essentially a vast pool of underground water covering an area of 16.2m hectares across both countries. This “groundwater” helps support the huge population in the Indus region, accounting for 48% of all water withdrawals in the basin.  But far more water is being taken out each year than is replenished by rain and other recharge sources. One recent study said the Indus was the most overstressed major aquifer in the world, thanks to population growth and development pressures in both countries. Despite this, the 1960 treaty also does not have any clause to deal with transboundary aquifers, and there are no agreed rules for the allocation and management of shared groundwater. As with most of Asia’s great rivers, the Indus ultimately begins on the Tibetan plateau, in Chinese territory. India currently has no treaty with upstream China on their shared rivers. How that relationship develops will determine India’s future water availability and in turn how India behaves towards downstream Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistan and Afghanistan have no water sharing agreement for the Kabul River, an important tributary of the Indus which supplies up to 17% of Pakistan’s total water. As Afghanistan strives to develop its hydropower, with the help of Indian finance, this could instigate a whole new conflict on the Indus itself. The authors of the Indus Water Treaty can’t be blamed for not anticipating climate change, huge population growth or modern hydropower issues. The treaty was drawn up in the 1950s, after all. The IWT does have a clause for “future cooperation” which allows the two countries to expand the treaty to address recent challenges like climate-induced water variability or groundwater sharing. But the historical trust deficit between the two countries has prevented meaningful dialogue. But it is clear that these new challenges require all countries in the basin to acknowledge their dependence on each other and discuss joint solutions. Expanding the water sharing agreement to include Afghanistan and China would be a start. Including these two countries, especially China, would also help to address the power asymmetry between India and Pakistan and pave the way for a more holistic sharing agreement over the Indus waters."
"A potentially deadly disease affecting marine mammals, including seals and sea otters, has been passed from the North Atlantic Ocean to the northern Pacific thanks to the melting of the Arctic sea ice. Experts have long been concerned that sea ice melting in the northern oceans, caused by global climate heating, could allow previously geographically limited diseases to be transmitted between the two oceans.  Now scientists believe they have identified how an outbreak of distemper, similar to that suffered by dogs, was passed from northern seal populations to Alaskan seals and sea otters . “There’s long been concern that melting Arctic sea ice could allow disease to pass between the Atlantic and the Pacific,” Tracey Goldstein, an expert in marine animal diseases at the University of California, Davis, and one of the lead authors of a report, said. “Now here we are.” Phocine distemper virus, or PDV, has long been a threat to seal populations in the northern Atlantic, along with several strains of influenza, but had not previously been identified in the Pacific. It was first recognised in 1988 following a massive epidemic in harbour and grey seals in north-western Europe with a second event of similar magnitude and extent in 2002. The 1988 outbreak killed thousands of Britain’s seals. The virus attacks the immune system, leaving animals susceptible to pneumonia and in the most severe cases can kill a seal within 10 days of infection. The two outbreaks, which both started on the Danish island of Anholt in the Kattegat strait, killed about 23,000 harbour seals in 1988 and 30,000 seals in 2002. The virus is believed to spread through contact between infected individuals and has killed animals in the waters of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the UK and Germany. The new study, published in the journal Nature Communications, based its conclusions on samples taken from seals, sea lions and sea otters in Alaska between 2001 and 2016, finding that PDV had become entrenched in Alaskan waters. “Concern was first raised that PDV could be infecting Alaska’s sea otters so we decided to look at whether it had been transmitted via overlapping populations of seals and sea lions,” said Goldstein. “When we started testing the different species the sequence of the virus was always the same strain, with incidence peaking when the sea was open.” The research was prompted by mounting concern in recent years that the virus could reach the Pacific via a warming Arctic and infect the large Pacific harbour seal and northern elephant seal populations or the endangered Hawaiian monk seals. Genetic sampling of the disease also established that the same strain identified in the Atlantic had emerged in Alaska, with peaks of the disease correlating to periods of low sea ice. The study tested more than 2,000 animals from a variety of species in Alaska’s waters from the northern Beaufort Sea in the Arctic to more temperate southern areas. The report warns of the potential for other diseases to be spread as sea ice recedes. “Climate change-driven reductions in sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean are projected to increase and open-water routes along the northern Russian coast have occurred every August and/or September since 2008. “The health impacts of this new normal in the Arctic are unknown, but association of open-water routes through Arctic sea ice with increased PDV exposure or infection suggests that opportunities for PDV and other pathogens to cross between North Atlantic and North Pacific marine mammal populations may become more common,” it said. One of the concerns about the disease’s path from the North Atlantic to the Pacific is that it is unclear what impact it will have on infected species. While some may have a natural resistance to the disease, others may be more vulnerable, with the deadly 1988 outbreak in Europe believed to have been caused initially by an infected harbour seal from Greenland where the disease has long been endemic and the population has built up resistance."
"The world’s sea level is expected to rise by up to 82cm by the end of the century. Some areas of the world, such as the north-east coast of North America and the Western Pacific, will be more affected than others. But in many places this will mean floods are more likely, the cost of coastal protection will rise, and coastal ecosystems will be put in danger. Yet it isn’t just the average sea level that will rise. The biggest risks will come from the fact that the highest sea levels (caused by high tides and weather) will also increase by at least as much as the mean. This is what are seeing so far in many parts of the world. A potential increase in the frequency and severity of storms could make higher sea-level extremes and their impact even worse. More violent storms could also produce more energetic and higher waves, testing the resilience of ships and offshore structures like oil rigs and disrupting trade. But how serious will these problems be? Computer models of climate change caused by greenhouse warming indicate that the most devastating tropical cyclones will be between 2% and 11% more intense by 2100. The same models also indicate there will be fewer tropical cyclones overall but more high-intensity cyclones. This leaves us with a rather unclear picture that is further complicated because scientists disagree on whether and how tropical cyclones have been changing over the past 30 or 40 years.  The role of regional climate patterns like the El Niño cycle of wind and sea temperature changes in the Pacific and the monsoons in the Indian Ocean also add to this complexity. Although we expect climate change to influence these phenomena, they also vary significantly from year to year naturally, making it very challenging to say if any particular extreme event is driven by climate change. Research we conduct with several collaborators involves examining changes in extreme waves and sea-level records to identify factors that contribute to changes in extremes. This information can then be used to improve computer models of sea level in the hope of making this picture clearer. As mentioned, sea level extremes have generally been found to change in line with the observed mean sea level trends. But changes in extremes are also caused by changes in the tides, in the seasonal cycle, in currents in the ocean, and the number of the typhoons impacting on land. We found that each of these factors affected the areas studied (the Mediterranean Sea, the Caribbean Sea, and the North Sea) by a different degree. We also found that these factors were not all related to climate change or natural variability. For example, significant changes in the extremes at the Chinese coasts are linked to changes in regional tides thought to be related to the extensive land reclamation going on to create more space for building. This kind of human influence is distinct from climate change but just as important to the local environment. Other partners worked on improving the parameters of models of tropical cyclones. This confirmed that previous models underestimated sea level extremes. But what this also means is that climate models that are much less detailed aren’t good enough to produce firm conclusions on whether climate change will increase extreme ocean activity. For example, we know that wave heights in the North Atlantic have increased, partly due to changes in regional atmospheric patterns. But for the Norwegian Sea, the increase has been much smaller since 2000 than previously recorded. If we want to understand how marine extremes will change in the future, we need to look at each location individually and take into account the specific factors that will affect its extreme ocean activity. We also need more detailed global and regional climate models and a clearer understanding of cyclonic systems to be able to predict changes in the severity and the pathways of cyclones and how they affect extreme activity. Other environmental factors that could become more extreme, such as temperature, salt levels, oxygen content, acidity and current speeds will also be important in determining the impacts of climate change on the marine environment. But the data we have now doesn’t allow us to do such comprehensive analyses. Until we have a clearer picture, we won’t know just how extreme our oceans will become as the climate changes."
"Tribal leaders, fishermen and environmentalists from Alaska will testify before Congress on Wednesday in an effort to save America’s biggest national forest – the latest battle against the Trump administration’s assault on environmental protections. The Tongass national forest, one of the world’s last intact temperate rainforests which plays a crucial role in fighting the climate crisis, is under threat of logging as Alaska seeks exemption from the Roadless Rule, which protects millions of acres of pristine forests across the US. The Tongass is considered the “crown jewel” of the national forest system, sequestering huge amounts of carbon dioxide to keep the greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere. The Roadless Rule prevents mass clearcutting of trees in undeveloped forested areas and is seen as one of the most broadly supported environmental protections in the US. Donald Trump has reportedly intervened in the Alaska case, raising fears that other states with strong extractive industry lobbying machines will seek to fast-track similar exemptions without properly consulting communities on the impact that felling trees in wilderness areas will have. “There are indications that many other states are watching to see what happens with Alaska, which has shown us how this administration is blindly following whatever industry, corporations and lobbyists want without thinking about future generations,” said Blaine Miller-McFeeley, senior legislative representative at the legal not-for-profit Earthjustice. Wednesday’s hearing by the natural resources subcommittee on national parks, forests and public land (NPFPL) will hear evidence on the potentially devastating consequences for the Tongass and its people. “We’ve been here for thousands of years. These are our lands and we depend on the Tongass for food security,” Joel Jackson, 63, president of the organized village of Kake, said. “Tribes everywhere are worried and watching very closely at what they’re trying to do in Alaska,” added Jackson, who will testify. “Tourism and commercial fishing run this region economically, not timber, which is a pathetically small sector,” said Lance Preston, 47, a fisherman and board member of the Seafood Producers Cooperative in Sitka. “The salmon already faces challenges from ocean acidification and warming … A very small minority stands to gain economically by being very irresponsible.” Stretching 16m acres over 500 miles, the Tongass is unique in its size and biodiversity, with thousands of islands, waterways, glacial fjords and green valleys flanked by rugged mountains and sprawling forests of old-growth cedar, spruce and hemlock trees. It is home to myriad species including wild Pacific salmon, brown bears, wolves, Sitka black-tailed deer and bald eagles, and attracts more than a million visitors annually. The Roadless Rule was adopted during the Clinton administration after an extensive public consultation, in which 96% of the 1 million participants nationwide supported protection for unspoiled forests. Since then Alaska has fought the regulation, but its efforts to roll back the protection have been repeatedly thwarted in Congress and the courts. Then, the state’s petition for an exemption was granted by the Department of Agriculture in August 2018 without consulting any tribal nations. The state was given $2m in federal funds by the Forest Service (FS) to help facilitate dialogue about six potential outcomes ranging from no change to full exemption. At least 10% of this money was given to the Alaska Forest Association – a timber industry group – to aid their participation in the process, according to documents obtained by KTOO.  The Angoon Cooperative Association, Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes, Hoonah Indian Association, Hydaburg Cooperative Association, organized village of Kake and organized village of Kasaan – which all have roots in the Tongass dating back thousands of years – were belatedly offered a seat at the table as “cooperating agencies” alongside the state in the review process. The tribes say they were not given any financial support leaving them scrambling to make sense of complex long document. Their requests for extensions were repeatedly denied. In June, Trump held a private meeting with Alaska’s governor, Mike Dunleavy, on Air Force One. Shortly after, Trump instructed the agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, to grant a full exemption, according to the Washington Post.  Last month, a full exemption, opening the door for the logging industry to bulldoze roads and clearcut trees over 9m acres, was recommended in the draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In response, tribal leaders wrote to Perdue condemning the federal government’s rushed and unfair handling of the proposed exemption, which they said “represents the most controversial and potentially destructive assault on our way of life to date”.  In the Tongass, the tribes mostly live on isolated islands, relying on salmon fishing, deer, moose, grouse and berries. This traditional diet remains extremely important amid rising food prices and cuts to ferry services. “All communities deserve to have access to the resources they rely on for subsistence, but this administration has gone out of its way to change the rules for their friends who seek to profit off those resources,” said the New Mexico congresswoman Deb Haaland, chair of the NPFPL. In May, fellow committee member and Arizona congressman Ruben Gallego, and the Washington senator Maria Cantwell, senior member of the Senate energy and natural resources committee, introduced legislation to codify the Roadless Rule in order to permanently protect millions of acres of pristine national forests. The 2019 Roadless Area Conservation Act would prevent state exemptions to the rule, which nationwide protects habitats for 1,600 threatened or endangered species, reduces wildfire risk and supplies clean drinking water to 60 million Americans and 350 communities across the US. “The administration continues to try to solve 21st-century problems with 19th-century thinking, trying to extract a relatively small amount from our few remaining pristine natural areas,” said Cantwell. Nationally, public support for the Roadless Rule remains strong: a Pew poll in March of this year found three-quarters of respondents want protections to remain in place. Locally, the vast majority of south-east Alaska’s 32 native and white communities also support the current roadless protection.  But the Alaska congressman Don Young, the Republican leader of the NPFPL, believes the Roadless Rule has been a “disaster” for his home state. He has been working closely with Trump, senior White House staff and the rest of the Alaska delegation to secure an exemption. “Congressman Young believes an exemption is needed to not only boost the economy of south-east Alaska, but to bolster the long-term health of the Tongass national forest by promoting active resource management,” a spokesperson said. The rule already allows for individual exemptions: in Alaska, every single request for the Tongass to date – more than 50 – for projects such as mines and dams has been approved. Dunleavy’s office did not respond to requests for comment, but has previously blamed the rule for destroying logging and thousands of jobs. The timber industry contributes less than 1% to the south-east Alaska economy, compared with 25% by the fishing and tourism industries combined. Tongass waterways produce 80% of the commercial salmon annually harvested from south-east Alaska, valued at $60m. The FS has lost almost $600m on Tongass timber sales over the last 20 years, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense.  The FS is legally obliged to take into account public opinion before making its final decision, which is expected in mid-2020. If it is fully repealed as Alaskan Republicans want, 5m acres of the Chugach national forest, which is second only to the Tongass in roadless acreage, could also be threatened, according to the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council. In both forests, vital food sources and Native cultural and sacred sites are at risk. “If we didn’t have wild food to eat, we would be starving right now. We are living in virtual poverty because of the systems of government,” said Wanda Culp, a Tlingit advocate for the Tongass in Hoonah. “The Roadless Rule is just the latest example of how we jump through hoops but get nowhere – there is no due process for indigenous communities. We are nuisance communities standing in the way of industry profits.”"
"On my official UN visit to Norway in September, I found inspiring examples of leadership on climate change. I encountered a nearly emissions-free electricity system, the highest share of zero-emission vehicle sales in the world (almost half of all new cars sold are fully electric), and billions of dollars being invested in a Green Climate Fund that provides support to developing countries, as well as a burgeoning Climate and Forest Initiative. However, Norway continues to explore for oil and gas at a time when the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that meeting the vital 1.5C target in the Paris agreement requires that the majority of existing fossil fuel reserves cannot be burned.  The Norwegian paradox is that its leadership on some aspects of climate action is undermined by its continued dependence on a large fossil fuel industry. Norway, as one of the world’s wealthiest nations and a leading producer of oil and gas, has a responsibility to lead efforts in mitigation, adaptation and, to some degree at least, compensation for the loss and damage caused by those products. It is this Norwegian paradox that is currently under scrutiny in the court of appeal in Oslo. In a high-profile lawsuit filed in 2016, Greenpeace Nordic and Norway’s Nature and Youth organisation argued that the government is violating the rights of present and future generations to a safe and healthy environment by continuing to issue licences to petroleum companies, enabling them to explore for new oil reserves. In the first week of the appeal hearing, we heard that the Norwegian government challenges elements of established climate science and maintains its argument that Norway is justified in continuing to search for new oil in the vulnerable Arctic region. In 2018, the district court confirmed that the right to a healthy environment is an enforceable human right protected by article 112 of Norway’s constitution. The government has a legal obligation to respect, protect and fulfil this fundamental human right. However, the judge accepted the government’s claim that Norway has no responsibility for carbon emissions resulting from burning Norwegian oil and gas outside of Norway. Hence the appeal by the environmental organisations. From a climate change perspective, it is irrelevant where on Earth fossil fuels are burned. The emissions exacerbate the global climate emergency. There is no such thing as clean coal or clean oil, only varying degrees of dirty. Earlier this year an Australian court recognised this reality in overturning the approval of a new coal mine. The court acknowledged that the government needed to consider not only the climate impacts of digging up the coal, but also the emissions produced eventually by burning it, regardless of where in the world combustion occurred. The judge concluded that the proposed mine was in “the wrong place at the wrong time”. There is no doubt that major oil producers like Norway are fuelling the global climate emergency and contributing to a wide range of human rights violations across the planet. These human rights impacts fall primarily upon small island developing states and lesser developed countries. It is a staggering injustice that the world’s poorest people, who have made virtually no contribution to causing climate change, are paying the highest costs. Were it not for the enormous carbon emissions, I would suggest that every Norwegian travel to a nation like Fiji or Dominica to see the damage that has been caused. I visited Vunidogoloa, one of the first communities in the world to be relocated because of rising sea levels, storm surges and salinisation of their water and farmland, as well as impoverished informal settlements on the outskirts of Fijian cities, populated by people whose homes were destroyed by Cyclone Winston in 2016. These communities lack adequate sanitation facilities, and regular flooding is causing outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as cholera. Winston was the strongest storm ever to reach land in the southern hemisphere, inflicting damage equal to about 31% of Fiji’s GDP. And in Dominica, two hurricanes in the past five years have damaged more than 90% of buildings at a cost of more than three times its GDP. The Fiji and Dominica examples are the tip of the iceberg of human rights violations caused by the climate crisis. In the future, as global temperatures rise, these violations will only worsen. The Norwegian government must not then ignore its global responsibility for the emissions from the oil and gas it exports. Climate change impacts are even more severe today than in 2016 when Norway became the first industrialised country to ratify the Paris agreement. Time is running out. The world needs Norway to demonstrate climate leadership by ending exploration for additional oil and gas reserves, stopping further expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure, and protecting the fragile Arctic. By harnessing its immense wealth and ingenuity, Norway could lead the world in demonstrating how to achieve a just and equitable transition to a fossil-free economy. • David Boyd is the UN special rapporteur on the environment and human rights"
"We know that mindfulness can transform the life of an individual. But did you know it could also change the world? We are facing increasingly complex global challenges, of which climate change is perhaps the most important. It is obvious that we must do something about our carbon emissions and the increase in floods, windstorms, and heatwaves that threaten our environment – but we don’t seem to know what.  It is becoming clear, however, that the problem can’t simply be solved by new technology or new governments alone. We also need to develop new social practices and encourage a broader cultural shift towards more sustainable living and climate action. We have to completely rethink how we do things. This is where mindfulness comes in. Mindfulness is the psychological process of bringing one’s attention to the present moment. It is more than just moment-to-moment awareness. It is a kind, curious and non-judgemental awareness that helps us relate to ourselves, others, and our environment with compassion. Mindfulness can be developed through meditation and other contemplative practices, such as yoga and deep listening. It is increasingly used in various professional fields and disciplines. In 2016, 14 times more academic articles used the term as did in 2006. Mindfulness is often summed up with the phrase “be here now”. We can all be mindful; it’s rooted in our consciousness, and it’s associated with greater emotional intelligence. Neuroscientists think that mindfulness can literally rewire our brains. As I show in my own research, mindfulness can not only change how we think about the social and environmental crises that affect our world, but can also help us to take the actions needed to build a more sustainable society. Mindfulness can influence our response to crises, including climate change. It does this for instance by modifying how people process information about risks, changing their environmental behaviour, and by increasing their motivation to reduce suffering and support governments’ climate actions. Reasons include the influence of mindfulness on compassion for both people and nature, and on understanding complexity. Mindfulness can also increase our ability to cope with the impact of climate change. Studies have shown that mindfulness can be used to help not only the victims, but also everyone else involved in a disaster. Post-traumatic stress affects groups such as emergency workers, firefighters, police, military, volunteers, and communities that host disaster victims; mindfulness can help them reduce that stress. It can make people better able to cope with stress and adapt to new circumstances, by minimising automatic, habitual, or impulsive reactions and increasing cognitive flexibility. Mindfulness can also encourage us to be more aware of social justice and injustice, and more sensitive to context. It can help cultivate compassion and our intrinsic moral values which, in turn, can be reflected in actions for the common good.  This links to climate change as global warming has environmental and health consequences, which disproportionately affect low-income countries and poor people in high-income countries, who must be protected. Climate adaptation measures must not create new problems or make existing problems worse. Mindful thinking can lead people to consider the consequences of unquestioned structures and power relations, at all scales from petty disputes in the workplace to global issues.  Hence, mindfulness can also change organisations from within. In times of climate change, sustainable organisations need to nurture and develop their social assets in the anticipation of, and to cope with, unexpected risky events. It does this by influencing people’s job satisfaction and organisational learning, and by improving their cognitive flexibility and openness to novelty. This can encourage organisations to constantly probe their environment for ways to stay ahead through innovation.  Yet despite the obvious benefits, researchers have been slow to assess the potential of mindfulness and other contemplative practices for transformation. Bodies such as the United Nations have been more proactive. The United Nations office which co-ordinates global climate action (the UNFCCC), asked the Buddhist leader Thich Nhat Hanh to provide a statement ahead of the Paris climate summit in late 2015, for instance. My research shows that mindfulness and global sustainability are more connected than we think, but we need to know more about the link between them. It’s high time to explore the practical impact that contemplative practices such as mindfulness can have on sustainability, and how we can tap into this potential to drive global change."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot only is North America bracing for a possible near record-setting cold blast from the Arctic, but also Siberia has been reporting massive snow cover and widespread cold. It’s only the first half of November and the dead of winter is still two months away!

The CO2 blanket having no effect in Siberia. Image source: earth.nullschool.net729.
This, experts have been warning, bodes ill for the chances of a harsh winter over North America and Europe. Two weeks ago Siberan snow cover and cold was already close to record high levels. That situation has only gotten worse, the Big Wobble Almanac here writes:
Remember how evidence was mounting last month that early snowfall was accumulating across Siberia? And remember how there’s a theory that says this snowfall signals a cold winter? So in the two and a half weeks since, the news for the winter-haters has, unfortunately, only gotten worse.
About 14.1 million square kilometers of snow blanketed Siberia at the end of October, the second most in records going back to 1967, according to Rutgers snow lab.”
There are other signs that Europe could be facing a cold winer, although so far early on it has seen weeks of very mild weather. The online prfire writes:
The first migrating Siberian swans landed in Britain – heralding the belated arrival of winter. Each year around 300 Bewick swans flock to the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust reserve at Slimbridge, Glos after flying 2,500 from Arctic Russia. This year’s arrival – coinciding with the first cold snap of the season – is the latest for 45 years and more than two weeks ahead of usual. […]
The Bewicks – the smallest and rarest members of the swan family – live in Siberia during the summer. In winter they migrate west – aided by chilling easterly winds – to escape winter temperatures of -25 degrees C.
Bewick’s have migrated to Slimbridge every winter for 60 years and adult swans teach their young the route. Their arrival comes after weather experts predicted the harshest winter in 100 years. James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, said last week: “The worst case and more plausible scenario could bring something on a similar par to the winter of 2009/10. ‘That was the coldest in 31 years, or an event close to 2010/11 which experienced the coldest December in 100 years.'”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe intense but short heat wave that struck parts of Central Europe earlier this month created quite a bit of hysteria among some German activist climatologists and most of the media.
For example IPCC climatologist Mojib Latif attributed the heat and severe thunderstorms to global warming. Stefan Rahmstorf tried to hint this may be the case, but had to concede there was no real data to back it up.
DWD dismisses connection to climate warming
Now the DWD German Weather Service has made it’s opinion public on the matter. At his climate blog at online flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, journalist Joachim Müller-Jung writes, “It does not suffice to attribute the heat records to climate change” and he quotes the official DWD spokesman Gerhard Lux:
It may suit our imaginative world of the consequences of climate warming, but we are sticking to the principle that you cannot craft a climate statistic from one singular extreme weather situation.”
We’ll remember that when the next storm or hurricane hits. Good to see that Germany’s national weather service, the DWD, is keeping its sanity and dismisses the link between singular extreme weather events and climate change. 
Heat records show no climate trend

Müller-Jung then adds:
The hot ‘African air’ produced record temperatures exclusively in southern Germany, already in Hessen or North Rhine Westphalia [Central Germany] there was not a single heat record. From heat records, which happen every few years and thus are too seldom as a whole, it still is not possible to discern a climate trend.”
In northwest Germany where I live, the temperature did not even reach the 30°C mark. So the intense heat was not only short, but it was rather local/regional as well.
Lux does note, however, that the frequency of heavy rainfall events (more than 30 mm) has risen. (That may have more to do with decadal cycles).
When asked why journalists have the feeling storms are more frequent, Lux says it is because people are far better networked today and every storm gets instantly communicated everywhere.
In earlier times no one gave a rat’s ass about a storm way out in East Hicksville, except the Hicksvillers. By the time the dramatic Hicksville pictures reached the audience in other places, it was already old news. That’s not the case today.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Austrian online Kronen Zeitung here has an article about something most German-language media outlets have been too red-faced to report on: The sudden growth in polar sea ice.
The Kronen Zeitung opens with:
A huge growth in ice at the poles has surprised scientists and is casting questions. Is global warming taking a break? […] For the prophets of climate change the new figures pose questions: At the poles of Mother Earth, in complete contradiction to prognoses of a complete polar melt, there is an ice growth like one not seen in decades.”
Almost the entire mainstream media has been quiet about this development. So it is refreshing to see that some media are reporting the “good” news that the planet is not warming alarmingly.
Antarctic ice growth “problem for penguins”
The Kronen Zeitung reports that Antarctic sea ice is growing at an average annual rate of 16,500 square kilometers since 2007. The case is pretty much the same for Arctic sea ice, the online Austrian daily reports.
The Kronen Zeitung also writes that the rapidly growing sea ice surrounding Antarctica is a “huge problem” for penguins, who need open water.
“Climate science turned on its head”
Moreover, the Kronen Zeitung mentions the surprise of the National Snow and Ice data Centre (NSIDC) in Colorado concerning the growth in the Arctic:

Scientists t the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder (Colorado) in any case have to admit that instead of a global warming, a global cooling is taking place. […]
At the moment this development appears to have turned climate science on its head globally.”
The Kronen Zeitung then explains how the climate models have failed in that they predicted the very opposite to happen and that some scientists even desperately claimed that the measurements were wrong.
Max Planck scientists: “colder winters and cooler summers”
To explain what is happening, Kronen Zeitung turned to Professor Anastasios Tsonis of the University of Wisconsin. Tsonis says there are many factors at play. “Currents, winds, precipitation and foremost the upper and lower water layers.”
At the end of its article, Kronen Zeitung explains how the recent slowdown in overall solar activity may be playing a major role on the climate.
For years few sunspots could be observed. Colder winters and cooler summers could once again be the consequences, Max-Planck scientists say.”
Reported or not, the polar sea ice is there, and it cannot be ignored.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLooks like summer will be ending early this year. Once again parts of Central Europe will be getting hit by cold temperatures, frost, and even snow at elevations down to 2500 meters – in the middle of the summertime!
Germany’s leading popular daily Bild here writes how ex-hurricane Bertha has ushered in cooler air across western and central Europe, putting an end to the summer weather.
Meteologist Domink Jung of wetternet.de told Bild that widespread across central Europe “it’s going to be getting cooler over the coming days. At night many places will see single digit temperatures. Foremost in northern Germany it is already autumn-like cool.“
Moreover Bild adds:
‘At some higher elevation valleys in the Alps of Switzerland and Austria there will also be surface frost,’ says weather expert Jung. On Friday and Saturday in may even snow down to elevations of 2500 meters.”
Last month, July, I reported on how a spell of snow hit in the Swiss Alps at elevations down to 6000 feet, flying in the face of claims by global warming alarmists that snow would be “a thing of the past” and that Europe’s wintertime ski industry would suffer shortages of snow. Now it’s snowing in the middle of summer!
So what can be said about the cool weather? Global warming obsessors will claim it’s just weather, and not climate…forgetting how just days ago they claimed a single severe thunderstorm was a sign of global warming.
