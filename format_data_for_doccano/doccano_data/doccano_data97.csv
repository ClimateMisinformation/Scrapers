"If you were to trust what you see in the UK media you would think that climate change is a white issue that speaks to and is populated by one demographic alone.  The reality is that from Seattle to Beijing the international climate movement is a dynamic, multicultural, multi-class and intergenerational force using a diversity of tactics to challenge the root causes of climate change. It’s just the British movement that is a bit, shall we say, stuck in its ways.  I watched the premier of This Changes Everything in London over the weekend, as part of a global series of screenings and live chats with film-makers, Naomi Klein and Avi Lewis. The film starts in Alberta Tar Sands, one of the world’s largest ticking carbon bombs. Klein and Lewis amplify the stories of communities such as the Beaver Lake Cree, who are taking on the Canadian government and an army of energy giants for the rights to assert their traditional rights to live on the land, and leading the way with the transition to community-led solar projects.  When we switched to the panel discussion in London I experienced cognitive dissonance. We had just been watching all these incredible stories about this multicultural global movement, only to be suddenly met with an all white panel. Hosts Friends of the Earth recently made a big fuss about addressing the lack of diversity in the movement, with its chief executive Craig Bennett calling it a “white middleclass ghetto”. So it was embarrassing but not surprising, to see that at the launch of this international event, there was not a person of colour, or anyone from the ‘global south’ on the panel.  I met with Klein last year at a gathering of NGOs and climate movers and shakers in a workshop for the launch of the book of the same title. We were there to explore “broadening the climate movement in the UK.” She has been working with some of the same inspiring indigenous activists who have redrawn the map for environmentalism in Canada.  The movement in Canada has gone through a seismic shift with a generation of indigenous activists demanding a seat at the table. At the People’s Climate March in New York last year they were at the front alongside indigenous leaders from across Turtle Island, and representatives from a diverse range of communities from hurricane Sandy survivors to the Philippines. Klein has been inspired by what’s been happening in Canada to bring social and environmental movements together, so I hated to break it to her that this was not the case in the UK. At the last UK climate march people of colour like myself were poorly represented, if not invisible.  Britain should wake up to a new environmental movement that jives with new global realities. The Leap Manifesto which launched in Canada last week is a testament to the movement-building taking place in Canada. It sees an incredible coming together of First Nations, civil society, artists, unions of fossil fuel workers and ngo’s calling for a just transition from fossil fuels. We are no longer working in the development paradigm where the global south is waiting to be saved by the north. Back in the cinema, the activist in me wanted to jump on the stage with a Black Lives Matters banner. Luckily, I looked over at my friend who’s new to the phenomenon of the all-white speaker panel, and has a Filipino background. She was laughing at the situation, saying it was almost like we were back in 1984. She joked about a Band Aid mindset – “Do They Know It’s Climate Change?”  I have decided that we no longer have time to be challenging the non-profits for crumbs at the table or a seat on the panel, so I will be boycotting white-only panels for a while. There’s simply too much work to do.  I also wonder how much of the absence of people of colour though is half our own fault: is the British immigrant population too busy getting ahead to worry about climate change? Are we simply disengaged from the debate, or are we organising in our own communities but just aren’t getting the word out on our terms?  When the big UK green NGOs start to do that personal reflection and wake up to what it means to work in solidarity and side by side with communities then they’re more than welcome to join this global, multicultural, multi-class, vibrant movement that is changing everything.

"There is a need for a grassroots movement to strenghten the case for water in the climate debate. This grassroots movement for water exists, but could be stronger. In many countries local NGOs, water committees and youth associations have worked on raising awareness. In France, local water parliaments work together to tackle water and climate change issues. These initiatives could be further shown in other countries. Heloise Chicou, deputy director and climate program officer, French Water Partnership, Paris.  Community involvement starts with recognizing that community members are key stakeholders in the water debate. We need to seek their opinion from the planning of programmes, to their implementation. We shouldn’t turn to them only when everything has already been decided from the office. Community involvement can be costly, particularly in terms of the time invested, but it is a necessity. James Williams Kisekka, project officer and consultant, Aidenvironment and Rain Foundation, Kampala, Uganda. 3. Secure funding for developing countries Funding is a key issue for developing countries, who need it to develop their water and climate-related projects. Development banks have a role to play, but so do other innovative types of financing. For instance, a local authority from a developed country can help another local authority in a developing country to build sustainable technologies such as micro irrigation measures. Heloise Chicou, deputy director and climate program officer, French Water Partnership, Paris.  Water professionals can use digital platforms to share best practice, access information and to engage in project or action-related planning and discussion. At the World Economic Forum we are working to get all our networks onto digital platforms to share and connect. Dominic Waughray, head of public-private partnerships and member of the managing committee at the World Economic Forum, Geneva. A successful alliance is one that recognizes the strength of each member and allows them to tackle the part of the issue that they are best suited to address. For example the scientific community has great data and analysis that everyone can use, but they need to simplify knowledge and implications to get stakeholders on the same page. And we all need to leave our egos behind. Vidal Garza Cantú, director at the Femsa Foundation, Monterrey, Mexico. We must understand the political landscape. The best technical fix in the world will never be implemented if it results in the decision-makers losing office or power. We need to think about what is driving the decision-maker and whether is it possible to appeal to it. Deciding who to target is also critical. We often spend time trying to influence water ministries when we should be talking to the treasury. Louise Whiting, senior policy analyst at WaterAid, London. We should keep up the good work advocating for water, but we must also constantly strive to improve. Scale-up success stories and share lessons learned, as well as ideas and inspiration. World Water Week was a great stepping stone towards New York and Paris later this year. Let’s continue the momentum.

"Volkswagen faces a barrage of legal claims from British car owners over the emissions tests scandal, according to top law firms. Lawyers say they have been inundated with inquiries from VW drivers whose vehicles may have been far more polluting than claimed, after the German carmaker admitted installing defeat devices to cheat tests.  The chief executive of Volkswagen, Martin Winterkorn, quit on Wednesday, with the group facing criminal investigations in the US and other countries, plus potential legal claims worldwide, with 11m vehicles directly affected.  A spokesman for Leigh Day, a London-based law firm specialising in personal injury and product liability claims, said it had been inundated by inquiries. The number of potential claimants they were talking to would number “in the thousands – it’s constant inquirers at the moment”, he said.  Another law firm, Slater & Gordon, said it was fielding calls from concerned drivers. The firm’s head of group litigation, Jacqueline Young, said owners and car dealerships would have viable legal claims for breach of contract, with the value of vehicles falsely boosted by VW’s misrepresentations. Shareholders might also have a case, Young said, after the 30% fall in its share price since the scandal erupted. The German transport minister, Alexander Dobrindt, has confirmed that Volkswagen vehicles containing software to fix emissions standards were sold across Europe. Young said a class-action lawsuit was possible: “If the Volkswagen scandal applies to cars in the UK then this has the potential to be one of the largest group action lawsuits this country has seen.” She said drivers should not expect to claim back the whole value of their car, but some recompense for its fall in value. “Many of these drivers paid more for a greener car – on average £2,000 – only to find that that car is not greener after all.” But lawyers who have advised global carmakers said such claims would not necessarily succeed. Ian Plumley, of Clyde and Co, a specialist in product liability and recall, said: “Claimant law firms have a successful model and are creative in bringing cases, but it’s not a slam dunk at all – especially in the UK where you have a professional, impartial judiciary, whereas in the US you have regional differences and jury trials which can have an influence on the success or otherwise of cases.”  Plumley said claims from investors at group level were inevitable, but consumer legal claims would not be the biggest problem: “I think the more substantial issue is the reputational harm rather than the sanctions. It dents consumer confidence and the brand and can take a long time to repair.” VW has put aside an initial €6.5bn (£4.8bn) to deal with the costs of the crisis, although that sum could be dwarfed by fines from US regulators. The carmaker has enlisted Kirkland & Ellis – the US law firm employed by BP during the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster – to deal with its mounting legal claims. Concerns over true pollution levels have also spread to fuel consumption, with the consumer group Which? having long reported discrepancies between official miles per gallon test figures and its own results, with the VW Golf being the second-worst offender in its research. Richard Lloyd, the Which? executive director, said: “Our research has consistently showed that the official test used by carmakers is seriously in need of updating as it contains a number of loopholes that lead to unrealistic performance claims.” Pressure has grown on the UK government to follow up its call for a European commission inquiry, after it was revealed that the Department for Transport had been lobbying in private for less rigorous tests. The environmental law organisation ClientEarth has written to the DfT asking it take action to establish whether VW’s use of defeat devices was part of a wider industry practice, and to release all information held on the true emissions performance of cars licensed for sale on UK roads. James Thornton, head of ClientEarth, said: “Five days into the diesel emissions scandal the government has taken no action to reassure the public that cars on our roads meet even the lax standards required by EU law. The industry has shown it cannot be trusted. We cannot wait for action from the EU. First responsibility for protecting our health lies with our own government. The public must know the full scale of the problem and urgent action must be taken to fix it.”  The transport select committee is set to launch an inquiry into the scandal and its wider lessons for testing, which could lead to ministers and VW executives in Britain being questioned by MPs. While an inquiry cannot be officially launched until parliament returns in October, Louise Ellman, chair of the committee, said: “Action must be taken to give the public confidence in the testing regime in relation to emissions, safety, recyclability and other factors. There are questions over whether the testing authorities commissioned by motor manufacturers are truly independent.” "

"Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki, who was the subject of a solo Q&A broadcast in 2013, is back in Australia in March to take part in WOMADelaide’s Planet Talks series. Suzuki, a vocal advocate for action on climate change, spoke to Guardian Australia about Tony Abbott, the upcoming Paris climate talks and his new book. What did you make of Australia’s latest change of prime minister?  I had no idea this was going to happen. I thought ‘my God, I’m not a religious man but you’ve answered my prayers.’ I know Malcolm Turnbull is not a climate denier, so that’s a step up, our prime minister [Stephen Harper] is a denier. It all depends on why Tony Abbott was booted out. Is his party committed to action on climate change? Do you have a favoured method on how to reduce emissions? An emissions trading scheme, for example? What we’d call cap and trade is an inefficient system – a simple tax on carbon is the way to go. It’s fair and simple, and it works.  Our prime minister has said for 10 years that a carbon tax will destroy the economy. Oh really, what about Sweden? In 1991 it introduced a carbon tax and it’s at $133 a tonne. We have a carbon tax of $30 a tonne in British Columbia and it works.  Sweden recently raised the tax. Between 1991 and 2008, their emissions dropped 40% and in the same period their economy grew by 44% so what the hell is this bullshit that a carbon tax will destroy the economy? These guys are full of bullshit, they just don’t believe in information. Are you hopeful that the demise of Abbott is a positive signal in the global effort to tackle climate change?  I’m delighted to see it happen and I hope it does signal a change. Most of the industrialised world is dealing with this, even in [the] US with its completely fractured government. I mean, look at the Republicans, half of them should be in a loony bin for goodness sake.  Obama went to Alaska, an oil state and said we need to do something. Canada’s prime minister went to the Arctic and never mentioned climate change – the contrast is amazing. So how is Australia doing?  When you’ve got nine out of 10 solar panels made in China, you have to ask what the hell is wrong with Australia, you’ve got the solar resource, you are crazy. Canadians would kill for that sunshine, you have the CSIRO, some of the top scientists in the world and you’re not taking solar seriously, what’s wrong with you? You have Gina Rinehart, the big coal magnate, look at stuff she says! How does it get published? You recently put your name – along with the likes of Ellen Page, Leonard Cohen and Naomi Klein – to the Leap Manifesto, which calls for a rapid transition to renewable energy. What do you think of the argument put forward by Klein that capitalism isn’t suited to the challenge of doing this?  I’m completely with Naomi. We can’t fiddle around with little bandage attempts, more insulation in houses, small carbon taxes and so on. We’ve reached a crisis point where we have very little time to get off fossil fuels.  Al Gore said over five years ago that we need to be fossil fuel free in 10 years – that’s the kind of big call we need. We can’t fiddle around any longer. Our economic system treats air, water and soil like it’s free, we treat it like a garbage can. We demand growth forever – growth is defined as success. But economies grow by using up the rightful legacy of children and grandchildren. So you’re not a fan of market-based systems to deal with climate change? People say market-based systems – come on now. The atmosphere is what keeps us alive, then you can talk about markets and capitalism. Those things aren’t part of nature, we invented them. We asked nature to suit our agenda – it’s crazy. We should be shoehorning economics to suit nature’s needs, not the other way around.  We must start in Paris [at the UN climate conference] defining what the most basic things humans have. The most important thing a human being has is a breath of air – if you don’t have that, you’re dead. Our highest priority is protecting clean air.  We are 60% water by weight, we need to keep drinking. If you don’t drink water you’re dead, if you have polluted water you’re sick. If you don’t have food for four to six weeks weeks you’re dying, you eat contaminated food you’re sick. So put clean soil up with clean air and water in terms of importance. These are the fundamental things we need. Once we make that commitment we then ask how do we have an economy, how can we make a living? Are you hopeful about the upcoming Paris climate change talks?  We’ve had 20 COP [conference of the parties] meetings over 25 years. If the 21st is just a continuation of the last 20, forget it. Unless we do something completely different I’m not interested because we won’t make it.  You have 195 countries dealing with the atmosphere, dealing with 195 economies. You can’t shoehorn nature into human agendas.  What are the most worrying impacts of climate change, as far as you’re concerned? Witnessing the fires you’ve had, the years of drought, means that any Australian who says they don’t care about climate change doesn’t care about their own children. The Great Barrier Reef is in terrible shape.  We are seeing glaciers disappear in Canada, which is a source of water, and we are seeing mega droughts and storms, it’s happening everywhere.  We are at carbon dioxide levels of 400ppm now, we are in foreign country. We need to get off fossil fuels very quickly. In Canada my priority is make what happened to Mr Abbott happen to Mr Harper when we have our election here. You’ll be talking about your book Letters to My Grandchildren when you’re in Australia. Can you explain a bit about it? My grandparents came to Canada from Japan. I was born and raised in Canada and I spoke English at home, I never learned Japanese, so I never had a conversation with my grandparents. I never heard what the voyage was like, what it was like to get to a racist country. Those important questions were never answered so I thought I’d hate to die and my grandchildren never know things about me. So I wanted to share the things I’ve learned in this book."

"Leonardo DiCaprio and over 2,000 individuals and 400 institutions are now committed to pulling their money from fossil fuel companies, together representing a remarkable $2.6tn of investments, it was revealed on Tuesday. A new analysis shows the value of the funds committed to selling off their investments in coal, oil and gas companies has rocketed in the last year, rising 50-fold. Major pension funds and insurance companies have joined the universities and churches that founded the divestment movement, all of whom fear the impact of climate change on both the world and the value of their investment portfolios.   Among the biggest divesters are the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, held by Norway, and two of the world’s biggest pension funds, in California. The campaign, now active in 43 countries, was backed on Tuesday by the UN’s climate chief, who will lead negotiations for a global climate deal at a crunch summit in Paris in December.  Christiana Figueres called for the shift of investment from fossil fuels to meet the $1tn-a-year need for clean investment and to create momentum ahead of Paris. “Investing at scale in clean, efficient power offers one of the clearest, no regret choices ever presented to human progress,” she said at the launch of the report in New York. DiCaprio, who on Tuesday revealed the divestment of his personal wealth and his charitable foundation’s funds, said: “Climate change is severely impacting the health of our planet and all of its inhabitants, and we must transition to a clean energy economy that does not rely on fossil fuels. Now is the time to divest and invest to let our world leaders know that we, as individuals and institutions, are taking action to address climate change, and we expect them to do their part in Paris.” Bill McKibben, of the 350.org climate campaign that started the divestment movement, said: “In the hottest year we’ve ever measured on our planet, big institutions and organisations are finally stepping up to say: we won’t participate in this charade, and we will stand up to the fossil fuel companies that are causing it. A 50-fold increase is a sign that civil society is finally fully on the move in the battle against climate change.” Connie Hedegaard, former EU commissioner for climate action, said that divestment from fossil fuels not only helped tackle climate change but was also “sound economics”. She said the KR Foundation which she now chairs would divest it own funds, to “put our money where our mouth is”. Scientists agree that most existing coal, oil and gas reserves must remain in the ground if global warming is to be kept below the internationally-agreed danger limit of 2C. This means that, if action on climate change is successful, the vast majority of fossil fuels will be unburnable and the companies owning those reserves could crash in value. Many coal companies have already seen their share prices crash as limits on carbon emissions get stricter. The World Bank, along with analysts at Citigroup, HSBC, Mercer and the Carbon Tracker Initiative, have all warned of the financial risk climate action poses to fossil fuel investments. The Bank of England and G20 are examining the risk this poses to the global economy. The fossil fuel divestment movement, aimed primarily at stripping legitimacy from fossil fuel companies, has grown faster than even the divestment movement that targeted apartheid South Africa and it is backed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The new report, by Arabella Advisors, shows that the number of institutions committed to fossil fuel divestment has soared from 181 in September 2014 to 436 today. These institutions, which include local government, health and education bodies, represent more than 646 million individuals around the world. Pension funds and private companies now represent 95% of the assets committed to divestment, but university commitments have also risen rapidly, tripling in the last year, with notable announcements coming from the universities of California, Oxford and Syracuse. The Guardian, whose parent group has committed to divest its £800m fund, launched a campaign in March calling on the world’s biggest medical charities – the Bill and Melinda Gates’ Foundation and the Wellcome Trust – to divest from fossil fuels. It is estimated that the Wellcome Trust has lost £175m on its fossil fuel investments in the last year."

"Expectations among American Catholics were high for the pope’s first visit to the US. Those on the liberal wing of the church hoped that Francis would focus on his signature themes of poverty and climate change; conservative Catholics were looking for papal reinforcement of their opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. On the plane to Washington DC from Cuba, Francis sought to play down the notion that he was a leftwing pope. He told reporters he “may have given the impression of being a little more to the left, but it would not be a correct interpretation.” His doctrine was the doctrine of the church, he said: “Nothing more, nothing less.”  During his historic six-day trip, however, the pope’s words – accompanied by powerful symbolic gestures – are likely to have boosted liberal Catholics and disappointed conservatives. On the six key themes of his tour, the bottom-line score is a clear liberal win. What he said Almost his first public words on US soil were to introduce himself as “the son of an immigrant family”. During his trip, Francis repeatedly raised the issue of migration, referring both to refugees fleeing war and persecution, and those seeking a better life for themselves and their children. He told Congress:  On this continent, thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities. Is that not what we want for our own children? We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation. He urged lawmakers and citizens to reject a “mindset of hostility”. In Philadelphia, he told around 24,000 people at Independence Hall that immigrants brought “many gifts” to their new nations. Addressing “members of America’s large Hispanic population”, the pope urged: “Do not be ashamed of what is part of you, your life blood.” What he did After addressing Congress, Francis spoke to a crowd of tens of thousands in Washington DC, in his native Spanish. Using a language he shares with so many immigrants to the US was a powerful gesture of solidarity. Later, Francis accepted a letter from five-year-old Sophie Cruz, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, who broke through security along the mall in Washington. The letter asked him to call on US lawmakers to pass comprehensive immigration reform so she and her family could stop living in fear of deportation. The pope also met immigrant families at Our Lady Queen of Angels, a Catholic school in East Harlem, New York. Score Liberal win What he said Francis repeated a call “to avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity. I am convinced that we can make a difference and I have no doubt that the United States – and this Congress – have an important role to play. Now is the time for courageous actions and strategies.” Later he told the UN: “Any harm done to the environment, therefore is harm done to humanity. The ecological crisis, and the large-scale destruction of biodiversity, can threaten the very existence of the human species.” He also said that the world’s poor were the disproportionate victims of climate change, linking two of his key themes: the environment and inequality. What he did To the incredulity of US television commentators, the pope’s choice of vehicle for his US tour was a Fiat 500L. “I wouldn’t put my dog in a car like that,” said one pundit. The modest car, dwarfed by secret service SUVs, was a symbol of an environmentalist pope. Score Liberal win What he said Francis repeatedly spoke about the poor and the marginalised. Those “trapped in a cycle of poverty ... too need to be given hope. The fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly and on many fronts, especially in its causes.”  But the pope also spoke of “the many thousands of men and women who strive each day to do an honest day’s work, to bring home their daily bread, to save money and – one step at a time – to build a better life for their families.” He softened earlier trenchant criticism of capitalism as “the dung of the devil”, instead describing business as a “noble vocation” that could be a “fruitful source of prosperity”. And he accidentally omitted a section of his speech to Congress in which he warned politicians not be a “slave” to the economy or finance. What he did After addressing the most powerful legislature in the world, the pope had lunch with more than 300 homeless people at a Catholic Charities meals programme, in another symbolic gesture. He was too busy shaking hands and posing for selfies to eat his own lunch. Score Liberal win What he said The pope raised the issue of religious freedom several times during his trip, touching on an issue that has become a flashpoint between the Obama administration and faith campaigners over same-sex marriage and contraception provision. Efforts to build a just society should “respect [Catholics’] deepest concerns and their right to religious liberty. That freedom remains one of America’s most precious possessions,” he said. “All are called … to preserve and defend that freedom from everything that would threaten or compromise it.” In Philadelphia, Francis denounced discrimination against religion. “Religious freedom certainly means the right to worship God, individually and in community, as our consciences dictate,” he said. What he did Francis made an unscheduled visit to the Little Sisters of the Poor community in Washington in a clear gesture of support for their long legal battle over Obamacare. The order of Catholic nuns, which runs 30 nursing homes across the country, are fighting the requirement under the Affordable Care Act for employers to include contraception provision in health insurance. Score Conservative win What he said Francis seemed to allude to same-sex marriage when he said:  I cannot hide my concern for the family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without. Fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family. In Philadelphia, the city hosting the Catholic church’s World Meeting of Families, he ditched a prepared speech in favour of spontaneous acclaim for “families who bring up their children to grow and to move forward. Who create, who develop a society of truth, goodness and beauty.” The speech, released later by papal aides, made only a passing reference to marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Significantly, the text said: “Perfect families do not exist. This must not discourage us. Quite the opposite. Love is something we learn; love is something we live; love grows as it is ‘forged’ by the concrete situations which each particular family experiences.” Throughout his trip, the pope barely touched on the issue of abortion. In addressing American bishops in Washington, he said attention should be paid to the “innocent victims of abortion” and in his speech to Congress he spoke of “our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development”. What he did Perhaps it’s more significant what Francis didn’t do. He did not bless any newly-wed couples nor did he visit any pro-life groups. But neither did he consciously meet lesbian or gay Catholics, nor repeat his recent order for priests to absolve women who have had abortions if they express contrition.  Score No clear win for either liberal or conservatives The pope called for the abolition of the death penalty, a pointed intervention in the US where 35 prisoners were executed last year, and more than 3,000 languished on death row: Every life is sacred, every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes. Recently my brother bishops here in the United States renewed their call for the abolition of the death penalty. Not only do I support them, but I also offer encouragement to all those who are convinced that a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation. What he did On the last day of his trip, Francis visited the Curran-Fromhold correctional facility in Philadelphia to meet around 100 prisoners in the overcrowded jail, nine of whom have been charged with murder. It was a clear message about rehabilitation, his opposition to the death penalty and concern for the welfare of prisoners.  “I am here as a pastor, but above all as a brother, to share your situation and to make it my own,” he told them, hugging and blessing inmates following his speech. Score Liberal win"
"The one thing you could depend on when Pope John Paul II made one of his high-profile overseas trips was that he would hammer home in the most uncompromising terms Catholicism’s opposition to abortion. For the Polish pontiff, who died in 2005 and has now been declared a saint, abortion was murder, a stance which he presented as the keystone of all orthodoxy for Catholics. This week his successor but one, the Argentinian Pope Francis, will be following in John Paul’s footsteps with his own first visit to the United States after spending the weekend in Cuba. Together, the two legs of the trip promise to be among the defining moments of what has already been an extraordinary two-and-a-half-year papacy.  Like John Paul, Francis will be addressing the United Nations and visiting the White House, but those Americans, Catholic or not, hoping that he too will be speaking out unambiguously on the pro-life/pro-choice stand-off that has so dominated church-state relations in the US for a generation are likely to be disappointed. The world has responded to the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires with enthusiasm on account of his warmth, humility, spontaneity and habit of going off-script as far as the doctrines of his church are concerned. But Francis is also, in his own words, “a little furbo” – ie, shrewd, clever, an operator. This less remarked-on side has been seen in the way he is systematically reforming the corrupt, bloated Vatican curia (civil service) and straightening out its dodgy bank. It was there, too, in his instructions on the issue of abortion two weeks before setting off for Cuba and the States. Priests, he ordered, were to show mercy and compassion to women who came to them to confess having had an abortion. No longer were they to refuse absolution (forgiveness of sins) or have their case referred to the local bishop. Instead, Francis said, his priests were to emphasise to the women concerned that, however “profoundly unjust” their choice was, God still loved them and understood there were reasons why they had made such an “agonising and painful” decision. He added that the automatic excommunication decreed by canon law for abortion no longer applied. It was nothing short of reshaping the Catholic moral landscape, and must have come as a profound shock to many US bishops. They have traditionally taken a “culture warrior” approach to abortion, damning anyone who suggested there might be room for compromise. So when John Kerry, a practising Catholic, ran for the presidency in 2004, Cardinal Raymond Burke, then archbishop of St Louis, later the most senior judge in the Vatican’s highest court, ordered that the Democratic candidate be denied holy communion because of his pro-choice stance. You can’t but admire both Francis’s human empathy and his tactical nous. His instruction was, above all, a perfectly timed pre-emptive strike, allowing him to say all he intends to about abortion before he even set foot in the US, leaving him free once there to talk about the subjects that he wants to define Catholicism in today’s world. “We cannot insist only on issues relating to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods,” he remarked in a September 2013 interview with the church magazine, Civiltà Cattolica. So when he addresses a joint session of Congress on Thursday, “Papa Francisco” can tackle what have become the hallmark themes of his leadership: eradication of poverty; the plight of refugees and immigrants against the backdrop of what he has labelled the “globalisation of indifference”; and climate change. Given this agenda, the papal trip could not have come at a more crucial moment. There is a presidential race under way, with climate change among the disputed electoral territory. One of the leading Republican candidates, Jeb Bush, a 1995 convert to Catholicism, has publicly dismissed Francis’s encyclical Laudato Si (“Praise be to you”), which sets out in stark terms human responsibility for climate change, with the remark: “I don’t get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinals or my pope.” On poverty, when he stands up before the UN general assembly on Friday, the pope will be speaking to global leaders as they gather to agree international development goals for the next 15 years. It has been Francis’s constant demand as pope that Catholicism must be, first and foremost, “a poor church, for the poor”. If anyone doubts that commitment, much of the rest of his time in the US will be given to meeting those at the margins – at a soup kitchen for the homeless in Washington, a school for recent immigrants in East Harlem, and, next Sunday, on the final day of his trip, inside Curran-Fromhold correctional facility in Philadelphia. Some may regard such occasions as just photo-opportunities, but that is to underestimate the commitment of a man who spent much time when cardinal archbishop of Buenos Aires travelling anonymously on public transport to shanty towns on the outskirts of the city to minister to their inhabitants. This is where, he says repeatedly, the Catholic church must be – not waiting in ornate churches for the faithful to fill the pews, but going out in solidarity to where real life is a daily struggle. It is a belief that permeates everything Francis has done as pope, right down to his efforts, during the Cuba leg of his journey, to extend the historic renewal of diplomatic ties between Havana and Washington that he brokered into a wider lifting of the US trade embargo (“el bloqueo”) which blights the economic prospects of so many Cubans. It is an approach that has not always endeared Francis to some cardinals, priests and laity who hanker after the old certainties of the era of John Paul II and its footnote in the reign of Benedict XVI. It is said in church circles that the conservatives are doing their damnedest to delay every reform in the hope that Francis’s legacy will then be easier to reverse once he is gone. But whatever chill he may feel in the reception he is given by the ecclesiastical bigwigs, many Catholics in the pews will be drawing strength for the breath of fresh air that he represents. Here, after all, is a leader who it has been reported wanted to enter their country not via a red carpet on an airport runway, but by walking across the Mexican border as a show of solidarity with the economic migrants Donald Trump wants to shut out with a wall. Why this visit to Cuba and America matters so much is that it comes at a time when Francis is beginning to move beyond altering the style, tone and organisation of the Catholic church, to get on with reforming its rulebook. Hence his instruction on abortion, and his directives, which were announced at the same time, simplifying the church’s archaic and costly annulment process. Francis’s new system will make it quicker, cheaper and less about blame, thereby reversing the current exodus of divorced and remarried Catholics from the sacraments. I should enter a note of caution, lest we all get too carried away with Francis-mania. The 78-year-old pope is many attractive things, but he is not a liberal reformer set to bring Catholicism into line with the modern world. On a recent trip to Argentina, his old friends and colleagues repeatedly told me that, at heart, he is conservative. What that means in practice can be seen in the forthcoming “Year of Mercy” that Francis has announced throughout the Catholic church. While showing mercy towards women who have had abortions, divorced couples or gay Catholics is a huge improvement on condemning them as sinners, it still implies that they have been or are doing something wrong. For all his charm, integrity and “furbizia”, this is not a Catholic leader who is about to blur the fundamental boundaries between his church and secular values.

"What if there were an affordable programme to prevent catastrophic climate change and provide the finance that developing countries need to end poverty by 2030? With summits this week on the sustainable development goals and in December on climate change, this year marks the most significant push on the world’s biggest challenges since 2005, the year of the G8 meeting at Gleneagles and the UN world summit.  It’s sobering to compare then with now. A decade ago, big ideas were on the table: timetables for donors to reach 0.7% of national income on overseas development assistance (ODA); cancellation of all debt to the World Bank and IMF; a development trade round. Today, by contrast, it’s like watching tumbleweed roll across the desert.  The Addis Ababa finance for development summit agreed on next to nothing to deliver the SDGs; tomorrow’s gathering in New York is unlikely to do much better. On climate, meanwhile, no one (including Christiana Figueres, the head of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) believes a 2C deal is in prospect. But what if there were a big idea that could achieve both?  Our starting point is to recognise that we won’t stabilise the climate until we base global climate policy on a binding, global “emissions budget”, which covers all countries and declines over time to keep the world on course for warming of less than two degrees’ celsius. Since long before the Copenhagen summit in 2009, climate negotiators have fought shy of recognising the need to do this – based on the belief that it would be politically and economically impossible. We weren’t so sure. We built an economic model – “SkyShares” – to tell us what the cost implications of a safe global emissions budget would be for every country, in every year, for the next two centuries (the first time, as far as we know, that this work has been done). Although SkyShares will give you costings for any set of assumptions you wish to set, we chose some sensible starting points for our reference scenario.  First, we assumed that permits would be shared out on the basis of equal per capita entitlements, with countries able to emit in proportion to their population (the “contraction and convergence” approach first proposed by the Global Commons Institute). Our reasoning here was that we couldn’t imagine how else to share out the most basic common property resource there is: the sky. Nor could we imagine most countries agreeing to anything other than equal shares. Second, we assumed that countries could use emissions trading. Recent experiments in this area, such as the EU emissions trading scheme or the clean development mechanism, have got a bad name, and rightly so given how full of loopholes they’ve been.  But if emissions trading were to take place within a safe emissions budget – as it would under our approach – then this problemwouldn’t arise. (We also assumed that countries only make use of emissions trading when it makes economic sense to do so.) We were pleasantly surprised by what SkyShares found, for two reasons.  First, because it turns out to be far more affordable for high emitters than we dared hope: under our reference scenario, high-income countries would face net costs of just 0.56% of gross domestic product a year in 2025 and 1.45% in 2030. True, these costs are substantial. But we are, after all, talking about the price tag for the biggest economic transition since the industrial revolution, with numerous high emitting assets being retired early. What’s more, having a liquid global emissions trading market makes the transition cheaper for all countries – far more so than if they all met their emissions targets solely through decarbonisation at home. Economists across the board agree we need to put a price on carbon. An emissions trading scheme that sits within a safe global emissions budget not only achieves that, but by design ensures that the world stabilises greenhouse gas concentrations in the air at a safe level. Our second key finding was that emissions trading becomes a new source of development finance. As soon as 2025, low- and lower-middle income countries could make $416bn (£273bn) a year from emissions trading – more than three times as much as total current aid spending. What’s more, these flows would have an inbuilt prioritisation towards least developed countries – the ones with least access to alternative sources of development finance like FDI, remittances, or tax revenue – for the simple reason that they are invariably the lowest per capita emitters and hence those who would have the most spare emission permits to sell. We take policymakers at their word when they say they want to end poverty by 2030 at the same time as stabilising the climate through an economic transformation of unprecedented scale and speed. It can be done, but only if we’re willing to think about truly big ideas. This is one of them. "

"Pope Francis’s arrival in Washington on Tuesday has reinforced hopes that one of the last great bastions of climate change denial – the US Congress – may be on the verge of crumbling. As the pope touched down in the US from Cuba, Democratic leaders in Congress and environmental campaigners were optimistic that Francis would keep the focus on his core themes of the global economic order, poverty and environmental degradation over the next six days, and so widen the emerging fractures in the Republican wall of denial.   Republicans, meanwhile, remained wary, and expressed hope that the pope would steer clear of controversial issues on his first visit to the US.  Sheldon Whitehouse, the Democratic senator from Rhode Island, said he believed the call to action from a popular pope made it increasingly difficult for Republicans to continue to dismiss the science on climate change. “I think this whole edifice of climate denial is crumbling,” Whitehouse told the Guardian. As Pope Francis was taking his first steps on American soil, Hillary Clinton broke her lengthy silence on the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, saying she opposed the project and did not believe it was in the interests of “what we need to do to combat climate change”. Even before the pope’s indictment of capitalism and climate change in his encyclical in June, Republicans in Congress had been slowly edging away from outright climate denial.  Fifteen Republicans in the Senate voted last January that human activity contributed to climate change. Last week, 11 Republicans in the House broke with the party leadership to acknowledge the threat of climate change. Whitehouse argued that strong concern about climate change among Latino and young voters made it increasingly difficult for Republicans to cling to climate change denial – and remain viable in the 2016 elections.   “You are seeing folks fleeing it on the House side. There are innumerable behind-the-scene conversations happening on the Senate side with Republican senators who are in real disagreement with where their party has been led and I think it’s only a matter of time until there is a break in the Senate,” he said.  “The forces that are coming to bear on that, of [the] Paris [United Nations Climate Change Conference], of corporate pressure, of key constituencies for the November 2016 elections are all very strong, and the risk to an out-of-touch party going into a national election with an unpopular position on a major issue that has been paid for by a big special interest is an ugly combination. So it is very logical, I think, for people to want escape from that ship before it sinks too much further and to want to escape soon. I think the pressure of the pope talking about this helps.” That was the hope of campaigners who have been organising around the pope and his visit to the US for months, seizing on the encyclical as a chance to reframe climate change as a question of morality.  Sally Bingham, a reverend who organised 18,000 churches, synagogues and mosques in the Interfaith Power and Light campaign group, said she hoped the pope would help Republicans reposition on climate change denial.  “Maybe the pope will be able to make them think about it a little bit and shift away from the next campaign, and the money that they may be needing, and to think about what kind of leader they are going to be,” she said.  Within Congress there was hope from Democrats that Francis’s visit would provide cover to moderate Republicans who might be willing to back legislation on energy and climate change. “The pope will be helpful in bringing some of the moderates to us,” Ruben Gallegos, a Democratic house member from Arizona, told a conference call.  But he said he doubted the pope’s message would succeed in heading off Republican efforts to defeat the clean power plant rules. “I don’t believe it will change Congress right away,” he said. “Unfortunately the attack on the president’s efforts to mitigate carbon emissions from coal power plants will continue from that wing of the Republican party.”  “Whoever the presidential candidate is, is extremely likely to have an epiphany once he is through the convention and actually is the nominee,” Senator Whitehouse said. For the moment, however, Republicans in Congress remain sceptical about the visit becoming an opportunity to bash them on a host of contentious issues from climate change to Cuba and economic inequality. On the eve of the pope’s visit, Paul Gosar, a Catholic Republican from Arizona, said he would boycott Francis for promoting what he called “questionable science”. Iowa senator Joni Ernst said it was “premature” for Democrats to claim the pope as one of their own. “I am hoping the visit is not politically motivated,” she told the Guardian. “What I want to hear is just some uplifting message about how we can all help the most vulnerable in our society.“ “I think his message is going to be somewhat less political than people believe it will be,” agreed Senator Susan Collins of Maine. “I don’t see him as a person who is trying to influence votes, he is outlining what he believes the mission of the church is in the modern world.” Some Democrats were quick to seize on the pope’s past criticism of unfettered free markets as vindication for their own focus on income inequality and union pay campaigns. “As we welcome Pope Francis to the United States, I hope that every member of Congress and the president will heed his call for social and economic justice,” presidential candidate Bernie Sanders told striking federal workers near the US capitol. “The United States of America today is the richest country in the history of the world, but most Americans do not understand that or feel that because most of the wealth is going to a handful of people at the top,” he added at a packed rally of union members held to coincide with the pope’s arrival. But on a day when the Senate narrowly voted against moving forward on anti-abortion legislation, others were braced for difficult moral questions for both Republicans and Democrats when the pope addresses a joint session of Congress on Thursday. “There is a way to be political without being partisan,” said John Gehring, Catholic Program Director at Faith in Public Life, an advocacy group in Washington, during a preview event at the Center for American Progress. “In the meat-grinder of American politics we chop up issues of life and dignity and social justice, and the pope reflects a Catholic social tradition that connects those dots and he will make people uncomfortable on both sides.”"
"Environmentalists have criticised a decision to appoint a former consultant to major oil and gas companies as David Cameron’s key adviser on energy and environment policy. Stephen Heidari-Robinson, a little-known consultant from oilfield services company Schlumberger, arrives in Downing Street just months before the prime minister is expected to attend the UN’s global climate change summit which begins in Paris in December.  A Number 10 spokesman confirmed the appointment of Heidari-Robinson, who started in the job this week. It is understood he will serve as a lead energy and environment adviser to the prime minister, liaising with senior ministers and officials across Whitehall.  He joins Cameron’s top team from Schlumberger’s London-based consulting division where he advised companies including BP, Shell and Chevron and co-authored a paper critical of the tax regime on North Sea oil and gas production.  Number 10’s spokesman said Heidari-Robinson has been appointed for his experience and expertise, however according to his LinkedIn profile he has little previous experience in environment or climate change policy. Prior to Schlumberger, Heidari-Robinson worked at multinational consultancy firm McKinsey, advising state-owned oil companies in the Middle East. He previously worked at the Ministry of Defence for six years and is an Oxford graduate and Persian speaker. This is not the first time Cameron has drawn criticism over appointing a climate change adviser from the energy sector. Heidari-Robinson’s predecessor, Tara Singh, was previously a lobbyist for British Gas owner and fracking investor Centrica. Singh left Downing Street in April after two years in the job. Singh replaced Ben Moxham, a former aide to Lord Browne, the former chief executive of BP. Moxham’s appointment in 2011 attracted controversy as he came straight from Riverstone, a private equity firm behind the UK-based shale gas company Cuadrilla. Heidari-Robinson’s previous employer, Schlumberger, is a major player in the oil and gas industry providing a range of services to fossil fuel companies around the world. In the US, Schlumberger have developed many of the controversial drilling technologies used to extract oil and gas from shale formations.  Responding to the latest appointment, Greenpeace UK’s head of energy Daisy Sands said: “Hiring an oil man as an energy and environment adviser in the run-up to a major climate summit is like asking Count Dracula for advice before a conference on veganism. It shows yet again that the government remains enthralled to the oil and gas industries.” The appointment comes amid increasing concerns among environmentalists and the renewable energy industry after a spate of recent government decisions to axe or roll-back high profile green policies, including scrapping support for onshore wind farms. Simon Bullock, Friends of the Earth’s senior climate and energy campaigner, described the UK’s current climate and energy policy as “a mess”.  “The Government has a clear choice – to prop up the last centuries’ fossil fuel industries and become a climate-laggard, or champion clean energy and lead the way.  “Choosing an experienced oil industry insider to make this choice doesn’t bode well, but from his work in the Middle East Mr Heidari-Robinson will be well aware of the ever-growing impacts of climate change on people’s lives,” Bullock said. Over the past year, environmentalists have also raised the alarm over David Cameron’s enthusiasm for kickstarting the UK’s shale gas industry. The government’s commitment to shales gas was underscored in August when ministers said they would intervene on planning applications for fracking operations if local authorities fail to act quickly enough."
"Australia is behind its allies in preparing for climate change, exposing defence personnel – and the country more broadly – to considerable strategic risk and uncertainty, a new report written by the former defence force chief, Admiral Chris Barrie, warns. More than half the world’s natural disasters last year occurred in the Asia-Pacific region and the Australian defence force was increasingly being called upon to provide humanitarian assistance to affected areas, the Climate Council report said.  Although climate change was increasing the frequency and severity of many extreme weather events in the region, the report cited weak government action on climate change as undermining the ADF’s ability to respond. “The US has mandated that their military forces address the risks of climate change as a routine part of all mission planning,” the report said.  “In Australia, comparatively less action is being taken by the government to ensure the Australian defence force is prepared for the security risks posed by climate change. This is particularly concerning because Australia and the Asia-Pacific are on the frontline of climate change and its impacts.” The defence minister, Marise Payne, was asked at a press conference in Canberra on Tuesday if the government’s defence white paper should include a strategy for how to respond to the threat posed by climate change.  “I’m not going to go into the details of the white paper,” Payne said. “I have not had a chance to be briefed on the submission process yet, but after that I am sure I will form a view and we will be able to talk further.”  The report said strong action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would be critical to reduce these security risks, given that climate change was a “threat multiplier” that made unstable conditions worse by exacerbating food and water scarcity. “These threats, in turn, can contribute to political instability and social tensions that result in violence and conflict,” it warned. “Projected sea-level rise, coastline retreat and the eventual submergence of small low-lying islands may affect the maritime boundaries of nations and alter exclusive economic zones in which natural resources are located. This may intensify existing regional tensions and contribute to new conflicts over natural resources.” Rising temperatures would also make it more difficult for ADF staff to train, exposing them to heat stress, and training ranges risked being wiped out or damaged. “The 2013 state mine fire, one of New South Wales’s biggest ever bushfires, was caused by inadequate defence planning, in which high explosive tank rounds were detonated on a day of high bushfire danger,” it said.  “Climate change is one of the largest long-term global challenges humans have faced in the history of civilisation. The implications for the security sector and defence forces are formidable.” Prof Will Steffen, of the Climate Council, said he was confident that the new Turnbull government would take the findings of the report seriously.  Steffen said he would meet Payne next month and hoped to brief her more extensively on the report. “The need to get greenhouse gas emissions down is a big issue requiring much discussion and it’s my feeling that this new leadership will be much more open to exploring how we can do that,” he said. “We also need climate change to be mainstreamed into defence planning. Without acting we will face much more serious consequences than we are now, within a couple of decades.”"
"How many divisions has the pope? Stalin once sneered – but that was before the world’s superpower swooned over Pope Francis. Rapturous crowds, a reverential White House welcome, a trumpet fanfare, TV networks hanging on his every word: the United States isn’t merciful with his desire to be humble. The pontiff’s journey through the centres of US power and history began on Wednesday with an elaborate arrival ceremony and balmy sunshine at the White House’s south lawn. “What a beautiful day the Lord has made,” President Barack Obama beamed.  Fifteen thousand spectators, including the first lady and the vice-president, packed the lawn for the official start of the pope’s six-day tour of Washington, New York and Philadelphia. A Fife & Drum Corps marching band in full revolutionary regalia played Yankee Doodle for the black president and Catholic leader, just as the white, Protestant founding fathers envisaged. Francis pulled up in his now-famous Fiat, a Lilliputian marvel in the world’s limousine and SUV capital, and listened as the commander in chief of the world’s mightiest military made common cause with him, the head of a 110-acre city state guarded with pikes. “In your humility, your embrace of simplicity, in the gentleness of your words and the generosity of your spirit, we see a living example of Jesus’ teachings, a leader whose moral authority comes not just through words but also through deeds,” said Obama. Francis is not only the spiritual leader of 1.2 billion Catholics, including 70 million Americans: he is popular, a global sensation whom conservatives and liberals alike wish to co-opt – a minor miracle in a polarised country where Republican and Democratic presidential contenders clash bitterly over immigration, economic inequality, the environment, foreign policy, abortion and same-sex marriage. The Latin American pontiff, visiting the US for the first time in his 78 years, put himself simultaneously above, and on both sides, of the divide, a feat closer to magic realism than triangulation.  “As the son of an immigrant family, I am happy to be a guest in this country, which was largely built by such families,” he began, in what was perhaps a veiled swipe at the xenophobic lurch of US politics. Donald Trump at least would have appreciated that the Argentinian spoke English, his weakest language, carefully enunciating each word.  He explicitly endorsed Obama’s regulatory programme to fight climate change. “I find it encouraging that you are proposing an initiative for reducing air pollution. Accepting the urgency, it seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation,” he said. “When it comes to the care of our common home, we are living at a critical moment of history.” Lest climate-change deniers miss the urgency, Francis added: “To use a telling phrase of the Reverend Martin Luther King: we can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note and now is the time to honour it.”  A grateful Obama sounded like the 2008 candidate of hope and change. “Holy Father, you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet – God’s magnificent gift to us.” He also hailed the pope’s call to help the poor and dispossessed. “You shake our conscience from slumber,” he said. Social conservatives – not least US Catholic bishops who resent the pope’s relatively soft tone on abortion and divorce – noted his reference to his visit to Philadelphia for the Eighth World Meeting of Families “to celebrate and support the institutions of marriage and the family at this, a critical moment in the history of our civilisation”. Translation: in the age of same-sex marriage. After a private meeting with Obama in the Oval office, Francis swapped the Fiat for a popemobile – a converted Jeep Wrangler – and kissed babies and saluted cheering, ecstatic crowds lining the route to the Cathedral of St Matthew the Apostle, the patron saint of civil servants. There, speaking in Italian, he addressed about 300 US bishops who are grappling with division, declining congregations and vocations and a sex-abuse scandal. “It is not my intention to offer a plan or to devise a strategy. I have not come to judge you or to lecture you,” he said, though he did urge unity and dialogue. “The world is already so torn and divided, brokenness is now everywhere. Consequently, the church … cannot allow herself to be rent, broken or fought over.”  He alluded to the victims of sex-abuse “crimes”, with little elaboration, and referred to the “innocent victim of abortion” along with children who die from bombings or drown in search of a better life. Outside crowds waited patiently for the 266th pontiff to emerge, bells pealing across the sunlit city. The only snafu, it seemed, were long delays on the metro, prompting wags to request an exorcism of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority."

"Drilling for oil in the Arctic is not yet commercially viable and may not be for a long time to come, the chief of the world’s energy watchdog has warned, casting doubt on the controversial practice even as it is being enthusiastically adopted by governments and businesses. Shell is undertaking exploratory Arctic drilling off the Alaskan coast after the Obama administration granted it a green light in August. Environmental groups have urged a ban, saying it risks one of Earth’s last pristine landscapes and is contributing to climate change, which this week was blamed for Arctic sea ice shrinking to its fourth lowest ever level.  But the intervention of Fatih Birol, incoming executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), is likely to carry more weight with governments and businesses. He told the Guardian that the technology was not ready, and faces hurdles that may prove too costly to overcome. “I believe that Arctic oil is not for today, and not for tomorrow – maybe for the day after tomorrow,” he said. “It’s geologically difficult, technologically difficult, lots of environmental challenges, and the cost of production is very, very high, especially if you look at the current oil price levels.” Birol stopped short of recommending an outright ban, but urged leaders of states and businesses to look deeply into the issues before embarking on expeditions. “It should be an assessment of the oil company, whether or not they see [a business case] at those prices [for oil], or at those costs [of production] – whether or not it could be a profitable project,” he said. “I think the companies should look at all these risks combined. It is up to them to make or lose money.” Shell has already spent £4.5bn proving resources in the Arctic exist. He warned governments to consider the potential risks, including those of climate change and pollution. “Governments should hold projects from the angle of whether or not it makes economic sense for the country, for this business, whether or not it has implications for the local and the global environment. And they should also think of what supports the energy security of their country.” Birol said that, despite the constraints of climate change the world would continue to use oil for some decades, but that the question of whether it came from the Middle East and other established oilfields, shale deposits, or the Arctic would “depend on the economics”. Birol took over as executive director of the IEA this month, from his longstanding position of chief economist at the agency, which is regarded as the gold standard on energy issues. He has long been a champion of clean energy, and was one of the first economists to put climate change at the heart of the world’s energy policy. His role will be key in the run-up to the crunch climate change conference later this year in Paris, where the IEA is also based, at which the United Nations is hoping to forge a new global agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions post-2020. So far 62 countries have submitted pledges on cutting emissions ahead of the Paris summit, with many more expected in the next fortnight. To date, however, the prospect of monitoring those pledges and holding governments to account has been a thorny one, with many nations balking at independent oversight of their progress towards their targets, because of fears over national sovereignty. Birol plans to cut through this by publishing the IEA’s own comprehensive data on energy use, and assessing annually whether countries are on track for their targets, as well as how they could be ratcheted up in future. This would be a new role for the IEA, and one that will add sharper teeth to any pact reached in Paris. “I believe our analysis will show that no energy company can afford to ignore the upcoming climate policy push internationally. If they do so, that may well have implications for the financial performance of their companies.” Birol, who has never bought a car, and has lived in the same small 43sq metre apartment in Paris as he did 20 years ago on joining the IEA, is in a better position than most to propound his vision of tackling climate change while bringing electricity and affordable energy to the poor across the globe.  While the directorship is usually a political appointment taking turns across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) member countries, he is the first to be promoted from within and to receive unanimous backing from the states involved. “Seven years ago, the IEA started to look at the implications [for the climate] of using energy. And this one number made me convinced that we have to work on climate change very, very hard – that two-thirds of the emissions causing climate change come from the energy sector. I was very clear from the beginning that our aim should be how to transform the energy sector.”"

"The world has experienced record-breaking warmth every month so far in 2015, making this year virtually guaranteed to be the hottest on record, according to a US science agency. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said that 2015 was 97% likely to be the hottest year so far, eclipsing 2014, the current warmest year. Last month was the warmest ever August globally since records began in 1880, at 1.58F above the 20th century average. Every month this year has been the hottest on record, with the period of January to August 1.51F above the long-term average. In an update published on Thursday by Noaa, scientists said that manmade global warming and the El Niño climate phenomenon were the cause. Deke Arndt, chief of the monitoring branch at Noaa’s national centres for environmental information￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼, said: “Longterm climate change is like climbing a flight of stairs: over time you get higher and higher. El Niño is like standing on your tippy toes when you’re on one of those stairs. Both of those together work to create the warmest temperature on record. We would not be threatening records repeatedly if we had not climbed the stairs for decades.” The agency said that there was “high confidence” that El Niño – a climate phenomenon that occurs when a vast pool of water in the western tropical Pacific Ocean becomes abnormally warm – would last through the winter and the level of heat in the oceans meant it was extremely likely that 2015 would be the warmest on record. Arndt said:￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ “We would have to see some really unusual cooling behaviour and the reason that the probabilities are so high are not just that we have such a big lead just now but because much of that is being driven by the oceans, and the ocean tends to have a strong persistence, meaning one month is very, very related to the next month. The oceans don’t turn quickly.” In a blogpost, scientists at the agency wrote: “We estimate a 97% probability that 2015 will become the warmest year on record.” Arndt described the jump in the record broken for August as a “relatively large” one compared to previous new records. Since the 21st century, the world has broken 30 monthly warmth records as climate change takes hold.  Noaa also said that 31.5% of the contiguous US was in drought, up six percentage points since July, and drought had intensified in parts of the south-eastern US.  Oregon and Washington had their warmest summers on record, while California and Nevada are among the four US states on track to experience their hottest year yet. Alaska is having its secondest warmest year to date. Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief charged with forging a new agreement on climate change at a summit in Paris at the end of the year, said the new data demonstrated the need for action on climate change. .@NOAA chart shows global average temperatures this year, demonstrates need for #climateaction @ #COP21 #action2015 pic.twitter.com/6LyxWAbPdm The US agency’s data follows a report by the UK Met Office earlier this week which predicted that 2015 and 2016 will be the warmest – or near-warmest – on record.

"The government is wrong to assume its existing policies will be enough to phase out coal power in the UK, analysts have told the Guardian. Minister for energy and climate change Andrea Leadsom said this week that her department expected unabated (meaning without carbon capture) coal would make up just 1% of the country’s electricity generation by 2025. Referring to a Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) report from September last year, Leadsom said the decline would occur “as a result of deployment of low carbon alternatives, the cost of generation and the investment needed to meet new pollution abatement standards”.  But this prediction is not reinforced by a mandatory end date for electricity generation from coal. Despite rhetoric from the prime minister and his ministers that coal needs to go, the government has been reluctant to set a timeline for the phase-out of the most carbon intensive fossil fuel. Robert Gross, director of Imperial College’s Centre for Energy Policy and Technology, said relying on existing policies and the market for cleaner technologies left the door open for coal generation to continue beyond 2030. 1% coal by 2025 is a projection, not an aim, DECC confirms. See projection here: https://t.co/2vYSc5PUHm pic.twitter.com/MNDfQvmRId “There’s a considerable range of uncertainty about how much coal will be retained on the system. And if it’s at the upper end of the range of possibilities then its going to absolutely blow the carbon budget,” he said.  A 2014 report prepared by Gross found that the range of coal generation expected to remain on the system was dependent on the price of carbon set by the government in future. With a low carbon price, coal would continue to provide 19% of electricity in 2025, down from roughly a third in 2013. A high carbon price would reduce coal generation to 3%.  Both scenarios retain more coal generation than Leadsom’s predicted 1% and both exceed the UK government Committee on Climate Change’s (CCC) decarbonisation goals for the electricity sector. The CCC has said “there can be no role for conventional coal generation in the UK beyond the early 2020s”. Gross said little had occurred in the year since his report was published to alter the view that coal could still play a role well beyond the government’s expectations. In April, the carbon price was doubled to £23/tonne. But this is less than a third of Gross’ high carbon price scenario of £75/tonne.  He said cuts to subsidies for onshore wind and solar and a lack of committed support for offshore wind meant investors would be increasingly wary of starting new projects in the UK that could displace coal. This week the UK dropped out of the top 10 safest countries in the world for renewable investment for the first time. Yan Qin, a carbon analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon, said her modelling suggested that the UK’s relentless stripping of renewables subsidies was going to leave a big gap in demand that would be filled by existing old coal stations. She said that even under the UK’s ‘dash for gas’ policy the country would still need a “minimum of 5% to 10% of coal generation to account for power demand” by 2025. “To assume that unabated coal only accounts for 1% of total generation by 2025, that seems quite ambitious. Especially taking into account the slower growth in renewables in the UK, because the UK is one of very few countries now that is very likely to miss the [EU] 2020 renewables target,” said Qin.  Leadsom noted that her prediction of 1% came from Decc’s “central scenario”. In fact, Decc’s predictions for coal’s future range between 6.75% to 0% by 2025. The department’s “baseline scenario” which retains the highest amount of coal relies on what Decc calls “baseline policies” – policies introduced before the UK set its carbon budgets in 2009. These “baselines” included the solar feed-in-tariff and the renewables obligation scheme for solar and wind farms, both of which were introduced before 2009 and have now been scrapped or effectively gutted. In February, the leaders of the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats signed a joint pledge on climate action that included an agreement to “end the use of unabated coal for power generation”. In response, a host of charities wrote to the leaders asking them to set a mandatory date for the full phase out of coal. “Unless you have any explicit emissions regulations that would affect how much coal can run, then you’re reliant upon the other policies,” said Gross. “At the moment, we absolutely don’t know what [the government’s] energy policy is going to be.” One of the policies the government expects to lead to the near total shut down of coal power stations has nothing to do with carbon emissions at all. The EU Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) has ordered plants to reduce the amount of toxic particles they spew out or be forced to close by 2023. This is likely to force some plants to shut down, although the UK has been lobbying for an exemption to keep one of its dirtiest coal stations, Aberthaw, open. But Gross found that even with a high carbon price, some plants would continue operating. This is because it would be cheaper to add filter technology to an existing coal plant than to build a new gas or renewable facility. These filters do nothing to reduce the carbon emissions of the station. A spokeswoman for RWE, the operators of Aberthaw, said filter technology was being fitted to the plant to reduce its NOX emissions.  “The company is committed to maintaining its fleet, to help keep the lights on, despite difficult market conditions,” she said. “We are working to ensure that Aberthaw power station will be able to operate to the latest emission standards into the 2020s.” SSE operates two coal power stations in Britain, one of which (Ferrybridge) will close in 2016 due in part to the costs of adapting to the IED and a fire. A spokeswoman for the company would not comment on when its Fiddler’s Ferry plant might face closure. “As the UK moves towards a cleaner energy mix coal is gradually being phased out, and the government and other parties have made it clear it doesn’t have a long-term future,” she said."

"I’m not a Catholic, but credit where credit is due: at the very least Tuesday’s arrival in America of the people’s Pope coincided with a small brace of minor miracles on the climate front. Early on Tuesday morning, Divest-Invest announced at press conference in New York that the new total of assets in endowments and portfolios divesting from fossil fuels has topped $2.6t. That’s a 50-fold increase on last year’s number – and the year before that, we had precisely one college on board, with an endowment of $13 million.  That news might have passed somewhat unnoticed except that a handsome lad by the name of Leonardo DeCaprio announced at the same time that he was divesting his own assets and those of his charitable foundation – which for some reason seemed of interest to our planet’s news media, go figure. And then, literally as the papal plane landed, Hillary Clinton completed her long-running metamorphosis on the Keystone pipeline. Before the pipeline review even began, many long years ago, she said she was “inclined to approve” this fuse to one of the planet’s biggest carbon bombs. But as KXL turned into the defining environmental fight of the decade, she went mum. And now, faced with the clear understanding that climate will be a defining issue in next year’s election, she came out in firm opposition to the plan. It’s not really divine intervention that moved the former Secretary of State (who had originally gamed the State Department review process to approve the project). It was hard hard organizing – thousands went to jail, hundreds of thousands marched, millions wrote public comments. And that work has gone far beyond this one pipeline: its helped turn almost every fossil fuel infrastructure project on the planet into a full-on battle. Bernie Sanders played his part too. He’s made no direct criticism of Hillary, but he has pointed out regularly how odd it is she has no position on this key issue. As he rose in the polls, her determination to dodge the issue clearly wavered. But the pope did help too: his powerful encyclical last summer is a reminder to every politician of exactly which way the wind is now blowing. That wind is in the sails of the climate movement now, and so there will be more days like this to come. Whether they come in time to slow the planet’s careening new physics is an open question, but at last the political and financial climate has begun to change almost as fast as the physical one. "
"Pope Francis addressed one of the thorniest issues in American politics on Wednesday with a White House speech explicitly supporting Barack Obama’s plan to cut carbon emissions and chastising climate change deniers for failing in their duty to protect our “common home”. In a tougher-than-expected call for action on global warming, the spiritual leader of more than 70 million American Catholics defied calls among some Republicans to steer clear of politics by making clear he believed this was a moral issue. “Climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation,” said the pope, who invited contrast with the civil rights struggle by invoking the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr in support of his argument. Barack Obama introduced the welcoming ceremony, the pope’s first public event of the six-day trip to the United States, as a moment to “shake our conscience from slumber”. His target audience was less the 11,000 hand-picked visitors crammed onto the south lawn – or even the several thousand more faithful on the neighbouring Ellipse – than the millions of watching Americans who remain sceptical of the need for radical climate action. From the moment his famous cassock materialised under the emblematic White House colonnade on Wednesday, any doubt this would be a deeply political visit by Pope Francis vanished. “Mr President, I find it encouraging that you are proposing an initiative for reducing air pollution,” the pope said with a slow, deliberate delivery that left little room for misinterpretation. And, lest a papal blessing for the Environmental Protection Agency’s new emission control standards not prove a shocking enough incongruity, the pope made clear his view that support was a moral imperative for all Americans.  “I would like all men and women of goodwill in this great nation to support the efforts of the international community to protect the vulnerable in our world and to stimulate integral and inclusive models of development, so that our brothers and sisters everywhere may know the blessings of peace and prosperity which God wills for all his children,” he said to loud applause. Whether Republican opponents of the EPA rule change will consider themselves “men and women of goodwill” in this case will become clearer on Thursday, when the pope is expected to make a similar appeal in a direct address to Congress. In the meantime, the pontiff emphasised his belief that politicians owe a debt not just to the planet and their children, but particularly to the underprivileged in the world seen as most at risk from the effects of global warming. “Such change demands on our part a serious and responsible recognition not only of the kind of world we may be leaving to our children, but also to the millions of people living under a system which has overlooked them,” he said. “Our common home has been part of this group of the excluded which cries out to heaven and which today powerfully strikes our homes, our cities and our societies,” he added. “To use a telling phrase of the Reverend Martin Luther King, we can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note and now is the time to honor it.” Enlisting the spirit of Dr King – a tactic familiar to president Obama, who used his sing-song pulpit voice to rouse the crowd ahead of the pope’s address – was less conventional territory for the Vatican. The remark contained an implicit reference to the US constitution as well as the teachings of the Bible. King originally accused America of defaulting on the “promissory note” in his “I have a dream” speech and suggested African Americans had been given “a bad check” by the founding fathers who promised to grant all men inalienable rights. To this, the pope responded: “We know by faith that the Creator does not abandon us; he never forsakes his loving plan or repents of having created us.” He continued: “Humanity still has the ability to work together in building our common home. As Christians inspired by this certainty, we wish to commit ourselves to the conscious and responsible care of our common home.” The pope’s direct reference to the Obama administration’s new proposed climate change regulations made this address his most politically charged commentary since Francis began his journey to Cuba and the US. While in Havana, he encouraged leaders of both countries to keep striving for reconciliation, but he steered clear of any direct references to political controversies on either side. In Washington, the pope appears willing to be more bold, addressing head-on the major controversies that divide a polarised US political establishment. The pope provoked cheers from the crowd, for example, by reminding them that he too was an immigrant and that America was a country built on immigration – another subject of fierce topical debate in the US. In pre-released drafts of the speech issued by the Vatican, it was hard to tell how much remarks like this would deliver a political punch. But there was something about the slow, deliberate diction of the speech and enthusiastic reaction of the Washington audience that gave these tweaks of the American political consciousness a momentous feel. The pope also made clear he would not shy away from challenging his hosts on other issues too – pointedly pledging to address the “institution of marriage” in future remarks that will be closely scrutinised for criticism of recent US breakthroughs in same-sex marriage equality. More conservative Americans may also draw solace from the pope’s reference to the need to protect religious liberty, something many believe is infringed upon by requiring state officials to recognise same-sex unions despite any personal objections they may have. But the welcoming event on the south lawn concluded with a stirring choral performance that transcended the political elements of the speech. “We love you, Pope Francis,” shouted a lone male voice across the lawn at the end of the ceremony, drawing laughter and applause from the crowd before, once again, a military brass band struck up. Many of the guests at the ticketed event on the south lawn said they saw the pope as a unifying figure. “He is particularly good at bringing young people together who are not necessarily the most devout,” said Katharine Connolly, a 23-year-old law student at Georgetown University. “It’s a once in a lifetime event,” added Alexander Kurien, 51, a government worker also from DC. “I really feel he is a reflection of Christ: he lives by example.” Obama paid tribute to the Pope for “shak[ing] our conscience from slumber” in a warm welcome that made clear the personal bond between the two men and imbued the sunny south lawn with a greater than usual mood of bonhomie. The president also thanked Francis for his diplomatic support for talks between the US and Cuba, although the pope himself did not mention the matter. “We are grateful for your invaluable support of our new beginning with the Cuban people, which holds out the promise of better relations between our countries, greater cooperation across our hemisphere, and a better life for the Cuban people,” said Obama. “Holy Father, you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet – God’s magnificent gift to us,” he added. “We support your call to all world leaders to support the communities most vulnerable to a changing climate and to come together to preserve our precious world for future generations.” But not all observers found the love-in quite as appropriate, including the conservative Catholic website Rorate Caeli: Not sure if that was a speech by the head of the Catholic Church or Al Gore ..."
"An ambitious plan to build a £1bn prototype plant to capture carbon from a coal-fired power station in North Yorkshire is under threat after a key shareholder pulled out. Drax, owner of the country’s biggest single power station, blamed cuts in renewable energy subsidies by ministers for the decision to abandon the White Rose carbon capture and storage (CCS) scheme, triggering a claim that the government energy strategy is “unravelling”.  Alongside the engineering company Alstom and industrial group BOC, Drax was intending to build a new power station next to its existing plant which would capture the CO2 and send it via pipeline for burial in an old North Sea oilfield. Dorothy Thompson, the chief executive of Drax, said her company had been forced to withdraw because changes to the subsidy regime had left it short of cash to invest in the White Rose project. She told the BBC: “The government has removed a tax exemption for renewable power that is sold to industrial companies and we’re the largest generator of renewable power in the UK and this has suddenly removed a stream of income. “The day it was announced our share price dropped by a third and that simply reduces the amount of cash we have available for future investments.”   The consortium, of which Drax was part, said it still wanted to proceed with the scheme and is one of two bidders competing for £1bn of government money to trial CCS on a commercial power station. The only other bidder is Shell and the big six energy supplier SSE, who want to trial CCS at a gas-fired power plant at Peterhead, in Aberdeenshire. Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, said ministers needed to spell out exactly what their policies were in the light of widespread subsidy cuts. She wrote on Twitter:  Ministers must come clean on whether they are abandoning all efforts to secure investment in clean energy in this country. and Nuclear power station delayed, new onshore wind farms blocked, solar support slashed by 90% & now govt's CCS strategy unravelling too. The Department of Energy and Climate Change said it still expected CCS to play a vital role in decarbonising the electricity sector and heavy industry: “The government remains committed to assisting the development of CCS in the UK and to the CCS competition, continuing to negotiate with the two preferred bidders.” But the Trades Union Congress also expressed concern about jobs and investment follwoing the latest blow to Britain’s the green economy. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “This is a very worrying development and shows how government backpedalling on energy and climate policy is costing the UK jobs and investment. The current political uncertainty over our low-carbon future is bad for business, workers and Britain. “We need proper leadership from minsters, not lukewarm support for a greener industrial strategy. The UK has the companies, the scientific knowhow, and potential to lead the world in low-carbon economics – but we need commitment from policymakers to make this happen.”"

"The UK’s £5.8bn ($8.8bn) pledge to help poor nations cope with climate change falls short of the country’s fair share of the burden and the efforts of other European leaders, campaigners have said. The announcement increases the UK’s climate aid by 50% over the five years between 2016 and 2021. Significantly, it will also be scaled up, so that by 2020 the annual finance is £1.76bn ($2.68bn), or close to double the current annual funding. The rich world has promised to contribute $100bn each year by 2020 to help developing countries cope with climate change. The new tranche of UK funding was “compatible with our fair share of the $100bn”, said the energy and climate change secretary Amber Rudd. “The UK is playing its part.” The news was widely welcomed by the NGO community, including Oxfam’s lead advisor on climate change policy, Tim Gore, who said it was a “credible pledge”. But he said that all countries would need to do more. “We want to see the majority of the $100bn to come from public funds,” he said. “If everyone doubles their current commitment that will put us at about $40-50bn per year in 2020 from public finance specifically for climate purposes. The rest would then have to be made up of assumptions about how much private finance countries have successfully ‘mobilised’. The accounting for this is much less clear.”  Oxfam estimates public climate finance today runs somewhere between $17bn and $20bn each year. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) sets the number higher, at $37bn, but Gore said this included projects in which adapting to, or staving off, climate change was not the principal objective. The UK’s increase follows moves by Germany – which doubled its 2020 finance in May, which Oxfam said would reach $4.47bn – and the Asian Development Bank – which has doubled its commitment to an annual $6bn. Last week, China pledged $3.1bn over a non-specific timeframe. France is reportedly also set to increase their commitment to $4bn annually at the UN general assembly in New York on Monday. Other announcements from Sweden and Luxembourg are expected in the coming days. But while the UK joins its European peers in doubling its contribution, Maria Athena Ronquillo-Ballesteros, director of the World Resources Institute sustainable finance programme, noted that it came from a much smaller base. In 2020, France and Germany will be giving approximately twice the UK’s intended contribution. “This is close but definitely not 100% of the UK’s fair share. The UK needs to do more together with other donor countries but this is a significant gesture to raise ambition, and especially during a time of austerity,” she said. “Comparing countries is really difficult,” said Gore’s German colleague Jan Kowalzig. “There is no definition what is climate finance and what isn’t.”  He said German climate finance included “a lot of rather traditional development assistance that is now increasingly made climate-proof” and France’s accounting included a lot of subsidised loans.  “If one looks at what the French budget provides (some of it to make loans concessional) then the French amount is much smaller,” he said. It is a common misconception that the $100bn total is intended to come solely from the budgets of developed countries. Instead, it will involve a combination of private and public capital, as well as contributions from development banks. Speaking to the Guardian earlier this month, Hela Cheikhrouhou, head of the Green Climate Fund, the UN body set up to dispense climate finance donations, said public money can often leverage an additional two to three times as much private capital investment in a project. Funnelling $100bn into the response to climate change every year may seem a lofty target. But economist Jeffrey Sachs recently said this was “relatively a modest number” (it represents just 0.2% of OECD GDP).  To avoid a 2C increase in global temperature, as governments have pledged to do, the World Economic Forum estimates that $5tn of investments currently earmarked for infrastructure development by 2020 will have to be tailored towards a greener future, plus another $700bn of additional “green” funding. Smita Nakhooda, climate finance leader at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) said the $100bn target was a “crucially important” carrot that would draw trillions of dollars away from high-polluting projects. “The private climate finance challenge is much bigger than figuring out what share of the $100bn comes from private or public sources,” she said. Where the money comes from is as important as the raw numbers. Climate finance currently takes up about 17% of global overseas aid, said Gore, and the share is increasing.  In the UK, the money will come from within an existing overseas development assistance (ODA) cap of 0.7% of gross national income – so somewhere people in need may have their aid cut so the UK can fulfil its commitment to pay for the damage it has done to the climate. The UK argues that it is the only G7 country currently meeting the agreed 0.7% target for foreign aid, but others are concerned that this misses the point of ‘climate justice’. “This increase is being funded from within the existing ODA levels, so more to climate change must mean less to other sectors – it is not new money,” said Romilly Greenhill, team leader for development finance at the ODI. “This is problematic since climate change imposes additional costs on developing countries,” said Gore. “The bare minimum needed is that new pledges of climate finance do not divert existing ODA flows in other areas – they should at least be part of a rising ODA budget, rising at least as fast as the increase in climate finance to ensure no diversion.”"
"Watching another episode on Netflix, reading the Guardian online and downloading apps are not obvious ways to pollute the atmosphere. But collectively, our growing appetite for digital services means the datacentres that power them are now responsible for about 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a similar share to aviation.  Varying from a small room with servers to vast farms with a floor area of 150,000 sq m, datacentres are big energy users. As well as requiring power to run the equipment that stores and serves us cloud computing and on-demand music, films and entertainment, those servers also generate a lot of heat and require huge amounts of energy to keep them cool. That’s why big data users such as Facebook are siting their centres in cool climates such as northern Sweden. Individually, our everyday browsing has a relatively minuscule impact. Google, in response to claims that each search on its site generated as much CO2 as boiling half the water for a cup of coffee (7g), calculated the true figure was much lower, at 0.2g. Watching a YouTube video of cats was higher – 1g for every 10 minutes of viewing – while using Gmail for a year produced about 1.2kg a user. Not to be outdone, Facebook put a figure on its average user’s annual footprint – 269g of CO2, roughly equivalent to the carbon footprint of a cup of coffee. But with the technology giants’ billions of users worldwide, those numbers scale up quickly. Google’s carbon footprint was 1,766,014 tonnes CO2 equivalent in 2013, and the bulk of that was from datacentres. As with emissions from air travel, the real issue with datacentres is the rate at which they are growing.  “It’s an exponential growth in data,” said Sophia Flucker, a director at Operational Intelligence, a UK-based consultancy that advises datacentres on their energy use.  “Although IT efficiency is improving, and we can do more with less power, the demand is still there,” she said. “Any efficiency gains are being eaten up by demand. It’s very much an upward trajectory.” The industry claims improvements in energy efficiency and technology mean it can “decouple” economic growth and emissions, so that it could keep growing while keeping the sector’s share of global emissions in 2030 at roughly the same as they are today. But Greenpeace, which has reported for several years on datacentres’ environmental performance, says energy efficiency improvements can do only so much. How tomorrow’s datacentres are powered is key when it comes to climate change, it says. “Energy efficiency is of course very important,” said Gary Cook, senior IT analyst at Greenpeace. “It’s critical. It’s also completely insufficient on its own. If you look at the growth in datacentre demand and our digital world, energy efficiency will slow the [emissions] curve, but the curve is still going to the moon.” He said datacentres could become either a villain as an increasing source of emissions, or a driver for the take-up of clean energy sources, such as wind and solar. “If they’re built in the right way, it could be a great story and help the transition [to renewable energy]. If they’re built in the wrong way, it’s going to take us in the other direction, and increase our dependence on the sources of energy we have to move away from to address climate change.” "

"Sardines were once extraordinarily abundant in the south-west of England, leading one 19th-century guidebook to say: “Pursued by predaceous hordes of dogfish, hake and cod, and greedy flocks of seabirds, they advance towards the land in such amazing numbers as actually to impede the passage of vessels and to discolour the sea as far as the eye can reach … Of a sudden they will vanish from view and then again approach the coast in such compact order and overwhelming force that numbers will be pushed ashore by the moving hosts in the rear. In 1836 a shoal extended in a compact body from Fowey to the Land’s End, a distance of at least 100 miles if we take into consideration the windings of the shore.” (Handbook for Travellers in Devon and Cornwall, John Murray and Thomas Clifton Paris, 1851). Today people travel thousands of miles to dive and film such scenes, not realising they were once commonplace on our own coasts. Last week the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Zoological Society of London issued their most comprehensive look at the state of life in the sea. The report makes uncomfortable reading. Taking in more than 1,000 species worldwide and 5,000 populations of fish, turtles, marine mammals and a host of others, it draws the bleak conclusion that there is only half the amount of wildlife in the sea today as in 1970.  Although 1970 is their baseline year and seems long ago, life in the sea has been in decline for much longer. In short, that means the picture is worse than the report suggests. And the waters around Britain demonstrate the same patterns that are slashing fish stocks around the world. The first well-documented herring fishery collapse around the UK was off East Anglia in the mid-1950s, followed by that in Scotland’s Firth of Clyde in the 1960s. An abundance of small fish attracted the attention of larger creatures, as the above passage shows. Fishermen found the great herring shoals by following the “signs” of those better able to search for them: seabirds raining attacks from the sky, blowing whales, leaping dolphins, the thrashing of thresher shark tails; there was always a frenzy somewhere along the coast. The seas of the early 19th century and before had an exuberance of life it is hard for us to comprehend today, so long has it been since anybody saw it. Huge fish also prowled the seabed. Common skate and halibut metres long and weighing 50kg or more were present in enormous numbers. Early photographs of fish markets around the UK show these fish covering the floor like great paving stones. Pictures of seaside towns show cod, ling and hake each more than a metre long laid out for sale after being caught from small boats within a few miles of shore. There was a much greater diversity of large creatures in catches then. Animals such as wolffish, with their fabulous striped and spotted flanks, lurked in caves and rock piles. Conger eels were abundant too. Our cartoon view of the conger eel now is of a toothsome beast whose eyes twinkle from the portholes of sunken ships. The reason that wreck fishing is one of the most popular forms of sea angling is that these places are avoided by bottom trawlers, giving them de facto protection. Where trawling occurs, congers are scarce. It was bottom trawling that led to decline. Trawlers catch fish by dragging their nets over the seabed. It is not hard to imagine the damage this did to the great fields of invertebrates that lived on the bottom, including corals, sponges, seafans, sea nettles, oysters and hundreds of others. While big fish were the mainstay of net and hook-and-line fisheries from the middle ages to the early 19th century, they declined rapidly with the spread of trawling, especially when steam power was added in the 1880s and 90s. A recent analysis of catch records shows that the amount of fish caught by trawlers for every unit of power expended has declined 25 times from the 1860s to the present. The simple reason is because there is less life in the sea. Studies like that of the WWF/ZSL list climate change high among the threats that afflict ocean life. While this is certainly true now, and it will become increasingly problematic in future, the primary driver of decline to date is overfishing. To get a true picture of fishing’s impact, you have to take the long view. Ask an EU official for the latest stock estimate of common skate, and you would get a puzzled look. We no longer fish commercially for species such as common skate because there are hardly any left, so we no longer bother counting them and their disappearance goes unremarked. But fishing carried on long after the skates, halibut, wolf-fish, angel sharks, bluefin tuna, thresher sharks, porbeagle, sturgeon and wild salmon – the list is a long one – dwindled to irrelevance. What is not widely known among those outside the fishing industry is that managers deliberately aim to reduce stock sizes of the fish we eat. Cutting the amount of fish in a stock frees up resources for the others, so they grow faster. This theory, developed in the mid-20th century, says that maximum productivity is reached when you reduce a stock by half, a point called the maximum sustainable yield. Fishing at MSY was recently embedded in the reformed European fisheries policy, which should have been a good thing given that stocks have been so depleted. But behind the scenes, fisheries scientists have gradually eroded target stock levels, arguing that for many stocks MSY is reached when they have been reduced by 70% or 80%. At these low levels though, we are on dangerous ground. When life is brought low, there are unwanted and unanticipated knock-on effects. Predators like tuna, sharks, porpoises and whales are not mere embellishments, nice to have but not critical if lost. They once regulated the abundance of their prey and weeded out diseased and parasite-laden creatures before populations became seriously affected. They were important in cycling nutrients through ocean ecosystems, shuttling them from the depths to the surface where sunshine and plants could turn them into the energy that feeds all life in the sea. Seabed life, those waving fields of invertebrates swept aside by trawls, – captured carbon and sequestered it into the sediments. They kept the water clean, boosting photosynthesis, and removed pathogens and pollutants we put in the sea. So if you are wondering whether it matters that life in the sea has gone down, the answer is yes. In the long term, it is a matter of life and death to all of us. The oceans are vast. Once we thought they were too big to suffer anything other than minor damage at our hands. We know that is no longer true. Human influence reaches every part of the ocean, from the distant high seas to the deepest abyss. What we are just beginning to understand is that they are too big for us to let them fail. The oceans have colossal importance in keeping our planet habitable. If they fail, so do we. Fortunately, there is still time to do something about it. The great majority of species that have declined are still present somewhere. With the right kind of protection, we could bring them back. Many marine protected areas are springing up around the UK. Scotland established 30 in 2014, and England has 27, with more on the way. Unfortunately, there is still little appetite to introduce the high level of protection our seas need. Experience from other parts of the world shows that life rebounds when we stop catching or killing it, and the best way to do this is to create protected areas closed to all fishing. The government created more than half a million sq km of such protection around the Chagos Islands in the middle of the Indian Ocean and has promised another around Pitcairn. But only 7.5 sq km of the 750,000 sq km around the UK receives the same treatment. If we want life to thrive again nearer home, we must learn to treasure our own waters as highly.

"Every day for sixty million years, seabirds have performed mind-boggling acts of derring-do: circumnavigating the globe without rest, diving more than 200 meters in treacherous seas for a bite of lunch, braving the most unpredictable weather on the planet as if it were just another Tuesday and finding their way home in waters with few, if any, landmarks.  But now seabirds, like so many other species, may have met their match.   Conservationists have long known that many seabird populations are in decline, but a recent paper in PLOS ONE finds the situation worse than anticipated. According to the researchers, seabird abundance has dropped 69.7% in just 60 years – representing the deaths of some 230 million animals.  “I was very surprised with the result, it was considerably greater than I’d expected,” said Edd Hammill, co-author of the paper, with Utah State University. “What we should take away from this is that something is serious amiss in the oceans.” Ben Lascelles, a Senior Marine Officer with Birdlife International, who was not involved in the study, said he found the research alarming because the decline appeared practically indiscriminate, hitting a “large number of species across a number of families.”  Seabirds, which include any bird that depends largely on the marine environment, comprise nearly 350 species worldwide – an astonishing variety of extreme-loving birds. For example, the indefatigable wandering albatross, which sports the largest wingspan on the planet; the child-sized Emperor penguin, the only bird that breeds during the Antarctic winter; and the tiny storm petrel that practically capers on the water as it feeds – they are named for St. Peter after all.  But, given that seabirds inhabit both the open ocean and the shoreline, this eclectic mix of birds faces a litany of threats: overfishing, drowning in fishing lines or nets, plastic pollution, invasive species like rats in nesting areas, oil and gas development and toxic pollution moving up the food chain. And as if these weren’t enough, the double-whammy of climate change and ocean acidification threatens to flood nesting sites and disrupt food sources.  “Seabirds are particularly good indicators of the health of marine ecosystems,” explained lead author, Michelle Paleczny with the University of British Columbia and the Sea Around Us Project. “When we see this magnitude of seabird decline, we can see there is something wrong with marine ecosystems. It gives us an idea of the overall impact we’re having.” Bu with such a large number of species across such a wide variety of environment one is left asking: how did the scientists count so many birds?  First, the team of researchers scoured all the population data on seabirds available. They found demographic data on 3,213 populations. But they couldn’t use all of theses counts, since conservationists had surveyed many of these far-flung populations just once or twice – not enough to show a real trend  The team eventually selected 513 populations that had been counted at least five times. In all, these populations represented about 19 percent of the world’s seabirds.  Still, Hammil said he believes the team’s findings “are an accurate representation of what is happening worldwide.” He added, “although we did not include every population, all seabird families were included, and we included populations from every major coastline in the world.”  Paleczny also said that when the researchers looked at the differences between monitored and unmonitored populations, they saw “no evidence that the monitored populations are declining more.” The findings are also bolstered by past research. In 2012 a paper in Bird Conservation International found that 28 percent of seabird species are threatened with extinction with 47 percent in decline. This meant, in all, seabirds were about twice as likely as land-based birds to be threatened with extinction.  “The trends for many seabird species have clearly been downwards for a number of years, and this paper provides further evidence of this,” Lascelles said.  Still, Paleczny and Hammil’s research arguably paints an even more alarming picture of the state of the world’s seabirds. For example, according to them, the tern family has fallen by 85%, frigatebirds by 81%, petrels and shearwaters by 79%, and albatrosses by 69%.  Such dismal findings point to one of the study’s patterns: open ocean birds – such as albatrosses, frigatebirds, petrels and shearwaters – are generally faring worse than birds that stick near the coasts. “[Open-ocean] seabirds are hit especially hard due to their large geographic ranges. Because these species travel so far, there is a greater chance they will encounter threats,” said Hammill who noted that coastal birds “in some cases” are doing better because of improved management of breeding areas and improved fishing gear.  But even when threats were minimised, Lascelles noted that recovery requires diligence and patience.  “Most seabirds are long-lived and slow reproducing, this means even quite small increases in mortality can lead to significant population declines, which they take a long time to recover from.” And even some widely-dispersed coastal birds are undergoing heavy declines. For example, the study found that cormorant and shag populations have fallen by 73%.  Given all the threats facing the world’s seabirds, it’s fair to ask: where do we start when it comes to conservation? “We already have solutions to many of the threats...it’s just they need scaling up and implementing across industries and geographies,” Lascelles said. “Increased efforts should be made to rid seabird colonies of invasive species, reduce bycatch in fisheries or the ensnaring of birds in fish nets, and setting up conservation areas.” Paleczny also called for the creation of international marine protected areas to cover the wide ranges of seabirds.  Protected areas in the oceans lag far behind those on land. Currently, only 2% of the world’s oceans are under some form of protection and less than half of those ban fishing altogether. In contrast, nearly 15% of the world’s terrestrial landscape is protected.  With so little of the ocean theoretically closed to fisheries – less than 1% – it’s hardly shocking that many seabirds are suffering from overfishing. Indeed, an illuminating study from 2012 found that whenever fish abundance dropped below one-third of maximum levels, seabird populations began to fall in response.  “What this is saying is that [seabirds] have evolved to exploit average to above-average feeding conditions,” co-author Ian Boyd told Mongabay in 2012. “This isn’t really very surprising, but some things don’t become obvious until the evidence is right in front of you.” At the time, Boyd said their findings should result in a new campaign to save “one third for the birds” (and other marine predators) from the world’s fisheries.  But to Hammill the “most pressing issue” is plastic pollution.  Long neglected by environmentalists – perhaps due to the intractability of the problem – the issue of plastic pollution in the oceans has been slowly getting more notice. A paper released last month found that 90% of the world’s seabirds likely have plastic in their stomachs.  “I have seen everything from cigarette lighters...to bottle caps to model cars. I’ve found toys [inside seabird guts],” co-author Denise Hardesty, with CSIRO, told the Associated Press.  Seabirds continually mistake plastic for fish eggs, devouring large amounts. Plastic in animals’ stomachs not only release deadly toxins, but can also lead to slow starvation by obstructing the animals’ bowels. Birds even feed plastic bits to their young, killing their fledglings en masse.  In the end, large-scale actions to help seabirds could also go a long way in cleaning-up our increasingly trashed marine ecosystems.  “The oceans are still woefully under protected and fisheries need greater management and enforcement. All of these activities need investment and support of governments around the world to make them happen,” Lascelles said. “These actions will build resilience in the seabird populations in the short term, which they need in the face of emerging threats such as climate change.” "
"Nearly a dozen Republican members of Congress will break ranks with leaders of their party on Thursday, and call for action against climate change. The mini-rebellion a week before the pope visits Congress appears timed to ratchet up the pressure on Republican presidential candidates and congressional leaders to soften a party line of casting doubt – or simply denying – the existence of climate change.  So far, at least 10 House Republicans have signed on to the resolution acknowledging that human activity contributes to climate change, and calling for actions to respond to the threat of climate change. The res­ol­u­tion was drafted by Chris Gibson, a former US army colonel and congressman from New York who is not seeking re-election. The resolution, calling for “conservative environment stewardship” was endorsed by representatives Ileana Ros-Le­htin­en and Car­los Cur­belo of Flor­ida, Robert Dold of Illinois, Dave Reich­ert of Wash­ing­ton, Pat Mee­han, Ry­an Cos­tello, and Mike Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, and Richard Hanna and Elise Stefanik of New York, according to the National Journal. A number of those representatives are also not seeking re-election or are from moderate districts. Campaigners who have been working for months to break Republicans’ blanket climate denial said they were hoping for more converts. Catholic climate activists said on Wednesday they were planning to deliver copies of the pope’s encyclical on climate change – a sweeping denunciation of environmental degradation and global inequality – to each of the 166 Republican members of Congress. Church leaders were also pushing Congress to support Barack Obama’s climate change plan and fund climate aid for developing countries. “It gives us a more dynamic entry to treat the issue,” Oscar Cantu, the bishop of Las Cruces, told a news conference in Washington. It is unclear how the Republican leadership will respond. The party has vowed to defeat Barack Obama’s plan to cut carbon pollution from power plants, the pillar of his plan to fight climate change. The House speaker, John Boehner, has sidestepped the issue of climate change, saying: “I am not a scientist.” A number of Republican presidential candidates including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas deny the existence of climate change. Others, such as former senator Rick Santorum and former governor Jeb Bush have called on the pope to steer clear of the issue – although Bush later softened his language. Democrats and campaigners had been quietly cultivating moderate house Republicans for months to try to neutralise the highly partisan profile of energy and climate change issues. The pope, and his framing of climate change as a moral issue – rather than an economic or scientific concern – provided the perfect opportunity, according to Alan Lowenthal, a Democratic member of the House from California and a leader of the Safe Climate Caucus. “Behind the scenes there are Republicans who understand they cannot be in denial and we are being supportive of them,” he said in an interview last June around the time of the pope’s pastoral letter on climate change. “They care what the future is. They just find it difficult to be out there all alone, and maybe this will give them the courage to move forward.” By any standards outside of those of Republicans in Congress – where a majority denies the human contribution to climate change, or opposes action on climate change – the resolution would be seen as exceedingly timid. It calls on the house to “study and address the causes and effects of measured changes to our global and regional climates”. The formulation is bound to outrage some because there is no doubt that climate change is caused by rising concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The resolution also limits the potential scope of any action, saying efforts to deal with climate change should not impose any costs on the economy. But after five years in which Republicans have blocked all efforts to deal with climate change, it’s a start."

"Indonesia, one of the world’s biggest carbon polluters, said it would cut greenhouse gas emissions 29% by 2030 compared to what it is currently on course for. The announcement on Thursday was one of the last big climate plans from a rapidly-developing economy to be unveiled ahead of a summit in Paris in December aimed at limiting warming to 2C.  Indonesia said it was prepared to cut emissions by 41% from a ‘business as usual trajectory’ if it received financial and technological support from industrialised countries. Jakarta put the price tag on that support at $6bn (£4bn). But the World Resources Institute (WRI), a leading environmental thinktank, said it was near-impossible to judge the scale of Indonesia’s ambition or how it would actually meet those goals because the country was so vague in its plan. “It doesn’t include a lot of information,” said Taryn Fransen, who leads the Open Climate network at WRI. “The current version does not allow for any accountability because it is simply not transparent enough.” Most developing countries have been more forthcoming about what they mean by a “business as usual” scenario, she said.  Indonesia’s plan also set a relatively low bar for moving from fossil fuel to cleaner energy sources, setting a target of just 23% of energy coming from renewable sources by 2030.  Indonesia is ranked the world’s sixth biggest producer of greenhouse gas emissions, because of the destruction of its rainforests and carbon-rich peatlands for palm oil and paper plantations. A strong climate promise from the country is critical to fighting global warming. Indonesia, a coal producer, has also been leaning more heavily on coal for energy generation, after China drastically cut imports. Coal shipments to China have fallen by close to 50%, according to Greenpeace, while local coal use doubled in the six years ending in 2014. Coal now makes up about 35% of domestic electricity, according to Greenpeace.  Indonesia’s promise before Paris lagged behind other developing countries such as Mexico and South Korea, which have been clear about spelling out their emissions reductions targets to the UN. So far, only three other countries have been as hazy about spelling out their business as usual scenarios and they are all much smaller than Indonesia: Benin, Gabon, and Trinidad and Tobago. Indonesia committed four years ago to stop opening up new forests and peatlands for plantation expansion – but huge swathes of forest are cut down and burnt each summer to clear land for corporate development or oil palm plantations.  WRI said Indonesia needed a ban on all future forest clearance, including licences that were awarded some years ago, and have yet to be activated.  “If Indonesia wanted to seriously protect its land and reduce carbon emissions than it needs a permanent moratorium,” said Andhyta Utami, a research analyst at WRI in Jakarta.  Indonesia’s vast swathes of forests and peatlands are one of the most important carbon stores. When these are cut down, or drained and burned, to make way for plantations, carbon dioxide is released.

"Melbourne and Sydney have joined an international coalition of cities that have committed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and advocate for action on climate change.  Australia’s two largest urban areas are among 10 new cities added to the Compact of Mayors – a UN-backed initiative launched last year by Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York. A total of 165 cities, representing 234m people, have signed up to the compact so far, including New York, London, Berlin, Jakarta and Rio de Janeiro. The US president, Barack Obama, has set a goal of 100 American cities to sign up to the compact before global climate talks in Paris later this year. Melbourne is in a race with Adelaide to become the world’s first zero net emissions city, with a target to reach this by 2020. The city has retrofitted more than 540 commercial buildings to become more sustainable in their use of resources over the past five years. Sydney has a goal to slash emissions by 70% by 2030 based on 2006 levels. It also aims to improve the energy efficiency of its buildings by 31% by 2030. Melbourne councils have a plan to buy renewable energy directly from solar and wind suppliers, while Sydney has a host of measures in place such as changing lighting to LEDs, and is installing solar panels on a range of public buildings. The Compact of Mayors requires that participant cities have ambitious plans to cut their own emissions, while also acting as advocates for climate action. It is estimated that the world’s cities produce about 75% of the world’s emissions and consume a majority of the planet’s natural resources. “In Australia, two-thirds of us live in cities – and by 2056, they will house another 10m people,” said Clover Moore, lord mayor of Sydney.  “We’re already delivering significant action on climate change and slashing carbon emissions in the heart of the nation’s largest city. Our commitment to this compact with city leaders from around the world reinforces our commitment to the Sydney community to take action on climate change.” Robert Doyle, Melbourne’s lord mayor, added: “You can’t be the world’s most liveable city without careful attention to two elements – the prosperity and sustainability of the city. “With the landmark climate conference in Paris approaching, the actions taken by cities at a local level will have a global impact.”  Bloomberg said that participant cities were making a “major contribution” in the global effort to ensure that the planet didn’t warm 2C beyond pre-industrial levels.   “They are also showing their national governments that more ambitious goals are both possible and achievable,” he said. “And – perhaps most importantly of all – they are proving that fighting climate change and increasing economic growth go hand in hand.”"
"Some of the world’s largest businesses have today announced plans to fully transition to using renewable electricity, providing a further boost to the global renewables market. Nine well-known firms – Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Goldman Sachs, Nike, Starbucks, Salesforce, Steelcase, Voya Financial and Walmart – will today used the annual Climate Week in New York to announce they have joined the global campaign RE100, which encourages businesses to source 100% renewable power.  All the firms have pledged to secure all their electricity from renewable sources, although the time periods for achieving the new target varies by company. For example, Goldman Sachs has pledged to source all its electricity from renewable sources by 2020, while Nike has pledged to go fully renewable by 2025. Similarly, Len Sauers, vice president of global sustainability at Procter & Gamble, said the firm was aiming to source 30% of its energy from renewables by 2020, with a longer-term aim to be fully powered by renewable energy later down the line. “Efforts like RE100 are key to helping scale efforts and allow peer-to-peer networking with like-minded companies,” he said. Mark Kenber, chief executive of NGO The Climate Group, said companies that commit to investing in low-carbon power will see significant business benefits. “Lowering risk, protecting against price rises, saving millions and boosting brand is what shaping a low carbon economy is all about,” he said. “Today these companies are signalling loud and clear to COP21 negotiators that forward-thinking businesses back renewables and want to see a strong climate deal in Paris.” The nine new RE100 members join the likes of IKEA, Unilever and Marks & Spencer, which have all previously committed to sourcing all their power from renewables. In addition, life sciences and materials company Royal DSM joined RE100 earlier this week, while fragrance creator Givaudan and environmental and industrial measurement firm Vaisala joined last week. In total, 36 companies have now joined RE100 since its launch in 2014. The news follows a high-profile update on the global divestment push, which was announced on Tuesday at the launch of New York Climate Week. Leonardo DiCaprio became the latest high-profile figure to announce he is to divest his multi-million dollar fortune, as new figures revealed total fossil fuel divestment pledges have now exceeded $2.6tn globally. Yesterday also saw the UN launch a new initiative, dubbed Climate Neutral Now, which is designed to encourage more firms and individuals to offset their emissions using UN-approved carbon credits."
"The UK risks missing its carbon targets and harming investment because of a string of recent cuts to green measures, ministers have been warned by the government’s statutory climate advisers. Lord Deben, the chairman of the committee on climate change and a former Conservative environment minister, has written a strongly-worded letter to energy secretary Amber Rudd to tell her that the government is creating confusion among potential investors in the low carbon economy.  His words chimed with those of John Cridland, director general of the CBI and widely regarded as the most senior voice in British business, who on Monday said the government was sending a “a worrying signal about the UK as a place for low-carbon investment”. Deben wrote: “The government has made a series of announcements about existing low-carbon policies. Unfortunately, these have been widely interpreted to have reduced the action being taken to meet the clear commitment to carbon budgets. They have, in some areas, left a policy gap which urgently needs to be addressed. As a package, they have raised questions over the future direction of low-carbon policies.” The lack of long-term signals from government “could well lead to stop-start investment, higher costs and a risk that targets to reduce emissions will be missed”, he warned. In a highly unusual move from the chairman of the climate change committee, he referred to several current government policies that he said were of concern. These included the scrapping of the “green deal” on insulation, with no indication of any replacement and the abolition of the “zero carbon homes” standard, also without a replacement. Deben wrote: “The UK’s ability to meet carbon budgets at least cost depends on firms and households making long-term investments and decisions based on how they think UK policy will unfold over a 10-15 year period. From that perspective, the announcements potentially present problems as the cumulative impression has been of a weakening of the policy framework. This is largely because the ending of measures has not been accompanied by a clear statement about what improved measures will be put in place.” He also asked about the government’s plans for phasing out coal-fired power generation, which ministers are supposedly agreed to, but on which the government has so far been silent. “It would be particularly useful were the Government to set out its plans for achieving this, which should be possible with minimal impact on energy bills,” he wrote in his letter, dated 22 September. With regard to the government’s controversial moves to cut support for renewable energy, he pointed out that “these new technologies are often competing against incumbents who do not pay their full cost and that innovation through all stages often requires public support. It is essential therefore that funding is not withdrawn too early.” The government has slashed support for solar power, and all but ended the building of new onshore wind farms, while increasing taxpayer funded support for oil and gas, from both the North Sea and fracking. In as statement, the Department of Energy and Climate Change replied to Lord Deben’s letter: “We are determined to reduce emissions in the most cost-effective way whilst keeping bills as low as possible for hardworking families and businesses. Government support has already driven down the cost of renewable energy significantly, helping technologies to stand on their own two feet.  “As costs continue to fall it becomes easier for parts of the renewables industry to survive without subsidies. This doesn’t detract from the fact that we are pushing for a strong global deal in Paris [the UN climate summit in November and December] that creates a level playing field for business and drives innovation.”"
"Ioane Teitiota has been in custody in Mount Eden Prison, one of two private prisons in New Zealand, after his bid to claim climate change refugee status was dismissed last week.  He was arrested by police and immigration officials at his West Auckland home on Tuesday morning for overstaying his permit.  He has been ordered to remain in custody until his flight, or for a further seven days in case of complications. At the Waitakere district court on Monday, Judge Stan Thorburn said there was no dispute that Teitiota was in New Zealand illegally and only came to be noticed on an unrelated police matter. “Today it appears he has pursued all avenues open to him through the judicial and tribunal process and has failed.” The judge said the district court was not a forum where the complex matters of the case could be addressed; he could only grant an order to release Teitiota from custody. “It seems to me that the intent must be at large that if there was no warrant of commitment and he was released on conditions, he would evade deportation on 23 September.” Teitiota’s family, from Kiribati, have fought numerous legal battles to stay in New Zealand as climate change refugees rather than return to the island nation, which is threatened by rising sea levels. Immigration New Zealand said there was no point releasing Teitiota so close to his deportation date as there was a risk he would go to ground and avoid the Wednesday afternoon flight which had been booked for him. Immigration New Zealand has also booked Teitiota’s family on the same flight if they were to co-operate, which it said hadn’t happened yet. Teitiota’s lawyer Michael Kidd said he supported the government’s recent decision to welcome more Syrian refugees but it was ignoring those left stranded in its own backyard.  He said any appeals to the United Nations and appeals to MP Phil Twyford’s office would stop with a deportation as he would not have access to his client. Kidd also delivered a petition to Judge Thorburn from the Kiribati community, though the judge said he was not sure it would be appropriate to receive that, as his powers as a district court judge were limited.  Teitiota and his family are desperate to stay in New Zealand, saying they don’t want to return to their polluted and potentially dangerous home country. He was denied bail on Thursday and was therefore able to be held in custody for up to 96 hours.  Teitiota’s latest effort to persuade New Zealand’s highest court fell flat in July, when the supreme court said Teitiota and his family did not qualify as refugees. “In relation to the refugee convention, while Kiribati undoubtedly faces challenges, Mr Teitiota does not, if returned, face ‘serious harm’ and there is no evidence that the government of Kiribati is failing to take steps to protect its citizens from the effects of environmental degradation to the extent that it can,” the court’s decision said. Kidd said Teitiota and his family feared returning to the Pacific Island nation, which was threatened by the effects of global warming. He said there was still hope to pursue further avenues over the next two days. Teitiota, his wife and their three New Zealand-born children were in the process of mounting their appeal when he was arrested. Kidd said he believed the family had a strong case under the United Nations international covenant on civil and political rights, which New Zealand had voluntarily signed. If Teitiota’s children were forced to return to Kiribati “his children will doubtlessly fall ill” as they were not used to the water pollution and human waste contamination, Kidd said. “New Zealand is returning him and his family to a situation where there is danger from a number of things, such as rising sea levels and pollution of fresh water and the possibility of cyclones destroying the place.” Teitiota was also unlikely to be able to get a job in Kiribati and would have to rely on family, who were also struggling. Teitiota and his wife came to New Zealand in 2007 and remained after their permits expired in October 2010. Although their three children were born in New Zealand, none of them are entitled to New Zealand citizenship. Outside court Kidd said the only thing that could stop deportation now would be a letter from the minister, which he would try for. He said the judge had summed up the matter well but he felt as though the courts were passing the buck on this case."

" Hillary Clinton completed the biggest environmental conversion of her presidential campaign to date on Tuesday, pronouncing herself opposed to the controversial Keystone XL pipeline as a “distraction” in the fight against climate change. Clinton’s newfound stated position on Keystone – offered up during an event in Iowa – follows months in which she has refused to divulge her views on the controversial project, claiming it would be inappropriate as a former member of Barack Obama’s administration. On Tuesday, the former secretary of state abruptly changed course, telling a student at Drake University in Des Moines that she now opposed the project. “I think it is imperative that we look at the Keystone pipeline as what I believe it is, a distraction from the important work we have to do to combat climate change, and unfortunately from my perspective one that interferes with our ability to move forward to deal with all the other issues,” Clinton said. “Therefore, I oppose it and I oppose It because I don’t think it’s in the best interest of what we need to do to combat climate change.” Campaigners said Clinton’s about-face gave Obama additional reasons to reject the project. “We’ve taken a top-tier presidential candidate’s ‘inclination to approve’ Keystone XL, and turned it into yet another call for rejection,” May Boeve, the director of 350.org, said in a statement. “Today’s news is a huge win for our movement, and ups the pressure even more on President Obama to reject the Keystone pipeline once and for all.” Responding to Clinton’s intervention, TransCanada said in a statement that its focus “remains on securing a permit to build Keystone XL”. “Pipelines are the safest and least greenhouse gas-intensive way to transport needed Canadian and American crude oil to Americans – safer than rail,” the company claimed.  Clinton, as secretary of state, came under attack from campaigners for saying in 2010 that she was inclined to support the project, and for promoting fracking abroad. On the campaign trail, however, Clinton had claimed it would be inappropriate to express her views on Keystone given her recent service in Barack Obama’s administration. Hillary Clinton has refrained from making her position public before now because, as the secretary of state who initiated the review of the Keystone XL pipeline, she is in a unique position compared to other candidates.  Clinton’s campaign aide, who emailed reporters on the condition of anonymity, repeated that excuse, but did not say why the Democratic frontrunner had chosen to break her silence now – other to say “she owes it to the American people to make it clear where she stands on this issue”. In Iowa, Clinton she said the process had dragged on for so long – seven years – that it was time to go on the record with her views. “I thought this would be decided now, and I could tell you whether I agreed or disagreed. But it hasn’t been decided,” she said. Clinton’s comments, of course, arrived at the start of a six-day papal visit to the US that is putting the focus squarely on climate change. They also mark the second time in a month that she has tried to stake out a more liberal position than Obama on the environment. Her opposition to Keystone XL appeared intended to blunt attacks on Clinton from insurgent candidate Bernie Sanders, who is mounting a solid challenge against the frontrunner in Iowa and New Hampshire. While in Obama’s cabinet, Clinton had signalled support for the project to transport crude from the Alberta tar sands to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, telling an audience in San Francisco in October 2010 she was “inclined” to give TransCanada, the Canadian pipeline company, the go-ahead to expand Keystone. “We’re either going to be dependent on dirty oil from the Gulf or dirty oil from Canada,” she said at the time. In 2010, those views reflected the political mainstream but in the heat of a primary campaign they left Clinton open to criticism from liberal Democrats. Sanders was quick to point out on Tuesday that his opposition to the Keystone pipeline has been longstanding.  “As a senator who has vigorously opposed the Keystone pipeline from the beginning, I am glad that Secretary Clinton finally has made a decision and I welcome her opposition to the pipeline,” he said. “Clearly it would be absurd to encourage the extraction and transportation of some of the dirtiest fossil fuel on the planet.”. Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland who is also seeking the Democratic nomination, called out Clinton for political caution. “I oppose #KeystoneXL because it’s bad for our environment and we need to move to a clean energy future,” O’Malley said on Twitter. “Leadership is about forging public opinion, not following it. On #KeystoneXL, @HillaryClinton has followed.” Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who is seeking the Republican nomination, waited no time to attack his Democratic rival, saying her decision confirms that she “favors environmental extremists over US jobs”. .@HillaryClinton finally says what we already knew. She favors environmental extremists over U.S. jobs. #KeystoneXL https://t.co/KOhVPPj8xm Over the years, campaigners have used the pipeline as a powerful organising symbol, arguing the transport network would further unlock the vast reserves of the Alberta tar sands, and set the world on a course of dangerous climate change. In recent months, however, as low oil prices reduced the economic viability of further tar sands expansion, campaign groups have turned away from Keystone and shifted their energies to opposing Obama’s decision to allow Shell to hunt for oil in the Arctic. Clinton has been charting out a new course on the Arctic as well, making a definitive break with Obama on his policy. In a tweet last August, a day after Obama gave final approval to Shell drilling in the Chukchi sea, Clinton said: “The Arctic is a unique treasure. Given what we know, it’s not worth the risk of drilling. However, it is unclear if Clinton’s opposition to Arctic drilling, and support of Keystone pipeline, will assuage liberals who accuse her of political maneuvering in the face of a surprisingly successful challenge from Sanders.  While declaring climate change the most “consequential, urgent, sweeping collection of challenges we face as a nation and a world”, Clinton has faced suspicion from liberal elements in the party because of her close connections to the oil and gas industry. Nearly all of the top bundlers to Clinton’s presidential campaign lobbied against climate change regulations, or in favour of offshore drilling and oil exports, according to financial disclosures last July. Those bundlers included lobbyists for Exxon, Chevron, BP and other oil and gas companies, as well as a former lobbyist for TransCanada. Last June, Clinton was criticised for hiring a former TransCanada lobbyist, Jeff Berman, as a consultant. "

"Vast swathes of forest are so brittle and bone-dry that they burn up in an instant. A vicious wildfire, whipped up by hot, arid winds and moving faster than anything in recent memory, consumed tens of thousands of hectares in a matter of hours. Hundreds of homes and at least one person were lost in an inferno that took days to get under control. That’s in California’s north. If you drove south on the same day last month, and you would have found darkened skies and heavy sheets of rain pounding the parched earth around Los Angeles. By noon on 15 September, the city had received 63.5mm of rain, that’s 10 times the precipitation the area usually gets in the entire month. The city has only seen two other storms like it in the past 150 years.  Rather than relief, the water brought chaos. Thousands lost power and hundreds of cars crashed on flooded roads, according to the Los Angeles Times. Almost one million litres of stormwater surged from San Gabriel sewers, contaminating the river and beaches dozens of kilometres downstream. At least one home plunged down a hillside as the earth beneath it was suddenly washed away. Ten people had to be plucked from rushing, rain-swollen rivers by rescue crews. For months – for four years, really – California has been dying for a drink. Repeated dry winters and scorching hot summers have depleted reservoirs and river systems and set fire to much of the land. But now that the rain might finally be coming, carried along by an El Niño that promises to be one of the strongest in recent history, the ground isn’t ready to absorb it. The same drought that makes the state so desperate for water has also baked the earth and denuded the landscape. Forests that once strengthened the soil and soaked up rainfall have been obliterated by fire. “El Niño is a cruel system,” Australian climatologist Roger Stone, a University of Southern Queensland professor and a programme chair the UN’s World Meteorological Organisation, said. “They bring relief, but they bring too much rain too quickly. That’s when you get mudslides, landslides, topsoil washed away.” Poor California. When it’s not “extraordinarily hostile” fires, as veteran firefighter Kevin Rosado described the Valley fire north of San Francisco, it’s the “Godzilla” El Niño forecasted in a few months. For a while, they’ll both be happening at once. September and October are usually the “largest and most damaging months for fires,” California Fire Chief information officer Daniel Berlant told Wired magazine. Meanwhile, stronger than usual storms are starting to arrive. “You have leftover intense drought patterns lingering in the system and now here comes the El Niño effect,” Stone said. “You’ve got both pummelling you at the same time.” Climate change isn’t necessarily causing these phenomena, but it makes them both worse, he added. Periods of scorching heat and drought are natural in California, but global warming has exacerbated them, scientists say. In El Niño years, the warmer air over the oceans makes storms slightly more fierce – a difference that can mean a lot by the time the rain reaches the ground. Last month’s record storm  was a remnant of Hurricane Linda, which fizzled out over the Pacific in early September. It’s not quite the big El Niño storms that scientists have been talking about – those won’t come until winter. But it got a boost from the notorious climate pattern, which tends to strengthen hurricanes in the eastern Pacific (like Linda). And, experts say, it’s a sign of what’s to come. “It has the El Niño footprint,” though it wasn’t an El Niño storm, climatologist Bill Patzert with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory told the LA Times. The storms expected for this winter will resemble the September one – huge doses of concentrated, heavy rain – but probably even more intense. In the winter of 1997 to 1998, California’s most severe El Niño on record brought 6-metre waves and 130km/h winds. Floods and mudslides killed 17 people and caused more than half a billion dollars in damage. There’s no question that winter rain will be a welcome reprieve from four years of drought. A study released last month found that the snowpack that California relies on for most of its moisture is lowest it’s been in 500 years. Nasa says that California’s “rain debt” for the past three years is about 500mm equivalent to an entire year of rain. Water, wherever it comes from, can only help. But it can also hurt, and it will probably hurt more because of the catastrophic effects of the drought. Long periods without rain strip away vegetation and clog dams with sediment. “There’s something to remember about El Niño,” Patzert told the LA Times in May. “He’s a good boy and he’s a bad boy because he can deliver drought relief … But all that water coming so fast is like trying to catch water out of a fire hose with a champagne glass.” There’s also a question of where all that rain falls. El Niños usually drop their contents over southern and central California, where it floods rivers and swamps the streets and then runs off into the ocean, making only a small dent in the vast water deficit. What the state really needs is snow over the mountains, the source of most of its water. When the snow melts in the spring, it will slowly feed the state’s rivers and reservoirs, rather than deluging them all at once. But even in an ideal situation, climate scientists warn, one good El Niño year is unlikely to solve California’s water woes. Earlier this month, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologist Tom Di Liberto estimated that every region of the state would need to have record-shattering rain years to recoup its precipitation debt. Southern California alone would require three times as much rain as usual – and nearly 380mm than its wettest year on record – to have any hope of returning to normal. “What happens this winter is definitely going to be interesting,” Stanford University climate scientist Daniel Swain told the LA Times. “And it’s not entirely clear whether California wins or loses.” This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from the Washington Post"

"After nearly three years of open global consultations, fraught negotiations and some high jinks, the proposed sustainable development goals (SDGs) are expected to be adopted by UN member states at a special summit convened at the UN headquarters in New York from 25 to 27 September. The event sits within the programme of the annual United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), which opens on 15 September.   The SDGs will replace the millennium development goals as the new global goals to be accomplished by 2030.  The whole thing kicks off with a vigil on Thursday night, and then on Friday 25 there will an address by Pope Francis. Once the General Assembly gets underway the three days will feature a mixture of plenary meetings and “interactive dialogues” on the main themes of the SDGs – including ending poverty, tackling inequality and combating climate change. The “interactive dialogues” are opportunities for non-governmental organisations to address the world leaders gathered for the summit. Amnesty International, Oxfam and Global Campaign for Education are among 24 civil society representatives that have been selected. Details of who is speaking when can be found here. Heads of state from around the world, representing all the global groupings: the G8, the Brics, the least-developed countries, the Arab group and small island states – Nobel prize winners and Beyoncé (more on that later), as everyone hitches their wagon to what has been billed as “the biggest launch in history”.   The event can be attended by UN delegates, civil society organisations and the media. Accreditation for civil society organisations is now closed, but you can still attend all the side events. Check on the websites of organisations you are interested in as final dates to register differ. A central list of all side events submitted to the UN is available here, but bear in mind that if your event is within the security zone, you will need to arrange access passes. The Economic and Social Council chamber will serve as the overflow room for the interactive dialogues. If not attending, you will be able to follow much of the summit from the UN’s own live streaming site. Seasoned attendees will know that with over 100 heads of state in one place the queues and security can be pretty tricky, but the advice this year is to brace yourself for worse. “Security will be tighter this year than it usually is because of the summit,” explains Dan Shepard, a public information officer at the UN. “The whole area from 2nd avenue to the UN will be closed. This is the security zone.” Describing the “complex situation” around the UNGA, Thomas Gass, assistant secretary-general for policy coordination in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, says: “Right now they are re-tarring the streets, so everybody is getting ready from an aesthetic point of view. From [the beginning of September] they are going to start putting barricades up and then gradually locking down. There will be special lanes in the street for the motorcades – anything from three to about 25 vehicles.” To get into the security zone, you will have to present your summit badge at checkpoints on 2nd Ave but Shepard says details of where to pick up passes for official events and side events have not yet been finalised. Regular guided tours of the United Nations building will be suspended from 4.30pm on Tuesday, 22 September until Tuesday, 6 October.    With a pope and royalty in attendance, it’s tempting to only stick with the official programme but Payal Dalal, an 11-year UNGA veteran, says that the experience is richer if you mix it up. Dalal, who is head of education and girls programmes at Standard Chartered, said: “Don’t just stick with the UN; go to the events you find interesting or where the dynamic people are going.” “Don’t schedule a ton of bilateral [meetings],” she adds. “The most valuable conversations, in my experience, are the informal meetings in the hallways or at drinks after an event. There are some events that are always good like the Clinton Global Citizens awards or the McKinsey parties.” If a room full of corporate types sounds like a drag, there will be many other gatherings to choose from. There were well over 200 events during the Financing for Development conference in Addis Ababa and the SDG summit promises to have equally rich pickings. Here are some big events worth knowing about: Director of the post-2015 agenda at the United Nations Development Programme, Paul Ladd cautions against getting caught up in the whirlwind of events. “Go there with a business-like objective, not just for the general circus that is the general assembly,” he says. But Ladd recognises that much of the reason why people attend these events is to network. “Hang around the Vienna cafe [at the UN] to bump into key people,” he adds. The most recent review of the cafe on Foursquare says it’s a “good place to go when the UN gets too stuffy”. #SDGLeaders: For the Guardian’s leaders’ forum on 22 September. #Action2015: Over 2,000 organisations across the world came together to collectively campaign for more ambitious goals. No doubt many of them will be hosting events in New York. #GlobalGoals: Making the goals more accessible to the general public has been a challenge from the start. The aim of Global Goals project, spearheaded by film director Richard Curtis, is to encourage general public engagement with the SDGs.  Got an event in September?

"China, the world’s biggest carbon polluter, will launch a national cap-and-trade scheme in 2017, the White House said on Thursday. The move, announced on the eve of a summit in Washington between Presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping, would make China the world’s biggest carbon market, overtaking the European Union, and could strengthen global efforts to put a price on carbon. White House officials said the cap-and-trade plan would be formally announced on Friday along with a “very substantial financial commitment” from China to help the world’s poorest countries fight climate change. The US has already pledged $3bn to a Green Climate Fund for poor countries. The US and Chinese leaders will also commit to the decarbonisation of their economies over the course of the century, campaign groups briefed on the negotiations said. G7 countries made a similar call at their summit in Germany this year, but the support from China – as a developing country and the world’s biggest emitter – would send an important signal ahead of November’s Paris climate meeting that global economies were moving away from fossil fuels, the campaigners said. China’s announcement of a launch date for the national cap-and-trade system – though long anticipated – will help solidify the joint efforts the two countries have taken on climate change.  Chinese officials have been promising since last year to consolidate existing regional cap-and-trade schemes into a national programme. China already has a network of seven regional carbon markets, but there are wide variations in pricing among them. White House officials said the new national scheme would cover power generation, iron and steel, chemicals, building materials including cement, paper-making and nonferrous metals which together account for a large share of China’s carbon pollution. The White House acknowledged in a conference call with reporters that the Chinese actions were helpful to Obama’s efforts to fight climate change by neutralising Republican arguments that the US was acting alone. “One of the arguments that has been proffered against the United States stepping up and providing more resources to help poor countries develop in low-carbon ways has been that if the United States steps up with resources, then other countries won’t – the sort of argument that if the US leads, then others will just take a backseat,” officials told a conference call with reporters. Since Obama’s visit to Beijing last November, the US and China have undertaken a number of measures in tandem to fight climate change. Earlier this month, Chinese cities pledged to peak carbon polllution several years ahead of the national target."

"Greg Hunt has insisted the Coalition’s Direct Action plan is the “best and most efficient” climate policy in the world, as China, the world’s biggest carbon polluter, confirms it will begin a national emissions trading scheme in 2017. Business groups and leading analysts say Direct Action cannot meet Australia’s new promise to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% of 2005 levels by 2030 without significant changes, but Hunt insisted it would easily do so and reduce electricity prices at the same time.  “We have arguably the best and most efficient scheme in the world, there are different forms of market mechanisms but arguably the most pure form is an action, which is what we have,” Hunt said. But Prof Frank Jotzo from the Australian National University’s Crawford School said confirmation of China’s national emissions trading scheme was “a great boost for emission trading schemes around the world because many countries are looking to China and will ultimately emulate what China does”. “It really demonstrates that emissions trading is the way of the future,” Jotzo said. Business leaders and environment groups say Direct Action has little chance of meeting Australia’s new 2020 target as it stands, particularly because its so-called “safeguards” mechanism – designed to make sure rising industrial emissions do not undo emission reductions bought through the $2.5bn emission reductions fund – sets such lenient baselines that major emitters will be able to significantly increase their greenhouse pollution. But tougher baselines to force gradual emission reductions on electricity generators and heavy industry would impose costs that would be passed through to consumers. Hunt’s biggest selling point for his taxpayer-funded scheme is that it does not increase electricity prices. “We are actually reducing our emissions ... we are getting the job done without a carbon price and by lowering electricity prices,” he said. “Mr Shorten wants to increase electricity prices.”  The Labor leader has promised to reintroduce an emissions trading scheme, but has provided no details nor spelt out the 2030 target that a future Labor government would seek to meet. Shorten said China’s announcement was “very exciting”. “For two years, the Liberal party of Australia has been – and some conservative commentators in the media, have been pouring scorn upon Labor and saying, ‘What would Labor know, they are crazy, we shouldn’t have an emissions trading scheme.’ Labor has stuck to its guns and the tide is turning on real action on climate change,” Shorten said. “If Labor is going in step in lockstep with rest of the world, why is Malcolm Turnbull the only person who is chasing after Tony Abbott’s discredited schemes? We all know that Malcolm Turnbull has sold out his views. If you had been asking this question in 2009 to me or Malcolm Turnbull we would have had the same position.” The independent senator Nick Xenophon has said he will try to force a toughening of the “safeguards” mechanism by threatening to support Senate disallowance. Turnbull lost the leadership of the Liberal party in 2009 over his backing for the former Labor government’s emissions trading scheme. Before becoming prime minister this month, he pledged to stick with Direct Action but has not commented on whether the policy would change. The first Direct Action auction spent $660m to buy 47m tonnes of greenhouse abatement, but was criticised because it mostly funded projects already operating, some of which would have continued without additional government money."

"Yesterday we launched in London what we hope will be a new direction for the environmental movement, one which takes green thinking in a more progressive and pragmatic direction. We call it ‘ecomodernism’.  The idea is to build a new cross-political movement of people who believe that humans are capable of using technological innovation to solve critical environmental problems, such as climate change, at the same time as allowing economic growth to eradicate poverty in developing countries. Traditional environmentalism has tended to insist that human prosperity and our environment are on a collision course: as we make clear in our manifesto, we don’t think this has to be the case.   We would have hoped that we would find an ally in George Monbiot. George is no friend of poverty, and his newly-launched movement for rewilding absolutely necessitates the kind of agricultural modernisation we are calling for in our manifesto. Only with more productive farms to feed the majority of humans who now live in cities, can enough free land be spared for nature and rewilding. However, in his column yesterday, he rejects ecomodernism by making a sweeping claim. There is, he writes, “an inverse relationship between the size of farms and the crops they produce. The smaller they are, on average, the greater the yield per hectare.” The implication is that agricultural modernisation is neither land-sparing nor beneficial to the poor. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are, it is true, many studies showing an inverse relationship between yields and farm size in developing regions. But the relevant comparison is not between small farms and slightly larger ones in poor countries. It is between smallholder farms in developing nations and farms of any size in developed nations (which are almost always larger than farms in poor countries).  One widely cited study found that the smallest African farms produced about 25% more yield per hectare than the largest African farms. But the average American farm produced about 10 times more yield per hectare than either. Yield gaps between farmers in rich nations and those in poor countries are profound. US farmers harvest five times more per hectare than African farmers in maize and more than three times in rice. To suggest that smallholder farmers, particularly those in subsistence rain-fed agriculture, are more productive per unit of land than large-scale modern farmers is simply wrong. Monbiot acknowledges that the reason that small farms in poor countries have higher yields than larger ones is because they have higher labor inputs, but fails to consider the implications of this fact. In poor nations, the lack of access to alternative livelihoods for large rural populations is the reason that labor is cheap and relatively high yields can be achieved on very small farms. Awash in cheap labor and lacking access to capital, markets, and infrastructure, farmers raise yields by applying more labor.  But any nature and land-sparing vision predicated on this model of agriculture would require maintaining large rural populations throughout the developing world in a state a of deep agrarian poverty, with no alternative livelihoods to speak of. Could you, in theory, raise yields dramatically through high inputs of labor (albeit also with healthy inputs of synthetic fertiliser, irrigation, and pesticides as well)? Perhaps. But doing so would only be possible given a very large pool of cheap or free (eg family) labor.  This seems to us to be neither a particularly plausible way to reduce human impacts on the environment nor an acceptable future for the billion people today living on less than a dollar a day. To suggest, as Monbiot does, that poor farmers are better off remaining on the farm is to suggest that they are better off remaining poor.  Without question, the journey from subsistence economies to modern livelihoods is not an easy one and moving from the farm to the city does not guarantee a better life, at least in the short term. But the last two centuries offer ample evidence that by just about every metric of human health, freedom, and material well-being, urbanisation, industrialisation, and agricultural modernisation are processes that have been overwhelmingly positive for humans.  Moreover, as a leading proponent of rewilding, we hope that Monbiot will think a bit harder about where all those rewilded landscapes in which, he hopes “nature is allowed to do its own thing, in which it can be to some extent self-willed, driven by its own dynamic processes” are likely to come from. On a planet of 7, going on 9 billion people, agricultural modernisation and intensification are clearly the most plausible path to leaving more of the Earth to nature."
"As humans emit greenhouse gases into the environment, it causes the Earth to warm, we already know that. What is less certain is how it will cause changes to the weather we experience in our lives. In the past few years, research looking into the connection between a warming planet and more extreme weather has found more conclusive connections. I have covered extreme weather quite a bit recently, because the science is so compelling and new. But a new paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by doctoral student Omid Mazdiyasni and his advisor Amir AghaKouchak takes a fresh look at this topic.  Instead of just looking at heat waves or just looking at precipitation, they looked for concurrent events. Droughts can be caused by reduced precipitation. Hot weather speeds evaporation and damages the environment. But droughts and high temperatures can happen at the same time. These concurrent-event droughts are particularly harmful, they can set in fast and severely. The authors present results of various heat wave severity (85%, 90%, and 95% events) and for various durations (3 day, 5 day, and 7 day events). Focusing on 1960-2010, they found that the concurrence of all combinations of drought, heat wave intensity, and heat wave durations “have increased substantially in the south, southeast, and parts of the western USA.”  In other past of the country, these trends have decreased (I have written about changing precipitation in the USA here and I have published on this topic here), in part because a warmer atmosphere contains more water vapor.  What is also interesting is that the authors find a greater increase in the most extreme events. The new study clears up past research which has been mixed in this area. The authors more advanced statistical technique is better suited to finding trends and patterns in the climate record.  I asked Omid Mazdiyasni about what makes his study unique. He told me,  To determine whether there has been a significant change in concurrent droughts and heatwaves, we used a statistical model new to hydrology. Our results show that although there is no statistical change in droughts individually, there is a significant change in concurrent droughts and heatwaves. The effects of this concurrent climatic event can greatly increase the damage on human health, air quality, agriculture, society, and the environment. Next, I asked Amir AghaKouchak about the significance of this work and how it fits into the scientific literature on the topic. He responded,  In the past decades, the science community has focused mainly on individual climate extremes such as droughts, floods and heatwaves. We know very little about causes and impacts of concurrent and compound extremes. This study was a step forward toward this direction. But there is a lot to be done!  This is another study showing that the changing climate is causing real changes to the weather we experience. This paper doesn’t even include the recent droughts and heat waves of 2011, 2012, and the current drought in the western USA including California. These extremes present financial and social costs that will increase as we continue to warm the planet."

"A day after announcing her opposition to the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, Hillary Clinton unveiled a more comprehensive agenda for the US energy infrastructure that seeks to transform the US into “the clean energy superpower of the 21st century”. The Democratic presidential candidate detailed her proposals on Wednesday in both a blogpost on Medium and a fact sheet distributed by Clinton’s campaign.  Clinton’s plan calls for the existing energy infrastructure in the US to be modernized through a series of steps, such as repairing or replacing oil and gas pipelines that are outdated and risk both oil and methane leaks and other hazardous accidents. The flaws highlighted by Clinton in the country’s energy infrastructure, including pipeline spills, rail car explosions, and the exposure to cyber-attacks, mirror the findings of the first-ever quadrennial energy review conducted by the Obama administration and released in April.  In addition to exposing the vulnerabilities in energy transmission, storage and distribution infrastructure, the review produced recommendations that included accelerating pipeline replacement, enhancing maintenance programs for natural gas distribution systems, and developing a more modern electric grid. Clinton said her plan would invest in “grid security and resilience”, and create a threat assessment team to protect against cyber-attack through improved coordination. Citing challenges that extend across the borders of Canada and Mexico, Clinton also said she would immediately begin negotiations with both nations, if elected president, to forge a North American climate compact with the purpose of producing shared targets and accountability measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and cut energy costs. Such a pact, Clinton wrote, would ensure that “all three countries demonstrate a commitment to climate action,” as well as “[create] certainty for investors and confidence in the future of our climate, so we can all marshal resources equal to the challenges we face.” Environmental activists broadly approved of Clinton’s plan, while welcoming the series of recent steps taken by the former secretary of state with respect to energy policy – such as her opposition to Keystone. Climatologist Michael Mann, director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center, described Clinton’s plan as “very good overall” while singling out her emphasis on building upon the successes of the Obama administration – namely the Environmental Protection Agency’s new rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, known as the clean power plan.  He also praised her outlined commitment to incentivizing clean energy, pricing carbon emissions, and working with international partners in a coordinated effort to lower carbon emissions. Mann nonetheless maintained that Clinton’s plan was “somewhat conservative” with respect to fossil fuel subsidies.  “Clinton indicates that she is open to the additional leasing of public lands to fossil fuel companies, which – given the cheap nature of those leases – is effectively a subsidy to fossil fuel interests,” he said, while acknowledging that Clinton said she wanted to ensure “taxpayers get a fair deal”.  “The devil is in the details here,” Mann said. “A fair deal would mean charging fossil fuel companies for the damage that is being done by the additional burning of fossil fuels in the form of climate change and its costly impact. Even the fossil fuel industry estimates that to be least $60 per ton of carbon burned.” Tiernan Sittenfeld, the senior vice-president of government affairs of the left-leaning League of Conservation Voters, said she was pleased with what Clinton had offered thus far and is optimistic about what is yet to come. “Overall, we’re increasingly excited about her leadership on clean energy and climate change,” she said.  Clinton’s new plan, her opposition to both Keystone and Arctic drilling, as well as the renewable energy proposal she rolled out in July, Sittenfeld said, were all evidence of a ramp-up that placed the Democratic frontrunner squarely at odds with her Republicans opponents.  “If you think about the fact that protecting the environment used to be such a source of bipartisan agreement and now pretty much every single Republican candidate for president wants to permanently block the clean power plan … climate deniers are running rampant amongst the Republicans running for president,” she said. “It’s pretty disgraceful, unfortunately.”  Environmental groups were especially jubilant on Tuesday, when Clinton finally made clear that she opposed the controversial Keystone pipeline – after months of declining to take a position. “I think it is imperative that we look at the Keystone pipeline as what I believe it is, a distraction from the important work we have to do to combat climate change, and unfortunately from my perspective one that interferes with our ability to move forward to deal with all the other issues,” Clinton said during a campaign stop in Des Moines, Iowa. “Therefore, I oppose it. And I oppose It because I don’t think it’s in the best interest of what we need to do to combat climate change.” She elaborated on her stance in the Medium post Wednesday, writing: “We shouldn’t be building a pipeline dedicated to moving North America’s dirtiest fuel through our communities .” The Keystone announcement earned immediate rebukes from Clinton’s Republican rivals – such as former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who accused Clinton of favoring “environmental extremists over US jobs”.  Reviews have suggested the hotly debated pipeline would not, in fact, result in a job-creating bonanza.  The State Department estimated that only 35 permanent positions would be created, while jobs for roughly 3,900 workers required to build the pipeline would last for just a year. Estimates have also varied dramatically for the indirect jobs that Keystone might add, and been lowered amid a drop in oil prices that has reduced the economic viability of further tar sands expansion.  Among the Republican presidential hopefuls, Marco Rubio is one of the few to lay out his own energy agenda. The Florida senator pledged earlier this month to immediately block the Obama administration’s rules on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and also advocated for lifting a federal ban on crude oil exports. Clinton said last week she would support reversing the 40-year ban only if there were concessions from the oil and gas industry toward cleaner energy. “I’m not against it under all circumstances but I have not yet seen any legislation introduced that would strike the right balance, in my perspective,” Clinton told reporters in New Hampshire."

"Over recent days and bit by bit, Australians have been coming to understand the price that Malcolm Turnbull was willing to pay to achieve his long-held personal ambition of becoming prime minister. Australians are beginning to understand the extent to which he was willing to discard so many long-held beliefs to satisfy that ambition. Nowhere has that price been higher than in relation to climate change and environmental protection policy. This was, after all, the signature difference between the former prime minister and the new prime minister.   Many Australians held out very high hopes that Mr Turnbull’s return to the leadership of the Liberal party would see him drag the party back to the sensible centre on climate change — that there would be the hope of Australia again regaining a bipartisan consensus that would allow us to move forward in the way that so many of our sister nations around the world are doing.  As these Australians watch what the prime minister has been saying over the last few days — going back to his press conference on Monday night — their hearts are breaking.  All those Australians who thought that Mr Turnbull’s return to the leadership of the Liberal party would actually mean something — that it would actually hold out the hope of a strong and sensible policy on climate change for Australia — have had their hearts broken, because this prime minister has swallowed Tony Abbott’s Direct Action policy, hook, line and sinker. Those Australians were entitled to hold out those hopes. They were entirely entitled to think that a change of leadership would mean something and would lead to some change in the Liberal party’s attitude to climate change. The old Malcolm had been so crystal clear about his belief that the Direct Action policy, in his words, was “an environmental fig leaf to cover a determination to do nothing”.  The old Malcolm Turnbull was clear in his advocacy of an emissions trading scheme as the cheapest and most effective means of reducing carbon pollution. We have heard him say, so many times, particularly in that critical period of debate in 2009 and 2010, that a policy like Tony Abbott’s emissions reduction fund would be “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale”.  Well, apparently it’s all different now. Tony Abbott’s Direct Action policy is apparently now a “very, very good piece of work”. In parliament, the new prime minister praised the emissions reduction fund’s first auction, which spent about $650 m of taxpayer funds. Forty seven million tonnes of carbon pollution reductions were purchased under this first auction. What the prime minister has not said is that of those 47 m tonnes, three quarters, or 34 m tonnes, were from projects that already existed and in some cases had existed for more than 10 years, including with big companies like AGL — the largest polluter in Australia. Taxpayers are paying for things that those companies were already doing.  The second element of Tony Abbott’s Direct Action policy, the safeguards mechanism, was released earlier this month, and it exceeded everyone’s worst expectations. RepuTex, the leading modelling agency in this area, has provided very clear advice that, under this safeguards policy, the biggest 20 polluters in Australia will not be touched whatsoever. And the biggest 150 polluters in this country will increase their emissions by 20% over the next 15 years. The Grattan Institute said in response to the release of the safeguards policy: “It is called a safeguard, but it is not an environmental safeguard. Greg Hunt is not actually constraining emissions; if it is going to work it is going to have to have teeth, but all we have got is gums.” It’s not surprising then that we’ve seen emissions starting to rise again. Under Direct Action, 2020 levels of carbon pollution will be substantially higher than they are today, and substantially higher than they were in 2000 or in 2005.  The government’s own projections suggest that, in 2020, carbon pollution levels in Australia will be 655 m tonnes against 559 m tonnes in 2000 — so, not 5% below 2000 levels, 17% above 2000 levels. RepuTex was more generous to the government than the government’s own modelling. It said only last month that, in 2020, carbon emissions will be 613 m tonnes against 559 m tonnes — so 10% above 2000 levels.  Land clearing is increasing again in Queensland, thanks to Campbell Newman’s reversal of Peter Beattie’s land-clearing laws. Electricity sector emissions are up because of Tony Abbott’s attack on renewable energy. Fugitive emissions from mining are up, and they will not be capped at all because there is no discipline in the safeguard mechanism. That is why we need an emissions trading scheme. That is why we need a hard cap on carbon pollution that reduces over time and then lets business work out the cheapest and the most effective way to operate.  We also need strong support for renewable energy. It is very clear now that you will only get that strong support from a Shorten Labor government. In parliament, Malcolm Turnbull dismissed out of hand Labor’s invitation to cooperate on a 50% renewable energy goal for 2030. He called the goal “reckless” and argued instead for “clean coal” and more gas-fired generation. Millions of Australians are now asking themselves, more in sorrow than in anger, I suspect: how did it come to this? How is Malcolm Turnbull, who apparently had such deep beliefs around climate change and environmental policy, now a convert to a policy he rightly condemned all those years ago, and which experience has shown deserved that condemnation. The answer, unfortunately, is the answer that is so often the case in these circumstances: base personal ambition. Australians are coming to understand that there was nothing that Malcolm Turnbull was not willing to trade off, not willing to sell out, to achieve his long-held ambition to become prime minister. We probably still don’t know it all. We know it includes climate change policy, water policy, renewable energy policy, same-sex marriage policy. How can Australians possibly trust this prime minister on anything? Mark Butler is Labor spokesperson for Environment, Climate Change and Water."

"“You can always judge a man by the quality of his enemies,” said Oscar Wilde. In the case of the UK government’s bid to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point, the quality of its enemies suggests the plan is idiotic. On Monday, the chancellor George Osborne announced £2bn in government loan guarantees in a bid to get the French-Chinese consortium behind Hinkley to finally commit to the much-delayed £24.5bn project. Energy secretary, Amber Rudd, accompanying Osborne on his trip to China, said the new Hinkley plant was “reasonably priced and value for money” and would provide a chunk of the low-carbon electricity needed to meet the UK’s climate change targets. Last week, Vincent de Rivaz, the CEO of French energy company EDF, said the Hinkley deal was “the right technology, at the right price, at the right time”. It’s true that the UK needs secure, low-carbon energy and that renewables are intermittent. The problem is that, apart from those with political or real capital riding on the deal, virtually no-one thinks the Hinkley plant is the answer.  Let’s start with well-known energy analyst Peter Atherton, who is no tree-hugger. He said the deal is “one of the worst ever signed by a British government”, who are buying the “most expensive conventional power station in the world”.  He calculated Hinkley would be pumping out vast profits by the end of the 35-year index-linked deal: £5bn a year, paid for by you and me. “The numbers are eyewateringly attractive for EDF and its partners; not so good for the national purse,” he said. Osborne’s loan guarantees - a taxpayer bailout for lenders if the project fails - are “a clear case of socialising risk and privatising profits”. The hard-headed number crunchers at HSBC agree, noting the high costs and vast delays to EDF’s two other new plants in France and Finland: “We see ample reason for the UK government to delay or cancel the project.” Turning to the sober suits at the Financial Times, the message remains the same: that the costs are far too high, more expensive than every kind of renewable energy, bar offshore wind. “Backing out might upset the French and embarrass the government. But a wish to spare ministerial blushes is no excuse for saddling the country with costs it cannot afford,” concluded the FT editorial. There’s more. Lord Turnbull, who knows his way around Whitehall, having led the civil service, recently told Osborne the Hinkley deal was a “bottomless pit and a big white elephant”.  Another peer, Lord Howell is a former Conservative energy secretary, a fracking fan and also happens to be Osborne’s father-in-law. He warned the reactor design planned for Hinkley C has never “been completed successfully” and that it was “one of the worst deals ever” for British consumers and industry. Paul Massara, boss of RWE NPower, one of the UK’s Big Six, said: “We will look back and think that nuclear was a expensive mistake.”  You’ll notice that not one of these Hinkley enemies I have cited are green activists, whose opposition can perhaps be taken for granted. But even those environmentalists who did back the deal, enraging many of their colleagues, have changed their minds.  On Friday, George Monbiot, Mark Lynas, and Chris Goodall declared: “Hinkley C bears all the distinguishing features of a white elephant: overpriced, overcomplicated and overdue. The delay [to 2023 at the earliest] that was announced recently should be the final straw. The government should kill the project.” But as it stands, the government appears to be doing the opposite. It is not just trying to drag the Hinkley deal over the line, but is also aiming the get Chinese companies building other new reactors, of a completely different design. Energy security is serious, affordability is serious and tackling global warming is serious. But when serious people queue up to condemn Hinkley as a colossal waste of time and money, risking security, affordability and the climate, ministers should swallow their pride and ditch it."
"Lawyers for UK drivers have urged Volkswagen to “come clean” over exactly which cars have been affected in Britain by the emissions-rigging scandal that has rocked the global car industry. The call came as the UK prime minister, David Cameron, labelled VW’s action as “unacceptable”, and German newspapers claimed the company had been aware of the cheating several years ago. At its near-10-hour meeting in Wolfsburg on Friday, the company’s 20-member board discussed an internal report that showed an employee warned in 2011 about the illegal use of software for emissions tests, according to the Conservative daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, citing sources close to the board. Bild reported that Bosch, which supplied the software for test purposes in 2007, warned about its planned illegal use at the time.  Cameron spoke about the scandal for the first time, saying any decision on banning VW cars was a matter for the Department for Transport. “What appears to have happened here is unacceptable,” he said, speaking on his way to New York. “If companies are breaking the rules and fiddling the figures, that is unacceptable. Emissions standards matter and they have to be properly policed and delivered.” Switzerland has banned sales of VW diesel cars, the most drastic action taken yet by any government. London-based law firm Leigh Day, which is representing hundreds of Volkswagen drivers in the UK, said there was a “woeful lack of clarity” over which diesel cars were involved. The German carmaker, the world’s biggest, has admitted to US regulators that 11m trucks and cars were fitted with software that cheated emissions tests. As well as a US regulatory penalty of $18bn (£11.8bn), the company faces multibillion-pound class-action lawsuits from customers and possibly shareholders. The scandal wiped more than €25bn (£18bn) off VW’s stock market value in one week, one-third of its value. Bozena Michalowska-Howells of Leigh Day said: “It is a disgrace that seven days after this scandal came to light ... consumers in the UK and other countries in Europe and around the world are still being kept in the dark over their vehicles. “Our clients still do not know definitively whether cars in the UK are affected and if so which models. They do not know whether the car they are driving is indeed emitting 40 times the legal emissions limit as has been suggested, nor do they know whether their cars will be recalled to bring them into line with EU regulations.” Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority has given VW until 7 October to come up with a detailed timetable for when all of its diesel vehicles will comply with emissions standards, according to German tabloid Bild am Sonntag. If the carmaker misses the deadline, it will be banned from selling those cars.  VW’s brand chief Herbert Diess has said the company is working on a technical upgrade for affected cars. Around 5m VW passenger cars are affected worldwide. Certain models such as the sixth-generation Volkswagen Golf, the seventh-generation Volkswagen Passat and the first-generation Volkswagen Tiguan are equipped exclusively with type EA 189 diesel engines that were found to be cheating emissions tests. All new cars that fulfill the EU6 norm are not affected, including the current Golf, Passat and Touran models. Volkswagen appointed Matthias Müller as its new chief executive on Friday. Müller has been at VW for four decades and ran its Porsche sports car division for the past five years. He replaced Martin Winterkorn, who stepped down two days earlier despite insisting he was not to blame for the scandal. Despite the scandal, a majority of Germans (55%) still have “great faith” in Volkswagen, a poll conducted for Bild showed. More than three-quarters of Germans believe that other carmakers are equally guilty of manipulation. Former consumer protection minister Renate Künast of the Green party has called for compensation for owners of affected VW vehicles in Germany. Leigh Day’s Michalowska-Howells pointed out that affected Volkswagen customers in the UK face not only the inconvenience of losing their vehicle while it is being repaired, but also higher fuel costs, and potentially higher vehicle excise duty, because vehicles will be less fuel-efficient and could emit more CO2 following any upgrade.  Consumers in some regions of the UK may also be out of pocket where parking charges are based upon such emissions. The secondhand resale value of the vehicle could plummet, she warned. This will have a particularly significant impact on organisations that have bought fleets of Volkswagen cars because of their apparent fuel and emissions record and reputation for holding their value.  The law firm called on the UK government to “act fast and take action to prevent further damage to air quality”. Carol Day, an environmental lawyer at Leigh Day, warned that the VW revelations make it harder for the UK to meet its climate change targets. Transport emissions make up nearly a quarter of UK emissions, but this figure was estimated to fall by around a third over the next decade primarily through more efficient combustion engines. She said: “As well as the losses suffered by the individual car owners, there has clearly been a significant impact on the environment as a result of increased nitrogen oxide emissions, which the government has not been able to assess as part of its strategy on climate change.”"
"The humanitarian emergency caused by the migration crisis has shocked the world. Desperate scenes of refugees risking their lives at sea or sleeping rough in European train stations are inescapable. But we should also be aware of what has brought us to this point.  One of the drivers of this crisis was a five-year drought – the worst ever recorded in Syria – that began in the 2007-8 cropping season. Farmers lost livestock, crops withered, and children went hungry. Many decided to move to nearby cities, hoping for work but finding instead unhealthy living conditions, a lack of community support and few jobs. During the drought, the UN estimated that levels of youth unemployment in Syria reached as high as 48%.  These factors undoubtedly contributed to the unrest that sparked the civil war four years ago and today’s migration emergency.  Dry areas in north Africa and the Middle East are getting hotter and drier, and droughts are becoming more intense and frequent. Syria and Jordan are predicted to lose 30% of their fertile land to desertification if measures are not urgently taken to combat desertification and land degradation. The Arab region as a whole already has the most significant food deficit in the world. While we can by no means downplay the role of armed uprisings, climate change is also contributing to escalating conflict in these fragile states. This mix of poverty, food insecurity, tremendous water stress and high levels of unemployment has created an environment for extremism and violence to thrive. As long as such conditions prevail, these areas will remain “soft targets” for extremist organisations, more so as climate change makes living conditions harsher.  The long-term solution is clear: give rural people the ability to remain productive and employed in their own settings. We need to recognise this migration crisis as the canary in the mine on climate change.  European leaders have the power to take action by investing in science for rural development. Our team at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (Icarda) was forced to abandon its headquarters and research station in the Syrian city of Aleppo in July 2012. But our scientific work, focusing on sustainable productivity and climate change adaptation in the dry areas, has continued across the region. We have found that food security, better livelihoods and resilient rural communities are not out of reach in the Middle East. The potential is certainly very high with the right investment and policy environment.  In fact, in the 1990s, improved, drought-tolerant wheat varieties, sustainable water management practices, and enabling policies boosted yields in Syria roughly fivefold, turning the country from a wheat importer to exporter in the early years of 2000. Even with the severe drought, the country was able to remain self-sufficient in wheat, the staple crop. Today, water stress in the region is rising to alarming levels. Increasing water productivity has been a key focus of our research through water harvesting and enhancing water-use efficiency.  In Egypt, mechanised raised-bed technology has proved to be cost-efficient, and integrates sustainable land and water management. Its use has led to a 25% increase in wheat productivity, with average water savings of 30% enhancing water-use efficiency by 72% in the Sharkia province in the Delta. In the last three years the Egyptian government made use of this success story and invested $1.6m to support a national campaign to spread the raised bed technology in 22 provinces. In Sudan, our heat-tolerant wheat varieties are transforming production and farmer incomes. Temperatures in the country often exceed 41C, affecting crop performance and limiting yields. With our new varieties, yields have more than doubled and the government is now looking to drastically reduce wheat imports.  In Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, the traditional and nutritious “freekeh” smoked wheat grain, made from young wheat, is in great demand and fetches almost five times what wheat does. We work with farmers to standardise production so it meets quality criteria and is competitive. Such products, with added value, can make farming more lucrative for resource-poor farmers. Access to markets – nationally and internationally – could create a new value chain for a food product that is nutritious, healthy and profitable. European leaders can increase investment in this kind of agricultural research in the vulnerable north African and Middle Eastern regions, where climate change and migration are defining problems of this time. The climate talks in Paris in December offer a golden opportunity to do this. Science, combined with enabling policies, can help rural populations remain employed, productive and safe in spite of drier, harsher weather conditions. We may not be able to completely control outbreaks of conflict and migration, but investment in this kind of research could go a long way to treating the causes. "

"Outspoken climate sceptic Maurice Newman’s term as chairman of the prime minister’s business advisory council expired last week and he has not been reappointed, a spokesman for prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has confirmed. Former prime minister Tony Abbott appointed Newman as one of his first acts after winning government in 2013.  Newman has used a weekly column in the Australian to expound private views on climate change, including that the world was ill-prepared for a period of global cooling and that the United Nations was using debunked climate science to impose a new world order under its own control.  He also called for a government-funded review of the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) to “dispel suspicions of a warming bias” in its temperature record-keeping, something freedom of information documents have recently revealed was under consideration by the prime minister’s department. Turnbull’s spokesman said the new prime minister, who has strong personal links to the business community, was still considering whether he needed a formal business advisory council. He said Newman had not been reappointed. The two-year terms of the other 11 members of the council expire in December because they were appointed by Abbott after he had named the chairman. Newman is a former chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange, Deutsche Bank (Asia Pacific) and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, as well as a former chancellor of Macquarie University. When appointing him, Abbott said he wanted to “restore a working relationship between government and Australian business”. The other council members include former productivity commission chairman Professor Gary Banks, chancellor of the University of Western Australia Michael Chaney, Linfox chairman Peter Fox, Grocon chief executive Daniel Grollo, Bluescope steel chairman Graham Kraehe and Business Council of Australia president Catherine Livingstone.

"Volkswagen is told to recall 482,000 cars in the US after it is caught deploying sophisticated software to cheat emissions tests and allow its cars to produce up to 40 times more pollution than allowed. The Environment Protection Agency claims VW installed defeat devices, meaning the cars only cut their nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution during certification tests. Its investigation was prompted by research by the International Council on Clean Technology (ICCT), which had finally forced VW to admit its actions.  The EPA says: “We intend to hold Volkswagen responsible. We expected better from VW. Using a defeat device in cars to evade clean-air standards is illegal and a threat to public health.” The agency warns that VW will be further investigated and could face other action for breaching the Clean Air Act, including a maximum fine of up to $37,500 per vehicle, or $18bn (£11.8bn). VW starts showing some contrition, promising to launch an investigation of its own. Chief executive Martin Winterkorn says: “I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public. We do not and will not tolerate violations of any kind of our internal rules or of the law.” The noxious stench of faked emissions tests spreads to Europe – and the Frankfurt stock exchange.  Within minutes of the market opening on Monday morning, about €15bn (£11bn) is wiped off VW’s share price. The German government warns that the VW scandal is jeopardising the reputation of Germany’s entire automotive industry.  Concerns also grow about the extent of possible test-fixing, with campaigners claiming that the European testing system is not fit for purpose. The possible ramifications for car manufacturers – and public health – start to emerge as the ICCT warns that other vehicles are emitting far more NOx than official tests suggest.  VW presses ahead with a glitzy product launch in New York that features Lenny Kravitz singing – and an accompanying appearance on stage from US chief executive Michael Horn, who declares: “We have totally screwed up.” The morning after the party, the headache grows. Volkswagen now admits there are 11m cars worldwide fitted with its defeat devices. The numbers could mean that VW’s diesels have pumped out as much as 900,000 tonnes of extra NOx emissions a year – about 25 times more than the UK’s controversial Drax power station – with huge implications for public health.  Winterkorn apologises again, releasing a hastily filmed video saying he was “endlessly sorry”. However, he insists he will not resign, even though VW shares slump again and the group tells investors it is earmarking €6.5bn to deal with the fallout.  Governments around Europe call for action: Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, demands “complete transparency” and sends a transport ministry team into the firm’s Wolfsburg HQ. Britain and France call for an EU commission inquiry.  Analysts start talking about a “Libor moment” for the motor industry, and speculate on the uncertain future of diesel cars.  Shares in other carmakers slip: Peugeot is down 7%, with BMW and Daimler, the owner of Mercedes-Benz, having 5% wiped off their value. Winterkorn finally bows to the inevitable and falls on his sword, protesting he was “not aware of any wrongdoing on my part”. He walks away with a €28m pension pot.  Lawyers start to circle: several class-action lawsuits are filed in the US and Canada, with UK firms saying they are preparing for similar cases here on behalf of VW owners. Criminal investigations are launched by the US Justice Department, while German public prosecutors consider the merits of a case. VW establishes a special committee to investigate, warning that heads will roll.  Rival carmakers insist that VW is an isolated case. But criticism deepens over how much governments knew, and when, about true NOx emissions from diesel engines compared with test results in the motor industry.  It also emerges that Germany was aware of defeat devices and that Britain, France and Germany had lobbied to dilute proposed real-world emissions tests for diesel engines, now delayed until at least 2017.  Germany confirms that VW vehicles with software installed to cheat emissions tests were sold across Europe.  Top German economists warn that the VW scandal could jeopardise the country’s growth, and could now be a bigger problem for the wider German economy than Greece’s debt.  BMW shares take a further hit after transport campaigners claim their diesels also far exceed emissions limits in real-world tests.  Under pressure from environmental groups and a prospective parliamentary grilling, the UK’s Department for Transport says it will start its own inquiry into car emissions, including running new lab tests and comparing the results with cars on the road. France and Italy also announce action including random checks.  Volkswagen unveils its new boss, Matthias Müller, formerly head of its Porsche division. The carmaker then blames the emissions scandal on a “small group” of people and says a small number of unnamed staff have been suspended.  Rival car manufacturers angrily rebut claims they they employed similar methods, the EPA promises to “up its game” on the testing of cars, and the UK government insists it had not been given enough information to act on misleading test results."

"Europe will not settle for anything less than a robust, ambitious and binding agreement on climate change at UN talks in Paris later this year, the EU’s climate chief has said. “Today’s a very good day. The EU is equipped with a very solid position for Paris,” said Miguel Cañete after environment ministers agreed the bloc’s joint position on the climate summit, overcoming objections from coal-reliant Poland. “We stand united, that is of the upmost importance, and ready to conclude an ambitious robust, binding global climate deal, and we will settle for nothing less.” However, the EU said it was concerned about the lack of substantial progress on the text for an agreement at Paris, which it warned still needed considerable work. Green groups said that the EU was not doing enough. The bloc’s joint position published on Friday calls for five yearly reviews of countries’ carbon emission cuts after any deal is reached in December, something many parties are now calling for.  It also says the nearly 200 countries meeting in Paris should commit to a long-term vision for “climate neutrality and climate resilience in the second half of this century”. The phrase “climate neutrality” replaced the word “decarbonisation” in an earlier version of the position, emphasising action on all greenhouse gases rather than just carbon dioxide emissions.  In a new addition to the text, other countries around the world were called upon to reduce their emissions to near zero or below by 2100. The G7 agreed in June to phase out all fossil fuels by the end of the century. Cañete said the EU was asking all countries to peak their emissions by 2020 to avoid dangerous global warming, in line with a report published by the UN’s climate science panel the IPCC.  The EU said that the issue of transferring funds from developed to developing countries to help them with climate change would be of great importance at Paris. “Public finance alone will not be enough to meet the challenge and we also need to attract better private climate finance,” Cañete said.  Green groups said the environment ministers’ position today still held out the hope of of avoiding dangerous warming, but more was needed. Greenpeace EU energy policy adviser Jiri Jerabek said: “The EU’s position is still far from what is needed to reach an effective global deal.” Geneviève Pons Deladrière, director of the WWF European policy office, said: “As climate change is speeding up and getting worse, it’s regrettable that EU environment ministers failed to spell out how the EU intends to increase its own climate and energy targets.” However, Amber Rudd, the UK energy and climate secretary, who was at the meeting, said she was pleased with the agreement: “I welcome today’s agreement, which the UK has been driving forward and will enable businesses to remain competitive and grow as we move to a low carbon future.” Activists in Brussels staged a tug-of-war contest between fossil fuels and renewable energy, and called on the ministers to go further than their commitment of cutting emissions 40% by 2030. Those on the renewable energy side won."
"Brazil on Sunday became the first major developing country to pledge an absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for an envisioned global pact against climate change. The world’s seventh biggest greenhouse gas polluter said it would cut its emissions by 37% by 2025 from 2005 levels by reducing deforestation and boosting the share of renewable sources in its energy mix. It also indicated an “intended reduction” of 43% by 2030. “Our goals are just as ambitious, if not more so, than those set by developed countries,” President Dilma Rousseff said as she announced the targets at the UN in New York. In talks on a new climate agreement, set to be adopted in Paris in December, developed countries are expected to shoulder the biggest responsibility for cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. For example, the US has pledged to reduce its emissions by 26-28% between 2005 and 2025. Major developing countries such as China and South Africa have pledged to rein in their emissions as their economies expand, rather than to slash them in absolute terms. Brazil, however, has already achieved significant emissions cuts in the past decade primarily because of efforts to reduce deforestation in the Amazon. Environmental groups tracking climate policy applauded Brazil for taking absolute reduction targets, but said they could have been even more ambitious. The targets would reduce Brazilian emissions from the current level of 1.6bn tonnes a year to 1.5bn tonnes by 2025 and 1.3bn tonnes by 2030, said Viviane Romeiro of the World Resources Institute (WRI), an environmental thinktank. “Ideally, we would have reached 1 gigaton by 2030. This pledge won’t allow us to get to that number,” she said. Rousseff said that by 2030, Brazil, which has large dams, aims to get 66% of its electricity from hydropower and 23% from other renewable sources including wind, solar and biomass. That’s an increase from a joint announcement with the US in June, when Brazil said it would double its non-hydropower renewable sources to 20% by 2030. She also said that Brazil would strive to end illegal deforestation by 2030, a goal that Romeiro said it had previously hoped to achieve by this year. A crunch issue in UN climate talks is how to divide the responsibility of fighting climate change between developed countries who have historically released the highest emissions and developing nations whose emissions are growing the fastest. Environment minister Izabella Teixeira told the Associated Press that Brazil’s targets were consistent with its historical responsibility to deal with the problem. “We are not increasing our emissions. We are cutting our emissions,” she said. Without naming anyone, she added that many countries say they want to fight global warming, “but when you check their numbers you see they are increasing their emissions”."
"You don’t so much interview Dame Vivienne Westwood as end up as an audience to her monologues. Britain’s most famous designer is promoting How to Change the World, a documentary about the birth of Greenpeace, although she doesn’t actually have anything to do with the film itself – she just wants to draw attention to climate change. She is fanatical about drawing people’s attention to climate change. She has a blog, Climate Revolution (formerly Active Resistance), and works with Greenpeace regularly. She has spent the summer appearing at festivals, talking about climate change. The day after we meet, to much fanfare, she rides a white tank up to David Cameron’s constituency home in Chadlington, Oxfordshire, to protest against fracking. The pictures have been endlessly shared on social media. It was a brilliantly arresting stunt. Westwood is one of the founders of punk, who famously didn’t bother to wear knickers when she collected her OBE from the Queen, so it’s no real surprise that she has driven a tank up to the prime minister’s house to tell him off. There’s a campaign running on her blog at the moment called Politicians R Criminals, which intends to remind everyone that “you’ve got to be scared of these people”. She doesn’t much like the establishment, with the exception of Caroline Lucas, and the Green party. When I tell people I’m going to meet her, those who have encountered her before describe her as formidable and combative. She will talk and talk, they say.  Westwood’s PA, Cynthia, seems exasperated before we even begin. “She’s a loose cannon,” she says with a shrug, while we wait for her to arrive, in an office in her Battersea HQ. Westwood finally enters the room: she is 74 now, tinier than I expected. Westwood doesn’t have much time, she tells me, that notorious voice quieter than I had imagined, because she has got to visit Julian. I assume she is talking about a friend, until she mentions the embassy. She means Julian Assange. “I go once a month,” she nods. “I’m really looking forward to it because they give you such a nice cup of coffee at the Ecuadorian embassy. It’s really good. I pick his brains. I think he’s brilliant.” They’ve been friends for years, since Assange invited her to his birthday party. She calls him a hero. I think we might have a debate. But is he a hero? “Well, of course he is,” she says, as if I’ve just asked her if she has any interest in clothes. “He’s got a library of truth that he’s building and checking and it’s a complete challenge to the official view, all of the time. It means newspapers are going to have to be more truthful. It’s really, really good.” It very quickly becomes apparent that it is impossible to discuss a subject with Westwood. She has her opinion, and that’s that. That’s not to say she is unfriendly; she really does just talk and talk. She continues her point about Assange being a hero for another five minutes or so. Before the interview, Cynthia gave me some advice: speak up, and speak at her, because she’s slightly deaf. Try to keep her on track. And don’t interrupt. I would like to keep her on track, so against Cynthia’s other warning, I try to interrupt, but it doesn’t work – she steams ahead, regardless. She spirals from how newspapers lie, to the migrant crisis, to climate refugees, to how the entire financial system is “a war economy”. She drifts in and out of threads of thought. There are people milling around the room, about to leave, and they’re distracting her. “Just understand that it’s a problem for me,” she says, returning to how the media is propaganda. “Anyway, you’ve got the point, haven’t you?” she asks at the end of it, though I am not sure I have. “I’m just hoping that people will understand that climate change is on our doorstep, it’s here, and that we’ll all be migrants soon. It’s something we might still have the chance to stop.” Does she trust any politicians? She says Lucas, of course, because Lucas is a big supporter of proportional representation, for one thing, and Westwood thinks PR is a necessary change to the current system. I ask if she supports Jeremy Corbyn. “Yeah, we do. We think it’s a real mistake for him to talk about having clean coal.” She tells a long anecdote about being on a panel with Kenneth Clarke and Liz Kendall, who believe you can have safe fracking, then goes on a detour to talk about arms sales to Indonesia. She comes back to “clean” coal, saying it is an old-fashioned, old Labour idea. “I want to support Jeremy Corbyn but he’s wrong there. I’d rather find somebody better to support, but I don’t know one better, except for Caroline.” Westwood thinks people vote Conservative because the status quo makes them feel safe. “I just think of my mother. She was very poor, yet her family voted Conservative. And when I first voted, I voted Conservative because I was brought up like that. Of course then, afterwards, I wasn’t voting Conservative. [In 2007, she announced that she would vote Tory; she supported the Greens in 2015.] Until she was 93, my mother always went and voted Conservative. When you asked her why, she said they were good for the country.” Westwood is notorious for kicking against the status quo. It’s ironic that she’s here to talk about the Greenpeace documentary, because the Greenpeace founders were self-proclaimed hippies, the hippiest of hippies. Flares, long hair, beards, magic mushrooms. At one point in the documentary, the group’s founders roll around in the moss, having a collective epiphany about the interconnectedness of the universe. Westwood is punk incarnate, dressing the Sex Pistols in bondage gear, sticking safety pins through the nose of the establishment. “It was only Malcolm [McLaren, her ex-partner] who was against hippies,” she says now. “That was his idea.” But wasn’t “Never trust a hippy” one of the era’s big slogans? “I actually never said it. I think the hippies absolutely politicised my generation. It was wonderful to find out what was going on, about dictators and what they were up to. I needed to. That’s why I was attracted to Malcolm in the first place – because he understood a lot more about what was going on, and I needed to know what was going on in the world.” Had their paths crossed in the 70s, might she have been friends with Greenpeace co-founder Bob Hunter and his fellow activists? “I’ve never taken drugs,” she says, as her reply. “I’m not interested in drugs. I mean, I do love alcohol. But I don’t like to think I’m not in control. I’ve had a couple of puffs of stuff, me and Chrissie Hynde, smoking something. That was a waste of time. It just gave me a sore throat. Next time, I started to hallucinate and I thought, oh no, thank you. I don’t want that.” She hasn’t touched marijuana since. Westwood can be great company. “I was a single parent most of the time,” she says, wandering off-topic on a question about why she thinks she got ahead in life. “Especially living with Malcolm McLaren, because he just denied having anything to do with [the children]. He was only here every now and then, causing trouble.” She does a rapid about-turn without seeming to notice. “He was great, actually. He’d give the children very dangerous things to do, and everything. He was very good to them.” What does she mean, dangerous? “Things you wouldn’t be allowed to do today. When Joe was about eight and Ben was 12, he sent them on a bicycle ride to Devon.” From London? “Yeah,” she says, smiling. “It took them four days. They went to youth hostels, and it all worked out and they got there. See, people thought very differently about their children,” she adds, catching the look on my face. “When it was dark, they got lost, and knocked on a lady’s door to ask the way. She brought them in for a cup of tea and called the police. The police phoned me, and I said, no, it’s quite all right. They let them carry on with their journey. As long as I knew, it was all right.” Does she think young people are as political today as they once were? “I think less. What do you think, Cynthia?” she asks. Cynthia, who is sitting in on the interview, says it’s half and half. “You either know a lot, or nothing,” Westwood agrees, thinking it over. She says she likes Noam Chomsky’s idea, though says it might be US author and climate activist Bill McKibben’s, about how people think they’re the only ones to hold an opinion. “They think, well I don’t agree with this, but I daren’t say it. I daren’t say that …” What she then says is incendiary enough for Cynthia to shout that that was off the record, and we all laugh. Unfortunately for Cynthia, Westwood ploughs on, and continues with her theory that 9/11 was an inside job. We talk over each other: at the same time as she adds with a glint in her eye, “Don’t ask me what I think”, I say: “Do you think that?” “Well, I do. I should never say this. I self-censor,” she continues, doing no such thing. “Everybody self-censors like that. But when you actually ask people, they say it’s a demolition. How can you lie to yourself about that? Just put it that way. That would be kind to me, if you don’t mind. You have to work it out from there.” How does she know who to trust when there are so many voices? “You have to trust yourself. Of course you do. And in the case of the twin towers, my eyes tell me it’s a demolition.” Cynthia is no longer laughing. “Vivienne, you really have to go.” Westwood is suddenly childlike. “What shall we do, Cynthia? Ask her to drop it?” I can’t promise to do that, I say. We’re in the middle of an interview. Westwood is too longstanding a veteran to expect that she can erase things she has talked about at length, after the fact. Later, I search online – she has stated her beliefs on 9/11 publicly before, in a filmed interview for Dazed Digital last year. And she doesn’t stop, even now. It’s as if she can’t help herself. She talks again about how she is certain the twin towers were demolished. “Most people think it’s not possible for people to be that evil, to do that. And I know that people are very evil. So, I don’t know.” Cynthia is on her feet. I try to get it back on track. I ask Westwood if, in that case, there is any hope for her environmental activism. We’re here to talk about Greenpeace, after all. “No, but we have to carry on. My next fashion show, I’ve called it Mirror the World. What I mean by that is that you have to understand the world you live in, and you should be a little splinter that mirrors the world. Today you have to understand politics, you have to understand what’s going on as well. I’m never going to talk about the twin towers ever again.” “Well you’ve just done it,” says Cynthia, crossly. “You’re 45 minutes late.” “What shall we say to Rebecca?” asks Westwood. “Rebecca’s already made a plan. She’s going to do it. Which is a real pity,” says Cynthia, frostily. I have not had time even to think about a plan. The whole situation is dizzyingly strange. “I don’t mind that it’s in there at all. Not at all,” Cynthia continues. “I don’t want it to take the focus off Greenpeace. I think if it turns out to be all about that, it will be a real shame. Because we really want to support Greenpeace.” There’s a lift in the office. Cynthia has called it up and opened the doors. I think she’s waiting to take Westwood away, until I realise she is waiting for me. I pick up my bag. “But can I just say one thing I think you should add,” says Westwood and, for a second, I think Cynthia might explode. “That is not the issue at the moment, whether that happened or not. One time I thought it was a big issue. Because I thought it would convince people of what harm people are prepared to do. There are more important things: migrants, climate change. The reason it’s not so important is because so many people in the world accept that that’s what happened anyway. People have absorbed it, internalised it, that’s how the world works. You’d be surprised the people you ask. The most conservative people say, oh yes.” Cynthia is holding the lift, impatient for this to be over. Well, thank you for talking to me, I mumble, suddenly feeling very sad. One last question comes into my head, and I’m not sure why. I ask Westwood if she likes people. She thinks about it. “I must,” she answers, finally. “Because I keep sticking my neck out.”"
"As Donald Trump entered the Rochester Community Center in Rochester, New Hampshire for a rally in front of 3,000 people, he was greeted by a full high school marching band playing the Europe song The Final Countdown. He left in the midst of media furor over whether he condoned anti-Muslim bigotry. In between, he took a shot at the Pope and attacked a fellow Republican candidate, all on national television. In short, it was just another Thursday night for Donald Trump. On the home basketball court of the Spaulding High Red Raiders where giant fans spun in an unsuccessful attempt to cool the unseasonable late summer heat, Trump took questions from the audience after briefly taking a victory lap from what he claimed was a win in Wednesday’s Republican presidential debate.   As the Republican frontrunner arrived to resounding applause, he told attendees to “sit down, you’ll be here for a while.” Trump then gave uncharacteristally short monologue where he complained about the debate, in his words, “it was three hours, felt like more than that” as well as his treatment by cable news networks, “Fox treated me shabbily, CNN a little bit better.” But not everything was bad for Trump, he bragged that in every online poll (none of which were scientific) he had won. The billionaire read out the precise percentages and exact number of votes that he had received. Trump also kvelled that he had been endorsed by star New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Trump told attendees “Great winner Tom Brady. Incredible guy, total champion, didn’t want to tell me about it.” He endorsed me yesterday. When you get Tom you’re getting a champ.”  Trump also went on his usual itinerary of his accomplishments on the campaign. He bragged about the crowds he had drawn, the reception he was receiving and his surprise “I’ve only been a politician for almost three months, can you believe it?” The proud graduate of the University of Pennsylvania also claimed he learned a new word in the course of his campaign. “Incoming’ is a word I never heard before, incoming means really bad press,” he explained to the crowd of New Hampshire residents. Eventually, Trump, who didn’t take questions from the media on Thursday night, asked for questions from the audience. He may have preferred to deal with the media in retrospect. The first person to ask a question told Trump “We have a problem in this country, it’s called Muslims. We know our current president is one.” At that point, Trump said “right” uneasily. The questioner then added: “You know he’s not even American, birth certificate man.” At that point, Trump said somewhat resignedly “we need this question” to scattered laughter at the audience. The questioner eventually wrapped up by noting, “But anyway, we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That’s my question. When can we get rid of them?” Trump responded awkwardly to the question. “We are going to be looking at a lot of different things,” he said. “A lot of people are saying that and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening out there, we’re going to be looking at that and plenty of other things.” The Republican frontrunner then quickly moved on.  By ignoring the fact the questioner called Obama “a Muslim” and “not an American,” Trump created a furor late Thursday night. A Trump spokesperson emphasized to the Guardian that the Republican frontrunner’s answer was solely in response to the “training camps”, which is a common far rightwing conspiracy theory and not the questioner’s rambling statement before that. While it drew national attention, it went relatively unnoticed in the high school gym where Trump was speaking. Instead, what drew oohs and aahs, was the Republican frontrunner speaking dismissively of Pope Francis. When asked if he would meet with the pontiff on his upcoming trip to the United States, Trump replied contemptuously, “well, the Pope believes in global warming, you do know that.” Eventually Trump did note “I like the pope. A lot of personality, good man.” Trump’s comment about the pope wasn’t his only awkward moment with Christianity Thursday night. Rod Webber, a man who has followed candidates around New Hampshire, asking questions and handing flowers, started reading a Bible verse to Trump. Webber recited 1 Timothy 3, “Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task. Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable.” Trump responded simply, “oh boy, am I in trouble, am I in trouble.” He then quickly moved on, though Webber, among others, heckled him later about the billionaire’s seeming disbelief in climate change.  The New York real estate mogul went out off his way to bash Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett Packard CEO and GOP presidential rival with whom he sparred in Wednesday’s debate. The Republican frontrunner bashed Fiorina’s corporate record, saying of Hewlett Packard, “people that work there said that company was such a great company until she went out and made such a horrible decision [in overseeing their 2001 merger with Compaq]. Trump has consistently risen in the polls since he entered the race in June and interviews with attendees gave no indication that would change any time soon. His supporters like Joan Jackson of Rochester, New Hampshire were “tired of career politicians” and convinced that the “no BS” Trump would “run the country as well as he runs his business.” This isn’t to say that they weren’t aware of his shortcomings. Emily Powers of Hampstead, New Hampshire warned “he just has to be a little careful about hurting people’s feelings.” However, she still felt confident in his candidacy. “What we really need is someone with business experience,” Powers said. She didn’t always support candidates who ran as businessmen though. Powers dismissed the last candidate to run for president on his business experience, saying of the GOP’s 2012 nominee “Mitt Romney, he just had no personality.” But, with marching bands blaring 80s hits and a propensity to leave entire religious faiths feeling insulted, it may just be that Trump has too much personality.

"President Obama welcomed Pope Francis to the White House Wednesday morning to loud cheers from thousands gathered to greet the leader of the Catholic church — in a city that has virtually shut down for the historic event. The ceremony marks the first time that Pope Francis has visited the United States and kicks off a much anticipated three-city tour that includes Washington DC, Philadelphia, and New York City. During his first address in the United States, Francis pulled no punches when talking about one of the defining issues of his leadership, calling on Americans to protect our “common home” and act on climate change with a sense of urgency – an issue that many Republicans have criticized. “It seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation,” Francis said. “We know by faith that the Creator does not abandon us; he never forsakes his loving plan or repents of having created us. Humanity still has the ability to work together in building our common home.” He is scheduled to speak before Congress tomorrow, where he is expected bring his climate agenda directly to lawmakers. President Obama also took the opportunity to praise Francis’s stance on climate change, telling the pope: “you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet—God’s magnificent gift to us.” Watch below:"
