"There is a 75-80% chance of a climate-warming El Niño event by February, according to the latest analysis from the UN’s World Meteorological Organization. The last El Niño event ended in 2016 and helped make that year the hottest ever recorded by adding to the heating caused by humanity’s carbon emissions. The 2019 event is not currently forecast to be as strong as in 2016.  El Niño events occur naturally every few years and stem from abnormally high ocean temperatures in the eastern Pacific. They have a major influence on weather around the globe, bringing droughts to normally damp places, such as parts of Australia, and floods to normally drier regions, such as in South America. The high temperatures also cause major bleaching on coral reefs. “The forecast El Niño is not expected to be as powerful as the event in 2015-2016,” said Maxx Dilley, the director of WMO’s climate prediction and adaptation branch. “Even so, it can still significantly affect rainfall and temperature patterns in many regions, with important consequences to agriculture and food security, and for management of water resources and public health. It may also combine with long-term climate change to boost 2019 global temperatures.” Forecasters in the US have already warned of an imminent El Niño. Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said in October that a dry, hot summer was very likely, with increased risk of heatwaves and bushfires and no relief for already drought-stricken farmers. There is evidence that climate change is making the effects of El Niño more severe. The heat boost from El Niño helped 2016 to be the hottest year ever recorded. The following year, 2017, was ranked equal second, but was the hottest for a year without an El Niño. Scientists expect 2018, which saw climate-related disasters around the globe, to be the fourth hottest on record. Billions of tonnes of carbon emissions are continuing and greenhouse gases are at record concentrations, meaning their heating effect is stronger than ever. But whether a new El Niño will help make 2019 a new record remains to be seen. “The developing El Niño conditions are likely to contribute to warmer global average temperature in 2019 – it is a little too early to say whether or not it will be a record year,” said Tim Stockdale, at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. In any case, human-caused global warming has resulted in 17 of the 18 hottest years recorded since 1850 occurring between 2000 and 2017. Scientific analyses have shown that many extreme weather events have been made more severe or more likely by climate change. The WMO analysis estimated the chance of a fully-fledged El Niño event between December 2018 and February 2019 at 75-80%, with a 60% chance of it continuing to April 2019. A strong El Niño sees western Pacific sea surface temperatures reaching at least 1.5C more than average. Current model predictions for the imminent El Niño range from 0.8C to 1.2C above average. • This article was amended on 4 December 2018. El Niño is associated with warmer water in the eastern Pacific, not the western Pacific as an earlier version said."
"This month, hundreds of children are going on strike from school to demand urgent action on climate change. From rural Victoria to Townsville, we are walking out of school for a day or more to tell our politicians to listen to us and protect our futures. We are Milou, Jean and Harriet and we are 14 years old.  Two of us – Milou and Harriet – live in rural Victoria. Throughout our lives, we’ve witnessed the impacts that drought, bushfires and extreme weather have on a community. We have been forced to evacuate when a bushfire came through our town. It was scary. But it is something that will happen more and more as climate change gets worse. We feel frustrated and let down when we think about the climate crisis and our future. There is so much our politicians could be doing that they aren’t. It seems they are in denial. Our government is supposed to protect us, not destroy our chances of a safe future. Climate change doesn’t only affect our environment. It affects our physical and mental wellbeing. Milou’s mum is a psychologist and she knows how much something like a bushfire can threaten everything a person cares about. It’s hard to hold on to dreams for the future when we don’t know what that future holds. We feel hurt when we hear people say that we can’t think for ourselves because we’re still children. This is just an excuse not to listen to us. We are perfectly capable of thinking for ourselves. We deserve to be heard and understood. As kids, we can’t yet vote or run for government, however scientists say there’s only about a decade left for us to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. By the time our generation is making decisions, it will be too late. We’re striking from school to push for urgent change now. We were inspired after seeing 15-year-old Greta from Sweden in the newspaper. She’s striking every Friday to put climate change in the spotlight in her country. Australia is even more vulnerable to climate change impacts, which is why we are doing the same here. We are also inspired by the stories of other kids in our community’s history who did big things to stand up for their values. Jean goes to Fort Street high and in the 60s, kids from her school went on strike to protest the war in Vietnam. They took a stand to help stop the atrocity. Young people have always been part of big movements for social change, and we intend to be the same. None of us want to grow up in a world where dangerous bushfires and crippling droughts are normal, where we struggle through extreme heatwaves, and where young people lose their homes to sea level rise. We are often told to count our blessings. We feel lucky to live in such caring communities. But, when we think of all our blessings, it also makes us want to cry. The idea that our children and grandchildren may not get to experience the beautiful world that we live in, is one of the saddest things we can think of. We want to live in a world powered by 100% renewable energy. We don’t want massive new coalmines like Adani’s that will wreck the climate and our future. Although we love school and learning, we love our family, friends and community more. And we will do anything to ensure all of us have a safe planet to live on. So, we are striking from school to save our future, and the futures of the people we love and those not yet with us. ""We might not be able to vote, but we have rights. We have a right to a future."" Words from an 8 year old. 🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏 #schoolstrike4climate #schoolstrike #climatechange #climatechaos #actnow #voicesofyouth #voicesofchildren. pic.twitter.com/fOHVeedj9N And we have a message for our politicians: it’s time to listen to us. You cannot continue pretending we are not here, and that climate change is OK. Because we are here. The climate crisis is here, and it is destroying our planet. People’s lives and livelihoods are on the line. We have trusted you to do what is in the best interest of our country, and it is clear to us that you aren’t doing enough. At the end of November, we are going on strike together with kids from across Australia to get our voices heard. We’re giving up our education for a day to learn more about climate change, experience how to make a difference, and demand our politicians take urgent action on the most important issue of our time. Comments are premoderated to ensure the discussion is about topics that have been addressed in this article."
"On Sunday morning hundreds of politicians, government officials and scientists will gather in the grandeur of the International Congress Centre in Katowice, Poland. It will be a familiar experience for many. For 24 years the annual UN climate conference has served up a reliable diet of rhetoric, backroom talks and dramatic last-minute deals aimed at halting global warming. But this year’s will be a grimmer affair – by far. As recent reports have made clear, the world may no longer be hovering at the edge of destruction but has probably staggered beyond a crucial point of no return. Climate catastrophe is now looking inevitable. We have simply left it too late to hold rising global temperatures to under 1.5C and so prevent a future of drowned coasts, ruined coral reefs, spreading deserts and melted glaciers.  One example was provided last week by a UN report that revealed attempts to ensure fossil fuel emissions peak by 2020 will fail. Indeed the target will not even be reached by 2030. Another, by the World Meteorological Organization, said the past four years had been the warmest on record and warned that global temperatures could easily rise by 3-5C by 2100, well above that sought-after goal of 1.5C. The UK will not be exempt either. The Met Office said summer temperatures could now be 5.4C hotter by 2070. At the same time, prospects of reaching global deals to halt emissions have been weakened by the spread of rightwing populism. Not much to smile about in Katowice. Nor will the planet’s woes end in 2100. Although most discussions use the year as a convenient cut-off point for describing Earth’s likely fate, the changes we have already triggered will last well beyond that date, said Svetlana Jevrejeva, at the National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool. She has studied sea-level rises that will be triggered by melting ice sheets and expanding warm seawater in a world 3-5C hotter than it was in pre-industrial times, and concludes these could reach 0.74 to 1.8 metres by 2100. This would be enough to deluge Pacific and Indian Ocean island states and displace millions from Miami, Guangzhou, Mumbai and other low-lying cities. The total cost to the planet could top £11trillion. Even then the seas will not stop rising, Jevrejeva added. “They will continue to climb for centuries even after greenhouse-gas levels have been stabilised. We could experience the highest-ever global sea-level rise in the history of human civilisation.” Vast tracts of prime real estate will be destroyed – at a time when land will be needed with unprecedented desperation. Earth’s population stands at seven billion today and is predicted to rise to nine billion by 2050 and settle at over 11 billion by 2100 – when climate change will have wrecked major ecosystems and turned farmlands to dust bowls. Unfortunately many experts believe Earth’s population will actually peak well beyond 11 billion. “It could reach 15 billion,” said Sarah Harper, of Oxford’s Institute of Population Ageing. “All sorts of factors suggest women, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, will still want to have relatively high numbers of children and this might keep the world’s population approaching 15 billion rather than 12 billion.” The world will have double its present numbers – but with hugely reduced areas of fertile land to provide food. We will be living in a shrunken, scorched planet bursting with human beings. Somaliland gives a grim vision of this future. In the past few years climate change has killed 70% of its livestock and forced tens of thousands of families to flee from its scorched interior to live in refugee camps. “You can touch it, the climate change, in Somaliland. It is real. It is here,” the country’s environment minister, Shukri Ismail Bandare, said in the Financial Times last week. Sudan and Kenya are also victims of a drought that has dried the Horn of Africa faster than at any other time in the past 2,000 years. Similarly, in Vietnam, thousands a year are abandoning the once fertile Mekong Delta as rising seawater pollutes paddy fields. By 2050, the World Bank says more than 140 million will become climate refugees. It will be bad for humans, but catastrophic for Earth’s other inhabitants. Arctic ice loss threatens polar bears, droughts imperil monarch butterflies, and koala habitats are being destroyed by bush fires. In all, about a sixth of all species now face extinction, say scientists, although in the end no creature or plant will be safe. “Even the most resilient species will inevitably fall victim as extreme stresses drive ecosystems to collapse,” said Giovanni Strona of Europe’s Joint Research Centre in a report last week on climate change. Scientists warned more than 30 years ago that such a future lay ahead, but nothing was done to stave it off. Only dramatic measures are now left to those seeking to save our burning planet, and these can have grim political consequences. In France, for example, President Macron’s new levies on fossil fuels, introduced to cut emissions and to fund renewable energy projects, triggered riots. Had only modest changes been enacted a few decades ago there would be no trouble today, say analysts. But the most telling example is provided by the US, which has emitted about a third of the carbon responsible for global warming. Yet it has essentially done nothing to check its annual rises in output. Lobbying by the fossil fuel industry has proved highly effective at blocking political change – a point most recently demonstrated by groups such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Heartland Institute, which helped persuade President Trump to pull out of the Paris agreement, thus dashing the planet’s last hope of ecological salvation. “The coalition used its power to slow us down precisely at the moment when we needed to speed up,” said the environmentalist Bill McKibben in the New Yorker. “As a result, the particular politics of one country for one half-century will have changed the geological history of the Earth.” No region of the US has more to lose from climate change than southern Florida. If scientists’ worst predictions are realised, an entire metropolitan area, currently inhabited by more than six million people, is likely to be swamped by a 1.5-metre sea-level rise before the end of this century, a rise that could see the tourist mecca of Miami simply disappear. It’s a doomsday scenario that has united the leaders of Miami-Dade county and the cities of Miami and Miami Beach in an attempt to find solutions to the most severe effects of rising oceans before it is too late. Their plan to combat the physical, economic and social challenges of climate change, as part of the global 100 Resilient Cities programme, will play a key role in determining whether the low-lying region will still be habitable in the coming decades or surrendered to the ever-rising Atlantic. “It’s a problem that can be managed, it’s not a problem that can be fixed and you walk away from,” said Susanne Torriente, chief resilience officer for Miami Beach, where hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ dollars have already been spent elevating roads, constructing higher sea walls and investing in modern, high-capacity pumps and stormwater drainage systems. “Every generation will add to the work that we have begun,” Torriente says. “We are always learning, it’s a constant process of learning, re-evaluating and improving.” Up to a million Florida homes, worth an estimated $371bn (£290bn, are at risk of tidal flooding by 2100, one recent study calculated, but the threats facing the greater Miami region are not just coastal. Hurricanes are becoming more powerful because of global warming, say scientists, who point to the destruction wrought by Hurricane Michael in October, while the combination of a low water table and high “king” tides – occurring in autumn – causes regular inland flooding even on dry days. This means that the new joint action plan being worked on by city and county officials has to be further-reaching than anything that has preceded it, Torriente says. “Our resilience journey began with the climate work, the storm water, [but] this strategy will be much broader and will be defining resilience not only in terms of climate and flooding, but also mobility and housing, property, and how to recover quickly in the event of a hurricane in south Florida.”  These moves reflect the sense of urgency being felt in Florida, where the state leadership has been criticised for neglecting the environment. Its newly elected senator, Rick Scott, banned staff from using the term climate change during his time as governor of Florida, and will be a close Washington ally of President Donald Trump, who took the US out of the Paris climate agreement. “We’ll be much more successful if we have more cooperation and more attention at all levels of government, [because] it’s a problem for all of us,” Torriente says. “But we do what we can. Everything we are doing is funded locally, so we can continue to invest.” Richard Luscombe, Miami It’s a 45-minute canoe journey along the coast from regional capital Morombe to Kivalo in south-west Madagascar. Children frolic in the water, palm trees sway, and fishing nets hang along the beach. This tranquillity is deceptive, however – for Madagascar is ranked as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Higher temperatures, extended drought periods in the south, intensification of cyclones and rising sea levels are all forecast. For good measure, the country’s pervasive poverty restricts its capacity to adapt to such changes. In Kivalo, this is already a familiar picture. “The southern wind used to start in January and last until July,” says Bikison Thomas, a fisherman. “But it’s still going now in November.” On very windy days, he cannot put out to sea. “There is also more fog,” he adds. Overfishing, higher sea temperatures and the loss of mangrove, a crucial habitat for fish stocks, are also reducing catches. The Madagascar government is aware of the country’s vulnerability and has ratified the Paris agreement. Climate change is listed in every major policy document but budgets usually fall short of producing effective measures, a point that is demonstrated dramatically down the coast in the town of Morondava, where hotels are grappling with sea-level rise. Two years ago, Chayune Badouraly bought the Coco Beach hotel. It had a few bungalows and a lovely beach. Badouraly added more bedrooms, a reception area and a restaurant. But in September, powerful tides destroyed two of his bungalows, and the sea has not returned to its previous level. “We used to have 150 metres of beach,” he says bitterly. “Now it’s minus five.”  Although there are plans to build sea defences, Badouraly says that could take months, even years, so he’s taken the problem into his own hands and built a 60-metre-long sea wall, a mixture of stone blocks, steel rods and sandbags. “I knew we had coastal erosion problems, but I didn’t think it would be that bad,” he adds. “I would never have bought.” Emilie Filou, Madagascar It is hard to get a grip of the sheerscale of the Thwaites glacier in west Antarctica. It’s more than 300 miles long and 200 wide – and more than a mile thick. It drains an area of ice that is larger than England and stealthily slides towards the sea by several metres every day. Only from satellite images have we understood the shape and power of this ice monster. These now show the beast is waking up. Thwaites’s uptake of falling snow was once matched, fairly finely, by snow and ice being lost as icebergs. Now it has begun to flow faster, along with some of its neighbouring glaciers. More ice is being lost into the ocean than is being replaced, speeding up global sea-level rise. The cause of the disruption at Thwaites is straightforward, researchers have discovered. Increasing amounts of warm ocean water coming from the north have been melting the floating parts of the glacier and this, in turn, is letting the inland glacier run more quickly into the sea. This much we know, but we have still to understand how this process is likely to accelerate. At present, Thwaites contributes around 4% of observed sea-level rise, but it is widely agreed that this could grow exponentially. Indeed, some glaciologists believe that a complete collapse of the Thwaites glacier over coming centuries is now inevitable – and that would raise global sea level by several metres, drowning coastal ecosystems around the world, damaging coastal investments and displacing millions of people. Research on the ice and frigid waters around Thwaites Glacier is urgently needed but carrying that out is tough. Even by Antarctic standards, this area is cold and remote. I have been working in Antarctica for more than 30 years, and I’ve never managed to reach Thwaites. However, the UK and US governments have agreed to send in scientists as part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration. We are finally going to get the chance to understand this waking monster. At the moment, it is merely yawning and stretching. The question we must answer, urgently, is whether it is about to wake up and roar. David Vaughan, British Antarctic Survey Coral reefs cover a mere 0.1% of the world’s ocean floor but they support about 25% of all marine species. They also provide nature with some of its most beautiful vistas. For good measure, coral reefs protect shorelines from storms, support the livelihoods of 500 million people and help generate almost £25bn of income. Permitting their destruction would put the planet in trouble – which is precisely what humanity is doing. Rising sea temperatures are already causing irreparable bleaching of reefs, while rising sea levels threaten to engulf reefs at a faster rate than they can grow upwards. Few scientists believe coral reefs – which are made of simple invertebrates related to sea anemones – can survive for more than a few decades. Yet those who have sounded clear warnings about our reefs have received little reward. Professor Terry Hughes, a coral expert at James Cook University in Queensland, Australia, recently studied the impact of El Niño warmings in 2016 and 2017 on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest coral reef and its largest living entity – and wept when he saw the damage. “The 2016 event killed 30% of corals, the one a year later killed another 20%. Very close to half the corals have died in the past three years,” he said recently. For his pains, Hughes has faced demands from tourist firms for his funding to be halted because he was ruining their business. “The Australian government is still promoting new developments of coal mines and fracking for gas,” Hughes said, after being named joint recipient of the John Maddox prize, given to those who champion science in the face of hostility and legal threats. “If we want to save the Great Barrier Reef, these outdated ambitions need to be abandoned. Yet Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions are rising, not falling. It’s a national disgrace.” This grim picture is summed up by the ethnographer Irus Braverman in her book Coral Whisperers: “The Barrier Reef has changed for ever. The largest living structure in the world has become the largest dying structure in the world.”"

"Standing on a tube platform, Miriam González Durántez’s article (May has added insult to the injury of Brexit, Journal, 29 November) made me cry. Growing up in the north-east of England during the 1970s, I did not get to meet many foreigners as a child, so any opportunity I had to make contact with someone from somewhere different was deeply exciting. Now, living in London, surrounded by difference, it is no less exciting, and I am enthralled as I have ever been by different ways of living and thinking. Having worked for 20 years looking after international students, I was deeply distressed by the Brexit vote and shocked by the increasing horrors of the “hostile environment” policy. An additional sadness is that my 21-year-old son, who has grown up among friends from all around the world, has lost at a stroke his right to live and work in the rest of Europe. But that is not the only thing he has lost: the trebling of tuition fees in 2010 wiped out the money we had been carefully saving to give him at 18, and saddled him with a £50,000 debt. But those two political blunders pale into insignificance beside the damage inflicted on his generation by the comprehensive failure of all governments to address the existential threat of climate change and halt the destruction of life on earth. That is when I really weep.Alison GarnhamChigwell, Essex  • The news that – at last! – the government plans to increase the number of young non-EU doctors allowed to work in the UK under the medical training initiative (MTI) is very welcome (Report, 30 November). We also learn that, sensibly, numbers on the MTI are not counted as part of the immigration total, as they form part of an exchange scheme in sharing knowledge and experience. That is exactly as it should be, but it raises the question: why on earth are university students counted in the immigration total? Surely the same logic should apply to them? The current immigration panic could be much reduced.Prof Peter Ekkehard KoppHull • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Brazil has abandoned plans to host crucial UN climate talks in 2019 amid growing signs of the anti-internationalism of the new government being formed by president-elect Jair Bolsonaro. The foreign ministry announced the reversal in a message to Patrícia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Convention on Climate Change, according to the O Globo news website.  Two months after winning the bid to host the COP25 conference in 2019, the note said Brazil would withdraw its offer to stage the event due to the transition in government and budget restrictions, the paper said. The decision is a blow to global efforts to prevent dangerous levels of global warming. Brazil, which is home to the the world’s biggest rainforest, the Amazon, has been an important player in international climate talks. Its sudden weakening of support comes just days before the opening of this year’s climate talks in Katowice, Poland. The Climate Observatory NGO said Brazil had abdicated its role in one of the areas where it was most needed by the world and its own people. “By ignoring the climate agenda, the federal government also fails to protect the population, hit by a growing number of extreme weather events. These, unfortunately, do not cease to occur just because some doubt their causes,” the group said in a statement. “It is not the first and certainly will not be the last bad news of Jair Bolsonaro for that area.” The broken promise is in line with the anti-globalist rhetoric of the far-right former army captain, who was elected president in October and will take power in January. He threatened to quit the Paris climate agreement, then subsequently backtracked, but has made no secret of his desire to open up the Amazon to mining, farming and dam building. He has also aligned himself closely to Donald Trump. Earlier this month he choose a new foreign minister who claims “climate alarmism” is part of a cultural Marxist plot and who said the United Nations has no language for “love, faith and patriotism”. The shift has been abrupt. Just two months ago – shortly before the election – the foreign ministry said Brazil’s offer to host the COP25 talks “confirms the country’s leadership role in sustainable development issues” and “reflects the consensus of Brazilian society on the importance and the urgency of actions that contribute to the fight against climate change”, according to the O Globo news website.

"Arriving in the village of Kivalo in south-west Madagascar after a boat ride of about three-quarters of an hour through beautiful mangrove from the nearest land point, is a bit like stepping out of time. Children frolic in the water. Palm trees sway in the ocean breeze. Chickens run between thatched huts as fishing nets hang by the beach, ready for the next outing. It feels like very little has ever changed here. Yet this tranquillity belies the enormity of the change ahead. Few countries are more vulnerable to climate change than Madagascar, the location of which – in the Indian Ocean, off the south-east coast of Africa – leaves it hugely exposed. The island nation’s pervasive poverty and lack of economic development also severely restrict its capacity to adapt to climatic shifts.  Broadly speaking, the main changes experienced by Madagascar will be rising temperatures, extended drought periods, as seen in the south, greater variability in rainfall, the intensification of cyclones – cyclone Enawo, in 2017, was the most destructive in 13 years – and rising sea levels and sea temperatures. In Kivalo, much of this is already familiar. “The southern wind used to start in January and last until June or July,” says Bikison Thomas, a local fisherman. “But it’s still going now [ in November].” On very windy days, fishermen cannot go out to sea. “There is also more fog, which makes it difficult to leave early in the morning,”says Thomas. Other factors are also contributing to reduced catches, not least overfishing and the loss of mangrove, a crucial habitat for the regeneration of fish stocks. Further down the coast, in the city of Morondava, hotels and restaurants in the seaside neighbourhood of Nosy Kely are grappling with another effect of climate change: sea-level rise. Two years ago, Chayune Badouraly bought a hotel there, the Coco Beach: it had a few bungalows and a lovely beach. Badouraly then built a new building with bedrooms, a reception and a restaurant. But in September, during the powerful equinox tides, the sea destroyed two of his five bungalows. The water level has not returned to its original level since. “We used to have 150m of beach, now it’s minus five,” he says, bitterly. “I knew we had coastal erosion problems, but I didn’t think it would be that bad. I would never have bought.” The government of Madagascar is well aware of the country’s vulnerability. It has ratified the Paris climate agreement and climate change is listed in every major policy document. Budget allocations usually fall short, however, says Jane Razanamiharisoa, director of adaptation at the National Bureau for the Coordination of Climate Change. “As part of the consultation for the national adaptation plan, we have lobbied about the importance of getting the ministry of planning and budget involved, so that decision-makers can factor climate change in the budget,” says Razanamiharisoa. The government is also piloting adaptation projects in key sectors, but Razanamiharisoa believes that, for Madagascar to boost its resilience, climate change must become embedded in policy “in every sector, and at every level: national, regional and local”. Although there are plans to build sea defences in Morondava, Badouraly says it could take months, even years for anything to materialise. Since September, the sea now laps right up against the new buildings, so he’s taken the problem into his own hands by building a 60-metre long sea defence wall from stone blocks, steel rods and sand bags. “Everything we earn goes there,” says Reza Vally, Coco Beach’s manager. In Kivalo, WWF is piloting the development of beekeeping and ecotourism. The initiatives offer alternative revenues to fishing and protect the mangrove by making it the cornerstone of the new activities. The organisation estimates that 80% of mangrove destruction in the area is due to human factors, and 20% to climate change; rising sea level and less rainfall means increased salinity levels and more silting in mangrove areas. “There is nothing we can do about [climate change factors], but we can work on the human factors,” says Eli Todimanana, capacity building offer at WWF Madagascar. Despite the new activities being far removed from anything they had ever done, the villagers have embraced the opportunity. The village now has 12 hives, kept in a secure enclosure, and they have had two honey harvests over the past year. Since different species of mangrove trees flower at different times of the year, Todimanana says they could have up to four harvests a year once they master the art of beekeeping. “Can you imagine? Fishermen converted to beekeepers, that’s quite something,” he says. “They have tough lives: they leave at 4am to fish, come back by midday; then they must look after their nets. It’s quite hard to fit in other activities.” The village has also started receiving tourists, making the best of its postcard location. There are pirogue tours, crab-fishing excursions in the mangrove and meals cooked by local women. WWF has provided training and technical support throughout. Justin Rakotomanahira, a local fisherman and president of Kivalo’s village association, says the new activities have been like a window to the world: “It’s allowed us to meet new people and learn new skills, which we’ll be able to pass on to our children. Fishing is our life but, given the current pressures, this move [to other activities] is really important.”"

"UK and US insurers are lagging far behind European firms when it comes to divesting from coal-heavy businesses and refusing to insure them, campaigners have warned. At least 19 major insurers holding more than $6tn in assets – a fifth of the industry’s global assets – have now divested from coal, according to a report from the Unfriend Coal campaign, which represents a coalition of a dozen environmental groups including Greenpeace, 350.org and the Sierra Club. This is up from $4tn – equivalent to 13% of global assets – that were covered by coal exclusion policies a year ago. The study rates 24 of the world’s biggest insurers on their efforts to distance themselves from the fossil fuel industry. A growing number of insurers are taking action, faced with mounting losses from disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires, whose frequency and severity has increased due to a warming climate. Global losses reached $337bn last year, including insured losses of $144bn. The report found that Europe’s four biggest insurers have restricted insurance for coal. Germany’s Allianz and Italy’s Generali limited underwriting this year, while French firm Axa tightened its policy further. A third of the global reinsurance market has also restricted cover for coal, with the reinsurance firms Swiss Re and Munich Re limiting their underwriting this year. UK insurers, though, have made less progress than European firms. Lloyd’s of London, the world’s oldest insurance market, has done nothing to encourage its syndicates to stop insuring coal or sell their coal investments, the report said, although it excluded coal from the investment strategy for its own central fund in April. Lloyd’s said: “The Lloyd’s market is made up of more than 50 insurance companies that run almost 100 syndicates between them. These insurance companies each have their own investment policies. It is not the corporation’s role to set investment strategy for the market, although we think that by showing leadership in this area, others in the Lloyd’s market and wider insurance sector will be encouraged to follow.” Aviva and Legal & General are focused on engaging with coal companies to create change, and only sell their coal holdings in exceptional circumstances. Neither provides insurance to coal companies, but Aviva is one of the top investors in the Polish coal industry, whose plans to build more than 7 gigawatts of new coal power are inconsistent with the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change, according to Unfriend Coal. Unfriend Coal’s campaign coordinator, Lucie Pinson, said trying to engage with coal companies was “a waste of time” and that cutting financial ties with them was the only way forward. Across the Atlantic, none of the nine leading US insurers have taken any action. In Japan, there are the first signs of change, as three large life insurers – Nippon Life, Dai-ichi Life and Meiji Yasuda Life – have announced they will no longer fund new coal projects. Globally, Allianz is the only company that has pledged to cut its financial ties with coal companies completely by 2040, by stopping both underwriting and insuring in coal.  The UK insurance broker Willis Towers Watson warned in September that “finding alternative sources [of coal insurance] is likely to become increasingly challenging – especially if North American insurers begin to follow the European lead”. The Unfriend Coal report is being presented to insurers at an insurance and climate risk conference in London, and as the UN climate change conference gets under way in Poland on Monday."

"Talk about cognitive dissonance. Just two days before 13 federal agencies released a report laying out the devastating human and economic toll that climate change already is taking in the United States, Donald Trump tweeted: “Whatever happened to global warming?” The tweet was based on a spurt of cold weather in the north-east, never mind that the rest of the world was experiencing higher than normal temperatures. The administration was so concerned about what the report, called the National Climate Assessment (NCA), would reveal – including the fact that the president’s thinking on climate change is hopelessly flawed – that it chose to release it on Black Friday, hoping no one would pay attention. A member of Trump’s transition team, Steven Milloy, was candid about this strategy, saying: “Do it on a day when nobody cares, and hope it gets swept away by the next day’s news.” Fortunately for the Earth and its residents, news coverage about the report continued over the weekend and into the following week. So, what was Trump trying to hide? The fact that global warming’s effects are here and now. When western state residents say that recent wildfires are unlike anything they’ve experienced before, there’s a reason for that. Climate change doubled the area burned by wildfires across the west between 1984 and 2015, relative to what would have burned without warming, according to the report. And when coastal residents say that decades ago, they weren’t splashing through flooded streets on sunny days, there’s a reason for that, too. Sea level rise has increased the frequency of high tide flooding by a factor of five to 10 since the 1960s for some communities. US residents (and, of course, people all over the world), are now being forced to cope with dangerously high temperatures, rising seas, deadly wildfires, torrential rainfalls and devastating hurricanes. If carbon emissions continue unabated, life will become much more difficult. By the end of the century annual losses in some sectors are projected to exceed $100bn and surpass the gross domestic product of many states, according to the NCA. However, we can avoid these damages by embarking on the lower emissions scenario, reducing costs by nearly 50% in the labor sector and nearly 60% in the extreme heat mortality sector. While the report doesn’t offer policy recommendations, its findings certainly make the case that the administration must stop rolling back the climate policies the previous administration put in place, including standards requiring vehicles to go farther on a gallon of gas and rules that would limit carbon emissions from power plants. The report will also make it much harder for the Trump administration to defend these rollbacks in court: judges don’t like it when policymakers ignore authoritative science. Though Trump has stalled progress at the federal level, he doesn’t control what states, cities and the private sector do. All have stepped up to fill the void left by the Trump administration’s abdication. For example, states across the country are implementing policies that curtail global warming emissions, either out of concern over climate change or because the policies make economic sense. California is leading the pack with a recently passed law targeting that the state’s electricity come from carbon-free sources by 2045. Texas, with its steady winds and large open spaces, is ranked number one in wind energy generation in the US, generating more wind energy than all but five countries. State leaders there had the foresight to invest more than $7bn in transmission infrastructure to connect those open areas to population centers. And sunny North Carolina is powering half a million homes with solar thanks to state incentives, renewable portfolio requirements, investments by utilities and solar energy purchases by large in-state firms such as Apple and Ikea. The midterm elections bode well for continued progress at the state level. In New Mexico, Maine, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin, gubernatorial candidates who pledged to advance science-based clean energy and climate action won their races. Even in Washington DC there are signs that the pendulum has begun to swing back, with voters deciding to end one-party rule in Congress. The House of Representatives’ new leadership plans to hold hearings on the president’s efforts to dismantle climate rules and young voters who have mobilized around climate issues plan to hold Congress’s feet to the fire, pushing Democrats to make climate legislation a priority this year. The lesson for Trump and his supporters is that you can only ignore science for so long – eventually it catches up to you. And people around the country are realizing that we are now deep into it and climate impacts will only get worse without action. State and private sector action is helpful; national action is essential. Let’s just hope that enough federal decision-makers get the message soon. The NCA makes it clear that time is the most precious commodity of all; we are running out of it.

"A record-breaking heatwave in north Queensland will further increase above-average marine temperatures, heightening the risk of another coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef next year, scientists say. Dozens of record November temperatures have been recorded in the region, most along the reef coastline, this week.  The most remarkable was at Cairns, where consecutive days reached temperatures of 42.6C and 40.9C. The maximum temperature on Tuesday broke a November record that has stood since 1900 by 5.4C. Extreme weather fuelled more than 130 bushfires, which the premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said on Twitter was “not the kind of fire we have seen in Queensland before”. “Heatwave records and fire weather is unprecedented,” Palaszczuk said. A dust storm, brought by strong westerly winds, covered the southern inland parts of the state. In the north, thousands of native flying foxes died due to the high temperatures. Reef scientist Terry Hughes, from the coral centre of excellence at James Cook University, said the summer heatwave was “terrifying” and lifted the chances of coral death on the Great Barrier Reef early next year. This is terrifying. An early summer heatwave breaks all records, lifting the chances of another episode of coral mortality on the #greatBarrierReef next Feb/March. https://t.co/NQkoKhGW5P The reef sustained successive marine heatwaves, in the early part of 2016 and 2017, which killed corals and badly damaged the northern and central sections. Hughes said the bleaching forecasts were “trending upwards” but scientists would not have a clear picture until the end of January. Coral ecophysiologist Dr Neal Cantin, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said ocean temperatures remained below those recorded at the same time in 2015 and 2016, but warmer than historical averages. Cantin said the current heatwave would “add heat and warm up the ocean. It certainly adds heat to the system. We’ve seen record breaking land temperatures this week, which we expect to see into the future with climate change and everything heating up. “We’re in a watch phase. There’s definitely the potential and how the local weather patterns pan out in January and February will really determine whether we get a large scale bleaching event or not. “There are some signs we may avoid [bleaching] this summer. At this stage it’s less likely to be as bad as 2016, but we’ll be ready to respond [if bleaching occurs].” “The hazard I worry most about is heatwaves,” Andrew Gissing, a disaster management expert from the firm Risk Frontiers, said. “Australia needs to be better prepared for heatwaves, with climate change we are already predicting they will get more severe.” Gissing told Guardian Australia people often respond to extreme weather events and natural disasters based on their previous experiences. But he said governments, businesses and individuals were often not prepared for the increasing severity and frequency of such events. “We did a lot of work in Lismore after Cyclone Debbie. So many people sheltered in their homes because that’s what they always did when it flooded. They just didn’t realise this flood was that much bigger “People really need to be attuned to what’s actually happening ... how the nature of climactic hazards is changing.” Gissing said businesses needed to start investing in climate change mitigation and adaption measures. “It’s going to be very hard to mitigate a lot of the [predicted climate] impacts, so adaptation for the future is going to be really important. Especially when you overlay climate change on a growing population base. “The [number of people living on the Queensland coast] is likely to double by about 2030. Because of climate change, we’re looking at there being more exposure [to disaster risks] there as well.”"
"School students protesting climate change have arrived in Canberra after the prime minister told them to be less activist and go back to school. Hundreds of students lined up outside Parliament House on Wednesday wanting to speak to Scott Morrison and government ministers about taking emergency action against climate change. On Tuesday, the Senate approved a motion to support the students in their decision to strike from school and hold a series of planned national protests. Students across the country plan to leave school this week, with protests in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Hobart scheduled for Friday. On Wednesday it was the turn of Canberra students, who waited in the rain outside parliament and met with Labor, Greens and crossbench MPs, including the federal Greens leader, Richard Di Natale. 200 school strikers are queueing to go inside Federal Parliament RN! #ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/dmf35wxoYx Matilda, 9, held a sign that said “Beware: Radical student activist”.

On Wednesday, Steele-John, Labor MPs Ged Kearney and Julie Owens, and Centre Alliance MP Rebehka Sharkie also met the students to hear their concerns. • #MyClimateQuestions: experts and youth leaders answer your questions about climate change and political action"
"People’s health is being damaged today by climate change through effects ranging from deadly heatwaves in Europe to rising dengue fever in the tropics, according to a report. Billions of hours of farmwork has been lost during high temperatures and global warming has damaged the ability to grow crops, it said.  The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change was produced by 150 experts from 27 universities and institutions including the World Health Organization and the World Bank. “The findings are clear and the stakes could not be higher,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director-general. “We cannot delay action on climate change. We cannot sleepwalk through this health emergency any longer.” The report sets out the impacts of global warming on health in stark terms. ”A rapidly changing climate has dire implications for every aspect of human life, exposing vulnerable populations to extremes of weather, altering patterns of infectious disease, and compromising food security, safe drinking water and clean air,” it said. Nick Watt, the executive director of the Lancet Countdown, said: “These are not things happening in 2050 but are things we are already seeing today. We think of these as the canary in, ironically, the coalmine.” On Tuesday the UN said action to cut carbon emissions must be tripled to avoid catastrophic warming. International climate change negotiations were due to resume on Monday in Poland. The Lancet report said the lack of progress “threatens both human lives and the viability of the national health systems they depend on, with the potential to overwhelm health services”. A survey in the report of leaders of almost 500 global cities found half expected their public health infrastructure to be seriously compromised by climate change, meaning systemic failures such as the shutdown of hospitals.  A heatwave in Europe this summer was linked to hundreds of premature deaths in the UK alone. MPs said in July that the UK was “woefully unprepared” for heatwaves. The Lancet report says populations in Europe and the eastern Mediterranean are at higher risk than those in Africa and south-east Asia because of the high proportion of vulnerable and elderly people living in cities. As temperatures rise across the world, the report says 157 million more vulnerable people were subjected to a heatwave in 2017 than in 2000. Hot conditions directly damage health via heatstroke, but dehydration and exacerbation of conditions such as heart disease are also very dangerous. Heat also worsens air pollution and mental health problems. Prof Kristie Ebi, of the University of Washington, said: “Increased mortality in extreme heatwaves is happening now [but] there is abundant evidence that communities are not prepared for the ongoing increases in the frequency, intensity and duration of heatwaves.” The Lancet report said 153bn hours of work were lost in 2017 due to extreme heat, 80% of it in agriculture. Almost half the losses were in India, equivalent to 7% of its total working population, while China lost the equivalent of 1.4% of its workers. “This has led to vast losses for national economies and household budgets,” said Prof Joacim Rocklöv of Umeå University in Sweden. Relatively small changes in temperatures and rainfall could cause large changes in the transmission of infectious diseases spread via water and mosquitoes. The ability of the dengue fever virus to be transmitted – its “vectorial capacity” – reached a record high in 2016, according to the report, 10% above a 1950s baseline. The danger from cholera risk was also rising in regions such as the Baltic states where the sea has been warming rapidly. Doctors not involved in the report said it presented convincing evidence. “It is clear that climate change is directly impacting our health,” said Howard Frumkin, head of the Wellcome Trust’s Our Planet, Our Health programme. “All sectors must prioritise action on climate change if we are to significantly reduce the potentially devastating impact on our planet and our health, affecting generations to come.” Prof Paul Ekins, of University College London, said the health benefits of tackling climate change had long been undervalued, with just 5% of funding for adaptation to global warming being spent on health. “These benefits are enormous, near-term and affect our health immediately,” Ekins said. “If you factor in these benefits, cutting emissions to [keep the temperature rise below] 1.5C is going to be a net benefit to humanity in monetary terms.” The Lancet report noted some promising trends, such as the phase-out of coal and the growth of electric cars. Prof Hilary Graham, of the University of York and part of the Lancet Countdown team, said linking health and climate change could help spur further action. “Health is what people feel. It makes a direct connection with their lives and the lives of people they care about like their children and grandchildren.”"
"The Trump administration published a major report on climate change the day after Thanksgiving. We will explore the key findings each day this week. Donald Trump doesn’t believe his own government’s major report on climate change – which the administration tried to bury over the Thanksgiving break. It warns that rising temperatures are already harming America and will cause huge damage globally. US coastal communities are already bearing the brunt of rising seas and more extreme weather made worse by climate change, as was evident with the vicious 2017 hurricane season. Sea-level rise could reshape the country’s population distribution, resulting in 13.1 million people who might need to migrate by 2100 if the oceans are 6ft higher (which is actually 2ft lower than the most extreme scenario estimated). That will be expensive. Already, the federal government spent $48m to resettle a tribe in Louisiana. The US is losing more than 80,000 acres of coastal wetlands per year, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico. By 2100, the US is likely to lose an additional 16% of wetlands. The wetlands are valuable ecosystems that protect humans from storms, reduce erosion from waves, enhance water quality and support fisheries and recreation. They also are sinks for the carbon dioxide from power plants, cars and industry that causes climate change. As they are degraded, they will not be able to soak up as much CO2. The National Climate Assessment raises tough questions about whether people will retreat, accommodate or protect against harsher storms and disappearing land. Helping people adapt to climate change along the coast is a difficult political proposition, as some property owners can afford to modify their homes or move while others cannot. Coastal cities – including Boston, New York, Miami, San Francisco, New Orleans and Los Angeles – are already spending to adapt to sea-level rise and more frequent flooding. But the resources they are allocating are not enough to meet future threats, the report notes."
"Americans, including Republicans, are becoming more convinced that climate change is causing extreme weather and sea-level rise, according to a new poll from Monmouth University. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans, 64%, now think climate change is happening, compared to 49% three years ago. And more of the general population, 78% compared to 70% three years ago, acknowledge climate change. But many people still don’t agree with the consensus science that shows humans are the dominant cause of climate change. Only 29% of people say climate change is more from human activity than natural changes in the environment or some mix of the two. Monmouth pollster Patrick Murray said he thinks climate-fueled disasters, including the wildfires in California, “have convinced folks that something is going on”. But Republicans tend to be less likely to acknowledge that humans are causing the problem. He said the conclusion for American political candidates is that “the worse the effects of climate change become the more likely people are to believe in it, which is not a very good thing if you’re trying to stop it”. The results come as Donald Trump and his key environment officials have been discounting a multi-agency report laying out the wide-scale and immediate risks climate change poses to the country. Trump said he doesn’t believe the findings and the top appointees at the environmental protection agency and interior department have questioned the assessment too, saying it focuses on the worst-case scenario. The report investigates what will happen if greenhouse gases from power plants and cars continue to rise through the century in a business-as-usual scenario, but it also warns of serious consequences even if the world manages to rein in pollution sooner. The administration has also been actively rescinding environment and climate regulations and trying to expand fossil fuel use that causes rising temperatures. Trump’s position and his efforts are not in line with public opinion, according to the poll. A large majority of Americans support action by the US government to slow climate change. The poll did not, however, ask people about their support of specific strategies that could include increased costs for consumers. "

"The kids couldn’t believe it. The adults couldn’t believe it. Martin Place hadn’t seen anything like it for years, and Elly and her sister had never seen anything like it – ever. Elly, 14, and Aidan, 10, had come thinking the strike would be “a small thing”. Elly said she didn’t know many people from her school who were coming. She found a thousand others. On Friday, in a crowded Martin Place, the chants went up and I’ve never felt prouder. This week thousands of students in every state walked out of school to protest inaction over climate change and the sense that their future is being frittered away. They had the signs, the statistics, the anger – and the solutions too. I looked around and felt I had seen the future, clever and full of passion. I count myself as nearly of the same generation as the strikers. I’m six years out of high school, nearly graduated from university – but I’ve never seen a protest like this. I came in with cynicism. In the exact same spot, I have seen so many protests wither on the vine, outnumbered by food-court patrons. University students like to think that they are the epicentre of social change, or at least they were in the heyday of the 70s. But on Friday in Sydney all you could hear in the CBD were the school kids, and in Melbourne they stopped traffic at 1pm on a school day. Activism seems to have skipped a generation, and I couldn’t be happier. In Sydney, Jean Hinchliffe, 14, had the stage and took the roll, in a way. She asked who here was in primary school, who was in high school, who was from western Sydney, who had travelled from the bush, who wanted their politicians to do way more about climate change. The roar sent the microphones screaming into static and camera operators winced with their headphones in. Scott Morrison had told them not to gather and that only made them feel better about doing it. Finally, something the politicians couldn’t control. That was the theme of the day – the frustration of feeling powerless. “You have failed us all so terribly,” said Nosrat Fareha, 15, from Auburn Girls High school. “We deserve better. Young people can’t even vote but will have to live with the consequences of your inaction for decades.” Morrison was mentioned by every speaker and booed every time. How much he must regret that throwaway line in question time, that “kids should go to school” and be “less activist”, and the electoral harm it threatens to cause in a few more years. It was so easily turned around, and the irony obvious to all. “If Scott Morrison wants children to stop acting like a parliament, then maybe the parliament should stop acting like children,” Manjot Kaur, 17, said. It was an articulate anger, and the speakers made sure to say they had the solutions too, not just the doom and gloom. There was music and happiness. They sang Stand by Me and everyone knew the words – an old-school activist vibe to make anyone dewy-eyed. One girl said to another, “Oh I should have put you up on my shoulders for that!” and then did on the next song. “Here’s to us”, said Fareha. “The generation that can’t wait until it’s too late”. There will inevitably be blowback from the rightwing commentariat, and the politicians themselves, that these young activists have been whipped into a false frenzy. But that’s not what this was. It was a hesitant, cautious embrace of something long overdue. “When I say student, you say power!” Hinchliffe shouted. They did. And it felt like a sense of self-actualisation – hundreds looking around and thinking yes, everyone is actually, really saying it too. Maybe it’s true. The call and response came up and down Martin Place in waves, swimming long laps. They were clutching their ears it was so loud."
"The UN climate change summit begins on Monday with a warning that today’s generation is the last that can prevent catastrophic global warming, as well as the first to be suffering its impacts. Almost 200 nations were set to meet in Poland for two weeks, aiming to hammer out a vital agreement to turn the carbon-cutting vision set in Paris in 2015 into reality. Moves to rapidly ramp up action would be another key goal, with current pledges leaving the world on track for a disastrous 3C of warming.  The negotiations will take place against a background of ominous news: the past four years have been the hottest on record and global emissions were rising again, when they need to fall by half by 2030. Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C scientists advise, according to the UN. The political backdrop contains challenges as well, with climate change denial from the US president, Donald Trump, and attacks on the UN process from Brazil’s incoming Bolsonaro administration. The hosting of the summit by a coal-friendly Polish government further worries some observers. But the EU’s new intention to become climate neutral and the plummeting cost of renewable energy have been positives, while a year of extreme weather was anticipated to focus minds. “We are clearly the last generation that can change the course of climate change, but we are also the first generation with its consequences,” said Kristalina Georgieva, the CEO of the World Bank. The bank announced on Monday that its record $100bn (£78bn) of climate funding from 2021-2025 would for the first time be split equally between projects to cut emissions and those protecting people from the floods, storms and droughts that global warming is making worse. In recent years, just 5% of global funding has gone on protection, but 2018 has seen climate impacts hit hard, with heatwaves and wildfires in Europe and California and huge floods in India, Japan and east Africa. “We are already seeing the devastating impact of climate change,” Georgieva told the Guardian. “We strongly believe that action ought to go both on mitigation and on adaptation.” “Climate extremes are the new normal,” said Prof Patrick Verkooijen, the CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, in the Netherlands. “The climate debate can no longer only be about the causes – it also needs to focus on how billions of people at risk can rapidly adapt. Rich nations have promised $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer countries adapt to climate change and develop clean energy. Negotiators in Poland would have to bring the two blocs together with firm agreement on how the promise would be fulfilled. Gebru Jember Endalew, the chair of the 47-strong Least Developed Countries Group, said: “We represent almost one billion people, the people who are least responsible for climate change but among those most vulnerable to its effects. The longer poor countries have to wait [for funding], the larger the cost will become.” The negotiators in Poland must also produce a rulebook governing how action pledged under the Paris agreement was tracked and reported to ensure all nations play their part. “Fair and effective rules for accounting must be established, with special responsibilities for the big emitters such as the US and Europe but also China and India,” said Prof Johan Rockström, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “While defining a rulebook sounds boring, it is in fact essential.” The role of the Polish hosts will be crucial and the deputy energy minister Michał Kurtyka has said it would focus on using forests to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, electric vehicles and ensuring workers in fossil fuel industries were helped into new jobs. Poland generates 80% of its electricity from coal and the UN summit will take place in a coal mining town, Katowice. The Polish government has also allowed two coal companies to sponsor the summit. “Having major coal companies as climate summit sponsors sends the worst possible signal at the worst possible time,” said Robert Cyglicki, Greenpeace’s director in Central and Eastern Europe. “It would be like Philip Morris sponsoring a health summit where a cigarette ban is supposed to be agreed. We will know this was a successful summit if coal companies regret sponsoring it.” Many nations remain firmly committed to climate action, particularly France and China. But the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned last week that the rise of populism was undermining the political will of some countries to work with others. “We have more and more nationalist approaches being popular and winning elections,” he said. “This has led in my opinion to a lack of political will.” “Every day, we witness the effects of the changing climate on poor and vulnerable people around the world,” said Adriana Opromolla, at NGO Caritas Internationalis. “Transformation is possible, but political will is needed to make it happen.”"

"Just a couple of months shy of 50 years ago, along with other students, I produced an anti-Vietnam war poster that urged high-school students to join the Student Underground Movement. As my first piece of street art it was hardly earth-shattering but was a tiny part of something that contributed, by May 1970, to a major student strike in which thousands of high-school students in Sydney and Melbourne took to the streets to protest the war in the lead-up to the moratoriums of that year.  It was a distant war insofar as it was in an obscure part of south-east Asia, but one with immediate consequences for those high-school students. If nothing else, some students — or their brothers — faced conscription and potential death on the Mekong Delta or the jungles of Nui Dat; let alone complicity in a colonial war that was leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people. A response of Liberal-Country party governments at the time was to suspend students who participated in anti-Vietnam war activities. Indeed, the then Victorian premier, Henry Bolte, threatened to expel students and prevent them from completing their high-school certificates. I was lucky in New South Wales, only being suspended for two days for daring to display a Vietnam moratorium sticker on my school bag — others were suspended for longer or indeed expelled. And so the response to recent high-school activism over climate change by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has an uncanny echo five decades on. There’s a different set of initials now: LNP. But the message is the same. High-school students should shut up, knuckle down, and stay away from the real world of political discussion – in this case the issue of climate change and campaigns to shift government action/inaction on the issue. We shouldn’t be listening to young people who nevertheless will have to bear the consequences of climate change – that “listening” is bitterly opposed by our prime minister. He told parliament they should stay in the classroom rather than thinking about things that “can be dealt with outside of school”. Really? “Each day I send my kids to school and I know other members’ kids should also go to school but we do not support our schools being turned into parliaments,” Morrison said in parliament. “What we want is more learning in schools and less activism in schools. “We are committed to all of these things [climate change action] but I will tell you what we are also committed to — kids should go to school.” Learning? Activism? Going to school? You don’t get it, prime minister. Your government urges young people to take up Stem subjects — yet rejects them out of hand when they take those learnings into life in confronting climate change. Perhaps it is the politicians that should go back to school and do a bit of learning. And all power to those high-school students who will be putting their hands up on climate change. History is on your side. Chips Mackinolty is an Alice Springs-based artist and writer"

"China must play a leading role if the world is to draw up a new and more effective strategy to halt the collapse of life on Earth, according to senior delegates at the close of this week’s UN biodiversity conference. With the US absent, Europe distracted and Brazil tilting away from global cooperation, the onus has shifted towards Beijing, the diplomats said after two weeks of slow-moving talks on how to maintain the natural infrastructure on which humanity depends.  China will host the next high-level negotiations, in 2020, which will be the most important in more than 10 years. This is the deadline for nations to agree on fresh global targets for the protection and management of forests, rivers, oceans, pollinators and other wildlife. Conservationists hope this “new deal for nature and people” becomes as much of a priority as the Paris climate accord and helps to reverse the current wave of extinction, which is at the highest rate the world has seen since the age of the dinosaurs. Over the coming two years, China should champion the cause of nature as France championed the cause of climate in the run-up to the Paris deal in 2016, urged the diplomats. “China is very important. It can be a great leader,” said Hesiquio Benítez Díaz, Mexico’s director general of international cooperation, who helped organise the previous global biodiversity conference. “We’re reaching the point of no return for many species. It’s really bad, but people don’t see this issue.” Rather than leaving biodiversity on the fringes, where it has until now been dealt with mostly by politically weak environment ministers and NGOs, he hoped Beijing would use its clout to ensure the subject was high on the agenda of G8 and G20 summits and to press for participation by heads of state in 2020. They also want the issue to be taken up by communities, companies and individuals. This message was echoed by the executive secretary of the biodiversity convention. “We tell China that the biodiversity agenda needs a lot of championing,” said Cristiana Paşca Palmer. “They were instrumental in the success of Paris and they can play a very important role.” Until recently, China’s dire pollution problems and woeful record on wildlife conservation meant it would have been an unlikely champion of nature. However, under President Xi Jinping perceptions have started to shift. The government has promoted the concept of “ecological civilisation”, established hundreds of environmental courts and played a positive role in global climate talks. At the conference, Beijing sent mixed messages. It initially ignored a proposal to get involved in preparations with Mexico (the previous host) and Egypt (the host this year), and it remained low-key in Sharm el-Sheikh over the past two weeks of talks. “We were very nervous about their silence,” confided one foreign diplomat. But those familiar with the Chinese delegation said this reflected a difference of approach. Rather than set ambitious public goals, they said the country preferred to set expectations low and work at a higher level behind the scenes. “They are really determined to succeed, but they don’t know how to do it,” said another source. A shift in pace and priorities is essential. Delegate after delegate in Sharm el-Sheikh warned of risks to food production and human wellbeing from the loss of corals, forests and the 60% loss of biodiversity since 1972. There was recognition that the current global management plan has been a failure: among the 20 Aichi biodiversity targets, only one – on the creation of protected areas – is measurably close to being met. Highlighting the low priority that even the host government put on nature, a shop near the conference centre was openly selling an illegal lion hide for $1,500 (£1,170). This convention established a process to draw-up a “Post 2020 Road Map” with more forceful and effective goals. But the political winds are even less favourable than in 2010. Brazil, which played an important role eight years ago, will soon have a far-right government and its diplomats spent much of the time on niggling issues that could have an impact on exploitation of its world-leading biodiversity. At one point the conference spent 35 minutes debating whether to be “concerned” or “deeply concerned” about the impact of climate change. A row broke out between developing and developed nations over how to share the economic benefits from genetic sequencing information. Tense negotiations were also needed to set new guidelines for gene drive technology, which can be used to eradicate entire species. Governments stopped short of imposing a moratorium, but built in strong precautions by insisting that no research be allowed without risk assessment , risk management and the consent of any communities who might be affected by the release of modified organisms. Crucially, the delegates struggled to identify what kind of target should be set. There was widespread agreement that biodiversity needed a single measurable headline goal – equivalent to the 1.5-2C (2.7-3.6F) in climate negotiations. But there is, as yet, no single metric that can cover the complex interaction of life on Earth. Instead, discussions centred on setting either zero net loss of natural habitat or a broad goal to “bend the curve”, which means reverse biodiversity loss worldwide through a series of bottom-up national commitments and wider demarcations of nature reserves, protected areas and traditional or indigenous community land. Pooven Moodley, the executive director of the NGO Natural Justice, said the conference had seen progress in terms of greater recognition of the need for improved environmental rights and more land tenure for indigenous groups. But he said overall the negotiations had failed to take into account the urgency of the crisis. “It does feel like rearranging the deckchairs as the Titanic sinks,” he said. Frustrations were also expressed by Ruth Davis, the deputy director of global programmes at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. “I am used to the UN – its ups and downs – but it’s still disorienting listening to hours of wrangling over single words in obscure documents in empty rooms when this is supposed – quite literally – to be about a plan to save life on Earth,” she tweeted. Despite occasional grumbles, delegates said the situation would be worse without the convention, which at least obliges governments to assess biodiversity and report every four years (with the exception of the US, which is the only nation that does not take part). Protected areas – the one concrete target from 2010 – have expanded substantially in the past eight years. Conservation efforts have also helped to pull a few species including whales and mountain gorillas back from the brink of extinction. Pasça Palmer, the UN head of biodiversity, said she too wanted more urgency, but she remained optimistic that a deal could be done in 2020. “The best possible outcome would be to have a clear recognition that biodiversity is infrastructure affecting life and development. We have to govern in a holistic way, not just one species. And we need to make it clear in people’s minds that without it, we won’t have a healthy planet.” China will have its work cut out. • This article was amended on 3 December 2018 because an earlier version converted absolute temperatures, rather than temperature increases.

"Australia’s carbon emissions have again continued to increase, according to official government figures released on Friday. The results show emissions are rising much faster than in recent years – the quarterly growth trend is the highest it has been since 2004. Australia’s emissions, seasonally adjusted, increased 1.3% over the past quarter. Excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (for which the calculations are controversial), they are at a record high. But per capita emissions have continued to decline, and are now at their lowest level in 28 years. The report puts the absolute increase down to a rise in fugitive emissions because of increased LNG production, as well as higher emissions from transport and other sectors. The new figures add evidence to claims by the United Nations, climate and energy analysts, and the opposition that Australia will fail to meet its Paris targets. On Wednesday, the UN released its annual emissions gap report, which looks at the gap between carbon reduction policies in each country and what is required to keep global warming well below 2C. The report found that Australia would fall short of meeting its nationally determined contributions (NDC) under the Paris agreement, saying: “There has been no improvement in Australia’s climate policy since 2017 and emission levels for 2030 are projected to be well above the NDC target. “The latest projection published by the government shows that emissions would remain at high levels rather than reducing in line with the 2030 target.” Australia’s environment minister, Melissa Price, said on Wednesday the government had “the right mix of scalable policies to meet our 2030 targets”. “Policies like the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation have led to emissions reductions in the electricity sector, for instance,” she said. “And they continue to deliver results. Wind and solar generation in the national electricity market is projected to increase by 250% over the next three years.” "

"A new study published in Nature has found evidence for 467 ways in which climate hazards due to global warming are making life on the planet harder for humans. It confirms that we are witnessing a shift in the functioning of the Earth system as a whole, a shift to a new state that is unsympathetic to the continued flourishing of human life. A changing climate is only one feature of a warming globe. Human activity has bounced the Earth into a state that has no equivalent in its 4.5 billion year history.  The Earth’s new trajectory as it spins into the future has led scientists to tell us we have entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. We have crossed a threshold and the geological clock cannot be turned back. The disruption we have caused is increasingly unpredictable and uncontrollable, and it has no endpoint. There are, therefore, two questions humankind must face. What must we do to prevent serial disasters becoming existential catastrophe? And how can we make our social and economic systems flexible enough to cope with the new dispensation? There are several reasons an international agreement has proven so hard. The leading one is sabotage by climate science deniers. Can it be countered? Climate science denial was invented and propagated mainly in the United States by the fossil fuel industry in the 1990s and early 2000s. Activists know how to thwart an industry lobbying campaign. But then something calamitous happened – rejecting climate science became caught up in the culture war. The Tea Party and Fox News were largely responsible for the shift. Before then, even a conservative like Sarah Palin accepted the science and called for action. But after 2009, rejecting climate science became a badge of political identity for conservatives. From that point onwards, facts no longer mattered. So the challenge is no longer how to use information to change people’s minds. The challenge is how to change a culture. No one knows how to do that. Last week Donald Trump, who calls climate science a hoax, visited a California devastated by wildfires. When asked whether his visit would change his mind about climate change he said “No”. What else could he say? The journalist was asking him if he would change who he was. Yet it’s too easy to blame the world’s slowness to act on crazy American deniers. Because, in a way, we are all climate science deniers. The full truth of what humans have done is almost impossible to take in. To fully embrace the message of the climate scientists means giving up the deepest presupposition of modernity – the idea of progress. Relinquishing our belief in progress means we must let go of the future, because we have been taught from infancy that the future is progress. In our minds, replacing the old future defined by progress with a new future defined by endless struggle requires a period of grieving. Not many people have the stomach for that. While most people in most countries accept the truth of climate science, they don’t accept its implications. What can be done to change that? When it comes to communicating the science’s message to the public, there is no magic potion to be found. A lot has been tried and some of it works reasonably well, up to a point. The scientists must keep doing their research and putting it out. Accusing them of alarmism is a calculated political slander; in truth, they have consistently been too cautious in their warnings, especially in IPCC reports. Yet the meaning of their reports has not sunk in. It’s clear that an Earth warmer by four degrees – and after the unwinding of the 2015 Paris agreement that is the path we have returned to – will impose enormous stresses on all societies. In poorer countries, it will lead to mass migrations, many deaths and violent conflict. The effects in wealthy countries will depend on who holds power and how they govern. Disasters, food shortages and waves of immigration will magnify resentment against the rich, who will be attempting to insulate themselves from the turmoil around them. But they too depend on the infrastructure of urban life – electricity and water supply, sewerage and waste disposal, transport systems for food and so on. And they can’t insulate themselves from social upheaval. Some communities will learn to adapt more effectively. Smaller, cooperative communities will be best placed to adapt themselves to endure the troubles. But however humans live or die on the new Earth we have made, we are approaching the endpoint of modernity and must accept that it is finally true that man is the environment of man. • Clive Hamilton is professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University in Canberra and author of Defiant Earth: The fate of humans in the Anthropocene"

"Donald Trump doesn’t believe his own government’s major report on climate change – which the administration tried to bury over the Thanksgiving break. It warns that rising temperatures are already harming America and will cause huge damage globally.  Climate change will exacerbate wildfires and droughts, causing particulate pollution from smoke and windblown dust and increasing smog that forms in higher temperatures. Worldwide, 5.5 billion people, or 75% of the population, live in places that don’t meet the World Health Organization standard for limiting particulate pollution, according to research by the University of Chicago. Air pollution shortens lives. In areas with the worst air, including in the Indian capital Delhi, people could live up to seven and a half years longer with less pollution. Aside from early deaths, air pollution also causes breathing and heart problems and worsens asthma. “In the last few years, we’ve seen enormous spikes in episodes where wildfires contribute to pollution,” said Janice Nolen, assistant vice-president of national policy for the American Lung Association. “It doesn’t have to be a continuous problem every day to be unhealthy. It can be that a spike happens for a few days of difficult breathing that shorten lives.” Rising temperatures and increased carbon dioxide levels will also make plant-based allergies worse by lengthening the pollen season and increasing the amount of pollen made by plants. Beyond air pollution, climate change is a threat to human health via extreme heat, reduced food and water quality, and population displacement. Depending on action taken to slow climate change, an additional 3,900 to 9,300 across 49 large cities in the US are predicted to die each year from extremely hot or cold days by the last two decades of this century, the report finds. Infectious agents will also spread wider with migrating mosquitoes and ticks. “Often people, when they’re affected by climate change, are affected by it in multiple ways,” Nolen said. “You’re affected by air quality, you’re affected by heat, you can be affected by a variety of things from allergens being increased, from mold from flooding, not to mention just stress.”"
"The global food system is broken, leaving billions of people either underfed or overweight and driving the planet towards climate catastrophe, according to 130 national academies of science and medicine across the world. Providing a healthy, affordable, and environmentally friendly diet for all people will require a radical transformation of the system, says the report by the InterAcademy Partnership (IAP). This will depend on better farming methods, wealthy nations consuming less meat and countries valuing food which is nutritious rather than cheap.  The report, which was peer reviewed and took three years to compile, sets out the scale of the problems as well as evidence-driven solutions.  The global food system is responsible for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than all emissions from transport, heating, lighting and air conditioning combined. The global warming this is causing is now damaging food production through extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. The food system also fails to properly nourish billions of people. More than 820 million people went hungry last year, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, while a third of all people did not get enough vitamins. At the same time, 600 million people were classed as obese and 2 billion overweight, with serious consequences for their health. On top of this, more than 1bn tonnes of food is wasted every year, a third of the total produced. “The global food system is broken,” said Tim Benton, professor of population ecology, at the University of Leeds, who is a member of one of the expert editorial groups which produced the report. He said the cost of the damage to human health and the environment was much greater than the profits made by the farming industry. “Whether you look at it from a human health, environmental or climate perspective, our food system is currently unsustainable and given the challenges that will come from a rising global population that is a really [serious] thing to say,” Benton said. Reducing meat and dairy consumption is the single biggest way individuals can lessen their impact on the planet, according to recent research. And tackling dangerous global warming is considered impossible without massive reductions in meat consumption.  Research published in the journal Climate Policy shows that at the present rate, cattle and other livestock will be responsible for half of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and that to prevent this will require “substantial reductions, far beyond what are planned or realistic, from other sectors”. “It is vital [for a liveable planet] that we change our relationship with meat, especially with red meat. But no expert in this area is saying the world should be vegan or even vegetarian,” said Benton. Rearing cattle and other livestock causes the same carbon emissions as all the world’s vehicles, trains, ships and planes combined. “We have spent 30 to 40 years investing quite heavily on fuel efficiency in the transport sector,” said Benton. “We need do something similarly radical in the farming sector and the scope for doing that by changing the way we raise the animals is much smaller than the scope we have by changing our diets.” The IAP report notes that in poorer countries meat, eggs and dairy can be important in providing concentrated nutrients, especially for children. It also says other things livestock can provide should be taken into consideration, such as leather, wool, manure, transport and plough pulling. The UN climate change conference, COP24, which starts on Sunday in Katowice, Poland, is an opportunity for political action, said Joachim von Braun, a professor who co-chairs the IAP project. “Our food systems are failing us. Agriculture and consumer choices are major factors driving disastrous climate change.” Another member of the IAP editorial group, Aifric O’Sullivan, from University College Dublin, said: “We need to ensure that policymakers inform consumers about the climate impacts of their food choices, provide incentives for consumers to change their diets, and reduce food loss and waste.” The report recommends many actions that could help deliver the “whole-scale root and branch transformation” that is required, said Benton. These include crops that are more resilient to climate change, smarter crop rotation, soil protection, precier use of fertilisers and less use of pesticides. It also backs innovation such as laboratory-grown meat and insect-based foods."

"Australia is not on track to meet its 2030 emissions reduction targets and global greenhouse gas emissions are showing no signs of peaking, a new UN report has warned. In its annual emissions gap report, which looks at the gap between carbon reduction policies countries have in place and what is required to keep global warming to well below 2C, the UN says global emissions have reached record highs. It warns that about half of the G20 countries, including Australia, will fall short of meeting their nationally determined contributions under the Paris agreement and, even if they do meet them, they are still not ambitious enough to restrict warming to the levels needed. “Current commitments expressed in the NDCs are inadequate to bridge the emissions gap in 2030,” the report warns. “Technically, it is still possible to bridge the gap to ensure global warming stays well below 2C and 1.5C, but if NDC ambitions are not increased before 2030, exceeding the 1.5C goal can no longer be avoided.” Australia has committed to an emissions reduction target of 26% to 28% on 2005 levels by 2030. The UN’s report says: “There has been no improvement in Australia’s climate policy since 2017 and emission levels for 2030 are projected to be well above the NDC target. “The latest projection published by the government shows that emissions would remain at high levels rather than reducing in line with the 2030 target.” The report finds that annual global emissions have reached a record high of 53.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide. On current policies, it says, annual global emissions would hit 59 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent by 2030. If countries met their unconditional 2030 targets they would hit 56 gigatonnes. To have a 66% chance of meeting the 2C Paris target, emissions would need to be down to about 40 gigatonnes a year by 2030 and to achieve the more ambitious target of 1.5C they would need to fall to about 24 gigatonnes. The UN warned that on current trajectories, the world was on track for about 3C of warming by 2100, with warming to continue after that. In a special report, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the world was nowhere near on track to reach the 1.5C Paris target and that even a half degree more of warming would significantly worsen the risks of droughts, floods and extreme heat for millions of people. The new emissions gap report says G20 countries including Australia “will need to implement additional policies” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 2.5 gigatonnes a year to achieve their unconditional commitments under the Paris agreement. Despite the reports findings, Australia’s environment minister, Melissa Price, said on Wednesday the government had “the right mix of scalable policies to meet our 2030 targets”. “Policies like the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation have led to emissions reductions in the electricity sector, for instance,” she said. “And they continue to deliver results. Wind and solar generation in the national electricity market is projected to increase by 250% over the next three years.” Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said the report showed the government had been “hopeless” in taking action on climate change. “It is a slap in the face for Australians that the prime minister, environment minister and energy minister all repeat the lie that Australia will meet our Paris climate targets in a ‘canter’,” he said. “The government’s own data, and now the UN, show that under Scott Morrison’s hopeless climate change policies, carbon pollution will continue to rise all the way to 2030 – which is as far as the projections go.”"
"Late-night hosts discussed the recent Paul Manafort revelations and Donald Trump’s refusal to believe in climate change. Paul Manafort double flips, Trump spouts some climate change jibberish, and Ivanka gets confronted about her use of private email. pic.twitter.com/eTqSLWaIre On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah joked that the Russia investigation “is like a sale at a used Honda dealership. It never ends.” He spoke about Manafort “double-flipping” after agreeing to comply with Robert Mueller and then reportedly reporting back to Trump with the details of what had been happening. “It’s like when your friend takes a test in the second period then at recess he tells you what to expect when you go in for the test, although I bet even with the answers, Trump could still mess it up,” Noah joked. After a White House report that warned of extreme effects of climate change, Trump has remained opposed to the findings. “Like the climate, his arguments are getting worse,” he joked. In a rambling answer Trump claimed that as someone with such high intelligence, he found the report hard to believe especially as water and air were at a record clean. “Clearly the president doesn’t believe in the science and the English,” Noah said. Ivanka Trump has also been under fire for using a personal account to send White House emails. In an interview with ABC she defended the usage, saying that she wasn’t sending important work emails. “I actually believe her when she says she wasn’t using her private account for important work emails because in order to have important work emails, you have to do important work,” he said. He continued: “Her inbox is probably just Goop newsletters and thousands of unopened emails from Eric.” On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert also spoke about Manafort. “He’s afraid to rat on the Russians because he has a lifelong dream of continuing to live,” he said. “He’s got this bucket list of not ending up in a series of buckets.” He also referenced the exclusive findings from the Guardian on Manafort’s meeting with Julian Assange. “If this is true then this means the world’s palest man met the world’s shadiest man,” he said. Colbert continued: “OK, that looks bad but only because it is very bad.”"
"Trevor Noah took aim at Donald Trump for his refusal to believe a report on climate change assembled by his own government. On The Daily Show, the host spoke about the report, which states that climate change has already been having an effect on the US and is set to worsen over the next few decades. He showed a news report which focused on the potential loss of life but also underlined the economic effects. You know it’s a bad sign when the president has less respect for science than Maury Povich. pic.twitter.com/hdosTZ0Rno “I love how America always thinks about everything in economic terms,” he said. “Like even when they’re talking about the end of the world they’re like: ‘Climate change is going to kill everybody and that’s gonna cost us like a billion dollars.’” When asked about the report, Trump said it was “fine” but he didn’t believe it. “How can one man possess all the stupidity of mankind?” Noah asked. “It’s like they edited his genes to give him superhuman stupidity.” CNN brought on Rick Santorum to talk about the report and he claimed that the reason scientists continue to discuss the dangers of climate change is because they’re after money and need to sustain their lifestyles. “We should have known when we saw them balling in those Gucci lab coats,” Noah joked. He also showed clips from a panel on NBC in which one of the talking heads admitted that she wasn’t a scientist so she didn’t really know what she was talking about. “Once you say ‘I’m not a scientist’ then why is anyone listening to your scientific opinion?” he asked. Noah criticised the networks for bringing on climate change deniers and warned of the dangers. “Why does the news keep bringing on non-scientists to argue against science?” he said. TONIGHT: Are you looking to not have fun, then suffocate to death? Come join Elon Musk on Mars! pic.twitter.com/9HiAVtLktK There was also news that Nasa successfully landed a spacecraft on Mars as well as talk from Elon Musk that he was hoping to travel to the planet but warned that for any prospective colonists there were many dangers, including death. “Are you looking to not have fun and then suffocate to death? Come to Mars!” Noah joked. He continued: “It’s nice that Elon Musk is so upfront about the details. But you gotta admit, it would have been kinda funny if Elon Musk waited until they landed on Mars to be like: ‘Oh I forgot to mention, you are my space slaves now get to work building my base!’”"

"For any tourist visiting Seattle, there’s the standard bucket list: ride the monorail, ascend the Space Needle, pay a visit to the world’s largest building, and, if you’re not squeamish about tax avoidance, check out the first-ever Starbucks and the Amazon Spheres. But, as I discovered on a recent visit, there’s a new attraction in town: the cannabis shops peppered through its downtown since Washington state legalised recreational marijuana.  They couldn’t be further from the smoke-filled coffeeshops of Amsterdam: this is very much America does weed. Show your passport at the door and you’re waved into a cheery space filled with brightly lit glass cabinets displaying their wares. Yes, there’s row after row of the little packets of greenish stuff you’d expect, with enticing names such as “Pink Lemonade” and “Chocolope”. But lots of other cannabis-infused goodies too: vape pens, pre-rolled joints and “edibles”, from brownies to jelly sweets to drinks. Budtenders are on hand to “talk flower” with discerning pot veterans, and chat with canna-curious tourists about the basics, such as the difference between the psychoactive THC, which produces a “mind high”, and the non-psychoactive CBD, which results in a healing “body high”. (Me: “But what’s the difference between a mind and a body high?” Patient budtender: “One makes your mind feel high, the other your body.”) It was fascinating talking to Washingtonians about what they’ve got right and wrong in regulating an industry from scratch. And as I tucked into my first vegan mockburger on the plane home – nicely pink inside, my tastebuds honestly couldn’t distinguish it from the real thing – it left me thinking, why are we so willing to wield the nanny state when it comes to cannabis but not something like meat, which does real social harm? If the goal of cannabis prohibition was to reduce social harm, it’s been an unalloyed failure. As even President Obama admitted, it’s safer than alcohol: it’s much less addictive than smoking or drinking. And while overdosing can be a deeply unpleasant, frightening experience, as the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd found when she consumed a whole chocolate bar that would have been better cut into 16, a fatal overdose is impossible. (There has been a handful of cases in the US where people have attributed extreme violence to ingesting cannabis, but the link between cannabis-induced psychosis and violence remains unproved – and, unlike alcohol, studies suggest smoking cannabis may be associated with lower levels of domestic violence). Where there are established risks – heavy cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of psychotic disorders – they should be set out so that, as with alcohol, people can make their own decision about whether they’re worth taking. Banning cannabis doesn’t stop people using – the industry in the US is thought to be worth $40bn a year, much of it black market, and in the UK, 2.2 million people are estimated to have taken cannabis. But a failure to legalise and regulate it makes it less safe than it need be – users have no idea of the psychoactive strength of what they’re buying on the black market, in stark contrast to the Seattle shops, which list the THC levels of every product. Prohibition also results in millions in lost tax revenue: California, the largest state to legalise recreational cannabis, collected more than $60m in cannabis taxes in the first quarter of 2018. Prohibition has had hugely unjust consequences. It disproportionately snares people of colour into the criminal justice system: in the UK, black people are around half as likely to report using drugs last year, but nine times more likely to be stopped and searched for drug possession and almost 12 times more likely to be convicted for cannabis possession. This should inform the way cannabis is legalised. In some places in the US, legalisation has been accompanied by expunging of historic marijuana misdemeanours, which can make it difficult to get a job or housing, from criminal records. Oakland in California has even reserved a proportion of its cannabis permits for those with a cannabis conviction in an attempt to combat the capture of the burgeoning weed industry by white, cash-rich businessmen. (Because cannabis remains federally illegal, it’s almost impossible for cannabis producers to secure bank loans.) But the reason we have prohibition is nothing to do with preventing social harm. It’s about the queasiness politicians feel about legalising something that they perceive still has a huge social stigma attached, even though the public is now firmly in favour of legalisation. Which brings me to the vegan burger. Take a step back and it seems bonkers that our political leaders hold firm on outlawing weed but seem loth to invoke the nanny state where it’s most needed: in avoiding catastrophic climate change. We won’t succeed in this unless we persuade people to fly less and eat less meat and dairy. That’s a gargantuan task, made harder by the demotivating knowledge that your own efforts are only likely to matter if others match them. Yet the most politicians do is half-heartedly conjure up a few green taxes in the hope they’ll nudge people in the sort of right direction. But they’re not effective enough, and also hit the poorest most. Time for the nanny state to get more radical. We should start by banning altogether things that have literally no function, such as bottled water in a country where it’s actually safer to drink tap water. And take a leaf out of wartime Britain – climate change is no less existential a threat – and ration activities such as flying and eating meat. If you’re not that bothered about a rare steak, you can sell your coupons to someone who can’t live without a good ribeye and feel smug as you tuck into your environmentally friendly, fake-meat alternatives. It’s perhaps not surprising that prohibition is based on social prissiness rather than rationality. But, my goodness, we’re missing a trick. We should follow Canada, which just became the second country to legalise recreational cannabis. And go after – if not banning, then rationing – the stuff that does society real, undeniable harm. • Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist"
"When the semi-state company that harvests Ireland’s peatlands recently announced the closure of 17 bogs, the news was greeted as the end of an era. Turning the soggy landscape that covers much of Ireland’s midlands into a fuel source had been a great national project, an ambitious undertaking launched by the republic’s founding fathers in the 1930s. Draining and cutting hundreds of thousands of hectares of turf on an industrial scale generated desperately needed jobs and reduced dependence on oil imports for almost a century. So there was some nostalgia last month when Bord na Móna, the peat-harvesting company, announced it was closing 17 of its “active bogs” and would close the remaining 45 within seven years. Nostalgia but also acceptance, given the growing awareness that harvesting peat emits greenhouse gases that worsen climate change, requiring a shift to renewable energy. “Decarbonisation is the biggest challenge facing this planet,” said Tom Donnellan, the company’s chief executive.  The announcement followed promises by the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, to make Ireland a global leader in protecting the planet, backed by a €22bn (£19.5bn) government plan for climate action. A progressive force on social issues, Ireland would also become a beacon for the environment. The problem, according to environmentalists and academics, is that it is all hot air. Renouncing bog harvesting, they say, is too little, too late – a false solace because the ravaged peatlands will continue to emit greenhouse gases. And the government’s climate leadership pledge, they say, does not cancel out a dismal environmental record that has left Ireland potentially facing up to €600m in fines for missing emissions targets. John Sweeney, a climate expert and geography professor at Maynooth University, said: “Climate change requires long-term thinking but the political cycle is much shorter and that of economically vested interest groups is shorter still.” Peatlands, formed by the accumulation of decayed vegetation, help regulate the climate by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing carbon within the peat. As fuel, it is more damaging than coal, generating less energy when burned while producing higher carbon emissions. Depending on how it is calculated, the peat industry contributes between 3m and 6m of the 62m tonnes of greenhouse gases that Ireland emits each year. Bord na Móna appears to be morphing from climate villain to climate champion. Its annual peat harvest is forecast to tumble: from 3m tonnes in 2015 to an estimated 2m in 2020 and less than 1m by 2025. Its power plant in Edenderry, County Offaly, still burns peat, but relies increasingly on biomass. During the 2017-18 financial year renewable energy, including wind and solar, accounted for more than 60% of the company’s power generation. Pat Sammon, a spokesman at the company’s headquarters in Newbridge, County Kildare, on the edge of the 370 sq miles of the Bog of Allen, said: “We’re heading to a new era because the main business of the company had been extracting peat and that’s falling away now.” But environmental experts are unimpressed. “It’s a bit of a smokescreen. It’s all revenue-driven,” said Florence Renou-Wilson, a research scientist and peatland expert at University College Dublin. Bord na Móna was closing bogs that were exhausted and no longer profitable, she said. “They’re all done and dusted.” The company was seeking new markets for peat in horticulture, she said, and, worse, it seldom “re-wet” used bogs, so the ravaged land continued to emit greenhouse gases. “They’ve just been leaving them abandoned.” Harvested peatlands – Bord na Móna’s as well as those developed by private operators – produce about 2.6m tonnes of “fugitive” emissions a year. Rehabilitation could make many of the bogs carbon neutral or even carbon sinks. Catherine O’Connell, the head of the Irish Peatland Conservation Council, said Bord na Móna’s decarbonisation talk was spin. “It’s genius what they’ve done. They’ve come out of this looking green. But they’re miners – they remove the living surface of the bog and dig down. Death by a thousand cuts.” As an environmental policy goal, ending the cutting and burning of peat should have been “low-hanging fruit”, said Tony Lowes, the director of the group Friends of the Irish Environment. “But we have struggled to truly bring it under control because of its emotional attachment and cultural heritage.” Environmentalists say this fits a pattern of state authorities ducking climate commitments. Ireland emits 13 tonnes of greenhouse gases per person a year, the third-highest level in the EU. The UK emits eight tonnes per person. Under EU commitments, by 2020 Ireland is supposed to cut emissions by 20% from 1990 levels. The target for 2030 is 40%. Ireland is on track to exceed the first target by 16m tonnes and the latter by 50m tonnes, triggering fines estimated to range from €230m to €600m. Last month, David Boyd, a UN special rapporteur on human rights, said Dublin’s failure to tackle climate change breached human rights. He made the comments in a legal submission to support a court case brought by Friends of the Irish Environment, accusing the government of “knowingly contributing to dangerous levels of climate change”. Earlier this year, Varadkar raised expectations of a rise in carbon tax, widely seen as a basic, vital step to curbing emissions. But last month’s budget left it unchanged at €20 a tonne. Critics said the government flunked climate commitments for fear of a voter backlash, a pattern set when it backed a dramatic surge in dairy and beef farming, pleasing rural voters and business interests but derailing emission goals. Richard Bruton, the minister for climate action and environment, acknowledged last week that Ireland was “far off course” and announced a plan to make every department responsive to climate change. • This article was amended on 27 November 2018 because an earlier version mistakenly said the power plant in Edenderry no longer burns peat.

"Global temperatures have continued to rise in the past 10 months, with 2018 expected to be the fourth warmest year on record. Average temperatures around the world so far this year were nearly 1C (1.8F) above pre-industrial levels. Extreme weather has affected all continents, while the melting of sea ice and glaciers and rises in sea levels continue. The past four years have been the hottest on record, and the 20 warmest have occurred in the past 22 years.  The warming trend is unmistakeable and shows we are running out of time to tackle climate change, according to the World Meteorological Organization, which on Thursday published its provisional statement on the State of the Climate in 2018. The WMO warned that, on current trends, warming could reach 3C to 5C by the end of this century. “These are more than just numbers,” said Elena Manaenkova, the WMO deputy secretary general. “Every fraction of a degree of warming makes a difference to human health and access to food and fresh water, to the extinction of animals and plants, to the survival of coral reefs and marine life.” The world has committed to keeping warming to no more than 2C above such levels, with an aspiration to limit rises to 1.5C, which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said will cause the dieback of coral reefs, sea-level rises and extreme weather in many regions. Greenhouse gas levels were also recently found to be at record levels, and a UN report this week said the world must triple its emissions reduction efforts to stay within 2C – and to stay within 1.5C, those efforts needed to be five times greater. The IPCC found that continued rises in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 12 years could result in a breaching of the 1.5C limit. On Monday, the Met Office said summer temperatures in the UK could be 5C hotter by 2070, making this year’s heatwave the norm for the future, while winters could get much wetter. London could become increasingly vulnerable to storms and flooding owing to sea-level rises, with the water level in the capital likely to rise by 1.15 metres by the end of the century. The WMO found the extent of Arctic sea ice in 2018 was much lower than normal, with the maximum in March the third lowest on record and the September minimum the sixth lowest. The oceans have been absorbing record or near-record amounts of heat at certain periods. The year started with a weak La Niña event but by October there were signs of a return to El Niño conditions, which can raise global temperatures further. There were a greater number of violent storms than usual, including 70 tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere, compared with the long-term average of 53. Storms brought devastation to the Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Vietnam, the Korean peninsula and Tonga, while hurricanes Florence and Michael caused substantial damage in the US. Wildfires raged in Greece, Canada, California and other areas, while floods devastated Kerala in India and displaced more than 1.4 million people. Japan also experienced serious flooding, as did east Africa. Petteri Taalas, the secretary general of the WMO, a leading authority on climate change, said: “We are not on track to meet climate targets and rein in temperature increases. If we exploit all known fossil fuel resources, the temperature rise will be considerably higher. “We are the first generation to fully understand climate change and the last generation to be able to do something about it.” Manaenkova added that every effort to reduce greenhouse gases and the impacts of climate change was worthwhile. “Every bit matters,” she said, citing the harm done by temperature rises to every aspect of life, including economic productivity, food security, glacier melt and water supplies, and the future of low-lying islands and coastal communities. Jens Mattias Clausen, Greenpeace’s head of delegation at the UN climate change conference (COP24) in Poland, said: “The evidence, if we needed any more, continues to stack up. The record-high heatwaves, record-low Arctic sea ice, above average tropical cyclones and deadly wildfires are an alarm bell impossible to ignore. We’re in the midst of a climate crisis and this meteorological report spells out the worsening threat in startling clarity. It’s no longer our future that is in peril; our today is at risk. “The recent IPCC report also showed that we still have hope. We have 12 years to move the needle and any leader who comes to COP24 unprepared to step up and take action needs to read the WMO report and understand it’s time to stop talking and start acting on climate – while we still have the chance.”"
"Time is up. The Liberal party won’t reform, so it is time to stop fighting, split and take the opportunity to compete for the support of the public. The Liberal party is now broken, brand-damaged and unable to attract new members that would enable it to represent a “broad church”. The failure of the existing Liberal party to address climate change or to support an integrity commission is unacceptable.  Nowhere is this failure more obvious than in its continued support for the Adani coalmine and new coal-fired power stations. I expected more from Scott Morrison after the Victorian walloping. Instead we get the very same. Slippery answers to everything. Coal, coal, coal and soaring greenhouse gas emissions. Refusing to reduce emissions as cheaply as possible is irrational, immoral and economically reckless. Achieving emission reductions of just 2% a year as proposed by the Labor party in the electricity sector costs very little and won’t risk system stability or security. We should be aiming for a 2% reduction in emissions every year to ensure Australia does its fair share to tackle climate change. Instead, emissions are increasing and are at a seven year high. Something must lie behind the failure of the Liberal party to accept policies that are economically rational and environmentally sound, so some sunlight from an integrity commission should be welcomed by all Australians.Wherever you look, something is wrong. The pursuit by ministers of baseload coal power when we need dispatchable renewable energy and storage. Claims by ministers that we need more fossil fuels and that they are cheaper than renewables or that clean coal is the answer. Claims by ministers that as Australia only emits 1.3% of global pollution we have no role to play, ignoring the fact that we are only 0.3% of the population and that we will be heavily damaged by the impacts of climate change. And the final insult – allowing the Adani coalmine to proceed when it lacks a social licence, is completely inconsistent with the need to tackle climate change and frankly smells with donations, overseas trips and wedding parties. We desperately need an integrity commission to investigate potential conflicts of interest that see a revolving door between the coal industry and minister’s offices. It is hard to believe donors don’t have influence on the selection of ministers to some degree. Members of parliament that are selected to be ministers stand to receive additional pay of more than $150,000, boosting their remuneration towards $500,000. It seems obvious that such ministers would be more likely to promote the views of the large donors that influenced their appointment in the first place. We need a parliament that accepts science. We need a parliament that respects our geography and rationally accepts that our neighbours and their views have special relevance and their concerns deserve special attention, just as my neighbours on my street deserve my special consideration. We need a root and branch review of the political remuneration system that ensures that it provides the right incentives for all politicians to work for the benefit of our country rather than fight against each other to secure the “spoils of government”. As a Liberal, I have had enough and, as evidenced by the swing in safe Liberal seats in Victoria, I am not alone. We must provide alternatives for Liberals to vote for at the next federal election, and I hope to see independent Liberals provide electors in safe Liberal seats with that choice. We need to return to the day where politicians know that their job is not to retain their job but rather to represent their electorate, who, if they are lucky, reward them with their job. The Liberal party brand has been so damaged and trust so completely destroyed that no amount of “shuffling the deck chairs” will change the outcome of the next federal election. It is simply impossible for many Liberal voters to vote for a party that: works to prevent any action on climate change has the potential to be controlled by the mining industry or whichever new industry is willing to pay for favours (clubs, internet gambling, pokies, firearms and many more) rejects the establishment of an integrity commission rejects donation reform and transparency and promotes members for their fundraising skills rather than policy and communication skills backs the Adani coalmine, which has no social licence and is inconsistent with our need to tackle climate change; and regardless of the election result seems to be heading towards installing Tony Abbott or Peter Dutton as the next party leader Liberal voters will align with independent Liberals who have real world experience, who will put the interests of their electorates first and who support:  tight fiscal responsibility so the country operates within its means strong border controls, backed by a compassionate approach to the treatment of refugees free enterprise and small business, balanced with appropriate regulation to ensure competition is fair transparency, integrity and trust; and real action on climate change that is consistent with what the science is demanding While I am sure many “shock jocks” who are doing daily damage to the Liberal party will yet again venture to their usual corner of scare tactics about the arrival of independent Liberals, there is no justification for that. Independent Liberals will move with transparency and integrity, and will clearly state their principals and beliefs so electors know what they are voting for. Just imagine how refreshing that would be in the current world of dark party politics where trading principles for position and power is considered a positive skill. Once the Liberal party reforms and rebalances, Liberal independents might elect to join again. • Oliver Yates is a member of the Liberal party and former chief executive of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation"
"In a hallway beneath the UN climate change headquarters in Bonn, Germany, Sue Biniaz leans on a table, scribbling some thoughts on a piece of paper. It’s May 2018, three years after representatives from nearly 200 countries convened in France in an extraordinary display of international unity and agreed to keep global warming below 2C and to pursue a tougher target of 1.5C.  How the Paris climate agreement will achieve that remains an open question. The rules to govern the deal are due to be agreed at the next United Nations climate change conference in the coal-mining town of Katowice in south-west Poland in December. With the clock ticking, diplomats have gathered in the former West German capital for mid-year talks. Things are not going well. Negotiators rush in and out of adjoining rooms. In years gone by, Biniaz would have been at the centre of these meetings. From 1989 to early 2017, she was a deputy legal adviser at the US state department and its leading climate lawyer. She personally drafted key passages of the 2015 Paris accord. In global warming diplomacy, few are more respected. She still attends UN climate meetings, but only as an observer, with limited access to the behind-doors wrangling. So in Bonn she stands in a visible spot and the meetings come to her. “Hi Sue!” calls out Chinese negotiator Xiang Gao, who is standing alongside Andrew Rakestraw, a Trump state department official and Biniaz’s former colleague. Beside these sharp-suited hotshots, Biniaz is an elder: rimless oval spectacles, grey hair loosely pulled back. They fill her in, cracking jokes and sounding hopeful about the stream of talks they are co-chairing. Biniaz writes something down. Biniaz left the department in 2017 and took up teaching in the law schools of Columbia and Yale as well as a fellowship with the UN Foundation, a Washington DC philanthropic institution. She did so partly because she thought nothing as professionally enthralling as the Paris agreement could ever happen to her again. She also predicted, correctly, that the new president, Donald Trump, would renege on the deal. “I just did not want to be part of an administration that was going to take the position that this was a terrible agreement, because I don’t agree with that,” says Biniaz. At the UN Foundation she shares an office with two former colleagues from the Obama state department climate team: Julie Cerqueira and Jen Austin. Between them, Biniaz, Cerqueira and Austin cover the three arms of climate politics outside federal policy: international talks, local and state government, and the business sector. Austin is policy director for the We Mean Business coalition. Cerqueira leads the US Climate Alliance, an umbrella office for “subnational” governments who want to coordinate efforts to combat climate change. Turnover between administrations is a great Washington tradition, as party devotees slip into the private sector, thinktanks or lobbying firms. But the exodus from the state department climate team has been different, says Biniaz. “The number of people who have left has been kind of extraordinary and it’s definitely been not just because the administration changed, but it changed into an administration that was very hostile to both the Paris agreement and climate change action more generally,” she says. Cerqueira says: “A lot of civil servants gave up their nice state department or [Environmental Protection Agency] job or whatever because they are so committed to addressing climate change as fast as possible.” She loved her state job and regrets deeply the change in policy that drove her out. “You stay in the federal government as long as you feel like you can make a difference and as long as you feel like you can act in good faith and uphold your oath to the constitution,” she says, “and at some point you realise that you can’t do that any more.” As a result, the most effective diplomatic and legal outfit ever assembled in global climate politics is now spread through the thinktanks and environmental organisations of Washington DC. “Some people have been calling it climate diaspora,” says Biniaz. “It’s not an organised group. But to varying degrees we keep in touch because our work is related. Well, we keep in touch socially too of course, just because we are friends.” The 2015 Paris accord drew up the global system to bring down greenhouse gas emissions in only the broadest strokes. At just 27 pages long, it represents what could be agreed at the time. But interpreting the agreement into a concrete set of rules is proving an immensely complicated task. For example, the Paris deal asks all countries to submit their plans to fight climate change. But much is left open as to what those plans should cover, or how often they should be updated, using which metrics and baselines, and how much leeway should be given to poor countries with bad data. These questions can all be split into increasingly finer details, with such eventual complexity that in many negotiating parties, the lead diplomat has only a rudimentary understanding of what their staff are working on. Consensus is proving difficult to find. If it is ever agreed, the “Paris rulebook” will iron out these technical, in some cases toxic, details. Without it, the deal will collapse. It is over these troubled waters that Biniaz keeps watch in Bonn. Using intelligence harvested from old contacts, she keeps track of which parts of the talks are in most trouble. When they become stuck, Biniaz arranges small, informal gatherings of key negotiators to try to unblock them. One evening Biniaz held an after-dinner session. “People are in a better mood when they are fed,” she says. Diplomats sat behind nameplates bearing their own names, instead of the name of their country. These meetings are private and completely off the record. Biniaz believes the relaxed setting can help adversaries “inch toward a point of view”. Biniaz has hosted at least five such meetings, held with the assistance of the Paris-based Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), on the margins of the busy 2018 negotiating calendar. These have usually focused on the area of the talks Rakestraw and Xiang oversee, which covers what information countries must provide as they report their efforts to cut carbon pollution. The role is neutral, but there is one ironclad principle under which she operates: the deal cut in Paris is not up for negotiation. There is an undercurrent at the talks that is disturbing the former US diplomat, who says there are serious attempts afoot to write rules Biniaz thinks “ignore the language” agreed in 2015. Based on legal language Biniaz helped to draft, Barack Obama and Xi Jinping agreed to universal rules that gave flexibility for the poorest countries. That compromise is credited with making Paris possible. It was good for small, vulnerable nations that feared China’s gigantic future emissions. But for emerging, coal-dependent economies it was hard to swallow. Hence their efforts now to reverse the deal and the possibility that a dual deal could be reached in Poland under which China is subject to different rules than the US. A group of developing countries, spurred by US betrayal and most likely coaxed on by China, are now trying to create one set of rules for the rich and one for the poor. This approach would govern China’s massive emissions more loosely, which would be unacceptable to the US and EU. If talks fail to produce a rulebook in Katowice over the coming weeks, it will be over this. It does not help that US diplomatic influence over climate change has collapsed under Trump. Just three years ago the Obama state department, with Biniaz as its lieutenant, ran the show. The Trump administration diplomats who still turn up to negotiate are tolerated, but their power has evaporated. As an Obama diplomat, Cerqueira built alliances between countries with similar interests. In her new job, the international experience has come in handy. As cooperation and dialogue on climate change with the US federal government has dried up, other – usually European – nations have sought diplomatic connections with governors and mayors across the US. Cerqueira is often their first call. When the UK and Canadian governments began gathering names for a global pact to end coal power, she says, “they wanted to coordinate on the recruitment of states into the alliance and so we are like a natural fit”. So far, seven US states and two cities have signed up. A short ride across town from the UN Foundation is the Brookings Institution, where Todd Stern has taken up a fellowship. If Biniaz was the driving intellectual force behind US efforts in Paris, Stern, as Obama’s special envoy for climate change, was its voice and face. His relationship with China’s lead negotiator and government minister Xie Zhenhua was a crucial factor when talks hit the skids in the final hours. The final draft contained a single word – some claimed it was a typo – the US found unacceptable. As the talks threatened to unravel, Xie stepped in, backed the change the US demanded and the gavel came down. Unlike many of his staff, Stern had no intention of staying on after the Paris deal was struck. He had had enough of the constant travel, the time away from his three children. He began packing up his offices and in May 2016, after striking a final bargain with his old friend Xie for the US and China to ratify the agreement together, he departed. Like Biniaz, he had agreed to teach a course at Yale. He was thinking about writing a book: the story behind the global accord. He was not thinking much about the ongoing negotiation of the Paris rulebook; certainly he didn’t imagine getting involved. Then Trump won.  “I really had been assuming that Clinton was going to win,” he says. Initially, Stern thought “wiser voices in the room” would convince Trump to remain in the Paris agreement. “Obviously that changed over time.” But he knew immediately that “it wasn’t good and we weren’t going to see anything like a bona fide climate change effort internationally or domestically”. In September 2017, a few months after Trump had announced his intention to leave the Paris deal, Stern travelled to New York to talk to old contacts as they gathered for the UN general assembly. He wanted to find out what other countries were thinking. How would the negotiations on the Paris rulebook, so critical to its function, be conducted with US leadership stripped away? Word of the binary system being pushed by China and its allies was circulating. This was something Stern and Biniaz believed they had buried in Paris. If US climate diplomacy has had a defining theme over years and across presidencies, it is that its great rival China must be bound by the same conditions. If December’s talks deliver a dual rulebook, it could stop the US rejoining the deal under a different president, says Biniaz. Neither Stern nor Biniaz denies that making sure this doesn’t happen is guiding their involvement. Six current and former non-US diplomats interviewed for this story said they thought this was at least partly their goal. Certainly, Stern heard enough in New York to continue turning up. Over the past two years he has dropped in to most major meetings. He lunches and listens and tactfully gives his views. His book has made little progress. His travels have included a visit to Beijing in May this year, where Xie hosted him at Tsinghua University. The two spent a lot of time together, says Stern, talking about the state of the negotiations. “My lodestar is: what is the way in which we stay faithful to the Paris agreement?” he says. “Not what does the US want or not, because I can’t speak for the US, and it won’t come as a surprise to you that people aren’t all that interested about what the US likes or doesn’t right now.” A senior diplomat from a developing country told the Guardian, speaking under condition of anonymity: “Some would say Todd and Sue are trying to keep the whole thing from crumbling. Others would say they are trying to keep some soft power for the US. Others could say they want to still feel relevant, or make sure that their vision of what the Paris agreement should be prevails.” The US vision of the Paris deal is, broadly, what Obama’s state department got from Paris. They wanted voluntary targets, rather than ones that were in line with their historical responsibility for creating climate change. Once set, countries’ pledges could not be legally binding, or the US Senate would reject them. The world accepted the rule of the Senate. These priorities arguably weakened the power of the deal to cut emissions. Certainly the current paucity of these voluntary efforts (which are supposed to increase over time, at a pace determined by each government) means the world remains on a path to warming well beyond 2C.  Meanwhile, Trump has argued that Paris “demeaned” the US; that Obama was stitched up; that China will go on building coal plants (it will) while the US cannot (it can, but doesn’t need them). Despite Trump’s radical reversals of domestic climate policies and threat to withdraw from the deal, his state department still turns up to the negotiations. The US cannot formally leave the Paris agreement until 2020, coincidentally on the day after the next US election.  The state department continues to advocate the same positions it has for years: common rules, non-binding, voluntary targets. A US department spokesperson said its priority was “to ensure a level playing field” – code for tying China to the same rules as all others. Of course, by flagging his intention to leave, Trump has significantly weakened his diplomats’ chances of protecting these goals. Because of this, Obama’s most senior climate advisers, who devised great chunks of the Paris accord, are now working in the shadows to defend a vision of the deal that is broadly in line with the efforts of the defanged Trump state department.  “It’s stupid to think that we would regard them [Stern and Biniaz] as the progressives,” says a former negotiator for a small island nation, noting that in Paris the US had been forceful in cutting off the most vulnerable countries on Earth from any form of reparation for damage they will incur from climate change.  When countries meet in Katowice this month, Biniaz and Stern will be there. In the final days of the two-week marathon, negotiators will hit a wall. Issues they cannot agree on will be handed to ministers. At that point Chinese and US intransigence could hamper the Paris agreement. “Who will China’s climate chief Xie turn to in that moment?” asks Greenpeace adviser Li Shuo. Stern’s old job at the state department no longer exists. The US delegation will not have anyone at Xie’s ministerial level who knows the deal like Stern.  For the most vulnerable nations on Earth, Trump’s election has had a little recognised, but insidious impact. In climate terms, it has shifted the emphasis away from improving the Paris agreement to defending it. Stern and Biniaz may well help rescue the deal, but will they want to make it more just?

"Governments often try to win elections by fighting the last one again. And to an extent you can understand it – after all, they did win it. But this week the prime minister adopted a rather more bizarre strategy of trying to win the next election by fighting the 2007 election over again. It is about as likely to result in victory for Scott Morrison as it did the first time round for John Howard. In Monday’s question time, the Morrison was at his shouty worst. Coming off the Victorian state election drubbing, the government MPs were hardly in a jocular mood and yet, oddly, Morrison decided to attack the opposition by invoking one of the more infamous jocular moments in Australian politics.  After railing at the ALP benchers for being “very cocky” he suggested that there was a warning ahead for voters, and it came in the form of Peter Garrett. Yes, a man who left parliament five years ago. The prime minister cast his mind back to 2007. The ALP were leading in the polls and Garrett had a conversation with Steve Price in Melbourne airport, in which in response to Price’s suggestion that it was “turning into the ‘me too’ election campaign”, Garrett replied, “Oh, don’t worry about that. Once we get in we will change all that.” Garrett later told the media that he was not serious and that it was just “a casual conversation, jocular in manner.” On Monday Morrison took us back to that time, telling parliament “I’ll never forget what Peter Garrett said back before the 2007 election. We all remember it. While they were all trying to pretend there wouldn’t be anything dramatic, that they would just be John Howard-lite if Kevin Rudd were elected, Peter Garrett let the cat out of the bag when he said, ‘We’ll change it all.’ That’s what the leader of the opposition’s plan is. That’s what the Labor party’s plan is. They want to change it all”. Such history lessons are always quite fun, if only to recall that “me too” now has a very different meaning from the one ascribed to the Rudd strategy of being Howard-lite. Yet, ironically, “me too” remains part of this election campaign – except now in its current meaning. The greater empowerment women feel, and their utter lack of patience with being told by those in power that changes take time, has meant the position of parties on gender issues is now a strong player in how people vote. And the Liberal party knows it – Kelly O’Dwyer was reported to have told colleagues this week that voters saw the party as “homophobic, anti-women, climate-change deniers”. Gee, I wonder why? This week in the Senate, the LNPs Barry O’Sullivan said of Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young that she had “a bit of Nick Xenophon in her” and his fellow senator Ian MacDonald responded to Greens senator Larissa Waters wearing a pair of earrings that said “Stop Adani” by asking the Senate if he could wear his “coal hi-vis jacket”. And then of course there was the minister for resources, Matthew Canavan, who responded to the news that the Adani coalmine would begin construction (albeit on a much smaller scale than previously proposed) by tweeting reference to the bushfires in central Queensland caused by extreme heat conditions and referring to Adani as a “little Aussie battler”. The problem with Morrison’s reference to the 2007 campaign is that there are a number of things the same, but also much that is different, and none helps the government. Back then the Liberal party sought to engage in fear and also hoped that budget surpluses would be enough to have people overlook other economic concerns such as industrial relations. It didn’t work. Now we again see the Liberal party clinging to the budget surplus as the ultimate aim of any government. The prime minister this week announced the date of next year’s budget and that it would be in surplus. He and the party hopes this will be enough to counter any concerns about flat real wages growth over the past four years. Thus far the polls suggest it is not working. The big difference is that in 2007 the presumed fear was that the ALP would get in and change everything; now the real fear is that it won’t. Morrison suggesting that if the Labor gets in it’ll change everything is actually a free ad for the ALP. The worry is that Labor’s big talk of change will become, once in government, a repetition of the same. For example, Labor’s energy policy is basically a resurrection of the Liberal party’s national energy guarantee – albeit with much greater emissions reduction targets. As Katharine Murphy has rightly noted, so damaged has climate change policy become in this country that the reformed Neg is probably a smart ploy. But all the same, it is hardly the bold policy that is needed. On Friday the latest greenhouse gas emissions targets were released. And, once again, total emissions (excluding land use, land use change and forestry) rose, the annual level of greenhouse gas emissions jumping 0.6% - the biggest quarterly jump in over 13 years. 2007 was also an election that featured climate change – indeed, it was an issue that severely wounded the government, as under Howard the Liberal party was lost in a haze of denialism and wilfully ignorant intransigence. Once again climate change politics is back in a big way. The extreme temperatures and early start to the bushfire season have placed the LNP’s policy shambles on the issue in the spotlight. The demonstrations by school students this week is the work of a generation holding their elders in rightful contempt. Their voting parents may not have also taken to the streets, but the Victorian election showed they have had enough of the LNP’s inability to even come up with a plausible energy policy that deals with climate change. The 2007 election was one where the economy was growing well and the budget was in surplus, and yet the government was caught out on issues of workplace relations and climate change and was seen to be out of touch with the way the times were headed. It is not an election that members of this government should wish to recall. And if Morrison believes the best tactic is to make people afraid the ALP will change it all once they get in, then he might as well give Bill Shorten the keys to the Lodge right now. Not only do voters not want Shorten to be Morrison-lite; the problem for the government is they don’t particularly want Morrison and what his party stands for either. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"
"The Trump administration published a major report on climate change the day after Thanksgiving. We will explore the key findings each day this week. Donald Trump doesn’t believe his own government’s major report on climate change – which the administration tried to bury over the Thanksgiving break. It warns that rising temperatures are already harming America and will cause huge damage globally. The Guardian will explore key findings from the report each day this week.  Climate efforts aren’t all or nothing Limiting greenhouse gases would substantially benefit the US economy and stop thousands of deaths each year, compared with allowing climate pollution to continue to rise through the 21st century. Reaching a peak for climate pollution mid-century and then beginning a decline would prevent in 2090: 48% of the $155bn per year in damages to labor 58% of the $141bn per year in lives lost on extremely hot or cold days 22% of the $118bn per year in damages to coastal property 31% of the $26bn per year in the health consequences from poor air quality 59% of the $20bn per year in damages to roads 47% of the $8bn per year in inland flooding The earth would continue to warm even if humans stopped producing greenhouse gases from power plants and cars today. But limiting – if not entirely eliminating – that pollution would substantially reduce risks. Cutting greenhouse gases would provide the biggest benefits in the latter half of this century. “In the absence of more significant global mitigation efforts, climate change is projected to impose substantial damages on the US economy, human health, and the environment,” the report says. “Under scenarios with high emissions and limited or no adaptation, annual losses in some sectors are estimated to grow to hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century. It is very likely that some physical and ecological impacts will be irreversible for thousands of years, while others will be permanent.” Ocean warming, for example, is causing coral bleaching around the world. If greenhouse gases rise through the century, nearly all coral reefs will be surrounded by acidified seawater. Reaching a peak for manmade greenhouse gas growth by the middle of the century in the US would also avoid up to tens of thousands of deaths per year from extreme temperatures and up to thousands of deaths per year from poor air quality."
"Donald Trump has told reporters he doesn’t believe his own government’s climate change findings that the US economy will suffer substantially with continued warming from greenhouse gas pollution. “I’ve seen it, I’ve read some of it, and it’s fine,” he said outside the White House on Monday. “I don’t believe it.” The report, called the National Climate Assessment, was quietly released the day after Thanksgiving. Also last Friday, the government slipped out another environment internal report with bad news about emissions from oil and gas drilling on federal lands. The Trump administration has tried to downplay the dire findings of the consensus analysis, which concludes climate change could cost the US economy hundreds of billions of dollars and thousands of lives each year in future. A White House spokeswoman said the assessment was “based on the most extreme scenario”, although the report explores the differences in the impacts of climate change based on pollution levels and other factors. “With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century – more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states,” the report says. Regional economies and industries that depend on natural resources and a favorable climate, including agriculture, tourism and fisheries, will suffer, the report finds. As other countries see even worse impacts than the US, Americans will feel the burden through import and export prices and in businesses that have overseas supply chains. The report puts a dollar figure on the economic damages from unmitigated climate change. If greenhouse gas pollution from power plants and cars continues to rise through the 21st century, the US could then see $155bn a year in damages to labor and $118bn a year in damages to coastal property. Lives lost to extreme heat and cold could cost another $141bn a year and the consequences from worsened air quality could equal $26bn a year. Curbing globe-heating pollution would significantly reduce those costs, but the Trump administration has consistently reversed government efforts to slow climate change. The Trump administration also published another report on climate change on Friday, laying out that oil and gas produced from drilling on public land accounted for almost a quarter of carbon dioxide pollution in the US between 2004 and 2015. The information from the US Geological Survey, in the first such report, was requested in 2016 under Barack Obama’s administration.Trump officials have since moved to make it easier for companies to drill on federal land and rescinded standards for the globe-warming methane released by oil and gas operations."
