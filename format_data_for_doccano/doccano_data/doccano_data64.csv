"France will end sales of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040 as part of an ambitious plan to meet its targets under the Paris climate accord, Emmanuel Macron’s government has announced. The announcement comes a day after Volvo said it would only make fully electric or hybrid cars from 2019 onwards, a decision hailed as the beginning of the end for the internal combustion engine’s dominance of motor transport after more than a century.  Nicolas Hulot, the country’s new ecology minister, said: “We are announcing an end to the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040.” Hulot added that the move was a “veritable revolution”. He said it would be a “tough” objective for carmakers but France’s industry was well equipped to make the switch. “Our [car]makers have enough ideas in the drawer to nurture and bring about this promise ... which is also a public health issue.” Hulot insisted that the decision was a question of public health policy and “a way to fight against air pollution”. The veteran environmental campaigner was among several political newcomers to whom Macron gave top jobs in his government. Pascal Canfin, the head of WWF France and a former Green politician who served in François Hollande’s government, said the new policy platform to counter climate change went further than previous administrations in France. “It places France among the leaders of climate action in the world,” he told France Inter radio. Prof David Bailey, an automotive industry expert at Aston University, said: “The timescale involved here is sufficiently long term to be taken seriously. If enacted it would send a very clear signal to manufacturers and consumers of the direction of travel and may accelerate a transition to electric cars.” Norway, which has the highest penetration of electric cars in the world, has set a target of only allowing sales of 100% electric or plug-in hybrid cars by 2025. Other countries have floated the idea of banning cars powered by an internal combustion engine to meet air quality and climate change goals, but have not yet passed concrete targets.  The Netherlands has mooted a 2025 ban for diesel and petrol cars, and some federal states in Germany are keen on a 2030 phase-out. India, where scores of cities are blighted by dangerous air pollution, is mulling the idea of no longer selling petrol or diesel cars by 2030, and said it wants to introduce electric cars in “a very big way”. The UK has an aspiration of all new cars being electric or ultra low emission by 2040, but has been criticised by campaigners and politicans for being slow to act on air pollution. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: “I welcome the strong leadership the French government has shown by making the decision to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040.  “This radical step shames the timid and insufficient response of our own government to the health threat posed by poor air quality.” France’s announcement came as Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicted electric cars would come to dominate the automotive market more quickly and dramatically than previously thought.  Electric vehicles will make up 54% of all light-duty vehicle sales by 2040, up from the 35% share Bloomberg was forecasting just last year, according to a new report by the research group.  Bloomberg said such a widespread uptake of electric vehicles would globally reduce oil demand by 8m barrels a day and increase electricity consumption by 5% to charge all the new cars.  But Tony Seba, a Stanford University economist who has published research predicting electric cars will even more rapidly take over from conventional cars, said of France’s plan: “Banning sales of diesel and gasoline vehicles by 2040 is a bit like banning sales of horses for road transportation by 2040: there won’t be any to ban.” French car manufacturers Peugeot, Citroën and Renault ranked first, second and third on a 2016 list of large car manufacturers with the lowest carbon emissions, the European Environment Agency said. Just 0.6% of new car registrations across the EU last year were for pure electric vehicles, compared with 1.1% of new cars sold in France.  French-Japanese carmaker Renault-Nissan has been an enthusiastic early advocate for the vehicles, taking 14.6% of the EU market share for battery-powered vehicles. The firm has built 425,000 of the more than 2m electric cars sold globally. France’s reliance on nuclear power stations for 80% of its electricity supply means that a shift to electric vehicles rather than oil-powered ones would dramatically cut its remaining carbon emissions."

"As we well know, climate myths are like zombies that never seem to die. It’s only a matter of time before they rise from the dead and threaten to eat our brains. And so here we go again – American conservatives are denying the very existence of global warming.  The claim is based on what can charitably be described as a white paper, written by fossil fuel-funded contrarians Joseph D’Aleo and Craig Idso along with James Wallace III. Two months ago, D’Aleo and Wallace published another error-riddled white paper on the same website with fellow contrarian John Christy; both papers aimed to undermine the EPA’s Endangerment Finding.  The Endangerment Finding concluded that the scientific research clearly shows that carbon pollution endangers public health and welfare via climate change impacts, and therefore according to the US Supreme Court, the EPA must regulate carbon pollution under the Clean Air Act. Conservatives who benefit from the fossil fuel status quo and oppose all climate policies have urged the Trump administration to go after the Endangerment Finding. Both papers are rife with flaws because they start from a desired conclusion – that the science underpinning Endangerment Finding is somehow wrong – and work backwards trying to support it. In this paper, the contrarians try to undermine the accuracy of the global surface temperature record, which has been validated time and time again. They don’t bother trying to hide their bias – the paper refers to “Climate Alarmists” and speaks of invalidating the Endangerment Finding.  The paper itself has little scientific content. Using charts taken from climate denier blogs, the authors claim that every temperature record adjustment since the 1980s has been in the warming direction, which is simply false. As Zeke Hausfather pointed out, referencing work by Nick Stokes, roughly half of the adjustments have resulted in cooling and half in warming. Moreover, the net adjustment to the raw data actually reduces the long-term global warming trend: Here's a histogram of the global land adjustments from NOAA. Also, I'm attaching an image comparing raw and adj global land/ocean temps. pic.twitter.com/BSZXVB9uQw Additionally, a peer-reviewed study last year led by Hausfather verified the validity of the temperature adjustments by showing that they bring the data in closer agreement with that from pristinely located temperature stations.  The white paper also claims that the adjustments remove a “cyclical pattern” that appeared more clearly in early versions of the temperature record. As Hausfather told me, that’s simply because we now have more data that better represent the planet as a whole: What they don’t tell you is that the 1980 record in question only comes from around 500 land stations almost entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and does not include any ocean data at all. There is a well-known warm period in the mid-to-high latitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere in the 1930s and 1940s, but it does not really show up much in the oceans and not at all in the Southern Hemisphere. As scientists have collected more historical temperature records from around the world in the past 35 years, we have created more complete records that show less warmth in that period simply because they cover more of the planet.  And of course natural thermometers validate this global warming as well. Ice is melting, species are migrating, spring is arriving earlier, sea levels are rising, oceans are warming, humidity is rising, and so on. The contrarian white paper also references satellite estimates of the temperature of Earth’s atmosphere – estimates that one group recently found are in close agreement with the global surface temperature record. The white paper authors admit that some adjustments to the raw data are necessary (for example, to correct for changes in instrumentation technology, time of observation, moving station locations, and so on), and they don’t dispute the accuracy or necessity of any of the adjustments that climate scientists have made. Basically, because they don’t like the end result of global warming, the authors assert that the adjustments must somehow be wrong, but fail to support that assertion with any real evidence. It’s not worth the paper it’s printed on. Predictably, a number of conservative media outlets like the Daily Caller and Climate Depot picked up on the white paper. The Daily Caller even went as far as to call it a “peer-reviewed study.” In a sense that’s true – a number of other fossil fuel-funded contrarian scientists who are technically the authors’ peers signed onto the paper. But of course that’s really pal review, not peer review; the white paper was not published in a peer-reviewed journal because it obviously would not withstand scrutiny by scientific experts. It’s telling that these contrarian white paper efforts to undermine the established climate science supporting the EPA Endangerment Finding are so poor. They’re forced to resort to conspiracy theories, implying that climate scientists from around the world are all falsifying data, adding a global warming signal to the temperature record that we also happen to see in nature and in satellites. As Hausfather put it: Ultimately all of these comparisons to past records are a bit of a distraction. We have all the raw temperature records today, and we can compare them to the adjusted data to see what, exactly, adjustments do to the temperature record. It turns out that adjustments actually result in less warming over the past century, not more. If we scientists were “cooking the books,” we are doing so in the wrong direction. If this is the best contrarians can do, it’s no wonder that even Scott Pruitt thinks challenging the established climate science underpinning the EPA Endangerment Finding is a losing effort."
"Strange things have been happening in the frozen tundra of northern Siberia. Last August a boy died of anthrax in the remote Yamal Peninsula, and 20 other infected people were treated and survived. Anthrax hadn’t been seen in the region for 75 years, and it’s thought the recent outbreak followed an intense heatwave in Siberia, temperatures reaching over 30C that melted the frozen permafrost.  Long dormant spores of the highly infectious anthrax bacteria frozen in the carcass of an infected reindeer rejuvenated themselves and infected herds of reindeer and eventually local people.  More recently, a huge explosion was heard in June in the Yamal Peninsula. Reindeer herders camped nearby saw flames shooting up with pillars of smoke and found a large crater left in the ground. Melting permafrost was again suspected, thawing out dead vegetation and erupting in a blowout of highly flammable methane gas.  Over the past three years, 14 other giant craters have been found in the region, some of them truly massive – the first one discovered was around 50m (160ft) wide and about 70m (230ft) deep, with steep sides and debris spread all around. There have also been cases of the ground trembling in Siberia as bubbles of methane trapped below the surface set the ground wobbling like an airbed. Even more dramatic, setting fire to methane released from frozen lakes in both Siberia and Alaska causes some impressive flames to erupt.  Methane is of huge concern. It is more than 20 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, and a massive release of methane in the Arctic could pose a significant threat to the global climate, driving worldwide temperatures even higher."
" His character Jon Snow may fret about the arrival of winter, but Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington has said he was instead confronted by “terrifying” evidence of global warming while filming the HBO show.  Harington said it was a “very sad irony” to film in locations with diminishing ice for scenes where the arrival of winter, and the frosty undead from beyond the Wall, is feared by his character. “We went to Iceland to find snow, because winter is here,” the actor told Time. “We got there and we were lucky to get the snow we did, because in our world, winter is definitely not here. It’s this weird parallel, the opposite parallel.  “We go out there this year, and the glacier that me and Rose [Leslie, who played his love interest Ygritte] filmed on four years ago, I saw it and it has shrunk. I saw climate change and global warming with my own eyes, and it is terrifying.” Game of Thrones has used several locations in Iceland as backdrop to scenes from beyond the Wall – a frigid, snow-blanketed environment where the itinerant Wildings are threatened by the advance of the undead White Walkers.  Grjotagja, a cave near the town of Akureyri, is where Snow and Ygritte sleep together, while the Svínafellsjökull and Vatnajökull glaciers are also featured.  Vatnajökull, Europe’s largest glacier, is estimated to be shrinking at a rate of 1 meter (3ft) a year and will probably disappear, along with Iceland’s other glaciers, within 100 years, a government committee has warned. This rate of decline is shared by many of the world’s largest ice sheets, with warming temperatures causing them to melt away and ultimately fuel sea level rise. Game of Thrones also films on location in countries such as Northern Ireland, Spain and Croatia. Harington said the show, despite the misery endured by many characters, is increasingly a pleasant distraction from recent real-world events. “There is a lot of chaos in the world right now, whether it’s implemented by our government, purposeful chaos or not,” he said. “It’s interesting being in a TV show that is not reflecting the world, but at the same time is. “Now, Westeros maybe feels like a nice escapism compared to what you’re seeing on the news, because the world’s politics has gotten very, very dark in recent weeks and months.” The seventh season of Game of Thrones starts in July."
"Donald Trump was left isolated at the end of a fractious G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, after every other world leader signed up to a declaration that the Paris climate agreement was irreversible following an unprecedented standoff. After the publication of a final communique that saw the emergence of a G19 grouping for the first time, Theresa May said she was “dismayed at the US decision to pull out” of the accord and had personally urged the president to reconsider.  Asked why she had failed to raise the issue during a formal 50-minute bilateral meeting with Trump at the Hamburg Messehallen, as furious negotiations were still going on behind the scenes, the prime minister said: “I did bring the issue of climate change agreement up with President Trump. “I have had a number of conversations with him while I’ve been here at the G20. What I did was encourage him to bring the United States back into the Paris agreement, and I continue to hope that’s what the United States will do.” It came after the president promised May that the US was ready to strike a trade deal with the UK as soon as possible after Brexit. “There is no country that could possibly be closer than our countries,” Trump said. “We have been working on a trade deal which will be a very, very big deal – a very powerful deal, great for both countries – and I think we will have that done very, very quickly.” He added: “Prime Minister May and I have developed a very special relationship and I think trade will be a very big factor between our two countries.” It came as May used the two-day summit to focus on the possibility of post-Brexit trade opportunities in a series of one-on-one meetings with non EU leaders, including China’s Xi Jinping, India’s Narendra Modi, and Japan’s Shinzo Abe. “I have held a number of meetings with other world leaders at this summit and have been struck by their strong desire to forge ambitious new trading relationships with the UK after Brexit,” said May. “This is a powerful vote of confidence in British goods, British services, Britain’s economy and the British people – and we look forward to building on these conversations in the months ahead.” May said she would not be sceptical about the Trump offer but remained “optimistic”. However, critics were quick to warn against taking Trump at his word. “I think it is political puffery. There will be no fast US-UK trade agreement,” said a former senior official at the IMF and in the Canadian government, who has dealt with the US in a major trade negotiation. Thomas Bernes, now a fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation, said: “I was involved in the Canada-US trade agreement and it was extremely complicated. No one will be interested in a trade deal until you know where the UK is vis-a-vis the European Union and until that point is reached you can have plenty of goodwill but it is nothing more than that.” He claimed that Trump had failed to understand the complexity of trade agreements, saying the US president would first need to request permission to negotiate from Congress, which would have six months to consider the issue. The G20 meeting saw a number of tense encounters between Trump and other world leaders, with a particular clash between him and the French delegation over climate change, but also tensions over protectionism and the overproduction of steel. The final communique said: “We take note of the decision of the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris agreement.” It added: “The leaders of the other G20 members state that the Paris agreement is irreversible.” However, the US did succeed in forcing in a controversial reference to helping countries access fossil fuels in a clean way – to the fury of environmental campaigners. Steve Price-Thomas, Oxfam’s director of advocacy and campaigns, said: “With the other 19 members firmly defending the Paris agreement as irreversible, President Trump’s stubborn insistence on propping up the fossil fuel industry leaves him isolated and stuck in the past.” He also accused the G20 of treating the world’s poorest as an afterthought. The communique placed a new emphasis on the need for trade deals to be reciprocal and non-discriminatory, reducing the previous emphasis on the primacy of liberalisation. At the same time it called for adherence to a rules-based regime and respect for the WTO. It also called for “concrete policy solutions” on excess steel capacity to be prepared by November this year; a speed-up in the previous timetable and a concession to Trump. On trade, another sticking point during the two-day summit, the leaders agreed they would “fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices and recognise the role of legitimate trade defence instruments in this regard.”"
"Human-caused climate change dramatically increased the likelihood of the extreme heatwave that saw deadly forest fires blazing in Portugal and Spain, new research has shown. Much of western Europe sweltered earlier in June, and the severe heat in England, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland was also made significantly more likely by global warming. Such temperatures will become the norm by 2050, the scientists warned, unless action is taken to rapidly cut carbon emissions.  Scientists combined temperature records and the latest observations with a series of sophisticated computer models to calculate how much the global rise in greenhouse gases has raised the odds of the soaring temperatures. They found the heatwave that struck Portugal and Spain was 10 times more likely to have occurred due to global warming. In Portugal, 64 people died in huge forest fires, while in Spain 1,500 people were forced to evacuate by forest blazes. The intense heat was made four times more probable in central England, which endured its hottest day since 1976, and in France, the Netherlands and Switzerland, where emergency heatwave plans were triggered. The analysis was carried out by World Weather Attribution (WAA), an international coalition of scientists that calculates the role of climate change in extreme weather events. “We found clear and strong links between June’s record warmth and human-caused climate change,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and part of WWA. “Heat can be deadly – especially for the very young and the elderly,” said Friederike Otto, at Oxford University and also part of WWA. “This extreme event attribution analysis makes clear that European heatwaves have become more frequent, and in the South of Europe at least 10 times more frequent. It is critical that cities work with scientists and public health experts to develop heat action plans. Climate change is impacting communities right now and these plans save lives.” The UK government’s official climate change advisers warned ministers on Thursday that their refusal to ensure new buildings are designed to deal with high temperatures could see annual heat-related deaths more than triple to 7,000 by 2040. Earlier in June, research showed that a third of the world’s population already faces deadly heatwaves as a result of climate change. “Hot months are no longer rare in our current climate,” said Robert Vautard, at the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences in France. “By the middle of the century, this kind of extreme heat in June will become the norm in western Europe unless we take immediate steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”"
"In this episode of the Bernie Sanders Show, Sanders talks to Al Gore about his new film, An Inconvenient Sequel. Below is an abridged transcript of their conversation. Sanders: Mr Vice-President, many people reach high political life and then disappear. You have not disappeared. You have chosen to tackle one of the most significant planetary crises: climate change. Now, you’re releasing a new movie, An Inconvenient Sequel. Could you tell us a little about it? Gore: Yes, the movie will tell you everything you need to know about the climate crisis, the solutions to the crisis and how you can become an activist to help solve it. A decade ago, the solutions were visible on the horizon. Now they’re here Sanders: It’s been 10 years since you released an Inconvenient Truth. What’s changed since then? Gore: Two big things: number one: the climate-related extreme weather events are way more common now, and way more destructive. Here in the US in the last seven years, we’ve had 11 so-called “once-in-a-1,000 year” downpours. The second change is: we now have the solutions! A decade ago, the solutions were visible on the horizon. Now they’re here.  In a growing number of cities and regions, electricity from solar and wind is cheaper than electricity from burning fossil fuels. Electric cars are becoming more common place. Efficiency technologies are coming down in cost. The problems are worse but the solutions are here. We need political will, but political will is a renewable resource. And people are rising up. The Paris agreement 18 months ago was an historic breakthrough. All over the country activists are being energized. We are working with Indivisible.com and their guide, the Indivisible guide. It is really a terrific guide to becoming a climate activist. We are counting on people at the grassroots level. Sanders: Most people in our country understand that climate change is not a hoax. Most people want to see us move to sustainable energy. Yet we are seeing all kinds of opposition, from the Republican party. What role does the fossil fuel industry play in that? Gore: Fossil fuel companies and fossil fuel burning utilities have actually taken the playbook from the tobacco companies. There is a great book called The Merchants of Doubt that documents this thoroughly. They’ve hired the same PR firms. They’ve tried to deliberately confuse people. You remember when the scientific and medical consensus linked cigarettes to lung cancer and other diseases? The tobacco industry hired actors and dressed them up as doctors and put them in front of cameras to reassure people that there were no health consequences. Well, the carbon polluters are doing the same thing. They’ve funded a major cottage industry of climate change deniers and pseudo-scientists trying to pull the wool over people’s eyes. We are the only country in the world that has a major conservative party that is wedded to provable idiocy on climate. It is now beginning to give way because more people are seeing through the ruse. Sanders: What is their response? My Republican friends say if we move away from fossil fuel, the cost of electricity will become much more expensive for manufacturing and that we’re going to lose jobs. What’s your answer to that view? So long as big money influences, they can use their lobbying to force the state legislatures to hold back solar and wind Gore: The Bureau of Labor Statistics offers an answer. Solar jobs are growing 17 times faster in the US than all other jobs. They predict that for the next 10 years the single fastest growing job is wind turbine technician. All over the world, the brightest spot for economic renewal and dynamism is the sustainability and renewable energy revolution. That’s why China is closing hundreds of coal-burning plants. Their emissions have come down three years in a row. They are trying to create most of the jobs in China. And India announced last month, that within 13 years all of their cars and trucks will have to be electric vehicles. When developing countries are moving faster than we are, and harvesting the economic growth and jobs, it just highlights how we are hurting ourselves by letting carbon polluters decide public policy. Sanders: Solar and wind costs are plummeting. Leaders in the industry expect that, without any subsidies whatsoever, solar will be far less expensive to produce electricity from than fossil fuel. What is your expectation of what will be happening in the future? Gore: The cost is coming down dramatically. There is a scene in this movie, Senator, where I go to one of the most conservative cities in the country – Georgetown, Texas – in the heart of oil country in Texas. There, a conservative Republican mayor has committed to completely switching to renewable energy, 100%. Their utility bills are going down. They’re getting more jobs as a result. Sanders: And he’s not doing it because he is a big-time environmentalist. He’s doing it because he’s saving money for the community. Gore: There are several utilities in Texas right now, that have a new rate plan from 9pm to 6am, where you can use all the [renewable] electricity you want for free. Because it costs them more money to turn off the turbines at night. The concept is zero marginal costs. It’s changing the economics of energy all over the world. Sanders: And recently Chile negotiated a contract that will allow for the cheapest electricity energy on the planet from solar, is that correct? Gore: That is correct. It’s 2.4 cents per kilowatt hour. That’s less than half of what the electricity of coal costs. Sanders: Wow. Gore: [Around the world] the fossil fuel-burning utilities talk among themselves about what they call a “utility death spiral”. A lot of them are moving faster than in the US to switch over to renewable energy. But we have this problem in our political system. Big money calls the shots all too often. You’ve been good at calling that out, Senator. So long as big money influences, they can use their lobbying to force the state legislatures to hold back solar and wind. This is not a partisan issue. The head of the Atlanta Tea Party was contacted by the Koch brothers a while back, wanting to get their support for holding back solar. But she had just put solar [panels] on her house. She contacted the Sierra Club and they formed a new coalition called the Green Tea Party. They defeated that legislation in Georgia. Similar uprisings are talking place all over the country. Bernie: It seems to me that, if we had a sensible president now, we wouldn’t need to be talking about this stuff. We’d be investing in wind and solar. I want to thank you calling attention to the crisis and the solutions. You’ve been a leader not just in the United States but in the world. What we are talking about is the future of the planet. That’s why we need the American people to stand up and tell the fossil fuel industry that the lives of our future generations are more important than their short term profits.

"Just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to a new report. The Carbon Majors Report (pdf) “pinpoints how a relatively small set of fossil fuel producers may hold the key to systemic change on carbon emissions,” says Pedro Faria, technical director at environmental non-profit CDP, which published the report in collaboration with the Climate Accountability Institute.  Traditionally, large scale greenhouse gas emissions data is collected at a national level but this report focuses on fossil fuel producers. Compiled from a database of publicly available emissions figures, it is intended as the first in a series of publications to highlight the role companies and their investors could play in tackling climate change.  The report found that more than half of global industrial emissions since 1988 – the year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established – can be traced to just 25 corporate and state-owned entities. The scale of historical emissions associated with these fossil fuel producers is large enough to have contributed significantly to climate change, according to the report.  ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since 1988. If fossil fuels continue to be extracted at the same rate over the next 28 years as they were between 1988 and 2017, says the report, global average temperatures would be on course to rise by 4C by the end of the century. This is likely to have catastrophic consequences including substantial species extinction and global food scarcity risks. While companies have a huge role to play in driving climate change, says Faria, the barrier is the “absolute tension” between short-term profitability and the urgent need to reduce emissions. A Carbon Tracker study in 2015 found that fossil fuel companies risked wasting more than $2tn over the coming decade by pursuing coal, oil and gas projects that could be worthless in the face of international action on climate change and advances in renewables – in turn posing substantial threats to investor returns. CDP says its aims with the carbon majors project are both to improve transparency among fossil fuel producers and to help investors understand the emissions associated with their fossil fuel holdings.  A fifth of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions are backed by public investment, according to the report. “That puts a significant responsibility on those investors to engage with carbon majors and urge them to disclose climate risk,” says Faria. Investors should move out of fossil fuels, says Michael Brune, executive director of US environmental organisation the Sierra Club. “Not only is it morally risky, it’s economically risky. The world is moving away from fossil fuels towards clean energy and is doing so at an accelerated pace. Those left holding investments in fossil fuel companies will find their investments becoming more and more risky over time.” There is a “growing wave of companies that are acting in the opposite manner to the companies in this report,” says Brune. Nearly 100 companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Ikea have committed to 100% renewable power under the RE100 initiative. Volvo recently announced that all its cars would be electric or hybrid from 2019.  And oil and gas companies are also embarking on green investments. Shell set up a renewables arm in 2015 with a $1.7bn investment attached and a spokesperson for Chevron says it’s “committed to managing its [greenhouse gas] emissions” and is investing in two of the world’s largest carbon dioxide injection projects to capture and store carbon. A BP spokesperson says its “determined to be part of the solution” for climate change and is “investing in renewables and low-carbon innovation.” And ExxonMobil, which has faced heavy criticism for its environmental record, has been exploring carbon capture and storage. But for many the sums involved and pace of change are nowhere near enough. A research paper published last year by Paul Stevens, an academic at think tank Chatham House, said international oil companies were no longer fit for purpose and warned these multinationals that they faced a “nasty, brutish and short” end within the next 10 years if they did not completely change their business models.  Investors now have a choice, according to Charlie Kronick, senior programme advisor at Greenpeace UK. “The future of the oil industry has already been written: the choice is will its decline be managed, returning capital to shareholders to be reinvested in the genuine industries of the future, or will they hold on, hoping not be the last one standing when the music stops?”"
"In the Paris climate treaty, nearly every world country agreed to try and limit global warming to no more than 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures, and preferably closer to 1.5°C. But a new study published in Nature Climate Change notes that the agreement didn’t define when “pre-industrial” begins. Our instrumental measurements of the Earth’s average surface temperature begin in the late-1800s, but the Industrial Revolution began in the mid-1700s. There’s also a theory that human agriculture has been influencing the global climate for thousands of years, but the mass burning of fossil fuels kicked the human influence into high gear.  We know that since the late-1800s, humans have caused global surface temperatures to rise by about 1°C. But what about the human influence in the centuries before that, which are technically still “pre-industrial”? The new study used climate model simulations from 1401 to 1800, during which time we know the climate influences of natural effects like solar and volcanic activity fairly well. They found that depending on the starting point, global surface temperatures during that period were 0 to 0.2°C cooler than the late-1800s.  According to the last IPCC report, to have a 50% chance of staying below the 2°C target, when accounting for non-carbon greenhouse gases, we have a remaining budget of about 300bn tons of carbon dioxide. But that was for 2°C warming above late-1800 temperatures. If we add another 0.1°C of pre-industrial warming, the study authors estimated that the budget shrinks by 60bn tons (20%), and if there was an additional 0.2°C pre-industrial warming, the 2°C carbon budget shrinks by 40%. As one of the study authors Michael Mann put it: Either the Paris targets have to be revised, or alternatively, we decide that the existing targets really were meant to describe only the warming since the late 19th century. It’s an important point if we want to measure whether we’ve succeeded or failed in meeting the Paris climate targets. And it’s important to know if our budget should be set at no more than 300bn tons, or more like 200bn tons of carbon dioxide pollution. However, we’re not yet on track to meet the Paris climate target budget. Based on current national pledges, humans will cause around 3 to 3.5°C warming above late-1800 temperatures by 2100. But the Paris treaty included a ratcheting mechanism through which countries can gradually make their carbon pollution targets more aggressive. If successful, that ratcheting could limit global warming to 1.8°C above late-1800 temperatures, which is likely less than 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures.  To accomplish that goal, the US would have to ratchet its carbon pollution down to 45% below 2005 levels by 2030, for example. But at the moment, America is moving in the wrong direction, shamefully becoming the only nation announcing withdrawal from the Paris treaty, aiming to join Nicaragua (which declined to sign due to objections that the agreement was too weak) and Syria (which did not participate due to a civil war) as the only non-signatory countries. Fortunately, other countries like China and the EU are stepping up to fill the global leadership role vacated by America under the Trump administration. It’s also important to remember that 2°C isn’t a red line – that if we cause 2.1°C the world will end or that at 1.9°C everything will be fine and dandy. The 2°C target is a reasonable one for two reasons: 1) Above about 2°C we start to get into the realm where there’s a significant risk of major climate impacts, like widespread coral bleaching, declining food production, significant sea level rise, and up to 30% of global species at risk of extinction. 2) From a practical political standpoint, meeting the 2°C carbon budget is about the best we can do. Even that will require aggressive global action, with countries ratcheting down their carbon pollution targets. But the key takeaway is that the more global warming we cause, the costlier and more damaging climate impacts will be. The faster we curb our climate pollution, the lower the risk of a climate catastrophe or especially damaging climate impacts. We’re at the point where we need to cut carbon pollution as quickly as feasibly possible. That’s true whether Earth has warmed 1.0 or 1.1 or 1.2°C above “pre-industrial” temperatures. However, knowing which is the case is useful for setting concrete targets and evaluating whether we meet them. But if we’re going to meet them, we’ll have to quickly reverse the mistakes of the Trump administration."
"Imagine, if you will, a government board to champion Australian arts without any artists on it, or an agency to advise on medical research without any medical researchers.  Or perhaps even, imagine a government authority set up to provide expertise on climate policy without any actual climate scientists.  Well you don’t have to imagine that last one, because that’s what we now have – the government’s Climate Change Authority is now sans climate scientist.  Prof David Karoly, of the University of Melbourne, has just finished his term on the authority’s board – the only member to stick it out for the full five years.  Karoly says without someone to replace him, the authority will struggle to fulfil its legal mandate. He told me: I think that it is critically important that at least one member of the Climate Change Authority is an expert and experienced climate change scientist. Such a member is needed to provide information and interpretation on the latest climate change science publications and data.  In my view, it can only do that with a climate change scientist as a member, to provide expert assessment of the effectiveness of proposed greenhouse gas emission reductions nationally and globally, and the projected impacts on Australia from current and future climate change. The Climate Change Authority Act 2011 states that, in conducting a review, the authority must have regard to environmental effectiveness among a number of other matters.  I asked the Department of the Environment and Energy if there were any plans to replace Karoly with another climate scientist. The department said: Government appointments to the CCA are a matter for the Government under the CCA’s legislation. The Chief Scientist is an ex officio Member of the Authority and can assist on scientific matters and in providing access to the scientific community, including climate scientists. So in other words, it won’t replace Karoly and will instead just rely on the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, to act as a go-between, which of course is much more efficient and logical than actually having a climate scientist right there in the room. That would be silly, right? Remembering too that the CCA has always had the serving chief scientist on its board so, by this logic, Karoly was always a spare part.  In reality, the makeup and character of the CCA was fundamentally altered after Malcolm Turnbull made changes to the board in 2015. So why did Karoly decide to stick it out this long, when colleagues including Prof Clive Hamilton, Prof John Quiggin and Danny Price were throwing in the towel out of frustration that the government was listening to rightwing anti-science advocates instead of actual expertise? Says Karoly: I decided to stay on because I believe that the CCA was established by the Australian Parliament. I believe that it is important that the Parliament and the Australian people are provided with the best possible independent science-based advice on Australia’s climate change policy.  Unfortunately, after six new members were appointed by the Government to the CCA in 2015, I do not think this continued to be the case, despite my efforts. That is why Clive Hamilton and I published our Minority Report in 2016. I did not resign at the same time as Clive Hamilton as I still wanted to provide the best possible science-based advice to the members of the CCA and to the Government. Karoly’s account of a shift in the authority under the Turnbull government matches that of Hamilton, who told me this year that “the whole character of the authority changed”. In its earlier years, the CCA had been forthright in its advice to the government. Simply put, the authority’s detailed reports showed targets to cut emissions were well short of what was needed if Australia wanted to mount any sort of claim to be doing its fair share globally.  Under the former Liberal leader Tony Abbott, the government vowed to axe the authority entirely – but couldn’t get enough support in parliament. So instead, if you believe its former insiders, the authority was carefully manipulated and undermined. As Hamilton put it, the CCA became “dominated by people who want action, but not too much action”."
"After a lifetime out in the field, measuring the egg-laying preferences of Californian butterflies or counting plant species living in and around Birmingham, ecologist Chris D Thomas is no typical debut author. But like so many writers, his first book, Inheritors of the Earth, has been germinating for some time. The seeds were sown in the early 2000s: Thomas was researching ways of saving animals and plants threatened by climate change, when he began to focus on the inconsistencies in attitudes to the ebb and flow of nature. “When things died out or declined it was seen as a loss,” he says, “but when new things arrived it was either ignored or also counted effectively as a loss, because it was seen as a departure from how things used to be. Implicitly, people were thinking that there was a way the world should be.”  We tend to think of the natural world in terms of our lifetimes, or the lifetimes of our parents and grandparents. But if you consider the environment over timescales of hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands of years, it is impossible to avoid the fact that it is always changing. As an example, during the last 20,000 years – which in the history of life is no time at all – the environment in the Vale of York has been turned repeatedly on its head. Lake species were replaced by those of dune, steppe and wetland; these in turn were supplanted by forest species, later usurped by those currently living in the hay pasture outside Thomas’s Yorkshire home. “Every process in ecology, every process in evolution, is a dynamic one, and therefore imagining that nature is a static old master that needs to be restored to a particular state is just not a reasonable way of looking at the processes of life,” he says. Casting aside this familiar way of thinking about the natural world does present a real problem, Thomas admits, because keeping nature as it was in the recent past is an easy goal to define and agree. “The only problem is that – particularly in the context of rapidly changing climate and land use and all the other things we’re doing to the world – it’s all very well wishing it, but we’re not going to achieve it.” Instead of focusing on preserving past ecosystems, Thomas says, we should concentrate on preserving biodiversity, so that living things can respond flexibly to future challenges. “Nothing that I’m saying lets us off the hook in terms of maintaining the biodiversity that we currently have, but if we accept that it’s a dynamic system rather than a static one … if we are prepared to accept biological gains as much as we regret losses, then we can take a much more optimistic view [of] conservation,” he says. As the climate shifts, Thomas argues, we must allow animals and plants to shift as well. In some cases, this means transporting species away from places where they can no longer thrive and giving them a chance to survive elsewhere. This kind of intervention runs counter to rules and regulations designed to prevent invasive species, but Thomas says that while some species can cause trouble for human beings, when you look at other organisms, “most of them don’t end up causing much of a problem”. “As far as we know, no native British species has completely died out from the whole of Britain as a consequence of those arrivals. If we take a national perspective, it’s 2,000 plus, zero minus … The chances of a new arrival causing an extinction is a very, very small fraction of 1%. At the moment in the UK, empirically it’s zero,” he says. “So it seems that the risk of causing a problematic invasive species that would eliminate one of the existing species is lower than the chances of the thing dying out if you don’t move it.” Human beings have made huge changes to the natural world, Thomas admits, and some of those changes have had catastrophic effects on individual species. Think of New Zealand’s takahē, a heavy, flightless bird that evolved on an island where there were few predators, and which is currently struggling under the relentless assault from rats and stoats. Nearly all of these are situations occur where the new species that arrives is functionally quite different, Thomas suggests, where there’s a small part of the world – a remote island, or an isolated lake – with a missing piece of the ecological jigsaw. But when you look at those changes on a wider scale and examine their effect on the variety of living things, the picture improves. “It appears to be empirically true that, over the last couple of hundred years, those parts of the world that we know about as regions have increased numbers of species,” he says. The author conjures up a future in which African black rhinos find refuge in Mediterranean shrubland, or butterflies from Provence can survive on grasslands in southern England, a world where wingnut trees, currently threatened in the Caucasian mountains, can flourish in British gardens. As soon as you discard the fiction that life on Earth can return to some prelapsarian idyll, conservationists have much more flexibility to protect species in new places, to form new combinations of habitats. Making the case for managed change in a political climate where business speaks louder than the natural world holds some dangers, as Thomas acknowledges, but trying to prevent all change just isn’t working. “Ultimately, we have to accept the rate of change and understand how we are going to work with it, because if we try to fight all change then, on timescales of decades, we’re not going to succeed. There’s no point, for the sake of political convenience, in continuing to steer our ship in a way that simply isn’t viable.” Whatever solutions we come up with, he is adamant that they can’t ignore the needs of the species which now – for better or worse – controls the fate of the planet. People can only look after the environment when they don’t have to worry about their own day-to-day survival. “Call me a dreamer,” he says, “but if we’re interested in the natural world, then we need a healthy and well-fed world population.”"
"Donald Trump regrets the “bizarre mistake” of withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement, Sir Richard Branson has said. The British billionaire also urged the president to help phase out the ailing US coal industry. Speaking in Brooklyn on Friday, the Virgin Group founder said businesses and cities were firmly behind a transition to low-carbon energy, which made Trump’s decision to exit the Paris deal “very, very strange”. “With climate change, it’s America first and our beautiful globe last, and that seems incredibly sad,” said Branson. “I’ve got a feeling that the president is regretting what he did. Maybe his children and son in law [adviser Jared Kushner] are saying, ‘Look, I told you so.’ Hopefully there is a positive change of mind.” On Sunday, French president Emmanuel Macron said he was hopeful that Trump would reverse his decision, according to the newspaper Dimanche.  “(Trump) told me that he would try to find a solution in the coming months,” Macron told the paper, referring to meetings the two leaders had this week in Paris. “We spoke in detail about the things that could make him come back to the Paris accord.”  The US is set to become one of only three sovereign nations in the world not to be part of the Paris accord, which aims to stem dangerous global warming. Of the other two, Nicaragua feels the agreement does not go far enough, and Syria is mired in a disastrous civil war. Branson said his companies would join the “We are still in” campaign – a coalition of hundreds of businesses, cities and universities committed to keeping to the US’s emissions reduction goals. Companies from Apple and Facebook to oil giants Exxon and BP urged Trump to stick with the Paris agreement, only for the president to fulfill his election pledge to jettison the pact. There’s no guarantee he’ll change his mind. Who knows what goes on in there. The Paris decision was a bizarre mistake “Trump had hundreds of the most influential business leaders in the world speaking to him and he ignored them, so there’s no guarantee that he’ll change his mind,” Branson said.  “Who knows what goes in there,” he added, pointing to his head. “The Paris decision was a bizarre mistake. “You have people in America who believe the world was made 5,000 years ago. There are some strange people out there who have got into heady positions in the American government. You have the strange position of a cabal of people with very influential positions in America making these decisions.” Branson admitted that he was unlikely to sway Trump, given his previous criticism of the president. In October, the British entrepreneur recalled a one-on-one lunch several years ago during which the future president explained how he was going to destroy five people who were unwilling to help him after one of his bankruptcies. Branson said the lunch was “bizarre” and showed Trump’s “vindictive streak”. However, he said he would advise Trump to drop his pro-fossil fuels stance and help transition coalminers into new work. “Coalmining is not the nicest of jobs,” Branson said, adding that in Britain miners have largely moved into jobs “far more pleasant, far less dangerous and far better for their health.  “I’d suggest that the government should help coalminers move into alternative jobs, such as clean energy. Clean energy needs hundreds of thousands of people. That would be good for the coalminers, good for America and good for the world. “Now is the time to get massive investments into alternative energies. The vast majority of governments in the world are all still going in the right direction and companies in America are stepping into the breach.” Branson was joined in a panel discussion by Andrew Liveris, chief executive of Dow Chemical and part of a group that advises the White House on manufacturing. Liveris said chemicals companies have moved on from “full frontal denial” of climate change and that businesses now grasp the seriousness of global warming. “We are leaving governments behind, it’s completely inverted,” he said. “I believe we will find a way back into Paris. That’s not coming from any deep knowledge, but because of the engagement on the issue.” Branson was in New York to promote DS Virgin Racing, which competes in the Formula E electric racing series. Another of his companies, Virgin Atlantic, is part of an airline industry responsible for around 5% of global carbon dioxide emissions. He said cleaner fuel and more efficient plane designs were getting “closer step by step”. “I was told 10 years ago it wasn’t possible to get across the Atlantic with a plane carrying a battery powered by clean energy before 2050, because of the weight of it and so on,” he said. “But the way things are moving, it’s quite possible that a battery driven plane could carry a plane full of passengers across the Atlantic by 2030. The airline industry could tick that box [on reducing emissions] before some other industries.”"
"Fears have been raised that the UK could soon see a repeat of the sort of flooding that has hit in recent years after forecasters predicted a one-in-three chance there would be a new record set for monthly rainfall during coming winters. The Met Office used a supercomputer to simulate possible extreme weather conditions to help build up a picture of what was likely to befall the UK. Forecasters found a 7% chance of a monthly rainfall record being set in the south-east. This rose to 34% once other regions of England and Wales were taken into account.  “Our analysis showed that these events could happen at any time and it’s likely we will see record monthly rainfall in one of our UK regions in the next few years,” said Dr Vikki Thompson, the lead author of a report published in the journal Nature Communications. Since the sort of extreme conditions being studied are relatively rare, the team needed more than the data they could get from observed records. Prof Adam Scaife, who leads this area of research at the Met Office, said a new supercomputer was used to simulate thousands of possible winters, “some of them much more extreme than we’ve yet witnessed. This gave many more extreme events than have happened in the real world, helping us work out how severe things could get.” The results demonstrated the likelihood of “one or more monthly regional rainfall record events” in a given winter, the Met Office said. It added that its method could also be “applied to assess other risks such as heatwaves, droughts, and cold spells and could help policymakers, contingency planners and insurers plan for future events”. Severe rainfall has caused widespread flooding in the UK in recent years; notably in the north-west of England in the winter of 2015-16 and in the south-east in 2013-14. Cleanup costs in the Thames Valley alone on that occasion were estimated to be more than £1bn.  Richard Allan, professor of climate science and joint head of the department of meteorology at the University of Reading, said exceptional seasonal rainfall in the UK was the result of a “perfect storm” of atmospheric influences. “Using serious number crunching power, the new study plays back thousands of possible weather patterns that emerge from detailed computer simulations of recent decades, some of which produce more extreme rainfall events than have actually been experienced to date. “The work complements evidence that warming of climate is already causing extreme rainfall events to intensify. “As the planet continues to warm due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, extra moisture in the air will fuel increasingly intense rainfall causing a continued rise in the risk of damaging events into the future.” His colleague, Prof Len Shaffrey, from the university’s National Centre for Atmospheric Science, added: “Using weather and climate models to better understand the probability of extreme weather is an important method that is becoming more widely used to help inform those dealing with weather impacts about the risks of extreme events.  “Future research needs to evaluate how well weather and climate models are able to accurately simulate other extreme weather events, for example droughts and heatwaves, if we want to use models to better understand extreme weather risks and how they might be changing.”"
"Michael Gove has said he “deeply regrets” Donald Trump’s approach to the Paris agreement on climate change and hopes the president will have a change of heart, in his first speech since returning to the cabinet. The environment secretary said international cooperation was crucial to resolve the problem of climate change, adding: “The world’s second-biggest generator of carbon emissions can’t simply walk out of the room when the heat is on.”   Gove also said the government was not prepared to compromise on environmental standards, sustainability or animal welfare to secure a trade deal.  Instead, Britain would compete on quality and not take part in a “race to the bottom” to win new trading relationships, he said. “Of course it’s important we explore new trading opportunities, with the United States and other nations across the world but it must not be, and the cabinet is agreed on this, at the risk of dropping any environmental standards whatsoever.” Organisations such as Friends of the Earth have previously warned of the dangers of pursuing a speedy trade deal with the US based on unacceptable compromises, when the US has long pushed a general dilution of health and environment regulation. Hormone-treated beef and poultry processed with chlorine are two common symbols used by activists of of lower US food safety standards.  In the speech at the WWF, Gove also pledged to deliver a “green Brexit”, although critics have pointed out that the Queen’s speech contained no planned environmental legislation. He also said farmers must prove they deserve future subsidies after the UK leaves the European Union. Gove described himself as an environmentalist in his speech in Woking, Surrey, on Friday morning. “Leaving the EU gives us a once in a lifetime opportunity to reform how we care for our land, our rivers and our seas, how we recast our ambition for our country’s environment, and the planet. In short, it means delivering a green Brexit.” In the speech, he criticised the common agricultural policy, which “puts resources in the hands of the already wealthy, and encourages patterns of land use which are wasteful of natural resources”. The government has promised to keep overall subsidies to farmers at the same level until 2022, but Gove said the subsidies would have to be earned. “There are very good reasons why we should provide support for agriculture,” he said. “Seventy per cent of our land is farmed – beautiful landscape has not happened by accident but has been actively managed.” However, Gove also said subsidies must benefit the environment: “I want to ensure we go on generously supporting farmers for many more years to come. But that support can only be argued for against other competing public goods if the environmental benefits of that spending are clear.” Stewart Stevenson, an MSP for the Scottish National party and a member of Holyrood’s rural economy committee, said the speech was “an unambiguous Tory threat to continued agricultural support funding after 2022 – that is the stark post-Brexit reality which the UK government is now proposing for our rural communities”. Gove also laid down a marker for his views on climate change. “We’ve seen climate change threaten both fragile natural habitats and developing human societies, we’ve allowed extractive and exploitative political systems to lay waste to natural resources and we’ve placed species of plants and animals in new and mortal danger while gambling with the future health of the whole world.” “I am an environmentalist first because I care about the fate of fellow animals, I draw inspiration from nature and I believe we need beauty in our lives as much as we need food and shelter.” Gove also confirmed the government would push ahead on its planned ban on plastic microbeads in beauty products by the end of the year. Last year the government launched a consultation on banning microbeads in personal care products such as exfoliators and body scrubs, which Gove said had “a devastating effect on marine life”. About eight million tonnes of plastic are discarded into the world’s oceans every year and Gove said the microbead ban would be an important step. “We are responding to that consultation today and we will introduce legislation to implement that ban later this year,” he said.  Gove, a prominent Brexiter, said he could understand why leaving the EU could be “a moment of profound concern” but said Brexit was not an opportunity to water-down environmental standards. “I have no intention of weakening the environmental protections we have put in place while in the EU,” he said. Caroline Lucas, the Green party co-leader, expressed scepticism about Gove’s environmentalist credentials. “Gove’s overture to the environment might make him sound like a keen defender of nature but his government’s actions suggest that protecting our natural world is a long way from the top of their priority list,” she said. “There is an environment-shaped hole in the government’s Brexit plans. They failed to announce any kind of environmental protection bill in the Queen’s speech, and we still don’t know how they will transfer enforcement powers from EU institutions to the UK.”"
"Shipping companies are under pressure to phase out use of heavy fuels ahead of a potential ban on their use in the Arctic in the coming years.  The International Maritime Organisation has approved an environmental review of the use of heavy fuel oil (HFO) by ships in the Arctic. Already banned in Antarctica, HFO is a dense and viscous byproduct of other fuel refining processes.   Oil spills or leaks would be severely toxic, and devastating to flora, fauna and indigenous communities because of the long time the sludge takes to break down in cold water. The risks to fragile Arctic ecosystems could soar as more polar sea lanes become accessible because of climate change.  A Canadian proposal unanimously adopted at the IMO’s marine environmental protection committee last Friday mandates a review of mitigating measures for HFO use, to begin in April 2018. No calls for a ban on HFOs have been formally put on the agenda but “at this early stage, nothing can be ruled in or out,” an IMO spokesperson said. “I’m fairly sure a ban will happen one day,” said Peter Hinchliffe, the secretary-general of the International Chamber of Shipping told the Guardian. “We won’t be opposing it but our role [in the IMO] is to make sure we are not causing a disproportionate disadvantage to ships that use HFOs in the Arctic today.” More than 850 ships operating in the Arctic today are thought to use HFOs, said Dr Sian Prior, lead advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance, and these represent around three-quarters of total Arctic ship fuel use. The majority are flagged to non-Arctic nations such as Panama, Liberia, Singapore and the Marshall Islands. But as global warming melts new shipping lanes, even larger ships from outside the Arctic are expected to steer through the Polar north in search of shorter journey times, increasing the risk of accidents. In March, Arctic sea ice extent fell to its lowest recorded level since records began 38 years ago. The shipping industry has already agreed to cut the sulphur content of marine fuels to 0.5% by 2020. “It will be extremely difficult to get HFOs with sulphur content as low as 0.5%. Most ships will turn to lighter fuels – diesel essentially – and that means that imposing an Arctic ban on HFOs may have a very limited life as few ships are likely to go there burning HFOs,” said Hinchliffe. Rune Thomas Ege, a spokesman for the Norwegian expedition tour operator, Hurtigruten, said that the new Arctic waterways opening up were pulling in inexperienced crews in unsuitable ships, and stoking concerns.  “HFOs should already have been banned in the Arctic – as they has been in Antarctica,” he said.   Next year, Hurtigruten says it will launch the world’s first hybrid battery-powered cruise ship, the MS Roald Amundsen, to be followed by the MS Fridtjof Nansen in 2019.  Hinchliffe said while the idea of battery-powered fleets was “not pie in the sky”, it would be inappropriate for tankers needing to travel thousands of miles. Other alternatives were in the works, he suggested.   “We don’t yet have a hydrogen-powered ship but I expect experimentation to take place,” he said. “Our holy grail is to find a carbon-free fuel but there isn’t one at the moment. I would hope that by 2030 we will have a very clear indication of what the fuel is likely to be.” Aslak Ross, the head of marine standards at Maersk Line, told the Guardian that fuels which were both low-sulphur and low-carbon could enter the world market “sooner than many expect”. “This is one of the reasons we have decided not to invest in ‘scrubbers’, not least due to their negative impact on the vessel’s energy efficiency,” he said. Scrubbing technology allows ships to chemically filter and cleanse their existing HFO blends and avoid the trouble and expense of switching to lighter distillate fuels such as diesel, liquefied natural gas or, potentially, ethanol.  But scrubbers are seen as impractical by industry analysts because they cost $3-5m to fit per vessel, and a lack of shipyards would prevent a retrofit taking place among the world’s fleet by 2020, when the new sulphur standard takes effect. Many environmentalists and shipowners alike see scrubbers as a way of ensuring the survival of highly polluting fuels at a time when rapid transition is needed. More than 200 LNG-fuelled ships are in service around the world."
"When Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate deal, the world reacted with outrage. And rightly so: the agreement represents a remarkable achievement in international diplomacy – a breakthrough after 20 years of failed climate negotiations. But as we rally to defend the Paris deal against the onslaught of an ill-informed bully, we need to resist the temptation to cast the agreement as some kind of saviour. It is not. Its purpose is right and noble, but its substance is nothing short of dangerous. If you look closely at the Paris agreement, you’ll notice a curious contradiction. The text commits the world’s governments to limiting global warming to no more than 2C above preindustrial levels. But, strangely enough, the emissions reductions it lays out don’t actually get us there. Far from it. Even if all the world’s countries meet their targets (which is very unlikely, since the targets are non-binding) if we do nothing else we’ll still be hurtling toward more than 3C of global warming, and possibly as high as 4.4C. Way over the threshold.   What might our planet look like if it warms by 4C? No one can say for certain, but projections show that this level of warming is likely to bring about heatwaves not seen on Earth for 5m years. Southern Europe could dry up into a desert. Sea levels could rise by 1.2 meters before the century is out, drowning cities like Amsterdam and New York. Furthermore, 40% of species will be at risk of extinction. Most of our rainforests will wither away. Crop yields could collapse by 35%, destabilising the world’s food system and triggering widespread famine. In short, a 4C world looks very bleak indeed. So why is nobody sounding the alarm about this? Why is nobody freaking out? The Paris agreement assures us that everything will be OK. But scientists are not so convinced.  Here’s the backstory. The Paris agreement relies on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Over the past couple of decades, the IPCC has been busy devising hundreds of different scenarios, or “pathways”, for how much we need to cut our emissions if we want a decent chance of averting catastrophic climate change. But as they were running the numbers, they stumbled upon a rather inconvenient fact. The necessary emissions reductions turn out to be so steep that getting there requires that we slow down and gradually reverse the pace of economic growth. This conclusion did not go down well with politicians and industry bosses, and everyone knew it would be a tough sell in international negotiations. So the IPCC fudged it and began devising pathways that relied on the assumption that sometime in the near future – by around 2020 – we will have “negative emissions technologies” up and running, which will pull carbon out of the atmosphere.  Speculating on the hope of future technology, suddenly the IPCC was assuring us that we can get by with much more relaxed emissions reductions. We can keep our existing economic model intact, it said – and rich countries can maintain their high levels of consumption – so long as we can figure out a way to pull carbon out of the atmosphere.  There are lots of ideas out there for how to do this, like seeding the soil with pulverised rocks, or pouring iron into the ocean to stimulate plankton growth (now discredited). But the IPCC relies on one in particular, which it considers the most promising. It’s called Beccs, which stands for “bio-energy with carbon capture and storage”. Basically, the idea is to develop enormous tree plantations that will suck carbon out of the atmosphere. Then we harvest them, turn them into pellets and ship them around the world to power stations to be burned for energy, capturing the carbon emissions and storing the gases deep under the ground, where they won’t have any impact on the climate. Voila – an energy system that pulls CO2 out of the sky. What’s not to love? Beccs features in more than 80% of the IPCC pathways, which means it sits at the very centre of the Paris agreement – even though it is not mentioned in the text. But there is a growing consensus among scientists that Beccs won’t work. The technology has never been proven at scale, and there’s no way it will appear in time to save us. Even if it did, it would require that we create plantations equivalent to three times the size of India, which would eat up one-third of the planet’s arable land, according to Kevin Anderson, deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. This would make it impossible for us to feed the world’s population. And transforming that much land into bio-energy monoculture would trigger ecosystem collapse that could be disastrous for all of us.  In other words, Beccs is simply not feasible. The Paris text could have been honest about its reliance on Beccs, giving us all a chance to scrutinise the plan and push for a better one. Instead we’ve been left hanging our collective future on a myth. If we accept that Beccs won’t save us, we have to face up to some difficult truths. For one, we need to commit to much more aggressive emissions reductions. Anderson argues that to have a 50% chance of keeping below 2C, industrialised countries will have to cut emissions by 8-10% per year (beginning in 2015) until net zero in 2050. That might sound easy on paper, but it’s remarkably difficult. Even if we throw everything we have into efficiency improvements and renewable energy technologies, they will help us reduce emissions by at most 4% per year.  So how do we bridge the rest of the gap? Well, industrialised countries will have no choice but to downscale their economic activity by 4-6% per year. And poor countries are going to have to follow suit after 2025, downscaling by about 3% per year.  In other words, the climate science recognises a clear de-growth imperative. De-growth might sound scary, but it’s really not. All it means is easing the intensity of our economy, cutting the excesses of the very richest, sharing what we have instead of plundering the Earth for more, and liberating ourselves from the frenetic consumerism that we all know does nothing to improve our wellbeing or happiness.  Scholars are already busy sketching out how this might work, but one thing is for sure: it won’t look anything like global capitalism as it exists today. And that’s OK – evolution is good. After all, no one says “this is the best novel or sculpture or smartphone ever and will never be surpassed”. So why be timid about imagining our way beyond capitalism?  We face a stark choice: either we act now, right-sizing our economy and managing the transition in a careful and controlled way, or climate change will do it for us. If we wait for the latter option it will be unimaginably destructive and chaotic. According to Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, 4C of global warming will cost us at least 5% of global GDP per year indefinitely, and possibly as much as 20% – economic crisis on a scale never seen before. This should shock us out of our climate complacency. The Paris agreement is a step in the right direction, but it needs to be much stronger. We need a deal that locks down ambitious emissions reductions – without fear of offending the powers that be – by pointing us in the direction of a new and better economy. Our future depends on it."

"Under President Donald Trump’s leadership, the United States took another major step toward establishing itself as a rogue state on 1 June, when it withdrew from the Paris climate agreement. For years, Trump has indulged the strange conspiracy theory that, as he put it in 2012: “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.” But this was not the reason Trump advanced for withdrawing the US from the Paris accord. Rather, the agreement, he alleged, was bad for the US and implicitly unfair to it. While fairness, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder, Trump’s claim is difficult to justify. On the contrary, the Paris accord is very good for America, and it is the US that continues to impose an unfair burden on others. Historically, the US has added disproportionately to the rising concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and among large countries it remains the biggest per capita emitter of carbon dioxide by far – more than twice China’s rate and nearly 2.5 times more than Europe in 2013 (the latest year for which the World Bank has reported complete data). With its high income, the US is in a far better position to adapt to the challenges of climate change than poor countries such as India and China, let alone a low-income country in Africa. In fact, the major flaw in Trump’s reasoning is that combating climate change would strengthen the US, not weaken it. Trump is looking towards the past – a past that, ironically, was not that great. His promise to restore coal-mining jobs (which now number 51,000, less than 0.04% of the country’s non-farm employment) overlooks the harsh conditions and health risks endemic in that industry, not to mention the technological advances that would continue to reduce employment in the industry even if coal production were revived. In fact, far more jobs are being created in solar panel installation than are being lost in coal. More generally, moving to a green economy would increase US income today and economic growth in the future. In this, as in so many things, Trump is hopelessly mired in the past. Just a few weeks before Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris accord, the global High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices, which I co-chaired with Nicholas Stern, highlighted the potential of a green transition. The commission’s report, released at the end of May, argues that reducing CO2emissions could result in an even stronger economy. The logic is straightforward. A key problem holding back the global economy today is deficient aggregate demand. At the same time, many governments face revenue shortfalls. But we can address both issues simultaneously and reduce emissions by imposing a charge (a tax) for CO2emissions. It is always better to tax bad things than good things. By taxing CO2, firms and households would have an incentive to retrofit for the world of the future. The tax would also provide firms with incentives to innovate in ways that reduce energy usage and emissions – giving them a dynamic competitive advantage. The commission analysed the level of carbon price that would be required to achieve the goals set forth in the Paris climate agreement – a far higher price than in most of Europe today, but still manageable. The commissioners pointed out that the appropriate price may differ across countries. In particular, they noted, a better regulatory system – one that restrains coal-fired power generation, for example – reduces the burden that must be placed on the tax system. Interestingly, one of the world’s best-performing economies, Sweden, has already adopted a carbon tax at a rate substantially higher than that discussed in our report. And the Swedes have simultaneously sustained their strong growth without US-level emissions. America under Trump has gone from being a world leader to an object of derision. In the aftermath of Trump’s withdrawal of the US from the Paris accord, a large sign was hung over Rome’s city hall: “The Planet First.” Likewise, France’s new president, Emmanuel Macron, poked fun at Trump’s campaign slogan, declaring: “Make Our Planet Great Again.” But the consequences of Trump’s actions are no laughing matter. If the US continues to emit as it has, it will continue to impose enormous costs on the rest of the world, including on much poorer countries. Those who are being harmed by America’s recklessness are justifiably angry. Fortunately, large parts of the US, including the most economically dynamic regions, have shown that Trump is, if not irrelevant, at least less relevant than he would like to believe. Large numbers of states and corporations have announced that they will proceed with their commitments – and perhaps go even further, offsetting the failures of other parts of the US. In the meantime, the world must protect itself against rogue states. Climate change poses an existential threat to the planet that is no less dire than that posed by North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. In both cases, the world cannot escape the inevitable question: what is to be done about countries that refuse to do their part in preserving our planet?"

"Rising temperatures are making it too hot for African wild dogs to hunt and the number of their pups that survive is plummeting, according to a new study. The research is among the first to show a direct impact of increased heat on wildlife that appears well adapted to high temperatures.  There are only 7,000 African wild dogs left in the wild and they have lost 93% of their historic ranges to humans. Research earlier in July suggested that a “biological annihilation” of wildlife in recent decades means a sixth mass extinction in Earth’s history is already under way.  African wild dogs leave their young pups in dens when they set off for their early morning and late evening hunts, avoiding the worst heat of the day. The scientists found rising peak daily temperatures in Kenya, Zimbabwe and Botswana cut the time the dogs were active and the survival of the pups. In Botswana, where the team had the longest records, they found the average number of pups surviving to a year old in each litter fell from 5.1 between 1989-2000 to 3.3 between 2001-2012, with temperatures rising 1.1C between the two periods. In Kenya, a 1C rise in the peak temperature cut yearlings by 31% and in Zimbabwe 14%, “When people think about climate change affecting wildlife, they mostly think about polar bears,” said Prof Rosie Woodroffe, at the Zoological Society of London and who led the new research published in the Journal of Animal Ecology. “But wild dogs are adapted to the heat – surely they’d be fine? So it is shocking and surprising that even right on the equator these effects are being seen. It illustrates the global impact of climate change.” African wild dogs need large hunting ranges to survive, about 800 km squared for the average pack of nine, equivalent to the area of New York City. But the projected rises in maximum daily temperatures due to global warming are ominous, said Woodroffe: “It’s really scary. It is possible that some of these big areas will become too hot for wild dogs to exist.” The dogs’ highly energetic lifestyles makes them susceptible to losses of food when it is too hot to hunt antelopes. “Wild dogs live fast and die young,” said Woodroffe. “They have these huge litters [of up to 14 pups] and then the mortality is quite high. “If you are an animal who makes your living by running around really fast, obviously you are going to get hot. But there are not enough hours in the day any more that are cool enough to do that. This is something which is genuinely suppressing population size.” Other new research also warns of the consequences of global warming for animals normally tolerant of heat. Aardvarks in the Kalahari desert, usually nocturnal and burrowing animals, died of starvation during a particularly arid spell, with scientists concluding: “With climate change predicted to increase the frequency and duration of droughts, aardvarks may be [eliminated] from much of their current range.” Another new study has shown that the African wild dog is far from alone in losing more than 90% of their historic ranges. The Ethiopian wolf, red wolf, tiger, lion and cheetah have all suffered the same fate, with scientists saying reintroductions are essential to ensure their survival."
"Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt wants to hold televised ‘Red Team/Blue Team’ climate science ‘debates.’ The idea is that a ‘Red Team’ of scientists will challenge the mainstream findings of ‘Blue Team’ scientists. That may sound familiar, because it’s exactly how the peer-review process works. But climate deniers have lost the debate in the peer-reviewed literature, with over 97% of peer-reviewed studies endorsing the consensus on human-caused global warming, and the few contrarian papers being flawed and failing to withstand scientific scrutiny.  So Scott Pruitt is trying to put his thumb on the scale, giving the less than 3% of contrarian scientists equal footing on a ‘Red Team.’ John Oliver showed how to do a statistically representative televised climate debate (so brilliantly that it’s been viewed 7.4m times), but it’s probably not what Pruitt had in mind:  Climate ‘Red Teams’ are a concept that the fossil fuel-funded Heritage Foundation tried four years ago, calling its 2013 ‘NIPCC report’ part of the group’s “Red Team mission.” But much like climate contrarian research papers, the NIPCC report was riddled with errors and long-debunked myths. The name also evokes images of the red and blue pills in The Matrix, in which characters could choose to remain in the Matrix (denial) by taking the blue pill, or accept reality with the red pill. In this case the colors are reversed, but the concept is the same – by choosing the red team, Pruitt and company are choosing the soothing comfort of denial over the harsh reality of human-caused climate change and the threats it poses. Fortunately, it seems like a growing number of Republican leaders are choosing the red pill. In April, Trump’s energy secretary Rick Perry ordered a 60-day study of the nation’s electric grid to determine whether policies promoting renewable energy growth are undermining its stability by crowding out “baseload” power from sources that are always readily available (ie don’t rely on intermittent wind or sunlight). Perry’s memo specifically called out “regulatory burdens introduced by previous administrations that were designed to decrease coal-fired power generation.” He put Travis Fisher in charge of the study, who previously worked for the fossil fuel-funded Institute for Energy Research, where he published a report calling renewable energy policies “the single greatest emerging threat” to the US power grid. In short, it appeared as though the Trump administration was putting together a biased report to support its pro-coal agenda. But a draft of the report was leaked to Bloomberg, and it didn’t follow the administration playbook. The report was drafted by career staffers at the Department of Energy, who are experts in the field and apparently didn’t bow to any potential administration pressure for pro-fossil fuel conclusions. The draft is now under review by administration officials and may change as a result, but the leaked draft ensures that the public sees the experts’ conclusions. The report concluded that many recent baseload plant retirements “are consistent with observed market forces,” often being taken out of commission due to “low natural gas price-based electricity prices, low electric demand, environmental regulations, state policies, and competition from renewables”. Most of the coal and natural gas baseload plants that have retired are old, inefficient units that were no longer cost-effective. Increased energy efficiency has also curbed American electricity demand. The report concluded that environmental regulations and renewable energy subsidies “played minor roles” in accelerating baseload plant retirements compared to those other factors. Most importantly, the draft report concluded that the electric grid remains reliable: Most of the common metrics for grid reliability suggest that the grid is in good shape despite the retirement of many baseload power plants … The power system is more reliable today due to better planning, market discipline, and better operating rules and standards These conclusions are consistent with the opinions of grid operators – including in red states where wind supplies a significant fraction of electricity (including Perry’s home state of Texas) – that renewables are not undermining grid stability. They’re also consistent with a major Department of Energy-funded two-year study published in 2012, which concluded: renewable electricity generation from technologies that are commercially available today, in combination with a more flexible electric system, is more than adequate to supply 80% of total U.S. electricity generation in 2050 while meeting electricity demand on an hourly basis in every region of the United States It’s unclear why Perry thought his 60-day study would overturn the findings of that two-year report, or many other similar studies. Even some Republicans from states that benefit from cheap wind energy were critical of the report. For example, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) wrote to Perry: I’m concerned that a hastily developed study, which appears to pre-determine that variable, renewable sources such as wind have undermined grid reliability, will not be viewed as credible, relevant or worthy of valuable taxpayer resources In another positive sign that Republican climate denial is cracking, an amendment to cut Department of Defense (DoD) funding for a study on how climate change will impact national security over the next 20 years was defeated by a vote of 185-234, including 46 Republicans (led by 22 of the 24 Republican members of the Climate Solutions Caucus) voting against the amendment. The US military has long recognized the national security threats posed by climate change. Normally the GOP views itself as the more pro-military party, but on climate change they’ve resisted the DoD’s findings. While three-quarters of House Republicans voted in favor of the amendment, a significant fraction bucked the climate denial establishment, in this case opting to take the red pill. It may seem like a minor event, but any cracks in the wall of GOP climate denial represent important progress. Perhaps the party needs its own version of Neo to accelerate the process."

"In the United States, people who refuse to accept even some of the basic tenets of climate science are calling for a heated debate. “Who better to do that than a group of scientists … getting together and having a robust discussion for all the world to see,” the boss of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, told Reuters.   And, of course, Pruitt thinks it should be on the telly. “You want this to be on full display,” he said. “I think the American people would be very interested in consuming that. I think they deserve it.” That’s right. Pruitt’s respect for climate science would see it reduced to a bastard TV love child of Jerry Springer and Judge Judy.  Pruitt has been pushing around an idea that has been the wet dream of fossil-fuel funded climate science deniers  for years now and it is this: there should be a “red team, blue team” process established on the fundamentals of climate change, from its causes to how bad it will be. In a world that doesn’t have a former reality television star and real estate tycoon as the US president, this process already exists – it’s called the scientific method. The clearest demonstration of the “red team, blue team” method is in the process of peer review.  To borrow from Winston Churchill’s commentary on democracy, no one pretends that peer review is “perfect or all-wise”, it just happens to be better than all the other ways of deciding what the facts are.  What Pruitt and his supporters are envisaging has echoes of the 1925 Scopes monkey trial. Then the state of Tennessee prosecuted a high school teacher, John Scopes, for teaching evolution (they had motion-picture cameras for that spectacle, too).  In Pruitt’s incarnation of the Scopes trial, one team would have scientists representing the central positions of all respected scientific institutions around the world. The other would have a thin sliver of contrarians. To the viewing public, the impression would be that there is some sort of even split among scientists about the fundamentals of climate change. It would be a test of debating techniques and communication skills, not a test of the evidence. The reality, of course, is that multiple studies have shown that somewhere between 90% and 100% of climate scientists agree on the fundamental points. If you ask Americans what percentage of scientists agrees that humans are the main cause of climate change, about seven out of eight underestimate the number (more than one in five Americans think most climate scientists do not think humans are the main cause – but it’s not clear how many of those watch Judge Judy).  One of those people responsible for confusing the US public on climate change is Marc Morano – the head of communications for the so-called “thinktank” the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow – and he’s now touring Australia. And while Morano wants people to keep thinking there’s a real debate about the basic causes of climate change (it’s his job to keep that debate going), there’s a real and worthwhile conversation going on at the more factual end of the spectrum. This is a conversation not about whether human-caused climate change is real or risky (yes and yes is the overwhelming consensus on that) but rather just how bad on the catastrophe-scale things could actually get.  In a much-read New York magazine cover story, the journalist David Wallace-Wells chooses to paint the bleakest of pictures. The story’s title “The Uninhabitable Earth” is like one big spoiler alert.  Writes Wallace-Wells:  What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen — that will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of human response. Instead, it is a portrait of our best understanding of where the planet is heading absent aggressive action. It is unlikely that all of these warming scenarios will be fully realized, largely because the devastation along the way will shake our complacency. But those scenarios, and not the present climate, are the baseline. In fact, they are our schedule. So in a world that does next to nothing to cut greenhouse gas emissions (an important caveat that you need to constantly remind yourself of as you read through the 7,200-word piece), Wallace-Wells looks around for climate studies that together paint a truly dystopian future.  He brings us unbreathable air, heat incompatible with human existence, submerged mega-cities, wars, famine and economic collapse.  He’s been getting a bit of pushback, with scientists including professors  Michael Mann and Andrew Dessler accusing Wallace-Wells of some inaccuracies.  Mann and others say this sort of doomsday styling could lead people to a sense of defeatism and pessimism that’s not reflected in what’s possible.  The veteran climate writer Dave Roberts argues the inaccuracies are very few indeed (he only really counts two among the scores of points made) but says if the article induces fear then this is in any case a key emotion that people need in order to act. As others have pointed out, it should not be the job of journalists to ignore or underplay aspects of climate change just because it might suck the living hope out of readers.  In reality, the fat end of the risk profile from climate change – where things go really bad – is really very fat indeed.  Take as just a small sampling the prospective loss of functional reef systems that feed hundreds of millions of people, or the trillions of dollars of infrastructure and buildings on flood-risk coastlines, or the disruption of food supplies, or the mass diasporas it could set in train as rising sea levels swallow people’s homelands and their collective history. If that leaves you cold, then there’s always coffee, chocolate and mass extinctions.  No wonder military leaders are so worried about it. Maybe they drink lots of coffee? At Mashable, Andrew Freedman writes that: “In more than a decade of reporting on climate science and policy, I have yet to meet a pessimistic climate scientist.” Well, I’ve also had about a decade in climate reporting and my experience is a little different. Many exhibit plenty of pessimism, and they do it often. In Australia, we’ve gone backwards. More than a quarter of a century ago, a prime minister wanted a target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by the year 2005. But those same climate scientists have bits of hope too. The two things can exist at the same time.  Last night the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, gave a lecture at the University of Queensland.  ""#Climate change is the number one threat to the reef"" but India needs our coal, says @JoshFrydenberg pic.twitter.com/P5Jx5uBGfw His speech dazzled with statistics and pragmatism about “solutions” that might aid his ministry’s “trilemma” of delivering energy security, affordable power and a transition to a lower emissions future while still being able to push the country to be the world’s biggest exporter of coal and gas.  There was a “crisis” in our energy markets, Frydenberg said. But he said almost nothing about the other “crisis” – the climate crisis. A questioner from the back asked that, given future prospects for the world were so dire, did his department have any plans to review potential geoengineering responses to climate change.  The response was that Frydenberg would be “interested to hear more”, as if it were an issue he hadn’t thought much about.  It was an answer that demonstrated the gulf between what a politician thinks is a crisis and what actually is one. And, yes, it’s OK to say things could get really bad."
"Last month Donald Trump announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. For his supporters, it provided evidence, at last, that the president is a man of his word. He may not have kept many campaign promises, but he kept this one. For his numerous critics it is just another sign of how little Trump cares about evidence of any kind. His decision to junk the Paris accord confirms Trump as the poster politician for the “post-truth” age. But this is not just about Trump. The motley array of candidates who ran for the Republican presidential nomination was divided on many things, but not on climate change. None of them was willing to take the issue seriously. In a bitterly contentious election, it was a rare instance of unanimity. The consensus that climate is a non-subject was shared by all the candidates who appeared in the first major Republican debate in August 2015 – Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, John Kasich, Mike Huckabee and Trump. Republican voters were offered 10 shades of denialism.  As Huckabee quipped in January 2015, any talk of global warming was a distraction from the real dangers the country faced: “A beheading is a far greater threat to an American than a sunburn.” Trump’s remarks on climate may have more been erratic (“I want to use hairspray!” he said at one point, confusing global warming with the hole in the ozone layer) but their consistent theme was that manmade climate change is a “hoax”, perpetrated by the enemies of the US, who may or may not include China. Climate science has become a red rag to the political right. The scientific consensus is clear: more than 95% of climate researchers agree that human activity is causing global warming, and that without action to combat it we are on a path to dangerous temperature rises from pre-industrial levels. But the mere existence of this consensus gets taken by its political opponents as a priori evidence of a stitch-up. Why else would scientists and left-leaning politicians be agreeing with each other all the time if they weren’t scratching each others’ backs? Knowledge is easily turned into “elite” knowledge, which is tantamount to privileged snobs telling ordinary people what to think. Trump’s stance reflects the mutual intolerance that now exists between those promoting the scientific consensus and those for whom the consensus is just another political racket. Trump didn’t create this division. He is simply exploiting it. It is tempting for anyone on the scientific side of the divide to want to apportion all the blame to the “alt-facts” crowd, who see elite conspiracies everywhere. But there is more going on here than dumb politics versus smart science. The facts are not just the innocent victims of politics. The facts have long been put in the service of politics, which is what fuels the suspicions of those who wish to deny them. The politicisation can cut both ways. The politics of climate change poses a stark dilemma for anyone wanting to push back against the purveyors of post-truth. Should they bide their time and trust that the facts will win out in the end? Or do they use the evidence as weapons in the political fight, in which case they risk confirming the suspicion that they have gone beyond the facts? It is not just climate scientists who find themselves in this bind. Economists making the case against Brexit found that the more they insisted on agreement inside the profession about the dangers, the more it was viewed with suspicion from the outside by people who regarded it as a political con. Post-truth politics also poses a problem for scepticism. A healthy democracy needs to leave plenty of room for doubt. There are lots of good reasons to be doubtful about what the reality of climate change will entail: though there is scientific agreement about the fact of global warming and its source in human activity, the ultimate risks are very uncertain and so are the long-term consequences. There is plenty of scope for disagreement about the most effective next steps. The existence of a very strong scientific consensus does not mean there should be a consensus about the correct political response. But the fact of the scientific consensus has produced an equal and opposite reaction that squeezes the room for reasonable doubt. The certainty among the scientists has engendered the most intolerant kind of scepticism among the doubters. Not all climate sceptics are part of the “alt-right”. But everyone in the alt-right is now a climate sceptic. That’s what makes the politics so toxic. It means that climate scepticism is being driven out by climate cynicism. A sceptic questions the evidence for a given claim and asks whether it is believable. A cynic questions the motives of the people who deploy the evidence, regardless of whether it is believable or not. Any attempt to defend the facts gets presented as evidence that the facts simply suit the interests of the people peddling them. Climate change is the defining political issue of our times and not simply because of the risks we run if we get it wrong. An inadequate response – if we do too little, too late – could inflict untold damage on the habitable environment. But even before that day comes, the contest over the truth about climate change is doing serious damage to our democracy. The fight over climate reveals how easily politics can get in the way of the facts, and how hard it can be to escape once cynicism exerts its grip. In many ways, climate science is particularly vulnerable to political distortion. But the issue of climate change also shows that it is a false comfort for liberal elites to think that the facts will win in the end. If they do, it won’t be because we woke up to the science. It will be because we woke up to the politics. Climate science has not always been so political. The idea that manmade carbon emissions are contributing to significant changes in the climate first came to public notice in the 1960s and 1970s. But attention to the issue was not primarily driven by politics, despite an attempt by Richard Nixon when president to push for more research into the issue. Most of the early consciousness-raising came from journalists. In 1975, Newsweek made a splash with the claim that the science of climate change was pointing to the imminent threat of global cooling. This warning gained notoriety but little political traction, at a time when the dangers of nuclear war and the economic consequences of the oil crisis crowded out other forms of apocalypse. The political consequences had to wait decades to be felt. Many of the recent Republican presidential candidates cited over-the-top scare stories about global cooling from their childhood as a reason to discount scare stories about global warming today. What politicised the idea of climate change was its adoption as a cause by Democratic politicians in the 1980s, above all by Al Gore. By the start of that decade, evidence of global cooling had faded and a scientific consensus was starting to form around the idea that the climate was warming up. Gore belonged to a group known as the “Atari Democrats”, for their wonkish attachment to science and technology. These politicians saw climate as a useful issue, as well as an urgent one. It was a way of appealing to moderate Republican voters, because the concerns it raised cut across party lines. In the words of another member of the group, Chuck Schumer, then a Brooklyn congressman, now Senate minority leader: “If you’re a Democrat, especially in a middle-class district or on the west coast, [climate] is a great issue … It is an issue with no downside.” The ecumenical quality of climate change as a political cause was emphasised when Margaret Thatcher took it up at around the same time. In her speech to the UN general assembly in 1989, she spoke of global warming as one of the most serious threats facing humanity. She was comfortable speaking the language of science, having been a scientist herself. But her motives were political: it suited her prior point of view. She drew extensively from the warnings of the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, in part because she had grown to trust their advice on climatic conditions during the Falklands war. She believed in nuclear power as an emblem of free enterprise. And she had historic reasons to be suspicious of coal. For Thatcher, climate change was a convenient truth. But no issue, once politicised, remains ecumenical for long. In 1989 Thatcher’s time was nearly up. Gore’s was just beginning. Through the 1990s and 2000s, as climate change became associated with left or liberal policy positions, it started to receive serious pushback from the right, for whom the political motivations of those championing the science were obvious. Climate change was seen as a vehicle for promoting big government and higher taxes. It became a totem of the partisan divide. This was the beginning of a vicious circle of mutual distrust. Once science gets dragged into the territory of politics, its opponents can accuse it of being a distortion of science. Scientists are meant to be politically neutral, at least as far as their science is concerned. Yet it is almost impossible to remain neutral when you are under political assault. In these politically charged circumstances, there is no safe space for the facts to retreat to. That was made clear by the so-called “climategate” scandal of 2009, when a series of hacked emails from the University of East Anglia was held up as evidence that the scientific evidence was being distorted to fit a political agenda. The emails showed no such thing. What they did reveal is that in an environment of highly politicised scepticism, climate scientists were forced to think about guarding the evidence against opponents looking for any excuse to discredit it. In private correspondence, the UEA scientists talked about presentational “tricks” for describing the data and the need to favour certain outlets for publication over others. They looked out for their friends and they were wary of their enemies: that’s politics. There was nothing wrong with the science, as was confirmed by an extensive series of inquiries into the affair. But the emails betrayed the scientists’ awareness that the idea of a consensus on manmade climate change was under concerted attack. So they went out of their way to shore up the consensus. Which, when revealed, confirmed to their opponents that the consensus was a sham. This is how climate scepticism becomes climate cynicism: doubts about the evidence are replaced by doubts about the motives of the people using it. In 2012, Senator Jim Inhofe, a Republican who once brought a snowball on to the floor of the senate to show that climate change wasn’t real, published The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future. The book contains two lengthy appendices. The first is the full transcript of the UEA emails, presented as prima facie evidence that the science is a fix. The second is a history of the United Nations global development programme. The argument goes like this: there is no need for world government unless there are issues that can’t be solved by national governments. Climate change is such an issue. So it follows that it has been invented by people who can’t justify world government any other way. It is a globalist plot. Once cynicism becomes the default mode of attack, then both sides are trapped. Moreover, it is not a level playing field. It favours the cynics. Scientists have to decide whether to let the facts speak for themselves, or whether to try to take on the cynics at their own game. If they pull back from politics, they risk letting the cynics set the agenda. If they don’t, they risk proving the cynics right. Cynicism is fuelled by the ease with which uncertainty about the science can be spread. All it takes is time and money. Questioning climate science suits the interests of the fossil fuel industry, where the politics of climate change has long been seen to pose a direct threat. Ever since climate became a political issue in the 1980s, the big oil companies have been funding an extensive PR operation to raise questions about the strength of the evidence. ExxonMobil alone has spent more than $240m on public relations in this area in the past two decades. Many of the leading Republican candidates for president in 2016 (though not Trump) took campaign funding from the Koch brothers, who have been at the forefront of the fight against the scientific consensus on climate change. The currency in which these campaigns trade is doubt. Their goal is to sow uncertainty in the public mind about what the science shows. In the words of an American Petroleum Institute action plan from 1998: “Victory will be achieved when average citizens ‘understand’ uncertainties in climate science.” To that end, money has been funnelled towards scientific researchers who dissent from mainstream opinion, even if those researchers are in a very small minority. Sowing doubt turns out to be relatively cost-efficient, because dissent only needs a few exceptions to the orthodoxy, whereas consensus requires everyone else to hold fast to it. However, it is no coincidence that this is how the oil industry chooses to see the struggle. Framing it as a contest between heterodoxy and orthodoxy fits the language of scepticism. In that way, it can be made to appear consistent with both science and democracy. Democracy needs dissent in order to function. Scientific progress depends on people being willing to challenge the conventional wisdom. Many climate sceptics argue that they are the ones on the side of science, because the currency of science is doubt. But when heterodox opinion gets purchased with hard cash, it cements the triumph of cynicism. Money ensures that motives are what matter. The ultimate goal of the merchants of doubt has been to politicise the orthodoxy, not simply to dispute it. What has given climate scepticism political teeth over the past two decades is the drive to associate the scientific consensus with the political establishment. Mainstream scientists and mainstream politicians are both viewed as belonging to a club that is comfortable spending other people’s money but deeply uncomfortable with anyone else’s point of view. In an age when all kinds of elites are viewed with suspicion, portraying scientists as a well-connected interest group leaves them vulnerable to political attack. Scientists take public funding. Scientists pass judgment on each other’s work. The scientific establishment is just another a closed shop. Political cynicism has weaponised climate scepticism. But it might also prove to be its achilles heel. Just as pure science struggles with the fact that it can’t avoid politics, so pure politics struggles with the fact that it can’t avoid science. Even the most cynical political operators need to know what’s really likely to happen. As reporting in the Los Angeles Times has shown, at the same time that it has been funding a PR campaign to question the scientific consensus, ExxonMobil has also been funding some of the research that underpins that consensus, including studies of rapidly shrinking ice levels in the Arctic. In the words of David Kaiser and Lee Wasserman, writing in the New York Review of Books, “a company as sophisticated and successful as Exxon would have needed to know the difference between its own propaganda and scientific reality”. Kaiser and Wasserman argue that, as a result, the company has committed fraud: it failed to disclose to its shareholders the basis on which it was making its investment decisions. Its business plans take it for granted that climate change is a real and imminent threat. This behaviour has clear echoes of an earlier attempt to challenge the scientific consensus: the campaign by the big tobacco companies to dispute the link between smoking and cancer. Although many of these businesses recognised as far back as the 1950s that the science was sound, they funded a body of widely disseminated research designed to throw doubt on that view. Their goal was to keep the public open-minded about the dangers of cigarettes, and therefore to keep as many of them puffing away for as long as possible. It was a purely cynical business strategy, and in some cases it was criminal as well. It worked to the extent that it bought the tobacco industry time to reorient its investment and marketing to take account of the new reality. But in the long run it failed. No reasonable person – and certainly no serious politician – now doubts the link between smoking and cancer. The fate of tobacco can give hope to people who worry that the truth is always outgunned: the science won out over the cynics in the end. Are there grounds for thinking that the same will be true for climate science? The tactics of the industries in question may be similar, but the cases are different in crucial respects. Tobacco impacts on its victims directly – smokers do eventually die – and it was when personal experience caught up with industry denial that the argument was lost. It is possible that climate change could kill even more people than smoking. But any damage on that scale is still a long way off. It is also far less direct. The victims will not necessarily be the people who are currently engaged in the most harmful behaviour. Once it had been established that smoking causes cancer, it was clear what had to be done to prevent it: individuals would have to stop smoking and tobacco companies would have to stop encouraging them. There is no equivalent certainty around climate change, even once we accept the scientific consensus that it is real. Those responsible for causing it are not those who will suffer most from it. The current migration crisis is partly being driven by changes in the climate affecting food and water supplies in Africa and the Middle East. But the politics of migration will never find answers in the science of climate change, for the simple reason that the science does not tell us what to do about it. Climate change has distinctive features as a political issue that make it much more intractable than other controversies in which the science was once in cynical dispute. The hyper-politicisation of climate science has coincided more or less directly with the rise of social media; the fight over tobacco took place before the age of the internet, which at least gave scientists some measure of protection from personal exposure. Meanwhile, the consequences of climate change are long-term, global and uncertain. That means any solution places a huge premium on trust. We have to trust that it really will cause harm. We have to trust that we are responsible for any harm it causes. We have to trust that any action we take won’t be undone by the inaction of others. In an age of enormous mistrust in politicians, this poses a huge challenge. We need far more trust in politics than we have at present in order to take concerted action on climate change: apart from anything, we would need to believe that politicians would be willing to share in the sacrifices they ask of us. In the meantime, those who are determined to sow suspicion about the merits of concerted action are fuelling our mistrust in politics. There is no equivalent of watching a relative die of lung cancer to split the difference. The people who made the case that smoking causes cancer were not generally thought of as hypocrites. It’s true that some of them still smoked, even after they knew the dangers. But there were far more smokers inside the tobacco industry, where being seen with a cigarette in hand was positively encouraged as a signal that there was nothing to worry about. Climate science is different. Ever since it became a political issue, it has been bedevilled by accusations of hypocrisy. The internet is awash with tales of Al Gore and his monstrous double standards: he racks up enormous air-conditioning bills in his multiple homes; he leaves his private jet idling on the runway as he spreads the message that flying is wrong; he sells his television network for megabucks to al-Jazeera, where the money to buy it comes from Qatari oil. In the words of the National Review in 2016: “The [climate] hysterics are hypocrites. It’s austerity for thee but not for me as they jet around the world to speak to adoring audiences about the need for sacrifice.” Until wealthy liberal New Yorkers start selling up their Manhattan real estate and moving to higher ground, the cynics say, there’s really nothing to worry about. Recent research by a group of psychologists shows why this is such a problem: we dislike hypocrites because we hate they way they seem to be signalling their superior virtue. Take two kinds of claims about environmental activism. Under one set of conditions, a speaker claims to recycle his rubbish, after which it is revealed that he does no such thing. Under the other, a speaker tell his listeners they should recycle their rubbish, after which it is revealed that he does not do it himself. The first is a liar. The second is a hypocrite, but not a liar, since what he says is still true (people should recycle their rubbish). Most people respond with relative equanimity to the lie. But they loathe the hypocrisy, because the hypocrite seems to be patronising them. This is terrible news for environmentalism. Doctors who smoke are not really patronising their patients: if anything, they are revealing sympathetic human weakness. But environmental activists who leave the engine running are easily portrayed as dreadful elitists: they think the rules don’t apply to them. The populist rabble-rousers of the right have exploited this fact mercilessly. Hypocrisy is hard to avoid when it comes to the politics of climate change, since it is a collective-action problem. It’s far from clear what difference any individual action will make. What matters is what we do together. This makes it practically impossible for any one individual to match words to deeds. Yet the failure to do so provides the perfect stick for the climate cynics to beat their opponents with. If we dislike hypocrisy more than we dislike lying, then it is not just a problem for climate politics. It is a problem for democracy. It gives the liars their chance. During the presidential campaign, it was widely hoped that Trump’s relentless record of untruths would be his undoing. In the New York Times, David Leonhardt painstakingly listed the 26 lies Trump told in the first presidential debate, which ought to have been enough for anyone. But Trump has always been careful not to come across as the wrong sort of hypocrite: the kind who seems to be talking down to people. Hillary Clinton was not so careful. And when the voters get to choose between the two, the hypocrite loses to the liar. In the febrile, divisive state of our politics, it’s not what you say, it’s what you say about yourself by saying it that really counts. The social media revolution amplifies and exaggerates these kinds of accusations. It has become easier than ever to find evidence of how individuals’ public attitudes are given the lie by their private actions. There are now so many public attitudes to choose from, and private actions are now so much harder to hide. Twitter is a vast hypocrisy-generating machine that is corroding democratic politics. Scepticism, which is a democratic virtue, is giving way to cynicism, which is a democratic vice, across the board. Since his arrival in the White House, Donald Trump has been in the middle of a tug of war between the liars and the hypocrites inside the West Wing. On one side stands Steve Bannon, representative of the “alt-right”, still looking to flush out the hypocrisy of the globalists and ready to peddle any old conspiracy theory to achieve his goals. On the other stand the younger members of Trump’s family, including his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, who are more concerned with keeping up appearances. Climate change quickly emerged as one of the fault lines in this showdown. In the end it was Bannon who persuaded Trump to make good on his promise to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord. Kushner argued that this would send the wrong signal and that much more could be achieved by sticking with the agreement but reorienting it to suit the interests of the big American fossil fuel producers. Trump’s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who was previously the CEO of ExxonMobil, sided with Kushner. They lost. In this case, both approaches are equally cynical. For Bannon, everything, including climate science, is just an extension of politics: all that matters is which side you are on. For his opponents inside the administration, climate change can be sidelined as an issue by paying lip service to the consensus while acting in ways that make it irrelevant. The liar denies that climate change is really happening. The hypocrite accepts that it is real but behaves as if the words don’t mean anything. Trump’s administration is dragging climate science further into the swamp of partisan politics. Populist attacks on the scientific consensus co-opt reasonable doubt and turn it into unreasonable suspicion of another self-interested elite. The natural tendency of any elite under this sort of pressure it to build the castle walls higher in order to keep the interlopers out. Faced with a concerted assault on their integrity, what should climate scientists do? They face a choice. One option is to try to reclaim climate scepticism from the people who have corrupted it. The other is to insist more strongly than ever on the consensus. When the space for doubt has been taken away, you can respond by becoming more certain of your own position. Or you can try to take doubt back. There are lessons for the politics of climate change from economics. The economics profession, like any other, is full of people who will express their doubts and uncertainties among friends. But when confronted with a hostile or bemused public, they will close ranks. Economists do not want to appear to be unsure of themselves, given how little the public understands of what they do anyway. So rather than admit that there are many different ways of thinking about, for example, free trade, they insist that all economists agree it is a good thing. As the economist Dani Rodrik puts it, when faced with hostile fire, the natural tendency is to start circling the wagons. For the many voters who do not see the benefits of free trade, this looks like a stitch-up. Economists have found themselves vulnerable to the same dilemma as climate scientists. If they express doubt, the cynics rip them to shreds. But if they conceal doubt, the cynics rip them to shreds anyway. Political pressure often tempts experts into making predictions about the immediate future to prove their point, even though this is a hostage to fortune. Economics is not really meant to be a predictive science. But making predictions is a good way to get attention in a very noisy news environment. The temptation always exists to reduce long-term forecasts to short-term predictions in order to get a hearing. Some economists fell into this trap before Brexit. By talking up the immediate downside, they made it easy to dismiss their warnings when the worst failed to happen straight away. The costs of a failed prediction far outweigh the benefits of an accurate one, especially when that prediction has made in the service of politics. Political journalism is now suffering its own version of this failure. Reasonable doubts about Trump and Jeremy Corbyn were too often accompanied by journalistic predictions that they couldn’t possibly win. These predictions were made to show that scepticism about their politics was something more than just one commentator’s opinion: it was based on a testable hypothesis that would be borne out by events. When the predictions turned out to be wrong, the reasonable doubts got discredited, too. Climate scientists have not faced an embarrassment on an equivalent scale to the financial crash of 2008 or the elections of 2016-17: the big shock they didn’t see coming. Were global warming to turn back into global cooling, climate science might find itself in the same boat as the economics profession: derided for its failure to provide any kind of warning mechanism for the real dangers we run. For now, the main accusations it faces are of crying wolf. In their eagerness to push the idea that climate change is real, environmentalists have too often been drawn into making premature claims about when we will feel its effects. Gore did it in An Inconvenient Truth, released in 2006, when he talked about a 10-year tipping point after which disaster would be at hand. He also overstated the threat of larger and more frequent hurricanes, in the recent aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Until the wolf is at the door, shouting louder and louder about how close he is does no good. It plays into the cynics’ hands. Science often makes for bad politics, because it pretends that it is not politics. The most effective political arguments for taking climate change seriously cannot therefore be ones that simply rest on the science. We need to stop thinking that one side has possession of the truth and the other is just running on money and prejudice. Both sides get tempted into being economical with the truth in the cause of politics. The cynics know what they are doing, which is what makes them cynics. The other side often doesn’t, which is what leads them into the cynics’ trap. We live in an age when mistrust of politics has spilled over into mistrust of expertise, and vice versa. To respond with ever-greater certainty in the name of science is a big mistake. Expertise doesn’t just need humility. It also needs to reclaim the idea of scepticism from the people who have abused it. Experts need to find a way of expressing uncertainty without feeling it undermines their expertise. Voicing doubt has been allowed to become a synonym for admitting you were wrong. The way out is to stop insisting that you were right in the first place. The scientific consensus on climate change is real. But by insisting on its merits for the purposes of politics, its champions have exposed it to ridicule. Political arguments for climate science – indeed, for any science – in the age of Trump should not keep saying that the populists are lying about the consensus. They should say that they are hypocrites about the doubt: they do not practise what they preach because they think they know the answers already. Climate change deniers argue they are only trying to discover the truth. We should all be sceptical about that.

"A giant iceberg twice the size of Luxembourg has broken off an ice shelf on the Antarctic peninsula and is now adrift in the Weddell Sea. Reported to be “hanging by a thread” last month, the trillion-tonne iceberg was found to have split off from the Larsen C segment of the Larsen ice shelf on Wednesday morning after scientists examined the latest satellite data from the area. The Larsen C ice shelf is more than 12% smaller in area than before the iceberg broke off – or “calved” – an event that researchers say has changed the landscape of the Antarctic peninsula and left the Larsen C ice shelf at its lowest extent ever recorded.   “It is a really major event in terms of the size of the ice tablet that we’ve got now drifting away,” said Anna Hogg, an expert in satellite observations of glaciers from the University of Leeds.  At 5,800 sq km the new iceberg, expected to be dubbed A68, is half as big as the record-holding iceberg B-15 which split off from the Ross ice shelf in the year 2000, but it is nonetheless believed to be among the 10 largest icebergs ever recorded. The huge crack that spawned the new iceberg grew over a period of years, but between 25 May and 31 May alone, the rift grew by 17km – the largest increase since January. Between the 24 June and 27 June the movement of the ice sped up, reaching a rate of more than 10 metres per day for the already-severed section.  But in the end it wasn’t a simple break – data collected just days before the iceberg calved revealed that the rift had branched multiple times. “We see one large [iceberg] for now. It is likely that this will break into smaller pieces as time goes by,” said Adrian Luckman, professor of glaciology at Swansea University and leader of the UK’s Midas project which is focused on the state of the ice shelf. The Larsen-C rift opening over the last 2 years from #Sentinel1 pic.twitter.com/MT9d3HAw1M Unlike thin layers of sea ice, ice shelves are floating masses of ice, hundreds of metres thick, which are attached to huge, grounded ice sheets. These ice shelves act like buttresses, holding back and slowing down the movement into the sea of the glaciers that feed them.  “There is enough ice in Antarctica that if it all melted, or even just flowed into the ocean, sea levels [would] rise by 60 metres,” said Martin Siegert, professor of geosciences at Imperial College London and co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change & Environment.  But while the birth of the huge iceberg might look dramatic, experts say it will not itself result in sea level rises. “It’s like your ice cube in your gin and tonic – it is already floating and if it melts it doesn’t change the volume of water in the glass by very much at all,” said Hogg. Following the collapse of the more northerly Larsen A ice shelf in 1995 and Larsen B in 2002, all eyes have turned to Larsen C.  But Siegert is quick to point out that the calving of the new iceberg is not a sign that the ice shelf is about to disintegrate, stressing that ice shelves naturally break up as they extend further out into the ocean. “I am not unduly concerned about it – it is not the first mega iceberg ever to have formed,” he said.  Andrew Shepherd, professor of Earth Observation at the University of Leeds, agreed. “Everyone loves a good iceberg, and this one is a corker,” he said. “But despite keeping us waiting for so long, I’m pretty sure that Antarctica won’t be shedding a tear when it’s gone because the continent loses plenty of its ice this way each year, and so it’s really just business as usual!” Luckman said that while the Larsen C ice shelf might continue to shed icebergs, it might regrow. Nevertheless previous research by the team has suggested that the remaining ice shelf is likely less stable now that the iceberg has calved, although it is unlikely the event would have any short-term effects. “We will have to wait years or decades to know what will happen to the remainder of Larsen C,” he said, pointing out that it took seven years after the release of a large iceberg from Larsen B before the ice shelf became unstable and disintegrated.  In terms of size, it’s fairly big. This is a 5,800 sq km iceberg - that’s twice the size of Luxembourg, or roughly the area of Delaware. While that doesn’t make it the largest iceberg on record - that gong goes to an iceberg that broke away from the Ross ice shelf in 2000 - it is one of the biggest. It is also exciting for the technological advances that have allowed scientists to regularly track the development of the rift, monitoring its growth down to 1km resolution. But in terms of its impact, the event is less dramatic: the iceberg itself won’t result in a sea level rise, and scientists say there is no evidence its formation is down to climate change. But, they note, the release of the iceberg might make the rest of the Larsen C ice shelf less stable. Collapse of the Larsen C ice shelf would remove buttressing from glaciers, meaning they could flow faster into the sea, eventually resulting in sea level rises. Only time will tell what the full impact of the birth of the new iceberg will be. What’s more, Luckman stressed that while large melt ponds were seen on Larsen B prior to its collapse - features which are thought to have affected the structure of the ice shelf - those seen on Larsen C are far smaller and are not even present at this time of year. And while climate change is accepted to have played a role in the wholesale disintegration of the Larsen A and Larsen B ice shelves, Luckman emphasised that there is no evidence that the calving of the giant iceberg is linked to such processes.  Twila Moon, a glacier expert at the US National Ice and Snow Data Center agrees but, she said, climate change could have made the situation more likely.  “Certainly the changes that we see on ice shelves, such as thinning because of warmer ocean waters, are the sort [of changes] that are going to make it easier for these events to happen,” she said. Luckman is not convinced. “It is a possibility, but recent data from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography actually show most of the shelf thickening,” he said. The progress of the rift, and the loss of the iceberg, has been carefully followed by analysis of radar images from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 mission, which provides data from the region every six days.  “Before we would have been lucky if we had got one satellite image a year of an event like this, so we would not have been able to watch it unfold,” said Hogg, pointing out that the radar system allows data to be collected whatever the weather and in the dark, while technological advances mean more data that can be downloaded than for previous satellites. Smoking gun, the #LarsenC iceberg has broken free! @ESA_EO @BAS_News @NERCscience #Sentinel1 pic.twitter.com/9jM47BC9sY The news of the giant iceberg comes after US president Donald Trump announced that the US will be withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate accord – an agreement signed by more than 190 countries to tackle global warming. “Truly I am dismayed,” said Moon of the move. Now at the mercy of the ocean currents, the newly calved iceberg could last for decades, depending on whether it enters warmer waters or bumps into other icebergs or ice shelves. "
"Extreme El Niño events that can cause crippling drought in Australia are likely to be far more frequent even if the world pulls off mission improbable and limits global warming to 1.5C. International scientists have released new modelling that projects drought-causing El Niño events, which pull rainfall away from Australia, will continue increasing in frequency well beyond any stabilisation of the climate.  Even if warming is limited to 1.5C – something scientists have warned is unlikely if not impossible – the modelling suggests Australia will face more frequent drought-inducing weather events. The risk of extreme El Niño events would rise from the current five events per century to 10 per century by 2050 under a scenario that presumes warming peaks at 1.5C by that year. But the risk keeps on rising for a further 100 years – to about 14 events per century by 2150. The risk of extreme El Niño events would not level off even if the climate was stabilised, CSIRO researcher and lead report author Dr Guojian Wang said. “This result is unexpected and shows that future generations will experience greater climate risks associated with extreme El Niño events than seen at 1.5C warming,” Wang said. Report co-author Dr Wenju Cai said extreme El Niño events occured when the usual El Niño Pacific rainfall centre was pushed eastwards towards South America. Sometimes it moves by up to 16,000km, causing massive changes in the climate. “This pulls rainfall away from Australia, bringing conditions that have commonly resulted in intense droughts across the nation,” said Cai, director of the Centre for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research. “During such events, other countries like India, Ecuador and China have experienced extreme events, with serious socioeconomic consequences.” The global Paris climate change agreement seeks to limit global warming to below 2C, a target intended to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. But the Paris deal, recently abandoned by the United States, also set an aspirational target of 1.5C – a demand from the most vulnerable countries, including low-lying island nations in the Pacific. Dr Scott Power, head of climate research at the Bureau of Meteorology, said most small island states in the Pacific had a limited capacity to cope with major floods and droughts, and the latest modelling was very bad news for them. “To make matters worse, our recent study published ... indicates that the risk of major disruptions to Pacific rainfall have already increased. And unfortunately, these El Niño-related impacts will add to the other challenges of climate change, such as rising sea levels, ocean acidification and increasing temperature extremes,” he said. The latest research on the El Niño risk has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change."
"At the end of June some exotic migrants flew into the country who have been enthusiastically welcomed by the Daily Mail. Following a hazardous journey from southern Europe a gang of seven bee-eaters have set up home in a desolate quarry in Nottinghamshire.  But while their presence is an inspiring example of the benefits of free movement, their choice of a quarry owned by Mexican minerals multinational Cemex raises some difficult questions about the relationship conservation has with big business.  Bee-eaters are one of our most beautiful birds and over the coming months thousands of birders are expected to flock to see them. Rare visitors to the UK, they are usually found nesting in sand banks along the Mediterranean and North Africa. If – as seems likely – they do colonise this country, it will be the most stark evidence yet of the northerly migration of bird populations due to climate change.  Like other migrants, people have been quick to exploit the bee-eaters. The RSPB have set up special viewing facilities with Cemex charging £5 for people to see them, half of which goes to the landowner. This has already led to accusations of them “parachuting in” by Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust, who have been managing the site with Cemex for the last 16 years.  When it comes to doing financial deals, both organisations are keen to develop their relationships with Cemex, who have assets in excess of £26bn. The RSPB has had a partnership with Cemex UK since 2009, employing a dedicated adviser, while Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust has been working with the company for 25 years.  Yet globally Cemex are in the vanguard of one of the great environmental crises of our age: the sand mining industry, which is destroying wildlife habitats around the world.  The practice of sand mining by other companies now directly threatens important wildlife habitats in Northern Ireland and Dover, endangering birds, seals and other marine life. Andy Spencer, director of sustainability at Cemex, said: “The arrival of the rare and exotic bee-eaters at East Leake quarry has created a lot of interest amongst not only bird watchers but nature lovers everywhere. The quarry offers the birds the perfect home, in a dedicated sand pile, well away from the operational part of the quarry. We are working in partnership with the RSPB to ensure the safety of the birds and any visitors.” Immigration, whether human or avian, is rarely without controversy. After Brexit, politicians are seeking new global partners to boost Britain’s finances. Following their bee-eater boon, the RSPB and Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust would do well to do the same."
"A taunting peal of thunder rings out overhead as Diego García de la Peña studies one of his ponds and wonders whether its water will see his cattle through until October. The 65-year-old farmer – a former bullfighter who quotes Federico García Lorca and whose ancestors were among the legions of steely Extremadurans who bent the New World to their will – is a worried man. The source of García de la Peña’s anxiety is imprinted on the landscape of his 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres) ranch. Its pastures are dry and pale brown, their grasses short and brittle, and the water level in its 10 ponds is a metre lower than it would be in a good year. But this is not a good year in Extremadura or elsewhere on the Iberian peninsula. Once again, drought has struck, devastating cereal crops, threatening the olive and grape harvest and leaving livestock short of food and water. “This is an awful year – the worst we’ve had over the past decade – and it’s one of those that costs you a lot of money,” says García de la Peña. “There’s been no rain – and here, everything depends on the spring and autumn rains.” His 400 cows may need to be given ready-mixed feed for eight or nine months rather than the usual five, and the water situation is another expensive headache. If the ponds run dry, García de la Peña will have to start sinking wells, around 100 metres deep, in his land. The wells cost €35 a metre to dig and then there are the solar-powered pumps to consider. All in all, he could find himself losing €30,000 (£26,347) this year as he tries to ride out the drought. “I hope I can make it up next year. I hope I won’t go into the red, but it’s a possibility.” Things in neighbouring, northwestern Castilla y León are worse still. The drought has ravaged the area, which is known as Spain’s granary, cutting the wheat and barley harvest by 50%. José Roales, who grows wheat, barley, peas, sunflowers, chickpeas, lentils, and alfalfa in the region’s Zamora province, is one of many staring at an alarming balance sheet. “I’ve been harvesting 1,000kg of cereals per hectare,” the farmer says. “In a normal year I’d get 4,000kg per hectare. The thing is that the first 2,500kg goes on covering my costs. That gives you an idea of how things are this year.” But, says Roales – who is also the cereals chief of the COAG farming association – others are suffering even more. “Given how things are in other bits of Castilla y León, I still consider myself lucky. In Palencia province, 80% of the cereals haven’t been reaped this year. It’s far, far worse.” According to the Spanish farming association Asaja, the country is suffering from both a lack of rain over the past five or six years and the gradual diminishing and salinisation of water in aquifers and wells near the coast, which makes irrigation difficult. With the Duero, Segura and Júcar river basins already officially declared to be in drought and some areas seeing 75% less rainfall this year, the focus is now turning to how the drought could affect olives, almonds, pistachios and walnuts. “All those are tree crops; they have well-established roots that will seek out water deep in the ground, so it will take longer to see how the drought affects them,” says a technical spokesman for Asaja. “It’s going to be a really, really tough year. But we won’t know just how tough until the autumn.” By then, the drought’s effect on Spain’s vineyards should also be apparent. José Joaquín Vizcaíno, COAG’s representative for the wine-producing sector, says that, while dry years and heat in June can improve grape quality, a prolonged dry spell would be unwelcome. “If this heat continues into August and night-time temperatures are above 20C, ripening will be difficult,” he says. Vizcaíno believes the high temperatures and lack of rain will see more vineyards turning to irrigation. “The kind of climate change we are seeing year-to-year means that areas in the south, where the rains are shorter, are going to need more irrigation as a back-up during some times of the year, or years when it’s very dry,” he says. “The proportion of irrigated vineyards has grown, and it’s past 40%, nearly at 50%.” Roales, too, sees the evident and unwelcome hand of climate change at work in his fields. “Older people – say, those over 80 – tell us that 30 years ago winters were harder; it was colder and there was more rain, snow and frost. But as the years have gone by, they’ve grown milder. Where we used to have four seasons, we now have only two: we’re seeing spring and autumn disappear.” García de la Peña has little choice but to keep on with his cows and the few bulls he raises for the ring. Despite the treacherous climate and the expense of cattle farming, he is ineluctably bound to his land. “You can put money into a farm until you’re totally and utterly ruined: there are wells to sink and fences and paths to mend. But at the end of the day it’s my life, and I wouldn’t know how to do anything else anyway. “Maybe if I was 20 I’d be able to change things, but not now. Back when I was fighting bulls, I’d spend all night driving from Nîmes so that I could get back to look after my cows. If you are from the country, you’re from the country.” The day that the old bullfighter takes off his brown leather riding boots will be the day that he dies. “Maybe we’re the last Romantics,” he says. “I can’t abandon the pastures; they have to carry on being pastures. What would Extremadura be without them?”"
"The government must reverse its opposition to new building regulations that ensure homes, hospitals and schools do not overheat as the number of deadly heatwaves rises, according to its official climate change advisers. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) recommended the new regulations in 2015 but ministers rejected the advice, citing a commitment to “reduce net regulation on homebuilders”. Without action, the number of people dying as a result of heat is expected to more than triple to 7,000 a year by 2040, the CCC warns in its annual report on the UK’s progress on tackling global warming.  Earlier in June, Britain experienced its longest period with temperatures above 30C since 1976. Heatwaves are known killers in the UK and the number of hot days is rising. On the hottest day of the year in 2016 there were almost 400 extra deaths, while a heatwave in 2006 led to 680 people dying and another in 2003 contributed to the deaths of about 2,000 people.  “What we need from government is a willingness to accept that building regulations, properly done, are not an incubus [problem] – they are in fact an opportunity to enable people to build for the future,” said Lord Deben, chair of the CCC and a former Conservative environment secretary. “It is absolutely essential to recognise that we will not deal with the problems of climate change unless we have tougher building regulations,” he said. “The government has a real opportunity to do that as it is going to have to look at its building regulations in any case because of the tragic events [of the Grenfell Tower fire] and I think it is very important that they should take the opportunity to look at them in this wider sense.” The CCC’s head of adaptation, Daniel Johns, said: “We said [in 2015] there is a compelling case for a new building standard to avoid new homes overheating. But [the government] response said there was clearly a trade-off here and they were also mindful of burdens on developers. So this is an area where they consider the potential small additional cost that could be borne by developers and what that might mean for the price of houses, being traded off against the potential long term cost for people occupying these properties in the hotter summers and heatwaves in years to come.” The CCC identifies hospitals and care homes as particularly vulnerable to heat, as the UK’s ageing population suffers most in hot temperatures, as well as schools and prisons. The best solutions for keeping buildings cool involve good ventilation at night and shading of windows during the day, said Johns.  Air conditioning should not be the first choice, said Deben: “If buildings are properly built in this country there is very little need for air conditioning. The problem with air conditioning is that it heats the area round about, so it has a disadvantage for the community as a whole. It’s a constant pushing out of hot air.” Julie Hirigoyen, chief executive at the UK Green Building Council, said: “The issue of overheating in buildings is of increasing concern. Clearly, there is a risk that our building regulations are no longer fit for purpose without robust protections against overheating.” The CCC’s annual progress report says that the UK has done well in tackling climate change, cutting emissions by 42% since 1990 while GDP has risen by 65%. But it warns that the transition to a resilient, low carbon economy is in danger of being “derailed” by delays in important policies caused by the Brexit referendum and recent general election. “The events of the past year have been, by almost any measure, exceptional,” said Deben. “However, it is now time for government, and for parliament, to act. Climate change is happening, not waiting. It is neither justifiable nor wise to delay further.” The UK is on track to miss its legally binding targets for cuts in carbon emissions and the plan to address this, expected in late 2016, will not now be published until autumn 2017. Emissions from energy have fallen, although key policies promoting this end in 2020. But emissions from transport and heating are rising and need to be urgently addressed, the CCC said. Furthermore, the overall state of the UK’s natural environment is worsening, reducing its ability to withstand climate change. The government target is for 50% of land habitats to be in good condition by 2020, but only 25% currently are, crucial pollinator insects are declining and the government has repeatedly missed targets to plant 5,000 hectares of woodland a year. Progress to tackle river and coastal flooding has been made, the CCC says, but the widespread problem of flash flooding has not been adequately addressed. A government spokesman said: “The government is a world leader in tackling climate change and committed to meeting the UK’s targets. Our industrial strategy continues to support our burgeoning low carbon sector which is helping deliver high-skilled jobs across the country.” “We’ve implemented the majority of recommendations from the first National Adaptation Programme report.” he said. “But we agree there is a need to do more.”"

"Donald Trump is being accused of trying to water down the wording of a G20 draft communique about climate change, with US and EU officials expected to clash over the issue in talks expected to stretch through the night. One section of the draft, seen by the Guardian, took note of the US decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change, but added: “The United States affirms its strong commitment to a global approach that lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs.”  That sentence has since been removed and the US is trying to introduce a new phrase that has angered other countries, and also campaigners, because it refers to fossil fuels.  It says: “Given the importance of energy access and security in the nationally determined contributions of other countries, the United States of America will endeavour to work closely with other partners to help their access to and use of fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently and help deploy renewable and other clean energy sources.” Sources said that diplomats from France, Italy and the EU more generally were working to block the addition, while Angela Merkel admitted that discussions on climate change and trade would be difficult. The German chancellor said they would stretch “through the night” but that was not unusual for such negotiations.  Max Lawson, a senior policy adviser at Oxfam, said: “Ending climate change is about ending harmful fossil fuels. The US is attempting to force language into the communique on planet-destroying, dirty energy. Clean coal is a myth. The remaining G19 should show some backbone and stand up to him.” Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International, added: “The G19 needs to stand together and make it very clear it will implement Paris and strengthen their climate action no matter what Trump says or does. They have a responsibility and an opportunity to move forward swiftly.” All world leaders gathering at the G20 Summit in Hamburg with the exception of the US plan to assert the irreversibility of their decision to commit to carbon reduction targets under the Paris accord. The news came as it emerged Trump was holding his high-profile bilateral meeting with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, at the same time the G20 group will be having a formal session on climate change. Many leaders have expressed their disappointment at Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement, with Theresa May claiming on Friday morning that she hopes “they will be able to find a way to come back into the Paris agreement”. Using stronger language than previously, the UK prime minister added: “I believe that is possible. We are not renegotiating the Paris agreement. That stays.” The joint communique notes, but does not condemn, the US decision to withdraw, instead claiming the US is committed to cutting carbon emissions by other routes. The communique also calls for the commitments made under the Paris treaty to be implemented swiftly. Angela Merkel, the German host, has said there are clear differences between the US and the rest of the G20 on climate change, adding that there is no point in disguising them.  There have been suggestions that the Chinese did not want the disagreement to be highlighted in a communique that the US would feel it was impossible to sign. The Chinese vice-minister of finance, Zhu Guangyao, said the aim should be consensus among all members. There were also fears that some of the less enthusiastic supporters of the Paris treaty might backtrack and join the US in pulling out. Russia and Turkey, for instance, have signed the agreement but not ratified it. Saudi Arabia, which was one of the last countries to hold out, has both signed and ratified. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, underlined the threat climate change poses to Africa and alluded to an expected increase in migration, saying “when it comes to Africa I assume the Paris agreement will be supported by almost everyone”. The European council president, Donald Tusk, also praised Trump’s surprising speech hailing the virtues of the transatlantic alliance, but questioned whether these words will be followed by deeds. He said “I’ve heard yesterday in Warsaw surprising diplomatic words from the American president about transatlantic community, about the cooperation between the United States, Europe, about our common political tradition and civilisation, and about the readiness to protect and to defend the whole western community. “We have been waiting for a long time to hear these words from President Trump but the real question is whether it was a one-time incident or a new policy. President Trump said yesterday in Warsaw that words are easy, but it is actions that matter – and the first test will be our meeting here in Hamburg.” The final version of the communique will be negotiated overnight by diplomats from the 20 attending countries. But Merkel is under domestic pressure not to brush the dispute on climate change under the carpet. Germany’s federal environment minister Barbara Hendricks, a member of the SDP, had insisted the differences could not be covered up, saying “we must not be stopped from protecting the climate. The climate treaty is not negotiable.” The German Green party chairman, Cem Özdemir, said: “We need to send a strong signal. The G20 countries produce 80% of global CO2 emissions, so they have a lever in their hands … I expect the summit to make a clear commitment to the Paris climate change agreement.” Greenpeace director Morgan added: “Merkel, as the G20 host, must not sacrifice ambition for unity. Instead, we need a G19 commitment to climate action that demonstrates the intent to implement and even go beyond what 195 nations agreed to in Paris.”    "
"Some of Australia’s largest listed companies, including Woodside, Rio Tinto and Santos, are likely to face sweeping changes to the way in which they model, plan for and disclose risk from climate change to investors. How they respond will affect their ability to attract funding from lenders, insurers and superannuation funds who are under pressure to stress-test investments for a carbon-constrained future. The release last week of a report by the Financial Stability Board’s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures is expected to add pressure on publicly listed companies to formalise their climate risk disclosure practices – particularly through scenario analysis – or risk investors pulling finance and rating agencies making assumptions about their risk profile.  The taskforce’s purpose is to ensure more methodical, comparable and consistent disclosure on climate-related risks and opportunities. It is also to stave off a global financial crisis-style correction as the financial community manages its exposure to assets which could rapidly become redundant as limits on carbon emissions tighten to 2050, well within the lifetime of most large-scale infrastructure projects. An independent financial thinktank, the Carbon Tracker Initiative, has referred to this as a “carbon bubble”.  “The aim is to enable better decision-making by capital markets and, ultimately, to ensure the financial system is not going to be exposed to the sort of systemic risk or shock that we’ve seen in the past with financial crises,” said Michael Wilkins, S&P’s global representative on the taskforce. “The more information that is out there, the more that it can be incorporated into decision-making and better capital allocation with less risk of systemic shock.” The taskforce’s recommendations will go to the G20 summit in Hamburg on 6-7 July 2017. More than 100 firms with market capitalisations of more than US$3.3tn and financial firms responsible for assets of more than US$24tn have encouraged the adoption of the taskforce’s recommendations. “The Paris agreement means much of the world has to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest and it’s clear that many businesses are not pursuing a strategy that’s consistent with this,” said Kate Mackenzie, head of finance and investment at the now defunct Climate Institute. “It’s not just the resources sector, but those who invest and finance them, and those who rely upon them. Both the oil industry and the auto industry are right now coming to terms with the prospect that the era of internal combustion engines may be ending much faster than many of us thought.” In Australia – where carbon-intensive oil, gas, coal and iron ore extraction industries drive trade, economic prosperity and geopolitical influence – many of the largest listed banks, insurers and super funds are heavily invested in these areas and are set to drive further change.  “The financial sector is leading and that’s partly due to the campaigns they’ve faced for lending to fossil fuels and how that fits into their overall portfolios,” said Dan Goucher of the environmental campaign group Market Forces. A speech given by APRA’s head, Geoff Summerhayes, earlier this year, in which he stressed the need for banks and insurers to act on the taskforce’s recommendations, is widely seen as a turning point for Australia’s financial sector. As a result, institutional investors such as Blackrock, Fidelity and Legal & General Investment Management are voting to support shareholder resolutions on climate risk disclosure. It is a seachange for Australia’s business sector and surpasses any resistance to change at a political level. But for energy and utility companies – those most affected by the rise of clean technologies, carbon caps and investor pressure to quantify how assets will continue to deliver shareholder value in a carbon-constrained future – progress has been patchy. Oil and gas companies in particular have argued that putting sensitive information on their asset and resource base into the public domain could jeopardise their competitive advantage globally. “AGL is a leader in terms of climate risk disclosure. They’re one of only two companies which has done scenario analysis publicly. The other is BHP Billiton. Origin has made commitments but hasn’t really delivered in terms of disclosure. The smaller utilities have done very little,” said Goucher.  Although it is a struggle to see how oil and gas companies such as Woodside can transition to a low carbon future beyond deploying gas as a transition fuel, Emma Herd, at the Investors Group on Climate Change, is optimistic: “There is much energy companies can do in the technology space to adapt to new challenges.” Not long ago investors were encouraged to divest from fossil fuel companies entirely. Instead, such companies called on investors to engage with them about their concerns. This has led to some stakeholder resolutions requiring companies to publish more information on climate risks, the most recent one being at ExxonMobil.  The taskforce’s recommendations go a step further in trying to ensure disclosures are comparable between companies to facilitate more effective engagement on the issue. Photos of green landscapes in annual reports will no longer cut it.  “Disclosure isn’t just about publishing pretty reports any more,” said Mackenzie. “It’s about demonstrating how you are responding to climate change-related risks, and why.” "

"Australia’s official greenhouse gas data, showing a continued increase in emissions, was quietly published on a government website on Friday, after internal government correspondence showed it had been held back from release for more than a month. The figures broadly confirm independent analysis done exclusively for Guardian Australia by consultants at NDEVR Environmental, published last month. Those projections proved about 98% accurate, with emissions rising by even more than was projected. The government also updated all its historical data, showing emissions going back to at least 2001 were higher than previously thought, with most of these revisions due to gas leaks from the mining sector – fugitive emissions. The data still remains one quarter behind, and the NDEVR-Guardian analysis published in June projected an unseasonal rise in emissions not seen in more than a decade for that quarter – the first three months of this year. The government release covers emissions up to December 2016 and confirms that they have continued to rise. The new figures for 2016 show emissions rose 1% over the new estimation of 2015 emissions – but that was a rise of 1.7% compared with the government’s previous estimation of 2015 figures. The rise is in line with government projections, which show that on current policies, emissions will continue to rise to 2030 and beyond. But they are in stark contrast to to Australia’s international commitments made as part of the Paris agreement, which now state that emissions will fall to at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2030. Australia has also committed to ratchet up that ambition over time, in line with the goal of keeping global warming to “well below 2C”. Most of the increase in emissions occurred in the “stationary energy” sector – which includes fuels used for heating and energy besides electricity generation – as well as in fugitive emissions. . The figures were released on the same day the Australian Conservation Foundation published documents it obtained under freedom of information laws showing that the government had been sitting on the release for more than a month. After the information was released, the federal minister for energy and the environment, Josh Frydenberg, tweeted a link to the report, pointing out that emissions from the electricity sector had dropped in the last quarter covered by the report. Emissions data released today here https://t.co/lBYSOHd2Xi NB: electricity sector emissions decreased by 1.3% in Dec Qtr  Emissions from the electricity sector almost always fall in the December quarter, but the NDEVR-Guardian projections suggest they rose dramatically in the quarter to March 2017, which is very unusual. Those figures are yet to be released by the government. The climate scientist Will Steffen, a member of the Climate Council, said Australia’s rising emissions were an embarrassment. “This is clear evidence that Australia is failing to tackle climate change compared to superpowers like the United States, whose emissions fell last year, and China, which has peaked its emissions more than a decade earlier than it promised in Paris,” he said. “In contrast, Australia’s lack of an effective climate and energy policy has now led to even higher emission levels while the big global emitters begin to reduce carbon pollution.”"

"World leaders have made clear the US’s isolated stance on climate change, with 19 of the G20 countries affirming their commitment to the “irreversible” Paris climate agreement. After lengthy negotiations that stretched well into Saturday, the final joint statement from the meeting in Hamburg notes Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris deal while stating that the world’s other major economies all still support the international effort to slow dangerous global warming.  The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Saturday she “deplored” the US exit from the agreement and added that she did not share the view of Theresa May, the British prime minister, that Washington could decide to rejoin the pact. “I think it’s very clear that we could not reach consensus, but the differences were not papered over, they were clearly stated,” Merkel told reporters at the end of the two-day meeting. “It’s absolutely clear it is not a common position.” The communique reads: “We take note of the decision of the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris agreement,” adding: “The leaders of the other G20 members state that the Paris agreement is irreversible” and “we reaffirm our strong commitment to the Paris agreement”. The US did successfully manage to insert text referencing fossil fuels which read: “The United States of America states it will endeavour to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently.” World leaders meeting in Hamburg managed to agree almost every aspect of the statement, including the potentially contentious issue of trade, but the final text was held up by the US’s contrarian approach to climate change. In June, Trump, who has enthusiastically touted coal and oil extraction, announced his country’s exit from the Paris agreement, which aims to avoid dangerous global warming of more than 2C (3.6F) compared to the pre-industrial period. The strongest proponents of the climate deal, including Merkel and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, have attempted to shore up support for the Paris deal among countries following Trump’s decision to exit the agreement. Saudi Arabia and Indonesia were reportedly considering watering down their commitment to the deal but they ended up reiterating their support at the G20 summit. The final communique was accompanied by an agreed climate and energy plan that supports the key planks of the Paris agreement and sets goals to phase out fossil fuel subsidies and shift countries towards “affordable, reliable, sustainable and low greenhouse gas emission energy systems as soon as feasible”. A lengthy notice period means that the US withdrawal from the Paris agreement will not take place until November 2020. The US will become the only country in the world not signed up to the landmark 2015 deal other than Nicaragua, which complained that it wasn’t strong enough, and Syria, currently mired in a bloody civil war. Trump’s administration has sought to unravel domestic climate policies by dismantling the clean power plan, which would slash emissions from coal-fired power plants, halting new emissions standards for cars and trucks and opening up new areas of public lands and oceans to mining and drilling. Climate change has been one of the animating causes for protesters who have clashed with police in Hamburg, resulting in more than 100 arrests. On Friday, Greenpeace erected a giant effigy of Trump, dressed in a diaper and soiling himself with oil on the globe, on the river Elbe. Other environmental groups were more optimistic, noting that almost all of the world’s major powers were broadly behind the transition to low-carbon energy and ameliorating the impacts of climate change. “In the end, it was a landslide victory for countries voicing support for global climate action,” said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute. “Chancellor Merkel demonstrated deft leadership in rallying 19 of the world’s largest economies to deliver an unmistakable message behind climate action. “The direction of travel toward clean energy is loud and clear. The question remains how quickly the world will surge forward and how far behind the Trump administration will let the United States fall.” Mohamed Adow, international climate lead at Christian Aid, said: “The US president’s weak attempts to capsize the climate movement have failed: he is now marooned on a political island of his own making, with his head buried in the sand. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is moving ahead.”"
"Donald Trump will travel to Germany this week to participate in his first G20summit. While most multilateral meetings are full of lofty rhetoric about global cooperation – and feature slightly awkward group photos that resemble a high school yearbook – the G20 meeting appears uniquely engineered to challenge Trump’s foreign policy instincts. Trump may face his most difficult in-person foreign policy test in Hamburg.  Presidential travel is often filled with pomp and circumstance, but such trips can also reveal a president’s true colors. Saudi Arabia – a repressive dictatorship – was Trump’s choice for his first stop in office. While there, Trump made time for meetings with some of the world’s less savory leaders, but had no time for meeting with the members of civil society systematically repressed in the Middle East. In Europe afterwards, he removed language affirming America’s commitment to defend Nato allies from his speech, sending shudders through the continent.   If Trump’s first foreign trip was worrisome, Americans and allies alike should brace themselves for when Trump goes to Hamburg. The lineup of participants and issues at this week’s G20 are likely to feed some of Trump’s most dangerous foreign policy impulses, and there are four key issues to watch as the president touches down in Germany.  First, will Trump continue to prioritise dictators over America’s democratic allies? The G20 is made up of the world’s largest economies, and so Trump will find himself sitting next to the leaders of democracies like France, Germany, and Japan – as well as some of the world’s most ruthless authoritarians, such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jinping, and Saudi Arabia’s King Salman. The leaders Trump meets and aligns with on policy issues will speak volumes about those he sees as his closest partners.  Second, does Trump have a reasonable, comprehensive international economic and trade agenda? The G20 summit was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis so that the world’s largest economies could coordinate in strengthening economies. The G20 has made important progress in reining in financial risks, stopping international tax evasion, and restoring growth.  Trump’s economic mantra on rolling back regulation, cutting taxes for the wealthy, and shutting off trade has yielded few economic results to date, and left many wondering whether Trump has a coherent economic agenda for the US and our key trading partners other than simply enriching his cronies.  Should Trump succeed in rolling back key economic progress made by the G20 or undermining the open world we live in, not only will this undermine our friends and allies abroad, but America will be exposed to a heightened risk of financial crisis, lost tax revenues, and greater income inequality. It would only be a matter of time before this kind of a dangerous international economic agenda comes home to roost for American workers and the middle class. Third, will Trump continue to deny the existence of climate change and thumb America’s nose at an existential challenge recognised by just about every other country in the world? The G20’s focus on climate change and clean energy has increased in recent years as it has become clear that any hope of tackling climate change requires the largest economies to adopt sustainable growth strategies.  Trump seems unlikely to go along with that. He just pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement, and his administration is already hard at work trying to dismantle many of the clean energy policies enacted by his predecessor. As much of the rest of the G20 works to combat climate change, Trump’s opposition may see him standing alone with his friend King Salman, whose kingdom relies on the world running on fossil fuels.  And fourth, what happens when Trump meets face to face with Putin? Trump’s administration has been mired in an ever-growing scandal over whether the president and his campaign colluded with Russia in its attempt to help Trump win the election.  At the same time, Trump continues to pursue policies helpful to Russia, from opposing more sanctions to trying to obstruct the FBI investigation into possible collusion. A meeting between the two now is highly inappropriate – especially since Trump seems completely unwilling to confront Putin over election meddling, Ukraine, or anything else – and will only reinforce signals that Trump is willing to sacrifice the interests of America and its allies.  A new Pew Research Center  opinion poll reveals that, after less than six months in office, global opinion of the US has plummeted over concerns about Trump’s personality and destabilising policies. People across the world have lost faith in Trump, and the G20 meeting could reveal the depths of just how dangerous the American president is to American leadership.   "

"Shortly before World Ocean Day, and a special UN meeting to address threats facing oceans, the US president, Donald Trump, announced that the country was walking away from the Paris agreement. Here in Australia, there was a welcome bipartisan commitment to stay the course, with Malcolm Turnbull defending Australia’s participation in this critically important environmental pact. But Australia’s environmental diplomacy needs to be more than just defensive. Taking a cue from French president Emmanuel Macron’s pledge to “make the planet great again” by determined leadership on climate action, Australia should likewise move on to the front foot. And one place where it can make a big contribution is in its own backyard – Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.  The Antarctic and its surrounding seas are experiencing profound physical and ecological pressure as a result of climate change and ocean acidification. Just last week, scientists reported on a big melting event on the surface of the Ross ice shelf during 2016, across an area of about 800,000 sq km, which is larger than Texas.  Antarctica’s ice shelves are also melting from below and are beginning to fracture and disintegrate. The Larsen C ice shelf, a major extension of the West Antarctic ice sheet, is the latest to show alarming signs of collapse, with a big rift rapidly “unzipping” a large portion of the shelf from the ice front. The calving of the shelf is only a matter of time. The states that manage Antarctica and the Southern Ocean have powerful tools at their fingertips to give ecosystems the best possible chance of adapting to the physical changes under way in Antarctica, while governments globally come to grips with the climate crisis. These tools include Marine Protected Areas, in which fishing is banned or limited to protect ecosystems and species. The science is clear that marine reserves can mitigate climate change and help ecosystems adapt to changes in water temperature, chemistry and circulation. MPAs help build ecosystem resilience, provide refuge for marine species and can also protect carbon pools, or sinks (“blue carbon”). In 2016, a deadlock of more than five years was broken when the Ross Sea MPA, the largest marine reserve in the world, was established by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. CCAMLR is the international body established under the Antarctic treaty system with the specific mandate of protecting the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Australia rightly enjoys a reputation as a global leader in the protection of the Antarctic environment. But our country needs to step up its diplomacy, particularly if it wishes to achieve the designation of the east Antarctic representative system of marine protected areas, a joint initiative of Australia, France and the EU. The proposal was developed in 2010 on the basis of extensive scientific research. But since then, it has not gained consensus support within CCAMLR. Successive revisions have been made to the proposal to make it more acceptable to the CCAMLR parties. The east Antarctic MPA is already smaller than initially proposed, comprising three areas instead of seven. Also still up for discussion is how strong the protections will be within the MPA.  There is a risk that the proponents will water down the proposal and accept a compromise in the face of potential Chinese and Russian opposition. The east Antarctic MPA is therefore still in flux – France and the EU have drafted a revised proposal that has been shared with the Australian government. The ball is now in Australia’s court on how best to proceed. The experience with the Ross Sea MPA shows that high-level political engagement is vital to make breakthroughs in Antarctic protection. The Ross Sea MPA was achieved in large part because of the direct interventions of the then US secretary of state John Kerry and president Barack Obama to persuade Russia and China to support the proposal. If the east Antarctic MPA is to be much more than just a “paper park” – an MPA in name only – it is vital that the Australian government identify it as a top diplomatic priority. Strong protections need to be retained in the MPA, including strict no-take areas where fishing is prohibited, which will protect the coastal and ocean ecosystems, including foraging areas for Adélie and emperor penguins. There is limited time for bilateral negotiations before the next CCAMLR meeting in Hobart in October, and the success of the MPA will hinge on whether Australia can join France and the EU in advocating for areas that will be firmly off limits for the commercial fishing industry.  If Australia is successful, it would mark a big achievement in Southern Ocean protection. But success is far from assured, and without a strong diplomatic effort at the highest levels, we could be saddled with a second-best outcome and one that would fail to serve the interests of effective Antarctic protection in an era of rapid environmental change.  • Saturday 8 July marks 100 days until the CCALMR meeting.

"Climate change is likely to worsen existing inequalities in the US, with the poorest areas of the country poised to lose as much as 20% of their income by the end of the century if greenhouse gases are not significantly reduced.  By 2100, the economic loss from warming temperatures will be on a par with the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, with states in the south and lower mid-west to be most severely affected, according to new research. Overall, each 1C of temperature rise is forecast to cost the US economy 1.2% in lost GDP, on average. “Unmitigated climate change will be very expensive for huge regions of the United States,” said Soloman Hsiang of the University of California, Berkeley, one of the authors of the study. “If we continue on the current path, our analysis indicates it may result in the largest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in the country’s history.”  While large areas of the south will suffer economically and socially from heatwaves, storms and failing crops, parts of New England and the Pacific north-west will do comparatively well, with balmier conditions reducing deaths from the winter cold and some crops responding well to the extra warmth. Previous research has shown that in some areas of the US, people have experienced seemingly favorable alterations to the climate. But the new study, conducted by a trio of US universities and published in Science, warns that unchecked climate change will prove costly for the whole country. “We are finely balanced at the moment but even areas that will do well end up being harmed if the world warms more severely,” said Robert Kopp, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Rutgers University and another co-author. “That borderline of net harm marches northwards over the course of the century.” “Climate change will be an amplifying factor in pre-existing economic inequalities. The warmest parts of the country are also the poorest parts of the country. Scientists looked at 116 climate projections and ran thousands of simulations of what would happen to the American economy under different emissions scenarios. Should little be done to constrain heat-trapping gases, temperatures could increase by up to 10F (5C) by the end of the century. By analyzing the impacts on agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy use, climate-related deaths and disrupted working conditions, the researchers found that the poorest third of counties in the US are set to experience an income loss of between 2% and 20% in this worst case scenario. As temperatures rise, some crops do well and cold-related deaths can drop off. But any increase in warmth is linked to rising seas and an increase in violent crime, with many aspects of life becoming hard or even unbearable as the temperatures climb further. Heatwaves are expected to pose a growing risk to people’s lives, while the output of workers drops as it gets hotter. Energy use for cooling will grow as temperatures rise, while storms and the advancing seas will take their toll on coastal communities.  States such as Texas, Louisiana and Georgia are expected to fare particularly badly. But Florida could be worst off of all given its low elevation and vulnerable demographics, Kopp said. “Florida is home to a lot of the hardest-hit counties,” he said. “It’s hot, there are plenty of older people there and they will have a lot of coastal flooding and storms. You end up with Florida being the epicenter of these impacts.” The economic cost of climate change will gather pace as temperatures climb, the study found, with an average 0.6% GDP loss from the first 1C of temperature rise compared to 1.7% of GDP lost once the fifth degree of warming is experienced.  Curtailing emissions from power plants, vehicles and agriculture will lessen some of these impacts, however. The research forecasts an average of one death per 100,000 people from climate-related impacts by the end of the century if emissions are radically cut, compared to a toll 10 times higher under “business as usual” conditions. Donald Trump hasn’t acknowledged an economic cost to climate change and has instead pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement and started dismantling various environmental regulations with the stated goal of boosting growth. In his speech announcing the US departure from the Paris accord, Trump said measures to reduce emissions would leave “millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness”. This position has been increasingly challenged by researchers who have found that the cost of addressing climate change will probably be dwarfed by the consequences of rising seas, storms, drought and other maladies.  In 2006, the economist Nicholas Stern released a landmark report for the UK government that warned that at least 5% of global GDP could be lost each year due to climate change.  Meanwhile, the US Environmental Protection Agency has warned the US faces up to $180bn in economic losses by the end of the century due to drought and water shortages, and a separate study from Stanford and Berkeley researchers found that most countries suffer economic losses once average temperatures move beyond 55F."
"Last month was the third-hottest June on record globally, temperature data suggest, confirming 2017 will almost certainly make a hat-trick of annual climate records, with 2015, 2016 and 2017 being the three hottest years since records began. The figures also cement estimations that warming is now at levels not seen for 115,000 years, and leave some experts with little hope for limiting warming to 1.5C or even 2C.  According to new figures from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), June 2017 was the third-hottest June on record, beaten only by the two preceding Junes in 2015 and 2016. The Noaa data show combined land and sea-surface temperatures for June 2017 were 0.82C above the 20th century average, making a string of 41 consecutive Junes above that average. June 2016 still holds the record at 0.92C above the 20th century average, followed by June 2015 which was 0.89C above the baseline. The data line up closely with Nasa figures released last week, which are calculated slightly differently, finding the month was the fourth-hottest on record – with June 1998 also being warmer in their data set. Based on the Nasa data, climate scientist and director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies Gavin Schmidt estimated that 2017 was probably going to be the second-warmest year on record after 2016, but would almost certainly be among the top three hottest years. With update to Jun, 2017 will almost certainly be a top 3 year in the GISTEMP record (most likely 2nd warmest ~57% chance). pic.twitter.com/jiR6cCv1x8 The June data see all of the first six months of 2017 sitting among the three warmest months on record, making it the second-hottest first half of a year on record – again, beaten only by the previous year. The near-record temperatures continued this year despite the passing of El Niño, which normally warms the globe, and its opposite – La Niña – currently suppressing temperatures. The warming trend is almost certainly caused by greenhouse gas emissions – mostly the result of burning fossil fuels – with many studies showing such warm years would be almost impossible without that effect. Last year, Michael Mann from Pennsylvania State University published a paper showing the then-record temperatures in 2014 would have had less than a one in a million chance of occurring naturally. “We have a follow-up article that we’ve submitted showing that the likelihood of three consecutive record-breaking years such as we saw in 2015-2017 was similarly unlikely,” he told the Guardian over email. “In short, we can only explain the onslaught of record warm years by accounting for human-caused warming of the planet.” Andy Pitman from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia said the onslaught of very rapid warming in the past few years is likely a result of the climate system “catching up” after a period of relative slow warming caused by natural variability – the so-called “hiatus”. “I do not think the recent anomalies change anything from a science perspective,” he said. “The Earth is warming at about the long-term rates that were expected and predicted [by models].” But Pitman said the ongoing trend was “entirely inconsistent” with the target of keeping warming at just 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures. Current trends suggest the 1.5C barrier would be breached in the 2040s, with some studies suggesting it might happen much sooner. “In my view, to limit warming to 2C requires both deep and rapid cuts and a climate sensitivity on the lower end of the current range,” Pitman said. “I see no evidence that the climate sensitivity is on the lower end of the current range, unfortunately.” “It would be a good idea to cut greenhouse gas emissions rather faster than we are.”"
"Banks should disclose lending to companies with carbon-related risks, according to recommendations in a new report by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. The TCFD report – part of a G20 initiative led by governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney and former mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg – outlines how companies should disclose climate-related information in their financial filings, with the aim of allowing economies to properly value climate-related risks.   It recommends companies disclose all of their direct and and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, and describe the risks and opportunities caused by climate change under a range of potential scenarios. More than 100 businesses with over $2 trillion of combined annual revenue have publicly committed to adopting the voluntary recommendations. The report follows a draft published in December 2016, for which the TCFD received hundreds of submissions from respondents in 30 countries. “Climate change presents global markets with risks and opportunities that cannot be ignored, which is why a framework around climate-related disclosures is so important,” Bloomberg said in a statement.  “The task force brings that framework to the table, helping investors evaluate the potential risks and rewards of a transition to a lower carbon economy.”  The recommendations were intended to be adopted by all companies, however there was extra guidance given to the financial sector, as well sectors likely to be most affected by climate change or the transition to a lower carbon economy – energy, transportation, construction and agriculture, food, and forestry “Widespread adoption will provide investors, banks and insurers with that information, helping minimise the risk that market adjustments to climate change will be incomplete, late and potentially destabilising,” Carney said in a statement.  The TCFD, led by Bloomberg, was established at the COP21 in Paris by the Financial Sustainability Board (FSB). The FSB was created by the G20 in the aftermath of the 2007-08 global financial crisis and is chaired by Carney. Christian Thimann, head of regulation sustainability at the insurer AXA and a member of the TCFD, said the financial sector had a particular interest in taking up the recommendations. He said insurers like AXA had several reasons to adopt the voluntary code. “We of course have an intrinsic interest in the world fighting against climate change. We see the frequency and intensity of natural disasters linked to climate change augmenting every year,” he said. “We consider a world of plus two degrees may still be insurable but a world of plus four degrees might not be.” He said banks have a shorter outlook than insurers but have an important role in steering the entire economy: “They too can use these recommendations because they will need to steer their lending between sectors aligned with a 2-degree world and sectors not aligned. They need to know which are the sectors with a high risk of stranded assets in the future and those with a low risk of stranded assets in the future.” Yeo Lian Sim, a special advisor to the Singapore Exchange and member of the TCFD said although the recommendations were made as a voluntary code for which there is a compelling business case to adopt, she thought they might one day become regulated for in some economies if they are widely adopted. Over the next year, the TCFD would work to monitor and assist companies implementing their recommendations. Philippe Defosses, chief executive of French pension fund ERAFP and vice chair of the UK’s Institutional Investor Group on Climate Change said: “The more companies report effectively on climate related risks and opportunities, the easier it becomes for investors to allocate the substantial amounts of capital required to implement the Paris Agreement and to work on their own climate risk disclosure.” “There should be no resistance to the widespread adoption on the TCFD’s recommendations given how – in most G20 countries – companies already have legal obligations to disclose material risks in their routine financial filings, including those that related to climate change,” Defosses said. Emma Herd, chief executive of Australia and New Zealand’s Investor Group on Climate Change, said investors see climate change as a material financial risk and are calling on business to disclose their 2C strategy.  “Boards need a plan for managing climate change risks and opportunities that shareholders can see. Having a globally consistent framework for reporting on material climate change risks will accelerate this trend,” she said. Among the companies that publicly supported the recommendations were big miners and resource companies like BHP Billiton, Shell and Glencore; energy businesses like Engie Group; and major banks like HSBC, Bank of America and Citigroup."

"Tackling climate change will be one of the central tasks of the upcoming Hamburg G20 summit of the world’s largest economies, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Thursday, following the US withdrawal from the Paris climate pact.  Merkel, who will host the gathering of global leaders in the northern port city, said the climate change scepticism of the Trump administration made it all the more important for the European Union to show leadership.   “Since the decision of the US to quit the Paris climate agreement, we are more determined than ever to make it successful,” she said. “We must tackle this existential challenge, and we cannot wait until every last person on earth has been convinced of the scientific proof.”  When chairing the summit, Merkel said she would seek to guide talks such that they furthered the goals of the Paris deal, but she conceded that differences with the US meant discussions would not be easy. “The differences are obvious and it would be dishonest to try to cover that up. That I won’t do,” she said, adding that the forum, which meets on 7 and 8 July, would also discuss common approaches to trade, another area in which the Trump administration’s protectionist instincts are at odds with the European Union’s.  “Anybody who believes the problems of the world can be solved with isolationism and protectionism is labouring under a huge error,” Merkel said. Germany on Thursday rejected a request by Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to address ethnic Turks in Germany on the sidelines of the summit.  Berlin-Ankara relations have badly deteriorated amid disputes over Turkey’s mass arrests of alleged state enemies since a failed coup last year and a host of other rights issues.  “I explained weeks ago to my Turkish colleagues that we don’t think that would be a good idea,” the Germany foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said. Merkel promised a renewed drive with France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, to deepen cooperation within the bloc and the eurozone. She said that far from being weakened by Britain’s vote to quit the EU, the bloc would remain united. With the fault lines multiplying, Merkel’s western European allies arrived in Berlin on Thursday to draw up a common battle strategy. “Merkel has called a summit between Europeans because there is a problem with the relationship with Trump,” said a diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity. It’s necessary to ensure European cohesion because within the G20, it’s complicated.” Besides the transatlantic differences, there was also a new European division growing between east and west particularly on the issue of refugees, said Jean-Dominique Giuliani, the president of the Robert Schuman Foundation, a Paris-based thinktank. Trump’s anti-immigration stance has emboldened many of the EU’s ex-communist members in the east, which have staunchly opposed Merkel’s pleas to accept larger shares of the refugees who have flocked to Europe. Trump will head to Warsaw for a summit of central and eastern European leaders likely to include Hungary’s hardline prime minister, Viktor Orbán, a day before the G20, which threatens to deepen divisions. The German foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said it was important for Europe to face up to the US confidently. “We do not want to forcefully separate the US from Europe. But what we don’t want either is to appear like an appendage of US policies,” he said. Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report  "

"The title of David Wallace-Wells’ recent essay in New York magazine is catchy, if not uncomfortable. “The Uninhabitable Earth: Famine, economic collapse, a sun that cooks us: What climate change could wreck – sooner than you think.” The article asks us to peer beyond scientific reticence into a doomsday future. The accounts of mass heat deaths in cities and praying for cornfields in the tundra is disturbing, but they’re familiar. It’s the same frame for how we talk about a much more immediate climate change disaster – US communities at risk to sea level rise today.   We’ve labeled Shishmaref, Alaska, a community that voted to relocate because of climate change impacts last August, a “tragedy of a village built on ice”. We’ve marketed Isle de Jean Charles, Louisiana, the first US town to receive federal funding to relocate, as climate change refugees watching their town slip into the sea. And we ask “Should the United States Save Tangier Island From Oblivion?” on the Chesapeake Bay island’s future.  Each of these follows a recognizable storyline: a vanishing island, a culture slipping away and an ensemble of characters unsure of what their future holds. Each piece tells a cookie-cutter version of a vulnerable village in fear of rising tides and residents as victims on the frontline of climate change.  Shishmaref could stand in for Isle de Jean Charles, which could stand in for Tangier Island. In none of these stories does the community hold agency over their future, empowerment or resiliency. These doomsday narratives are wrong, and they are dangerous. Telling and sharing stories, from the scientific to the personal, is one the most important tools we have to survive climate change. Stories help us to share facts, knowledge and experiences about the causes and effects of a warming world. But more than just educational tools, stories are how we make sense of the world we live in. The story you read in the newspaper or the documentary you watch on Netflix holds the immense ability to shape what we see and don’t see. Those visibilities and invisibilities shift our perspectives. And it’s those perceptions upon which we base our actions. I’m going to repeat that, because it’s really important. The narratives we read, hear and see informs how we understand climate change, and that understanding dictates whether we act or don’t. When we constantly see stories about communities in crisis as sea levels rise and extreme storms become more frequent, we come away with preconceived notions that all communities living on the frontline of climate change are victims in need of saving. On America’s eroding edges, there is no hope – the future is presented as an ominously uncertain but seemingly inevitable defeat. Feeling hopeless about a situation is cognitively associated with inaction and predicts decreased goal-directed behavior. That means when we present humanity as a hopeless victim of climate change, we are less likely to act because the ending seems inevitable. Climate change adaptation only works when we are hopeful for the future and believe that environmentally vulnerable communities have the agency to act. Something simple and concrete that each of us can do? Tell different stories. Instead of presenting narratives of helpless victims and an inevitable future of defeat, we should instead report on the climate change heroes who are doing everything they can to avoid that doomsday scenario. When people see strength in communities, we can overcome limiting labels such as climate change victim and begin to dismantle our prejudices against people in need of resources. We’ve already begun to change the narrative for cities and climate change mitigation. In the aftermath of Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement, city leaders publicly committed to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. Their determination provided the foundation for an optimistic conversation about climate change solutions despite national inaction. Let’s extend that climate of hope to communities along America’s eroding edges by highlighting examples of local solutions. Communities are championing the adaptation solutions that must complement the mitigation triumphs in cities. There are hundreds of stories of America’s sea level rise warriors across red and blue states – I know because I’ve seen them firsthand. Over the past year and a half, my research partner and I have traveled across the US and its territories to interview hundreds of Americans, from Alaska to Alabama to American Samoa. Funded by National Geographic and partnered with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, our aim was to find America’s climate change story. What we found was a story of hope. In American Samoa, community advocate Andra Samoa is restoring the mangroves in her home village of Lenoe to stop shoreline erosion and bring back a healthy ecosystem. In Miami Beach, Florida, Elizabeth Wheaton is installing pumps and raising streets to protect neighborhoods and historic buildings intact. And in the Native village of Shaktoolik, Alaska, Mayor Eugene Asicksik has led the community in building a gravel berm to stave off rising tides. As nonpartisan efforts, community adaptations like these can bond us together as a country and spur national support for action on climate change. I’m the first to admit that hope in the US is hard to come by these days. With the country now ready to pull out of the Paris agreement, it’s hard not to feel like America has entered a four- or eight-year period of stagnation. But hope is a future-oriented emotion. And while it’s predisposed to today’s tragedies, hope is based on the belief that the future can be better than today. It’s possible to be hopeful for tomorrow even when things seem hopeless now. We are at a point today where every decision we make counts in deciding what America’s climate change story will be – including the fundamental decision of how we tell climate change stories. Let’s start telling stories of hope and heroes."

"There have been times in my reporting from disaster zones when I have had the unsettling feeling that I was seeing not just a crisis in the here and now, but getting a glimpse of the future – a preview of where the road we are all on is headed, unless we somehow grab the wheel and swerve. When I listen to Donald Trump speak, with his obvious relish in creating an atmosphere of chaos and destabilisation, I often think: I’ve seen this before, in those strange moments when portals seemed to open up into our collective future. One of those moments arrived in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, as I watched hordes of private military contractors descend on the flooded city to find ways to profit from the disaster, even as thousands of the city’s residents, abandoned by their government, were treated like dangerous criminals just for trying to survive.  I started to notice the same tactics in disaster zones around the world. I used the term “shock doctrine” to describe the brutal tactic of using the public’s disorientation following a collective shock – wars, coups, terrorist attacks, market crashes or natural disasters – to push through radical pro-corporate measures, often called “shock therapy”. Though Trump breaks the mould in some ways, his shock tactics do follow a script, and one that is familiar from other countries that have had rapid changes imposed under the cover of crisis. This strategy has been a silent partner to the imposition of neoliberalism for more than 40 years. Shock tactics follow a clear pattern: wait for a crisis (or even, in some instances, as in Chile or Russia, help foment one), declare a moment of what is sometimes called “extraordinary politics”, suspend some or all democratic norms – and then ram the corporate wishlist through as quickly as possible. The research showed that virtually any tumultuous situation, if framed with sufficient hysteria by political leaders, could serve this softening-up function. It could be an event as radical as a military coup, but the economic shock of a market or budget crisis would also do the trick. Amid hyperinflation or a banking collapse, for instance, the country’s governing elites were frequently able to sell a panicked population on the necessity for attacks on social protections, or enormous bailouts to prop up the financial private sector – because the alternative, they claimed, was outright economic apocalypse. The Republicans under Donald Trump are already seizing the atmosphere of constant crisis that surrounds this presidency to push through as many unpopular, pro-corporate policies. And we know they would move much further and faster given an even bigger external shock. We know this because senior members of Trump’s team have been at the heart of some of the most egregious examples of the shock doctrine in recent memory. Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, has built his career in large part around taking advantage of the profitability of war and instability. ExxonMobil profited more than any oil major from the increase in the price of oil that was the result of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It also directly exploited the Iraq war to defy US state department advice and make an exploration deal in Iraqi Kurdistan, a move that, because it sidelined Iraq’s central government, could well have sparked a full-blown civil war, and certainly did contribute to internal conflict. As CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson profited from disaster in other ways as well. As an executive at the fossil fuel giant, he spent his career working for a company that, despite its own scientists’ research into the reality of human-caused climate change, decided to fund and spread misinformation and junk climate science. All the while, according to an LA Times investigation, ExxonMobil (both before and after Exxon and Mobil merged) worked diligently to figure out how to further profit from and protect itself against the very crisis on which it was casting doubt. It did so by exploring drilling in the Arctic (which was melting, thanks to climate change), redesigning a natural gas pipeline in the North Sea to accommodate rising sea levels and supercharged storms, and doing the same for a new rig off the coast of Nova Scotia. At a public event in 2012, Tillerson acknowledged that climate change was happening – but what he said next was revealing: “as a species”, humans have always adapted. “So we will adapt to this. Changes to weather patterns that move crop production areas around – we’ll adapt to that.” He’s quite right: humans do adapt when their land ceases to produce food. The way humans adapt is by moving. They leave their homes and look for places to live where they can feed themselves and their families. But, as Tillerson well knows, we do not live at a time when countries gladly open their borders to hungry and desperate people. In fact, he now works for a president who has painted refugees from Syria – a country where drought was an accelerant of the tensions that led to civil war – as Trojan horses for terrorism. A president who introduced a travel ban that has gone a long way towards barring Syrian migrants from entering the United States. A president who has said about Syrian children seeking asylum, “I can look in their faces and say: ‘You can’t come.’” A president who has not budged from that position even after he ordered missile strikes on Syria, supposedly moved by the horrifying impacts of a chemical weapon attack on Syrian children and “beautiful babies”. (But not moved enough to welcome them and their parents.) A president who has announced plans to turn the tracking, surveillance, incarceration and deportation of immigrants into a defining feature of his administration. Waiting in the wings, biding their time, are plenty of other members of the Trump team who have deep skills in profiting from all of that. Between election day and the end of Trump’s first month in office, the stocks of the two largest private prison companies in the US, CoreCivic (formerly the Corrections Corporation of America) and the Geo Group, doubled, soaring by 140% and 98%, respectively. And why not? Just as Exxon learned to profit from climate change, these companies are part of the sprawling industry of private prisons, private security and private surveillance that sees wars and migration – both very often linked to climate stresses – as exciting and expanding market opportunities. In the US, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) incarcerates up to 34,000 immigrants thought to be in the country illegally on any given day, and 73% of them are held in private prisons. Little wonder, then, that these companies’ stocks soared on Trump’s election. And soon they had even more reasons to celebrate: one of the first things Trump’s new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, did was rescind the Obama administration’s decision to move away from for-profit jails for the general prison population. Trump appointed as deputy defence secretary Patrick Shanahan, a top executive at Boeing who, at one point, was responsible for selling costly hardware to the US military, including Apache and Chinook helicopters. He also oversaw Boeing’s ballistic missile defence programme – a part of the operation that stands to profit enormously if international tensions continue to escalate under Trump. And this is part of a much larger trend. As Lee Fang reported in the Intercept in March 2017, “President Donald Trump has weaponised the revolving door by appointing defence contractors and lobbyists to key government positions as he seeks to rapidly expand the military budget and homeland security programmes … At least 15 officials with financial ties to defence contractors have been either nominated or appointed so far.” The revolving door is nothing new, of course. Retired military brass reliably take up jobs and contracts with weapons companies. What’s new is the number of generals with lucrative ties to military contractors whom Trump has appointed to cabinet posts with the power to allocate funds – including those stemming from his plan to increase spending on the military, the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security by more than $80bn in just one year. The other thing that has changed is the size of the Homeland Security and surveillance industry. This sector grew exponentially after the September 11 attacks, when the Bush administration announced it was embarking on a never-ending “war on terror”, and that everything that could be outsourced would be. New firms with tinted windows sprouted up like malevolent mushrooms around suburban Virginia, outside Washington DC, and existing ones, such as Booz Allen Hamilton, expanded into brand new territories. Writing in Slate in 2005, Daniel Gross captured the mood of what many called the security bubble: “Homeland security may have just reached the stage that internet investing hit in 1997. Back then, all you needed to do was put an ‘e’ in front of your company name and your IPO would rocket. Now you can do the same with ‘fortress’.” That means many of Trump’s appointees come from firms that specialise in functions that, not so long ago, it would have been unthinkable to outsource. His National Security Council chief of staff, for instance, is retired Lt Gen Keith Kellogg. Among the many jobs Kellogg has had with security contractors since going private was one with Cubic Defense. According to the company, he led “our ground combat training business and focus[ed] on expanding the company’s worldwide customer base”. If you think “combat training” is something armies used to do all on their own, you’d be right. One noticeable thing about Trump’s contractor appointees is how many of them come from firms that did not even exist before 9/11: L-1 Identity Solutions (specialising in biometrics), the Chertoff Group (founded by George W Bush’s homeland security director Michael Chertoff), Palantir Technologies (a surveillance/big data firm cofounded by PayPal billionaire and Trump backer Peter Thiel), and many more. Security firms draw heavily on the military and intelligence wings of government for their staffing. Under Trump, lobbyists and staffers from these firms are now migrating back to government, where they will very likely push for even more opportunities to monetise the hunt for people Trump likes to call “bad hombres”. This creates a disastrous cocktail. Take a group of people who directly profit from ongoing war and then put those same people at the heart of government. Who’s going to make the case for peace? Indeed, the idea that a war could ever definitively end seems a quaint relic of what during the Bush years was dismissed as “pre–September 11 thinking”. And then there’s vice-president Mike Pence, seen by many as the grownup in Trump’s messy room. Yet it is Pence, the former governor of Indiana, who actually has the most disturbing track record when it comes to bloody-minded exploitation of human suffering. When Mike Pence was announced as Donald Trump’s running mate, I thought to myself: I know that name, I’ve seen it somewhere. And then I remembered. He was at the heart of one of the most shocking stories I’ve ever covered: the disaster capitalism free-for-all that followed Katrina and the drowning of New Orleans. Mike Pence’s doings as a profiteer from human suffering are so appalling that they are worth exploring in a little more depth, since they tell us a great deal about what we can expect from this administration during times of heightened crisis. Before we delve into Pence’s role, what’s important to remember about Hurricane Katrina is that, though it is usually described as a “natural disaster”, there was nothing natural about the way it affected the city of New Orleans. When Katrina hit the coast of Mississippi in August 2005, it had been downgraded from a category 5 to a still-devastating category 3 hurricane. But by the time it made its way to New Orleans, it had lost most of its strength and been downgraded again, to a “tropical storm”. That’s relevant, because a tropical storm should never have broken through New Orleans’s flood defence. Katrina did break through, however, because the levees that protect the city did not hold. Why? We now know that despite repeated warnings about the risk, the army corps of engineers had allowed the levees to fall into a state of disrepair. That failure was the result of two main factors. One was a specific disregard for the lives of poor black people, whose homes in the Lower Ninth Ward were left most vulnerable by the failure to fix the levees. This was part of a wider neglect of public infrastructure, which is the direct result of decades of neoliberal policy. Because when you systematically wage war on the very idea of the public sphere and the public good, of course the publicly owned bones of society – roads, bridges, levees, water systems – are going to slip into a state of such disrepair that it takes little to push them beyond the breaking point. When you massively cut taxes so that you don’t have money to spend on much of anything besides the police and the military, this is what happens. It wasn’t just the physical infrastructure that failed the city, and particularly its poorest residents, who are, as in so many US cities, overwhelmingly African American. The human systems of disaster response also failed – the second great fracturing. The arm of the federal government that is tasked with responding to moments of national crisis such as this is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), with state and municipal governments also playing key roles in evacuation planning and response. All levels of government failed. It took Fema five days to get water and food to people in New Orleans who had sought emergency shelter in the Superdome. The most harrowing images from that time were of people stranded on rooftops – of homes and hospitals – holding up signs that said “HELP”, watching the helicopters pass them by. People helped each other as best they could. They rescued each other in canoes and rowboats. They fed each other. They displayed that beautiful human capacity for solidarity that moments of crisis so often intensify. But at the official level, it was the complete opposite. I’ll always remember the words of Curtis Muhammad, a longtime New Orleans civil rights organiser, who said this experience “convinced us that we had no caretakers”. The way this abandonment played out was deeply unequal, and the divisions cleaved along lines of race and class. Many people were able to leave the city on their own – they got into their cars, drove to a dry hotel, called their insurance brokers. Some people stayed because they believed the storm defences would hold. But a great many others stayed because they had no choice – they didn’t have a car, or were too infirm to drive, or simply didn’t know what to do. Those are the people who needed a functioning system of evacuation and relief – and they were out of luck. Abandoned in the city without food or water, those in need did what anyone would do in those circumstances: they took provisions from local stores. Fox News and other media outlets seized on this to paint New Orleans’s black residents as dangerous “looters” who would soon be coming to invade the dry, white parts of the city and surrounding suburbs and towns. Buildings were spray-painted with messages: “Looters will be shot.” Checkpoints were set up to trap people in the flooded parts of town. On Danziger Bridge, police officers shot black residents on sight (five of the officers involved ultimately pleaded guilty, and the city came to a $13.3m settlement with the families in that case and two other similar post-Katrina cases). Meanwhile, gangs of armed white vigilantes prowled the streets looking, as one resident later put it in an exposé by investigative journalist AC Thompson, for “the opportunity to hunt black people”. I was in New Orleans during the flooding and I saw for myself how amped up the police and military were – not to mention private security guards from companies such as Blackwater who were showing up fresh from Iraq. It felt very much like a war zone, with poor and black people in the crosshairs – people whose only crime was trying to survive. By the time the National Guard arrived to organise a full evacuation of the city, it was done with a level of aggression and ruthlessness that was hard to fathom. Soldiers pointed machine guns at residents as they boarded buses, providing no information about where they were being taken. Children were often separated from their parents. What I saw during the flooding shocked me. But what I saw in the aftermath of Katrina shocked me even more. With the city reeling, and with its residents dispersed across the country and unable to protect their own interests, a plan emerged to ram through a pro-corporate wishlist with maximum velocity. The famed free-market economist Milton Friedman, then 93 years old, wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal stating, “Most New Orleans schools are in ruins, as are the homes of the children who have attended them. The children are now scattered all over the country. This is a tragedy. It is also an opportunity to radically reform the educational system.” In a similar vein, Richard Baker, at that time a Republican congressman from Louisiana, declared, “We finally cleaned up public housing in New Orleans. We couldn’t do it, but God did.” I was in an evacuation shelter near Baton Rouge when Baker made that statement. The people I spoke with were just floored by it. Imagine being forced to leave your home, having to sleep in a camping bed in some cavernous convention centre, and then finding out that the people who are supposed to represent you are claiming this was some sort of divine intervention – God apparently really likes condo developments. Baker got his “cleanup” of public housing. In the months after the storm, with New Orleans’s residents – and all their inconvenient opinions, rich culture and deep attachments – out of the way, thousands of public housing units, many of which had sustained minimal storm damage because they were on high ground, were demolished. They were replaced with condos and town houses priced far out of reach for most who had lived there. And this is where Mike Pence enters the story. At the time Katrina hit New Orleans, Pence was chairman of the powerful and highly ideological Republican Study Committee (RSC), a caucus of conservative lawmakers. On 13 September 2005 – just 15 days after the levees were breached, and with parts of New Orleans still under water – the RSC convened a fateful meeting at the offices of the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC. Under Pence’s leadership, the group came up with a list of “Pro-Free-Market Ideas for Responding to Hurricane Katrina and High Gas Prices” – 32 pseudo-relief policies in all, each one straight out of the disaster capitalism playbook. What stands out is the commitment to wage all-out war on labour standards and the public sphere – which is bitterly ironic, because the failure of public infrastructure is what turned Katrina into a human catastrophe in the first place. Also notable is the determination to use any opportunity to strengthen the hand of the oil and gas industry. The list includes recommendations to suspend the obligation for federal contractors to pay a living wage; make the entire affected area a free-enterprise zone; and “repeal or waive restrictive environmental regulations … that hamper rebuilding”. In other words, a war on the kind of red tape designed to keep communities safe from harm. President Bush adopted many of the recommendations within the week, although, under pressure, he was eventually forced to reinstate the labour standards. Another recommendation called for giving parents vouchers to use at private and charter schools (for-profit schools subsidised with tax dollars), a move perfectly in line with the vision held by Trump’s pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Within the year, the New Orleans school system became the most privatised in the US. And there was more. Though climate scientists have directly linked the increased intensity of hurricanes to warming ocean temperatures, that didn’t stop Pence and his committee from calling on Congress to repeal environmental regulations on the Gulf coast, give permission for new oil refineries in the US, and green-light “drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge”. It’s a kind of madness. After all, these very measures are a surefire way to drive up greenhouse gas emissions, the major human contributor to climate change, which leads to fiercer storms. Yet they were immediately championed by Pence, and later adopted by Bush, under the guise of responding to a devastating hurricane. It’s worth pausing to tease out the implications of all of this. Hurricane Katrina turned into a catastrophe in New Orleans because of a combination of extremely heavy weather – possibly linked to climate change – and weak and neglected public infrastructure. The so-called solutions proposed by the group Pence headed at the time were the very things that would inevitably exacerbate climate change and weaken public infrastructure even further. He and his fellow “free-market” travellers were determined, it seems, to do the very things that are guaranteed to lead to more Katrinas in the future. And now Mike Pence is in a position to bring this vision to the entire United States. The oil industry wasn’t the only one to profit from Hurricane Katrina. Immediately after the storm, the whole gang of contractors who had descended on Baghdad when war broke out – Bechtel, Fluor, Halliburton, Blackwater, CH2M Hill and Parsons, infamous for its sloppy Iraq work – now arrived in New Orleans. They had a singular vision: to prove that the kinds of privatised services they had been providing in Iraq and Afghanistan also had an ongoing domestic market – and to collect no-bid contracts totalling $3.4bn. The controversies were legion. Relevant experience often appeared to have nothing to do with how contracts were allocated. Take, for example, the company that Fema paid $5.2m to perform the crucial role of building a base camp for emergency workers in St Bernard Parish, a suburb of New Orleans. The camp construction fell behind schedule and was never completed. Under investigation, it emerged that the contractor, Lighthouse Disaster Relief, was in fact a religious group. “About the closest thing I have done to this is just organise a youth camp with my church,” confessed Lighthouse’s director, Pastor Gary Heldreth. After all the layers of subcontractors had taken their cut, there was next to nothing left for the people doing the work. Author Mike Davis tracked the way Fema paid Shaw $175 per sq ft to install blue tarps on damaged roofs, even though the tarps themselves were provided by the government. Once all the subcontractors took their share, the workers who actually hammered in the tarps were paid as little as $2 per sq ft. “Every level of the contracting food chain, in other words, is grotesquely overfed except the bottom rung,” Davis wrote, “where the actual work is carried out.” These supposed “contractors” were really – like the Trump Organization – hollow brands, sucking out profit and then slapping their name on cheap or non-existent services. In order to offset the tens of billions going to private companies in contracts and tax breaks, in November 2005 the Republican-controlled Congress announced that it needed to cut $40bn from the federal budget. Among the programmes that were slashed: student loans, Medicaid and food stamps. So, the poorest people in the US subsidised the contractor bonanza twice: first, when Katrina relief morphed into unregulated corporate handouts, providing neither decent jobs nor functional public services; and second, when the few programmes that assist the unemployed and working poor nationwide were gutted to pay those bloated bills. New Orleans is the disaster capitalism blueprint – designed by the current vice-president and by the Heritage Foundation, the hard-right think tank to which Trump has outsourced much of his administration’s budgeting. Ultimately, the response to Katrina sparked an approval ratings freefall for George W Bush, a plunge that eventually lost the Republicans the presidency in 2008. Nine years later, with Republicans now in control of Congress and the White House, it’s not hard to imagine this test case for privatised disaster response being adopted on a national scale. The presence of highly militarised police and armed private soldiers in New Orleans came as a surprise to many. Since then, the phenomenon has expanded exponentially, with local police forces across the country outfitted to the gills with military-grade gear, including tanks and drones, and private security companies frequently providing training and support. Given the array of private military and security contractors occupying key positions in the Trump administration, we can expect all of this to expand further with each new shock. The Katrina experience also stands as a stark warning to those who are holding out hope for Trump’s promised $1tn in infrastructure spending. That spending will fix some roads and bridges, and it will create jobs. Crucially, Trump has indicated that he plans to do as much as possible not through the public sector but through public-private partnerships – which have a terrible track record for corruption, and may result in far lower wages than true public-works projects would. Given Trump’s business record, and Pence’s role in the administration, there is every reason to fear that his big-ticket infrastructure spending could become a Katrina-like kleptocracy, a government of thieves, with the Mar-a-Lago set helping themselves to vast sums of taxpayer money. New Orleans provides a harrowing picture of what we can expect when the next shock hits. But sadly, it is far from complete: there is much more that this administration might try to push through under cover of crisis. To become shock-resistant, we need to prepare for that, too.

"Biofuel use needs to increase to help fight climate change as liquid fuels will be needed by aircraft and ships for many decades to come, finds a new report requested by the UK government.  The Royal Academy of Engineering report says, however, that some biofuels, such as diesel made from food crops, have led to more emissions than those produced by the fossil fuels they were meant to replace. Instead, the report says, rising biofuel production should make more use of waste, such as used cooking oil and timber.   Ten years ago biofuels were seen as ideal, low-carbon, replacements for the liquid fossil fuels that power the majority of the world’s transport systems. But concerns grew that first-generation biofuels, made from food crops, were increasing food prices and were often as polluting as fossil fuels when all factors in their production were considered. The new report combines more than 250 analyses of the impact of biofuels around the world, including how demand for food-based biofuels drives the destruction of forests and peatlands when farmers expand into additional areas – the most contentious issue.  It also warns that the promise of clean biofuels from algae remains far off, with current versions much worse than diesel. The researchers found that when land use changes were accounted for, all the significant types of biodiesel – palm oil, soybean, rapeseed and sunflowers – caused more carbon emissions than diesel itself.  Accounting for land use change is complex, but even if this factor is ignored only palm oil has led to a reduction of 50% in emissions compared with diesel, the level required by EU rules. Bioethanol, which replaces petrol (gasoline) and is produced from corn, wheat, sugarcane and sugar beet, failed to meet the 50% reduction when land use change was included. Wheat-based bioethanol was the worst performer, actually producing more carbon emissions than petrol. By contrast, the use of waste from farms and forestry, and from used cooking oil, to make biofuels, always cut emissions compared with the performance of fossil fuels. In some cases, such as using waste stalks and cobs from corn, biofuels could have near-zero emissions overall.  Under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations order, biofuel must be blended into petrol and diesel in the UK today at a rate of 4.75%. A rise towards the 10% EU-wide target by 2020 has stalled due to the environmental concerns. The authors says their report is intended to break that impasse. “Overall our evidence [is] that the sustainability risk of increasing levels of biofuels can be managed and the government should be confident of increasing the mandate for biofuels,” said Nilay Shah, a professor at Imperial College London and one of the team who produced the report. In the future, non-food crops such as miscanthus grass, could be grown on poor quality land, he said. Wheat is an important source of bioethanol in the UK, with crops covering about 99,000 acres (more than 40,000 hectares) in 2015-16. But it is not clear if the land use changes that make wheat a poor biofuel apply in the UK, as the study combined data from all over the world. The 2020 target was going to be missed, both in the UK and elsewhere, said Shah, as ramping up production in a sustainable way would take time. “That would be a big challenge – realistically it is a five- to 10-year timescale,” he said. Despite the fast growth in electric cars, Shah said biofuels would be needed as a key part of tackling climate change because no significant alternatives for liquid fuels were available for aircraft, ships and long-distance HGVs. “The scope for electrification is quite limited for at least several decades.” Progress towards producing better biofuels has been challenging. British Airways abandoned a £340m scheme to create jet fuel from London’s rubbish in January 2016, although in the same month the US navy launched its first aircraft carriers powered by biofuels. James Beard, a climate and energy specialist at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF-UK), said: “Unsustainable biofuels can do more damage than good and should be phased out. But not all biofuels are bad. Certified sustainable biofuels will be needed in sectors that are tricky to de-carbonise, like aviation.” John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “While those promoting biofuels start with good intentions, the tendency, especially when it comes to land use, is for things to go horribly wrong. A much safer way to cut emissions is promoting energy efficiency, electric vehicles, and looking at mobility in a much broader way than just how to fuel people’s cars.”"
"The Guardian’s coverage of the global plastic bottle crisis (Surge in plastic bottle use sparks global alert, 29 June) has been powerful and compelling. Like so many of the environmental challenges we face, this issue has been largely ignored in the mainstream, which has led us to the extraordinary situation where we have one million bottles being bought every minute globally. Britain’s contribution to this problem is significant. We use a staggering 38.5m plastic bottles each day, accounting for roughly 40% of litter by volume found in our environment along with cans. We’ve all read in horror the stories of whales’ stomachs filled with plastic waste, and we’ve all seen bottles littering our local communities. The government must take responsibility for this growing crisis. One easy step forward would be to introduce a bottle deposit scheme. Such systems were commonplace in the UK until the 1980s, and are used in 11 other European countries. The concept is simple: you pay a small deposit on bottles and take them back to the shop you bought them from after use for recycling. The Scottish government has taken a major step towards introducing such a scheme – now the Tories must follow suit. We should also be ensuring that it’s easier for people to refill water bottles in shops and other businesses. This week has shown that the government is far more pliant towards the will of parliament than previously, and I’m hoping to build a cross-party coalition on this issue in the coming weeks so that Britain becomes a world leader in tackling plastic bottle pollution.Caroline Lucas MPCo-leader, Green party of England and Wales  • It is not just bottles and carrier bags – 99% of my non-recyclable, non-biodegradable waste is plastic wrappers from supermarkets. It is time to force our supermarkets to stop using plastic. If not, they should lose our custom. Plastic-free July challenge anyone?Lorrie MarchingtonHigh Peak, Derbyshire • Unfortunately it is not as simple as putting an empty plastic bottle into a recycling bin. Manufacturers are increasingly putting thin plastic wrappers around plastic bottles. Details of the contents are printed on to the wrapper instead of directly on the bottle. The advantage to the manufacturer is that they can use a generic plastic bottle for several, or many, different contents. Unfortunately using such a wrapper renders the bottle not recyclable. Instead, the sorting machine classifies wrapped bottles as “mixed materials” and they are sent to landfill not to be reused. This, then, is a plea to manufacturers to stop using plastic wrappers on plastic bottles. Perhaps government intervention will be required to make all plastic bottles recyclable.David HurryHurstpierpoint, West Sussex • Italy is responding to the plastic bottle problem by installing refill stations in many towns. Water costs 5 cents a litre and there’s a choice of still or sparkling. They’re heavily used, judging by our experiences in Carloforte, Sardinia.Cary BazalgetteLondon • Immediately after a full-page item on the danger to the planet of plastic bottles comes a full-page M&S ad offering free water with any sandwich, salad and crisps.Anne BoothReading, Berkshire • In response to the article (Taxpayer cost of dismantling North Sea rigs rises by billions, 29 June), the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) has a chance to extend the life of some of the UK’s offshore assets by reusing some of the infrastructure for carbon capture and storage (CCS). There are opportunities for carbon dioxide to be permanently stored in depleted oil and gas fields, thereby helping to meet UK climate goals, extending the life of certain offshore assets, reducing the cost of decommissioning and helping to retain jobs. Only this week the Committee on Climate Change, in its 2017 progress report to parliament, reaffirmed the importance of CCS to ensuring the lowest cost route to meeting the UK’s 2050 emissions reduction target. Claire Perry, the new minister of state for climate change and industry, has confirmed that the government’s much-delayed Clean Growth Plan will be published this autumn. This must include a new approach to CCS which brings much-needed confidence to the industry and at the same time gives the OGA a strong mandate to consider CCS as part of a wider asset-retention strategy.Judith ShapiroThe Carbon Capture and Storage Association • Deloitte, the firm that undertook the economic valuation of the Great Barrier Reef (Recognising the values that money can’t measure, 29 June), was one of a group of accountancy firms unleashed on Britain’s public sector in the late 1980s by the Thatcher government. Since when, with New Labour’s collusion, our public services (at least what’s left of them) have been overwhelmed by bean counters and box tickers. It’s called performance management but in reality it means that what counts is what can be counted and if it can’t be counted then it doesn’t count. So much for qualities like thoughtfulness, kindness, compassion and responsiveness which should lie at the heart of the user’s experience of health and social care but which can’t be measured. The drive to quantify (and then commodify) all aspects of life has masked the spread of a culture of uncare that permeates our relations with non-human nature as much as our relations with each other. And, as your editorial indicates, this applies even when the attempt to quantify is driven by a benign intent, as with the Barrier Reef. Quantification turns what should be sacred into something profane because what really counts for our life on this earth is precisely what cannot be counted.Paul HoggettChair, Climate Psychology Alliance • I was heartened to read your editorial and recognise that it exposes a fundamental flaw in human society. The sad truth is that many of our environmentally concerned people and organisations find they have to talk the language of “eco-system services”, whereby they try to put a price on the natural world in terms of its benefit to us. They do this because there is no tradition of thought in western society that gives nature value in itself. None of our great philosophical or religious traditions have clearly articulated a value for nature or of human beings as creaturely participants in the natural world. They have focused instead on human beings as “above and in contrast to nature” and therefore to be served by it. This is the deep cause of climate change and one that desperately needs addressing if, as you say, we are to “unbleach” our souls.Chris SunderlandBristol • You have had a number of articles over the last few months about private contractor Amey’s felling of trees in Sheffield and Patrick Barkham has written about the importance of the trees and their sad loss. Now local residents have learned that a surviving elm tree in Chelsea Road, Brincliffe, which they thought Amey had agreed to leave, is to be felled after all, despite their campaign to save it. The tree is of national importance not only as an old elm but also because it provides a home for a colony of rare white-letter hairstreak butterflies. Is there nothing that can be done to stop the Amey steamroller? If not, let other councils beware and learn the lesson of Sheffield: do not use Amey to maintain your roads!Jacky CreswickChester  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • This article was amended on 11 July 2017 to clarify Caroline Lucas’ letter was referring to litter by volume."

"Theresa May will raise the issue of climate change with Donald Trump this weekend when the pair meet for the first time since she lost her majority in the general election. They will talk at the G20 summit in Hamburg, which runs on Friday and Saturday. The two leaders will hold a formal bilateral meeting, at which the prime minister plans to tell the US president she does not believe the Paris climate change agreement needs to be renegotiated.  Trump caused consternation worldwide last month when he confirmed that he wanted to withdraw from the pact. May was criticised at the time for not signing a letter sent by several European governments condemning the move – though she insisted she had discussed it with him directly. But a senior government official said the prime minister would be “stressing that the UK remains fully committed to the Paris agreement. She will say that we don’t see any need for renegotiation – we support the Paris agreement because it delivers.” May and Trump are also expected to discuss this week’s North Korean missile test, with the prime minister stressing that it is essential the international community is united in condemnation of North Korea’s actions. Barry Gardiner, Labour’s shadow cabinet minister dealing with climate change, called for a more robust approach on climate, saying the prime minister should “take President Trump to task” for his announcement that the US will quit the international accord to address dangerous global warming. Gardiner said: “A Labour prime minister would make clear that the UK stands by the Paris agreement and that America is diminished by the president’s foolish and shortsighted decision to withdraw.” May and Trump’s last face-to-face meeting was at the G7 in Sicily, in an unscheduled “pull aside” in which Downing street said they “reaffirmed their commitment to increasing trade between the UK and the US, including a post-Brexit trade deal”. The prime minister was later criticised for failing to sign up to a joined up statement from the G7’s EU leaders – Germany’s Angela Merkel, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s Paolo Gentiloni – saying the Paris accord could not be renegotiated. The trio said: “We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies.” Downing Street stressed that the UK had responded in a normal way to the situation, and that the other G7 countries, Canada and Japan, had not signed up to the statement either.    Since May’s last meeting with Trump the US president caused anger in the UK by misquoting the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, following the London bridge terror attack last month. Trump castigated Khan on Twitter, saying the mayor had said there was “no reason to be alarmed” by the attack. Khan had in fact said this about the increased and armed police presence in London after the attack. Trump had been due to hold a state visit to the UK over the summer, which was set to be dogged by mass protests. However, this appears to have been indefinitely put back, with Trump reportedly telling May he did not want to make the trip if the British public did not support him. While Downing Street has insisted the plans have not changed, Trump’s arrival was not mentioned in last month’s Queen’s speech, as is normal for state visits, indicating has not been fixed for the two-year period covered by the address."

"A dramatic growth in electric vehicles on Britain’s roads could see peak electricity demand jump by more than the capacity of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station by 2030, according to National Grid. The number of plug-in cars and vans could reach 9m by 2030, up from around 90,000 today, said the company, which runs the UK’s national transmission networks for electricity and gas.  The impact of charging so many cars’ batteries would be to reverse the trend in recent years of falling electricity demand, driven by energy efficiency measures such as better refrigerators and LED lighting. If electric vehicles were not charged smartly to avoid peaks and troughs in power demand, such as when people return home between 5pm and 6pm, peak demand could be as much as 8GW higher in 2030, National Grid said.  Shifting the charging of cars to times when demand is lower would reduce the extra peak demand to 3.5GW, a smaller amount but still a similar capacity to the new reactors being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The forecasts are contained in the grid’s Future Energy Scenarios report, published just days after Volvo said all its new cars would be electric or hybrid from 2019 and France pledged to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040. “Electric vehicles are coming – how quickly is the question,” said Roisin Quinn, head of strategy at National Grid, adding that she expected battery-powered car sales to take off in the mid-2020s.  While there was uncertainty over when falling electricity demand would be reversed, she said: “It’s a big moment when demand starts to go up again.” National Grid acknowledged the cars’ batteries could also provide services and return power for the grid at a time when managing the network is becoming increasingly complex as variable sources of wind and solar power grow. But it cautioned that there was “still debate over whether it will become commercially viable to flow electricity from a vehicle back onto the network to provide network services”. Quinn said a large share of power from renewables had “already become a reality”, and three of the report’s four scenarios predict that solar power will have the biggest share of generation capacity by 2050. In all of the scenarios, new nuclear power stations are assumed to be built and the capacity of interconnectors that provide backup power from Europe rises from 4GW now to between 10GW and 19GW in 2030. Fracking for shale gas is expected to produce zero gas in two of the greener scenarios. However, in one scenario of high fracking, shale gas is projected to provide 32bn cubic metres by 2031, a similar amount to the 36bn cubic metres the North Sea provided last year. Regardless of how much of the UK’s gas comes from fracking, National Grid sees gas as playing a key role in power and heating for decades. It is not until 2050 in some of the group’s scenarios that alternative, electric heating technologies such as heat pumps begin to overtake gas for keeping homes warm. “The story around gas is that it’s critical to our supply now and will continue to be in future,” said Quinn. “We see it as having a long-term role as a reliable, cost effective and flexible energy source, and it will be favoured by many consumers.” But with North Sea gas production declining, National Grid expects the UK’s dependence on gas imports to continue for decades, to some degree. More liquefied natural gas is also expected to be shipped to the UK in the future. Climate change could also pose new challenges, with the UK forecast to get hotter. As temperatures warm, the use of air conditioning in summer could cause peak electricity demand to reach the levels normally seen in winter. National Grid did not take a view on the costs of the scenarios in the report, which was published just a day after a consumer group accused energy networks, including National Grid, of earning £7.5bn in unjustified profits over an eight-year period."
"In the lead-up to the 2015 general election in the United Kingdom, the leaders of the three major parties sat down together and signed a statement on climate-change policy that would seem unimaginable to Australians. They agreed that “climate change is one of the most serious threats facing the world today” and undertook “to work together across party lines to agree carbon budgets in accordance with the Climate Change Act”. They pledged “to accelerate the transition to a competitive, energy-efficient, low-carbon economy and to end the use of unabated coal for power generation”, meaning that the last coal-fired power station will be closed in the United Kingdom in 2025 at the latest. The 2015 UK election – true to the pledge signed by party leaders – saw no real debate over climate change or energy policy, other than a minor skirmish over the balance between onshore and offshore wind power. In the context of the deep cuts in pollution and the profound transition in the energy sector agreed by the parties, the absence of bare-knuckled fighting over these policies was amazing for Australian observers. Within 12 months, UK politics was then thrown into turmoil by the referendum decision to terminate the nation’s membership of the European Union – Brexit. But in the wake of that momentous vote, the Committee on Climate Change still recommended an ambitious carbon reduction target for the five-year period 2028-32 that is equivalent to Australia committing to a 61% cut against the 2005 baseline used by the Australian government. The budget was quietly endorsed by both parties shortly after.  The politics of climate change could hardly be more different in Australia than they appear to be in the UK. Climate change – or “global warming” – only emerged as a political issue across the world less than 30 years ago. In that time, Australia has been unable to reach an enduring consensus about even the core elements of a policy response to an issue that scientists agree will present enormous challenges to our vulnerable continent. And, on the rare occasions a consensus has appeared to be forming, it has been struck down by a combination of industry, media and political opposition. In the earliest days of climate change politics, the parties were much closer. The global Toronto conference of 1988 had called upon the world’s developed nations to stabilise emissions at 1988 levels by 2000, and to reduce them by 20% by 2005. Just before the 1990 election, Labor’s Graham Richardson convinced cabinet to adopt the Toronto position as an “interim” target. Liberal leader Andrew Peacock took an even more ambitious position to the 1990 election: which lasted through John Hewson’s leadership and the 1993 election. But those plans – and the political consensus that underpinned them – started to unravel in the wake of the 1991 recession. A number of state Labor governments fell to new Liberal administrations that were heavily influenced by hardline neoliberal thinking. And, across the world, industry groups and rightwing thinktanks started to push back against the momentum that had been building around global action on climate change since Toronto. This pushback was built on two pillars; to emphasise the economic downside of taking action on climate change, and to introduce doubt into the public discussion about the science. John Howard embraced the rightwing handbook. While every additional scientific report added to the consensus about human activity’s role in changing the climate, Howard and most of his ministers framed the matter as a continuing “debate” that was not yet settled. Howard’s ability to express his true views about this policy area expanded with the election of George W Bush in 2000. Under Bush and Howard, Australia and the United States became the only two developed nations not to ratify the Kyoto protocol (until Kevin Rudd did so in 2007). But things were not all going Howard’s way. Labor state governments moved to fill the vacuum in climate and renewable energy policy Howard had left at a national level. States enacted a range of programs to support greater energy efficiency and the spread of renewable energy. They also established the National Emissions Trading Taskforce in 2004 to build pressure for a market mechanism to bring down carbon pollution. A range of other factors started to swing the momentum back in favour of action on climate change. The devastating millennium drought in Australia almost certainly increased public consciousness of a changing climate, as well as support for action. And globally, Al Gore’s 2006 film, An Inconvenient Truth, popularised the cause of climate action. Howard started to look out of touch, finally yielded to that pressure and announced that his government would introduce an emissions trading scheme (ETS) to commence in 2011. It’s tempting to view Howard’s capitulation to pressure on the ETS as evidence of a broader acceptance of the science of climate change and the need to take strong action. But in 2013, Howard himself admitted that his 2007 policy was simply a political device – nothing more than a pragmatic recognition that he was facing, to use his words, a “perfect storm” politically against a Labor opposition that had more “fashionable views” on such matters. Rudd became prime minister in 2007 with huge public support for his plan to take strong action on climate change. Rudd decided to act on the basis that the major parties had reached a consensus on the establishment of an ETS. Throughout that period, though, the Liberal opposition argued that it should all be put off until after the Copenhagen climate conference scheduled for the end of 2009, a tactic that helped to delay the day of reckoning within the Liberal party room. Rudd has been criticised for not being more conciliatory to Turnbull. This conveniently ignores the broader political environment of the time. While the government’s climate policy was an important one, Rudd was locking horns with Turnbull over a range of other contested policy areas. Turnbull’s problem was not that Rudd wasn’t being nice enough to him – it was that the right wing in the Coalition was on the move. In November 2009, Penny Wong and the Coalition’s climate change spokesman, Ian Macfarlane, negotiated a package that could be passed through the parliament, but Turnbull was replaced as Liberal leader within days by Tony Abbott and a secret ballot of the Coalition party room rejected the Wong–Macfarlane agreement. Any prospect of consensus between the major parties had been dealt a death blow. On Abbott’s first full day as Liberal leader, the Greens inexplicably delivered him an enormous strategic victory, voting with him to defeat Rudd’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. This short-sighted tactical manoeuvre allowed Abbott to begin to build the momentum that has hamstrung long-term climate action for almost a decade. Had the CPRS passed the parliament in 2009, an emissions trading scheme would likely have been operating for some years before Abbott was able to become prime minister. And it’s likely that Abbott would not have been able to build a platform to tear down such a large reform after that time. In the wake of that Senate defeat, Rudd invested enormous political capital in the prospects of the annual climate conference to reinvigorate momentum around climate action in Australia. But the Copenhagen conference proved to be a disaster. The optics of the meeting were dominated by a breakdown between developing nations (especially China) and the developed world. Rudd reached the end of 2009 confronted by a broad sense in the community that the consensus around climate change that appeared to have existed in 2007 lay in tatters. Labor’s political position on climate change was allowed to drift through the first few months of 2010 while the new opposition leader, Abbott, worked tirelessly attacking Labor’s “great big tax on everything”. The drift ended when a decision by the government’s leadership to put the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme “on ice” was leaked to journalist Lenore Taylor. The community reacted strongly. Labor lost the support of around 1 million voters in just a fortnight. One voter told me in my electorate of Port Adelaide, “I was never really sold on the whole climate issue, but was willing to back you in anyway – but when you just suddenly dropped the thing because things got too hard, you lost me. I thought you were all piss-weak.” Within weeks, Rudd was replaced by Julia Gillard as Labor leader and prime minister. The new PM immediately reiterated her support for strong climate policy, promising to “reprosecute the case for a carbon price at home and abroad” if re-elected later that year. But Gillard was alive to the ferocity of the attack on climate policy by Abbott and the deterioration in community confidence about the best way forward. She tried to break the logjam by announcing a citizen’s assembly that would be tasked with developing a consensus, an idea Gillard later conceded was “probably very naive”. Gillard was judged more for her commitment that “there will be no ‘carbon tax’ under the government I lead”. Though she also said near the end of the campaign, “I don’t rule out the possibility of a CPRS, a market-based mechanism.” In late 2011 Gillard and minister for climate change Greg Combet achieved passage of a world-leading package of measures to reduce carbon pollution and shift the Australian economy to a clean energy future. This period was undoubtedly the low-point for any political consensus around climate change in Australia. Abbott led a campaign against the “carbon tax” that was unprecedented in its relentless and hysterical nature. The Liberals and their fellow travellers repeated lie. Outside Parliament House, Abbott and other Liberal frontbenchers joined protests featuring signs describing Gillard as “Juliar” and “Bob Brown’s Bitch”. Sydney broadcaster Alan Jones suggested on radio that the prime minister should be taken “out to sea in a chaff bag”, and that her father had “died of shame”. The lived experience of the government’s reforms demonstrated his claims to be massively overblown. Many areas of the economy saw no impact whatsoever. Woolworths confirmed that only five products increased in price as a result of the “carbon tax” from its range of 40,000. The most significant price impact was seen in electricity, given the high reliance in Australia on coal-fired power. But that impact was modest compared to the price increases seen in previous years from the gold-plating of the electricity networks. And Labor’s household assistance package lifted pensions and benefits to cover the projected price impacts, as well as tripling the tax-free threshold for wage earners There is little evidence that Labor’s price on carbon had much to do with our eventual election loss in 2013. Polling conducted by JWS Research found that only 3% of Coalition voters nominated “repealing the carbon tax” as the most important in the Coalition toolkit, less than the number motivated to vote for the Coalition on the basis of its roads policy. To the limited extent that the carbon tax did contribute to Labor’s loss of government, it was more a product of the attack Abbott made that Gillard’s decision to introduce an ETS was a breach of her promise that there would be no carbon tax under her government. In early 2017, Peta Credlin admitted that Gillard’s policy “wasn’t a carbon tax, as you know … but we made it a carbon tax”. It’s clear, that we underestimated the power of this point of attack. Gillard’s dismissal of Abbott’s accusation as a “silly little collateral debate” fell flat with too many voters. The truth is that we in Labor had sent too many mixed signals about climate policy in the previous few years. When he described climate change as the “greatest moral, economic and social challenge of our time”, Rudd gave voice to many in the community whose frustration at Howard’s inaction on climate change had reached breaking point. But then, Rudd’s decision to drop the legislation we’d argued would meet that challenge led many people to doubt the depth of Labor’s commitment and courage. Abbott’s repeal of all of Australia’s climate change laws represented the first time any country had reversed a decision to place a price on carbon. It was a heavy blow, but one that had been clearly telegraphed. By contrast, Abbott had given no indication of any intention to walk away from the long-standing bipartisan support for Australia’s renewable energy Target (RET). Bipartisan support for the RET was a critical factor in attracting local and overseas businesses to make investments lasting several decades. But, in just one infamous radio interview with the well-known opponent of renewable energy, Alan Jones, Tony Abbott brought that all undone. Abbott announced that he would conduct a review of the RET “because the renewable energy targets are having an impact on prices”. Unsurprisingly, investors were shellshocked by Abbott’s decision to walk away from this election commitment. Investment collapsed by 88%, and thousands of jobs were lost. Labor was deeply concerned that, if the investor uncertainty around renewables was allowed to drift, the industry would simply walk away from Australia. For that reason, we accepted the calls from the renewable energy industry to negotiate a revised bipartisan position on the RET. The revised RET will ensure that around 23% of Australia’s electricity is generated from renewable energy by 2020 – higher than Labor’s original 2007 election policy to achieve 20% by 2020. After only two years in the job, Abbott was replaced as prime minister in September 2015. Pollsters reported widespread relief among voters at the demise of Abbott and his abrasive brand of hard-rightwing politics. Many Australians remember that Turnbull said in 2009 that he “would not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am”. And people broadly respected that principled stance. Any hope that Turnbull’s return to the leadership would herald a shift in climate policy faded quickly. Coalition MPs told reporters that Turnbull was only supported to return as leader on the condition that he promised to retain Abbott’s climate and energy policies in full. Turnbull described Labor’s 50% renewable energy commitment (by 2030) as “reckless” and waxed lyrical about the effectiveness of Abbott’s Direct Action policy. Abbott’s Direct Action legislation requires a review of the scheme to be conducted in 2017. Some optimists held out hope that the Turnbull of 2009 would again find his voice, but Turnbull’s announcement of this review just before Christmas 2016 removed any doubt about his intentions. His minister Josh Frydenberg quite reasonably indicated that the review would consider adopting an “emissions intensity scheme” in the electricity sector, a rare opportunity for a bipartisan reform in energy policy. But Abbott and rightwing warrior Senator Cory Bernadi opposed the scheme even being considered. Their public warnings to Turnbull frightened him into overruling his minister in just 36 hours. And, with that, any real hope that the 2017 review would yield positive change on climate change policy disappeared.  • This is an edited extract of Climate Wars by Mark Butler, out 3 July from MUP.

"The much-discussed boom in coal-fired power in south-east Asia is being bankrolled by foreign governments and banks, with the vast majority of projects apparently too risky for the private sector.  Environmental analysts at activist group Market Forces examined 22 deals involving 13.1 gigawatts of coal-fired power in Indonesia and found that 91% of the projects had the backing of foreign governments through export credit agencies or development banks. Export credit agencies, which provide subsidised loans to overseas projects to assist export industries in their home countries, were involved in 64% of the deals and provided 45% of the total lending. The majority of the money was coming from Japan and China, with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) involved in five deals and the Export-Import Bank of China (Cexim) involved in seven deals. All the deals closed between January 2010 and March 2017. The China Development Bank was the biggest development bank lending to the projects, imparting $3bn, with a further $240m in development funds coming from Korea’s Korea Development Bank. The lending comes despite the world’s biggest development bank – the World Bank – warning last year that plans to build more coal-fired power plants in Asia would be a “disaster for the planet” and overwhelm the deal forged at Paris to fight climate change. “Right now, several key countries supporting the Paris climate change agreement are actively undermining it by trying to expand the polluting coal-power sector in other countries,” said Julien Vincent, executive director of Market Forces. According to the International Energy Agency, the world needs to phase out coal-power by 2050 in order to keep warming under 2C. “We wouldn’t have this massive spread of new coal-fired power if public finance institutions weren’t making them bankable,” Vincent told the Guardian. The government-backed banks offer low interest and long-term loans, transferring risk from the private sector to the taxpayer and offering other lenders confidence in the projects. “As early as 2015, private capital investments into clean energy were already double those into fossil fuels. Private investors are vacating the field in terms of coal and putting their money into renewable energy,” said Vincent. He said preliminary analysis of projects that are in the pipeline in Indonesia and Vietnam, but haven’t yet reached financial close, show the trend is set to continue into the future unless governments – especially Japan and China – change their attitude. “There’s probably almost 20 gigawatts of coal power that will go ahead pretty much because it’s got public finance,” Vincent said. The push of financing comes as Japan, China and Korea move to cut plans for coal-power in their own countries. Vincent said the moves were related, since Indonesia was now seen as a testing ground for new coal-fired power station technology. The coal industry says plans for new power stations in Indonesia and Vietnam is evidence of the promise of new-build coal-fired power stations."
"Local councils across Australia are taking climate action into their own hands as climate policy paralysis plagues the federal government.  Thirty-five have pledged to switch to renewable energy, build sustainable transport, and develop greener, efficient and more climate-resilient communities. The pledges by the councils, which serve three million Australians, were made as part of the Climate Council’s launch of the Cities Power Partnership, which encourages towns and cities via local governments to reduce emissions and increase resilience. The launch came as the Climate Council released a report showing the unique threats and opportunities climate change poses for Australian towns and cities, and highlighting earlier findings that 70% of the emissions reductions required to keep global warming at 2C can be achieved by making changes at the local level. “Cities and towns are leading the way in Australia with many putting the federal government to shame,” said the Climate Council chief executive, Amanda McKenzie. “This follows the US example where 250 mayors have committed to the Paris agreement in spite of the Trump withdrawal.” Councils from every state and territory except South Australia signed the pledge, and included Canberra, Alice Springs, Newcastle, North Sydney, Kur-ring-gai and Penrith. The participating councils will select five actions from a list of 32 that will help them achieve the aims of the partnership, and will report on their progress every six months. The possibilities include rolling out energy-efficient street lighting, setting minimum energy-efficiency benchmarks for planning applications, ensuring new developments maximise public transport use, and setting renewable energy or emissions-reduction targets. The report also highlights the number of councils already implementing many of the 32 options for action. The chief councillor of the Climate Council, Tim Flannery, urged “councils across the rest of Australia to take the pledge and get on with the job of combatting climate change”. Writing in the Conversation, the Climate Council councillor and scientist Lesley Hughes said: “Ultimately, the [Cities Power Partnership] is designed to help local communities sidestep the political roadblocks at national level, and just get on with the job of implementing climate policies.”"
"A new paper just published in the Journal of Climate is a stunning setback for the darling of cherry-picking for contrarian scientists and elected officials. Let’s walk though this so we appreciate the impact.  The vast majority of scientists know that the climate is changing, humans are the main reason, and there are going to be severe consequences. We have decades of measurements that prove our understanding of this process. There is simply no debate or dispute.   Despite this, there are a shrinking number of contrarian scientists, elected officials, and industry representatives that have spent endless time trying to downplay the impact. They have variously argued that the climate isn’t changing, that the changes won’t be very much, or that there are no viable solutions to the problem. Much of their position relies upon finding evidence that the current observations of warming are not great. That is, the Earth is not warming as fast as predictions.  To support this incorrect (and intellectually dishonest) position, contrarians have scoured the data for any evidence at all that suggests the Earth is not warming. They have skipped oceans (which account for 93% of the warming). They skip the Earth’s surface temperature, ignore ice loss, ignore sea level rise, and in fact ignore everything except some select regions of the atmosphere. Their fallback position is that since a part of the atmosphere seems not to be warming very fast, this means the Earth isn’t warming or that climate models cannot be trusted. I know I know, this sounds dumb, and it is. But it is their current argument.  But let’s pretend we are contrarians and let’s ignore the entirety of the Earth system except for this very small part. Do they have a point? There has been a lot of dispute about exactly how fast these atmospheric temperatures have been rising. Measurements are best made by weather balloons or by satellites. The satellites are convenient because they orbit the Earth quickly and can gather lots of information that is quite uniform across the globe. But satellites have their problems.  First, they are not stable. They drift in altitude and their orbits drift horizontally. As a consequence, satellite users have to correct their data to make sure these drifts don’t give a false impression of heating or cooling. The satellites also have other issues. For instance, they have to be calibrated and they have to be stable in time. You want to ensure the temperature sensors don’t change during the satellite’s lifetime. You want to make sure that you know the location where the measurements are taken.  In reality, the satellites make smeared measurements over a vertical column in the atmosphere. Part of that column is the lower level (called the troposphere). Another part is higher in altitude (called the stratosphere). The area of concern for this study is the troposphere (in fact the lower troposphere). But, if your smearing isn’t processed correctly, you may be measuring the stratosphere and think it is the troposphere (or vice versa). We call that potential “contamination.”  In short, you have to be really careful about satellite measurements, there is a lot of uncertainty. Despite this, contrarians have tried to tell us that satellites are better than thermometers, better than models, better than anything at measuring climate change.  One of the groups that has promoted satellite measurements, and downplayed climate change is from the University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH). In the past, they have falsely claimed that the atmosphere was cooling (it wasn’t, they had made a mistake). Over the years, people have found multiple errors in their work and data, and it seems every time an error was discovered, the satellites we revised warmer and in better agreement with thermometers and climate models. To counter the UAH group, another institution began processing satellite data (Remote Sensing Systems, RSS). The RSS group has been very helpful over the years finding and correcting errors in the UAH data. RSS was responsible for this new publication. In updating their analysis, they find that prior to about 2000, the old and new analysis were very close to each other. However after that, the improved analysis shows a much more rapid warming. Just in the time period for the so-called “hiatus” – the temporary slowdown in surface and lower atmospheric warming that’s now ended. Compare the red (new) analysis to the grey (old) in the image below. Not only that, but the improved analysis shows that the atmospheric (lower troposphere) temperatures are warming faster than the Earth’s surface.  This means that the results from satellites are now in-line with all the other signals from the climate. This is an incredibly consistent pattern. But what about those contrarians? Are there other data that contradict the current results? Yes, as seen in the third image, below. The image shows that the RSS and UAH data agree pretty well until around 2000. After that, the UAH data nearly flatlines but the RSS data continues warming. So what are the corrections made by the RSS team? As I mentioned earlier, the orbits of the satellites change over time which means that locations where measurements are made at a given time of the day change (it drifts). To account for these changes, RSS used a combination of satellite comparisons, climate models, and something called climate reanalysis to estimate changes in the temperature with time. They included measurements from other instruments as a check, such as weather balloons. RSS also identified bad data – when multiple measurements were made and one of the measurements disagreed substantially with the others, it was suspect. They also caught a calibration error that lead to changes in warming rate. For those who only follow climate science on the periphery, they may have heard phrases like “global warming stopped 15 years ago,” “climate models got it wrong,” “we don’t really know if it is warming,” etc. There is now no reason whatsoever to believe these claims. We who work in the field knew these assertions were baseless, but now hopefully the people making them will retract. This study also shows how science works. Science is a cut-throat occupation. As a group, scientists love to collaborate, to share ideas, to work together – all with a goal of understanding the world a little better. But, we are also very critical of each other (and critical of ourselves). We challenge each other, sometimes privately and sometimes openly. I firmly believe this culture is important. It is essential that the best ideas survive. It is critical that the best science wins out in the end. One way the best science can win is when science is competitive. The funding and publications should be based on your skill and your history of being right. Science funding should be cut-throat so bad science is not continually funded. Funding should be cut-throat so money isn’t wasted. Funding should be “survival of the fittest.” This idea is important because there is a move to break this strategy. In the USA, there is a growing effort to fund scientists not on their skill but rather on their politics. Sort of ‘give some money to mainstream scientists and equal money to contrarian scientists.’ While I have no argument with contrarians getting money for research, I object for scientists to get money for bad science. I object to favoritism and politicization.  Scientists should get rewarded based on good work that survives scrutiny. They should not be rewarded for being a Republican or a Democrat. This growing movement of favoritism should disgust any real scientist. It should infuriate taxpayers (whose money will be wasted). It means that scientists don’t have to be good to be supported, they just have to have their “team” in the White House. How shameful. More on this in a future post."
"All around the world, countries are sounding the death knell for the internal combustion engine. Earlier this month, France announced that it wanted to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040, joining India (2030) and Norway (2025) in envisioning an all-electric future.  Car-makers are racing to meet demand, with Volvo promising that from 2019, all of its new models will feature an electric motor.   Modern electric motors are compact, extremely efficient and emissions-free at the point of use but each one requires a battery to store and deliver power, and that is where electric vehicles (EVs) stumble. Most EVs today use lithium ion battery packs, the same technology that powers smartphones, tablets and laptops. Lithium ion packs for electric cars have fallen in price by about 80% since 2010, according to consulting firm McKinsey, but they remain expensive.  A replacement battery pack for GM’s Chevrolet Bolt is priced at more than $15,700 (£12,150) – representing over 40% of the cost of the entire vehicle. It could take a decade or more for EVs to drop to the price of petrol car, says McKinsey. While electric motors are much more efficient than internal combustion engines, batteries can store only a small fraction of the energy in fossil fuels. Some of today’s EVs can run out of juice in as little as 100 miles. Finally, while lithium ion batteries are not as explosive as petrol, they do have safety issues. They require cooling to keep from over-heating and contain flammable liquid electrolytes that readily ignite if the battery is damaged.  “For EVs, you have to consider cost, energy density, and safety,” says Jun Liu, a materials scientist at the US Department of Energy and director of Battery500, a $50m effort to improve lithium ion batteries, backed by Tesla and US tech giant IBM. “All three things are very important.” The 500 in Battery500’s name refers to its goal of doubling the energy density of batteries, typically 250 Watt hours per kilogram today. In the short term, says Liu, that means optimising current technologies, and building more large-scale facilities like Tesla’s Gigafactory, now taking shape in the Nevada desert.  “Costs could come down drastically just with the scale of manufacturing,” says Liu. Tesla alone wants to build three more Gigafactories around the world, each one capable of churning out as many lithium ion batteries in a year as the entire world did in 2013. The next step would be to replace the graphite anodes in today’s batteries with electrodes made of silicon. Silicon can store much more charge than graphite but expands and shrinks when charging and discharging, and can react with and use up the electrolyte. These problems cause experimental silicon anode batteries to fail much sooner than those made with graphite.  Solving these issues could take five years, but should boost energy densities to 350 Watt hours per kilogram, thinks Liu. However, he admits lithium batteries with enough energy density to double the range of cars are still at least a decade away. That should not prevent people from seriously considering EVs today, says Jessika Trancik, an energy studies professor at MIT.  Her research has shown that some of cheapest EVs, such as the Nissan Leaf or Ford Focus Electric, can already meet 90% of people’s daily driving needs while reducing their greenhouse gas emissions by 30% or more. “The challenge is getting people over their range anxiety,” she says. “When they’re buying a new car they want to know that it’s going to get them where they need on that one day of the year they drive a very long distance. Extending the charging infrastructure, or embracing new business models like car sharing, could solve the problem of EV adoption a lot quicker than developing new batteries.”"
"Countries with responsibility over world heritage-listed coral reefs should adopt ambitious climate change targets, aiming to cut greenhouse gas emissions to levels that would keep global temperature increases to just 1.5C, the UN agency responsible for overseeing world heritage sites has said. At a meeting of Unesco’s world heritage committee in Kraków, Poland, a decision was adopted that clarified and strengthened the responsibility of countries that have custodianship over world-heritage listed coral reefs. Until now, most countries have interpreted their responsibility over such reefs as implying they need to protect them from local threats such as water pollution and overfishing. But between 2014 and 2017, reefs in every major reef region bleached, with much of the coral dying, in the worst global bleaching event in recorded history. Over those three years, 21 of the 29 listed sites suffered severe or repeated heat stress. Last month Unesco published the first global assessment of climate change’s impacts on world heritage-listed reefs and it concluded that local efforts were “no longer sufficient” – concluding the only hope was to keep global temperature increases below 1.5C. The new decision builds on that assessment, clarifying the responsibility of countries with custodianship over world-heritage listed coral reefs. The decision adopted by the world heritage committee said it “reiterates the importance of state parties undertaking the most ambitious implementation of the Paris agreement”, which it noted meant pursuing efforts to limit global average temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. It went on that it “strongly invites all state parties … to undertake actions to address climate change under the Paris agreement that are fully consistent with their obligations within the world heritage convention to protect the [outstanding universal values] of all world heritage properties”. The decision appeared to implement the earlier finding that local efforts were insufficient to protect reefs, and indicated the committee considered that countries were obliged under the world heritage convention to undertake strong action on climate change. The decision put most countries’ emissions targets in stark contrast with what was needed to protect their reefs. Combined, all countries’ commitments made so far are projected to allow warming or as much as 2.7C by 2100. But some countries with coral reefs are not contributing their fair share to even that level of ambition.  Australia, which has responsibility over the world’s largest coral reef system – the Great Barrier Reef – has climate change targets consistent with between 3C and 4C of warming by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker. Moreover, Australia doesn’t have any policies in place that will help it achieve those targets, with official government projections showing emissions are not expected to be cut at all, and instead will rise for at least decades to come. The first indication that Unesco would consider action on climate change an obligation of custodians of world-heritage listed coral reefs came in June when it assessed Australia’s progress in protecting the Great Barrier Reef, following back-to-back mass bleaching in 2016 and 2017 that killed as much as half its coral. Despite acknowledging Australia’s progress in addressing water quality on the reef, and deciding not to put the reef on its “in-danger” list, Unesco noted that climate change was the most serious threat to it, and said there was the need to consider how bleaching was affecting the effectiveness of the country’s plan to protect it. “Last week the Australian government bragged that the Great Barrier Reef was not put on the in-danger list at this meeting,” said Imogen Zethoven from the Australian Marine Conservation Society, who was at the world heritage committee meeting in Poland. “However, this week the Australian government should be worried. It knows very well that it is still on probation with the world heritage committee. This decision means Australia needs to rapidly reduce carbon pollution and reject new coalmines – otherwise our reef is at great risk of being placed on the world heritage in-danger list in 2020. “The Australian government must now, more than ever, rule out any new coalmines and urgently develop a climate policy that will protect our global icon. It must do its fair share of the global effort to reduce pollution. “If it doesn’t, the world heritage committee should hold Australia to account for failing to tackle the single greatest threat to our Great Barrier Reef – and for putting all other world heritage coral reefs at risk.” An Earthjustice attorney, Noni Austin, who also attended the world heritage committee meeting, said: “The world heritage committee’s decision has confirmed what scientists have been saying for years: urgent and rapid action to reduce global warming and implement the Paris agreement is essential for the survival of coral reefs into the future.”"

"California legislators have voted to extend a centerpiece program to cut greenhouse gas emissions, burnishing the state’s reputation as a bulwark against Donald Trump’s demolition of climate change measures.  In a rare show of bipartisan agreement on climate change, eight Republicans joined with Democrats in California’s two legislative houses to extend the cap-and-trade emissions system a further 10 years until 2030.  The emissions-lowering scheme, the second-largest of its kind in the world, aims to help the state reach its target of cutting planet-warming gases 40% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. “Tonight, California stood tall and once again, boldly confronted the existential threat of our time,” said Jerry Brown, California’s governor. “Republicans and Democrats set aside their differences, came together and took courageous action. That’s what good government looks like.” The cap-and-trade program, established in 2006 under then governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, sets a limit on emissions and requires polluters to either reduce their output or purchase permits from those who have. As the limit steadily becomes stricter, it nudges businesses to take the more financially attractive option of cutting their pollution. California, the sixth-largest economy in the world, is in stark opposition to Trump’s administration. The president has said he will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement and has set about dismantling federal policies that lower emissions. Brown has positioned himself as a countervailing force to Trump, visiting China to talk to its leaders about climate change and promising to build and launch weather-monitoring satellites should federal budget cuts endanger programs handled by Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOOA).  “A lot of you people are going to be alive, and you’re going to be alive in a horrible situation,” Brown told Californian lawmakers at a committee hearing shortly before the vote. “This isn’t for me, I’m going to be dead. This is for you, and it’s real.” Many Californian Republicans remain opposed to the cap-and-trade system, warning it will pose a “crushing” blow to small businesses. But the bill ended up gaining an unusual level of Republican support, with the extension also supported by key conservative constituencies, including the California Chamber of Commerce and associations representing manufacturers and agriculture interests.  Concessions to get some Republican support, such as the limiting of separate regulations on refineries, risked alienating more liberal Democrats. Some environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, attacked the bill for allowing polluters to continue emitting greenhouse gases if they offset them with green projects, including those outside California.  But other climate activists declared themselves pleased with the outcome, pointing out that it showed that action to reduce emissions is bipartisan and popular. “California is once again showing Washington DC and the rest of the world that fighting climate and air pollution is the right thing for our health, economy and future,” said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. California’s pioneering attitude to climate change action was underlined by separate court action launched on Monday, aimed at holding fossil fuel companies accountable for global warming.  Marin and San Mateo counties, along with the City of Imperial Beach, filed a lawsuit in the California superior court to complain that 37 oil, gas and coal companies knew burning their products would increase carbon pollution and cause sea levels rise. “Defendants have known for nearly 50 years that greenhouse gas pollution from their fossil fuel products has a significant impact on the Earth’s climate and sea levels,” the complaint states.  The municipalities are claiming damages from the fossil fuel firms, echoing a strategy used against the tobacco industry in the 1990s that resulted in multibillion dollar payouts. The companies targeted in the lawsuit include Shell, Exxon Mobile, Chevron and BP. According to the municipalities, these businesses have caused around 20% of all industrial carbon dioxide and methane pollution since the 1960s."

"Nikil Saval writes that “Globalisation could take place in services, capital and ideas … but what it meant most often was making it cheaper to trade across borders” (The great globalisation backlash, 15 July). We hear no more from him about cross-border movements of capital. When I studied economics in the 1950s we spoke of “capital flight” as a major cause of economic stagnation and regulatory capture. The rich in most of South America appeared to be free to invest their winnings in US equities to the detriment of their local industries. My pension fund invests more abroad than in UK equities. Am I complicit in a modern version of capital flight? Could it be that another tenet of conventional wisdom needs to be challenged: that free movement of capital across borders benefits us all? David ChambersStroud, Gloucestershire  • The main drivers of environmental destruction (Earth faces sixth mass extinction, 11 July) are over-population and economic growth.

"It’s easy to feel powerless in the face of new coal mines and shrinking rainforests in distant countries, but we also know that being green starts at home. We do what we can, right? But what really helps, and what is a drop in a warming ocean? A study by the Universities of Lund, Sweden, and British Columbia, Canada, has crunched the numbers and the results are intriguing. Bottom line: every little recycled yoghurt pot helps, but the environmental impacts of our actions vary massively. Here’s a cut-out-and-keep (and then, you know, recycle) guide to a greener you.  Think before you fly long-haul. The study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, estimates the savings, in tonnes of CO2 a year, of various actions taken by one person. By avoiding just one transatlantic return flight, you could keep 1.6 tonnes of CO2 out of circulation. Sounds like a lot? Think of it this way: that’s more than seven times the 0.21 tonnes of emissions savings that come with a whole year of recycling. Sure you do, but – surprise, surprise – cars aren’t cheap for the environment, either. Living without one saves 2.4 tonnes of CO2 a year. That’s the second biggest single thing you can do. Next is buying green energy (1.47 tonnes). Even ditching an electric car will save 1.15 tonnes, while replacing a typical car with a (secondhand) hybrid saves 0.52 tonnes, or twice the amount you’ll save by hanging your clothes to dry (0.21 tonnes; save the same again by washing clothes in cold water). Make it rare – as in, ideally, never. Previous studies have detailed the environmental cost of agriculture (15% of all emissions), half of which are caused by livestock. Beef is by far the biggest offender, requiring 28 times more land than pork or chicken and 11 times more water. Eating less meat can have a big impact. Eating none, the new study says, could cut 0.82 tonnes of emissions a year, or eight times the savings triggered by upgrading your lightbulbs (0.1 tonnes). So do that, too. Here’s the big one, the massive elephant in the travel cot. By far the single biggest thing you can do to help save the planet is to spare it your car-driving, steak-munching, jetsetting progeny. I mean, don’t feel guilty if you’re up the duff, but consider this: having one fewer child saves 58.6 tonnes of CO2 a year, or almost seven times the emissions you’ll save by doing all of the above. And just think how many chickpeas and train tickets you’ll be able to afford with the financial savings, too."
"The greatest impact individuals can have in fighting climate change is to have one fewer child, according to a new study that identifies the most effective ways people can cut their carbon emissions. The next best actions are selling your car, avoiding long flights, and eating a vegetarian diet. These reduce emissions many times more than common green activities, such as recycling, using low energy light bulbs or drying washing on a line. However, the high impact actions are rarely mentioned in government advice and school textbooks, researchers found. Carbon emissions must fall to two tonnes of CO2 per person by 2050 to avoid severe global warming, but in the US and Australia emissions are currently 16 tonnes per person and in the UK seven tonnes. “That’s obviously a really big change and we wanted to show that individuals have an opportunity to be a part of that,” said Kimberly Nicholas, at Lund University in Sweden and one of the research team. The new study, published in Environmental Research Letters, sets out the impact of different actions on a comparable basis. By far the biggest ultimate impact is having one fewer child, which the researchers calculated equated to a reduction of 58 tonnes of CO2 for each year of a parent’s life. The figure was calculated by totting up the emissions of the child and all their descendants, then dividing this total by the parent’s lifespan. Each parent was ascribed 50% of the child’s emissions, 25% of their grandchildren’s emissions and so on. “We recognise these are deeply personal choices. But we can’t ignore the climate effect our lifestyle actually has,” said Nicholas. “It is our job as scientists to honestly report the data. Like a doctor who sees the patient is in poor health and might not like the message ‘smoking is bad for you’, we are forced to confront the fact that current emission levels are really bad for the planet and human society.” “In life, there are many values on which people make decisions and carbon is only one of them,” she added. “I don’t have children, but it is a choice I am considering and discussing with my fiance. Because we care so much about climate change that will certainly be one factor we consider in the decision, but it won’t be the only one.” Overpopulation has been a controversial factor in the climate change debate, with some pointing out that an American is responsible for 40 times the emissions produced by a Bangladeshi and that overconsumption is the crucial issue. The new research comes a day after researchers blamed overpopulation and overconsumption on the “biological annihilation” of wildlife which has started a mass extinction of species on the planet. Nicholas said that many of the choices had positive effects as well, such as a healthier diet, as meat consumption in developed countries is about five times higher than recommended by health authorities. Cleaner transport also cuts air pollution, and walking and cycling can reduce obesity. “It is not a sacrifice message,” she said. “It is trying to find ways to live a good life in a way that leaves a good atmosphere for the planet. I’ve found it really positive to make many of these changes.” The researchers analysed dozens of sources from Europe, North America and Japan to calculate the carbon savings individuals in richer nations can make. They found getting rid of a car saved 2.4 tonnes a year, avoiding a return transatlantic flight saved 1.6 tonnes and becoming vegetarian saved 0.8 tonnes a year. These actions saved the same carbon whichever country an individual lived in, but others varied. The savings from switching to an electric car depend on how green electricity generation is, meaning big savings can be made in Australia but the savings in Belgium are six times lower. Switching your home energy supplier to a green energy company also varied, depending on whether the green energy displaces fossil fuel energy or not. Nicholas said the low-impact actions, such as recycling, were still worth doing: “All of those are good things to do. But they are more of a beginning than an end. They are certainly not sufficient to tackle the scale of the climate challenge that we face.” The researchers found that government advice in the US, Canada, EU and Australia rarely mentioned the high impact actions, with only the EU citing eating less meat and only Australia citing living without a car. None mentioned having one fewer child. In an analysis of school textbooks on Canada only 4% of the recommendations were high impact. Chris Goodall, an author on low carbon living and energy, said: “The paper usefully reminds us what matters in the fight against global warming. But in some ways it will just reinforce the suspicion of the political right that the threat of climate change is simply a cover for reducing people’s freedom to live as they want. “Population reduction would probably reduce carbon emissions but we have many other tools for getting global warming under control,” he said. “Perhaps more importantly, cutting the number of people on the planet will take hundreds of years. Emissions reduction needs to start now.”"
"It is heartening to see the Guardian giving considered coverage to the issue of human population and its impacts upon our planet and the threat that continued population growth and excessive consumption pose to the wellbeing and indeed survival of future generations (Best solution to climate change? Fewer children, 12 July). For too long population has been a taboo subject avoided by those normally courageous and outspoken in publicising inconvenient truths about the consequences of ongoing environmental damage. The new study from Lund University showing that the most effective solution to curbing climate change is for people to have fewer children and smaller families confirms research we highlighted back in 2012, when seeking to persuade the likes of Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund to talk openly and honestly about population issues (with little success!). That earlier study by Oregon State University concluded that, over a lifetime, a family that chose to have one less child would reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 times the amount saved from undertaking all other obvious “eco-friendly” lifestyle changes.  Considering having one less child in developed countries and enabling women in developing countries to have the opportunities and means to choose their family size are “no-brainers” that will benefit both people and planet.Robin Maynard Director, Population Matters Jonathon Porritt Former chair, Sustainable Development Commission • Using words like “unsustainable population” and “rampant population growth in Africa”, your article (US funding cuts fuel fears of missing global contraception targets, 10 July) exemplifies a dangerous and persistent species of population alarmism that sees family planning not as a right but as a way to prevent terrorism and stem rising tides of migration. If you’re concerned about refugees escaping environmental crises, blame the west, not poor women and girls who lack the information, resources, and power to determine whether and when to have children, and how many to have. It would be convenient for the global north not to have to face its life-threatening consumption patterns, but reducing the number of poor people in the global south is not going to solve that problem. Overconsumption of carbon-intensive products, largely by industrialised nations, drives climate change and its effects, not high fertility rates in developing countries. Casting family planning in the global south as a solution to resource stress, migration, terrorism or rising carbon emissions not only unfairly pins blame for these crises on poor women, it also misdiagnoses the problem. Entrenched inequalities, not population numbers, are the problem. So, instead of wringing our hands about “unsustainable population”, let’s attack the inequalities that sustain poverty and drive migration, climate change and high fertility. But let’s do it without shifting responsibility to the poor, and without undermining women’s rights to reproductive self-determination. Let’s work together to expand equality and freedom for women and girls no matter where they live, and to rid the planet of the injustices that are the true threat to all of our futures.Christine GalavottiSenior director of sexual, reproductive and maternal health, Care International • It has long been apparent to people working in environmental science that overpopulation is one of the two key factors in the destruction of the non-human environment – the other being overconsumption by the wealthy world (‘Biological annihilation’: Earth faces sixth mass extinction, 11 July). The impact of the reproductive rate of African women, for example (seven children per female, on average, in many parts), is making itself apparent on the high seas of the Mediterranean, but much more destructively, and less visibly to western eyes, on the wildlife of the African continent. Yet, compared with how much debate goes on about plastic bags and electric cars, constructive discussion about overpopulation is studiously avoided. Climate change is indeed an additional stressor to wild populations already suffering from human-induced habitat loss, but it is humans that will suffer most from it, and in this way it is much the red herring. How ironic that Italy bears the brunt of the surge of ecological migrants, while the pontiff continues to deny that population is a problem, and so inhibits many women of the developing world from accessing birth control. It may be just this issue, however, that forces debate on a humane reduction in human populations, while we still have the resources to do it. Elon Musk and his Teslas are all very flash, but the technological items most required now, globally, environmentally, are condoms and the pill.Chris BrauschWhakatete Bay, New Zealand • The National Academy of Sciences study on which you report is an urgent wake-up call about the eradication of wildlife, but I doubt it will be heeded. Sadly our ever increasingly urban populations are so divorced from the countryside and wildlife that the apocalyptic changes taking place go largely unnoticed. The green fields and neatly manicured hedges of our countryside appear to the untrained and fleeting eye to be in pristine condition. When I return to the country lanes around Coventry where I enjoyed an idyllic childhood, it is like wandering through a cemetery. As a boy, I used to find robins’, yellowhammers’ and whitethroats’ nests every few metres; bullfinches, linnets and song thrushes twittered and sang everywhere from the trees and bushes, lapwings and yellow wagtails nested in the fields, and grass snakes sunned themselves on the banks of the myriad small ponds; wildflowers turned the lanes into riotous impressionist paintings. But no longer. These memories will be lost in a generation and few will be aware of what has gone missing. If it were dinosaurs instead of small animals and plants that were disappearing, more notice would be taken perhaps, but this loss is just as drastic and with far-reaching consequences that few of our fellow citizens are aware of. If we don’t drastically curb our population growth and adopt nature-friendly farming methods as a matter of urgency, we could experience not just a continued steady eradication but a cliff-edge phenomenon. But then it will be too late.John GreenLondon  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"

"Last year, the European Space Agency launched the Trace Gas Orbiter to Mars. It is designed to look for methane – a key tracer of life – to determine if Martian microbes are present on the red planet. Now, ESA is preparing to launch another spacecraft to look at methane on another planet: our own.  The UK-built Sentinel-5P, a pollution monitoring satellite, is ready to begin its journey from Airbus Defence and Space, Stevenage, to the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia, where it will lift off in late September/early October. Sentinel-5P is part of the Copernicus global monitoring programme, a joint venture between the European Commission and the European Space Agency. This particular spacecraft is the first Copernicus satellite dedicated to monitoring atmospheric chemistry. Missions like this are essential for making the connection between space and everyday life on Earth, according to Colin Paynter, Managing Director of Airbus Defence and Space, UK. He says, “Space is not just for geeks, it is part of our national and international infrastructure.” As a greenhouse gas, methane is potent. It traps 28 times more heat than an equivalent mass of carbon dioxide. It is released naturally by living things – hence the interest in looking for it on Mars – but also from the fossil fuel industry, landfill sites, rice agriculture and the thawing of the permafrost at higher latitudes. As well as methane, Sentinel-5 P will also look for nitrogen dioxide and other key polluting gases. Nitrogen dioxide comes mainly from road traffic and other fossil fuel combustion, and naturally occurring forest fires. Last year a report from the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health found that in the UK air pollution causes at least 40,000 deaths a year, and costs the economy £20bn a year. Sentinel-5P will be able to measure pollution accurately across individual countries, which can then be compared to their self-declared pollution inventories. It will image the whole Earth every day, and can also monitor concentrations of volcanic ash for air safety, and warn against high levels of the UV radiation that can cause skin cancer. The Copernicus programme aims to provide comprehensive Earth observation data to improve the management of the environment. It will eventually consist of 20 missions, 15 of which will be dedicated satellites and 5 of which will be instruments on other spacecraft. “A system like this has never existed before,” says Josef Aschbacher, Director of Earth Observation Programmes, European Space Agency. “The US and other partners are looking to Europe to make deals to get access to this data.” In a statement released today, business secretary Greg Clark said, “The UK-built Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite and the success of the Copernicus Programme demonstrates what we can achieve through collaboration with our European partners and the UK’s vital role in the programme thanks to our Earth observation expertise.” Aschbacher confirms that the UK has been a strong partner and says that from a programme management point of view, he wants to see that role continue but, “Brexit is the thing that is floating above us.” Although the UK will remain a member of ESA, around 70 percent of the Copernicus programme is funded from the European Commission. As such, Britain’s future involvement seems certain to be affected by the Brexit settlement. “It is clearly important to our industry to stay a part of the programme,” says Graham Turnock, Chief Executive, UK Space Agency, “We cannot wait until the day before Brexit to get clarity on this.” Separately, the future of the Copernicus programme is part of an on-going series of negotiations between ESA, its member countries and the European Commission. Aschbacher says that such constant reappraisal is essential, “We have the best system in the world. In 10 years, I want to ensure that we still have the best system in the world.” The next major hurdle is an ESA Ministerial Meeting in late 2019, after the UK has left the EU. Here, each country will agree how much to contribute to Copernicus and each of the space agency’s other programmes. The Sentinel-5P mission is designed to last for seven years in an 824km-altitude orbit around the Earth. No one knows where the UK will be in its orbit around the EU in 2024. Stuart Clark is the author of The Search for Earth’s Twin (Quercus). He will be delivering the Guardian masterclass on Is there life beyond Earth? on 6 September 2017."
"The Australian car industry has tried to kill any government move to cut greenhouse gas emissions from cars, arguing it would increase the cost to consumers and contradicting comprehensive government modelling. The government plans to introduce emissions standards for new cars, releasing a series of proposed targets in discussion papers and seeking input from industry and other stakeholders.  Under the strongest target considered, new cars would have to cut their CO2 emissions by 45% below current levels by 2025 – from 192g of CO2 a kilometre to 105g. Comprehensive modelling of that target by the government’s Climate Change Authority found the change would save consumers thousands of dollars. Although it would increase the average cost of a car by $1,500 in 2025, that would be offset by $830 in the first year from fuel savings, and by $8,500 over the life of the car. The modelling found the strongest target resulted in the biggest savings for consumers. But the higher sticker price on new cars has spooked the industry, which on Wednesday told some media outlets the emissions standards would increase the price of some cars by “more than $5,000”. The Daily Telegraph reported that Australian Automobile Association modelling found the standard would push up the price of a Toyota Accent by $3,925. The AAA declined to share the modelling with the Guardian, but the independent government modelling found it would raise the average price of a Toyota by just $1,672 in 2025 – a rise that would be more than offset by fuel savings. The AAA’s chief executive, Michael Bradley, told the Telegraph the standards would be “one of the most extreme efficiency standards in the world”. But the European Union has much stronger standards. Its legislation requires the fleet to reduce emissions to just 95g of CO2 a kilometre as soon as 2021. The US also has a stronger target, aiming to reach 101.3g of CO2 a kilometre by 2025. The AAA opposed taxes aimed at reducing the use of leaded petrol two decades ago, despite the overwhelming public health benefits of doing so. Because there would be a penalty for manufacturers that did not meet the fuel efficiency standards, the Telegraph labelled it an “emissions tax”.  “Certainly no decisions have been made in that regard at all,” the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said in London. Speaking on Radio National on Wednesday, the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the story was a “beat up”. “What we are focused on is how to reduce the fuel costs for families with vehicles and that is something we continue to consult on, but there has been no government decisions in this regard.”"

"  Australia’s world-leading Indigenous land management and carbon farming programs are spreading internationally, with a formal agreement signed to help build a similar program in Canada.  A chance meeting between Rowen Foley from the Aboriginal Carbon Fund and a Candian carbon credit businessman at the 2015 Paris climate conference spawned a relationship that led to an agreement this week that will help Canadian First Nations peoples learn from the Australian Aboriginal carbon farming success. “Sometimes chance meetings are a form of karma or synchronicity at play,” Foley says. Foley set up the Aboriginal Carbon Fund in 2010 to help other Indigenous organisations make money by managing land in such a way that it sequesters carbon in the soil. One of the most successful types of Indigenous carbon farming in Australia has been savannah burning, in which regular small fires are lit, replicating ancient Aboriginal practices and helping to prevent larger fires that release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The projects are often managed by workers in the Indigenous ranger program, which a recent government review concluded were enormously effective, increasing employment, building stronger communities and reducing violence, while also increasing income tax and reducing welfare payments. “Sustainable Indigenous land management, such as savannah burning, not only reduces carbon emissions but also builds communities by offering meaningful jobs for local traditional owners as rangers and an independent income,” Foley says. One project – run by the Karlantijpa North Kurrawarra Nyura Mala Aboriginal Corporation – was awarded a contract for carbon credits under the Australian government’s Emissions Reduction Fund. By burning the savannah early in the season, it secured payments for sequestering 24,100 tonnes of carbon, in an auction where the average value for such abatement would have been $257,629. The Aboriginal Carbon Fund works with similar groups to produce carbon credits that can be bought by corporations as carbon offsets. Now the lessons learned in Australia are set to be taken to Canada, with an agreement between the Aboriginal Carbon Fund and the Canadian First Nations Energy and Mining Council. “It feels like the idea is coming of age,” Foley says. Foley travelled to Vancouver to meet David Porter, the chief executive of the First Nations Energy and Mining Council, to sign the agreement. It notes the “strong similarities” between the First Peoples of Canada and the Indigenous people of Australia in relation to land management and climate mitigation. “The parties agree to work together to share information [on] renewable energy and carbon funding models, and to hold cooperative talks, to promote intrinsic cultural values, and to facilitate investment into indigenous lands,” the agreement says. More specific joint actions will be developed when the agreement is renewed in six months. “There are similarities between Indigenous land management programs in Queensland and in British Columbia so we have a lot to learn from each other in meeting our shared goals of supporting Aboriginal communities through jobs and enabling investment in the management of Aboriginal lands,” Foley says. His organisation plans to develop an investment fund to make buying and selling of carbon credits developed through Aboriginal land management easier."
"Mayors of more than 7,400 cities across the world have vowed that Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris accord will spur greater local efforts to combat climate change. At the first meeting of a “global covenant of mayors”, city leaders from across the US, Europe and elsewhere pledged to work together to keep to the commitments made by Barack Obama two years ago.  Cities will devise a standard measurement of emission reductions to help them monitor their progress. They will also share ideas for delivering carbon-free transport and housing.  Kasim Reed, the mayor of Atlanta, told reporters he had travelled to Europe to “send a signal” that US states and cities would execute the policies Obama committed to, whether the current White House occupants agreed or not. “Right now you have a level of collaboration and focus and sharing of best practices that I haven’t seen. I came from Brussels from a meeting of the US conference of mayors ... and more than 300 mayors signed a letter reflecting our will to deliver the Paris accord commitments.” He added: “My firm belief is that President Trump’s disappointing decision to withdraw from the agreement will actually have the opposite effect in terms of execution. The European commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, who along with the UN’s special envoy for cities and climate change, Michael Bloomberg, co-chairs the board of the new organisation, conceded that it as yet it lacked any members from China, although he said he was confident that this would change.  “Now is the time to join hands,” he said. Reed, whose administration has promised that the city of Atlanta will use 100% renewable energy by 2035, said 75% of the US population and GDP lay in urban areas, where local leaders were committed to fighting climate change. “We have the ability to still achieve between 35% and 45% CO2 emission reductions without the involvement of the national government and it is why I chose to be here at this time to send a signal to 7,400 cities around the world that now should be a time of optimism, passion and action,” he said. The mayor of Vancouver, Gregor Robertson, said mayors needed to be proactive and work together on ideas or face huge extra costs in rebuilding their infrastructure to deal with the changing climate. “The Trump administration better watch out for US cities,” he said. “They are on the rise, and I think will prevail in the end, turning the tide, and making sure the US is a climate leader rather than what is happening currently.” Šefčovič warned Washington that Europe was not willing to renegotiate the terms of the Paris agreement, and would bypass the White House if necessary. “I have to say that now we have to be very pragmatic,” he said. “We work very closely with the states like California, like Washington, like New York and many others, and have a strong alliance … We are not going to renegotiate the Paris agreement. Now is not the time to negotiate, it is time to implement.” The first meeting of the group of mayors came after Bloomberg announced on Monday an investment of $200m over the next three years in US cities able to illustrate a commitment to reducing emissions. Every American city with at least 30,000 residents is being asked to compete for cash that can be used to test ideas and fund training sessions for municipal staff. Addressing the European parliament in Brussels on Tuesday, Bloomberg said: “It’s important for you, and the world, to understand that the fate of America’s Paris pledge does not lie with Congress or the White House. “Few people realise it, but the US is already halfway to our goal of a 26% reduction in emissions by 2025 – and Washington has had almost nothing to do with that progress. Cities, states, businesses, and citizens, together with the market, were responsible for it. None of those groups are slowing down now – and my foundation is working to help each group accelerate its progress.”"
"Environmentalists have condemned Donald Trump as a “threat to every ocean and coastline in the country”, after the president pushed forward plans to expand oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans as part of what he called a new era of “American energy dominance”. The Trump administration has taken the first steps to rewrite a five-year plan, put in place under Barack Obama, that banned drilling along the Atlantic seaboard and in large swaths of the Arctic. The interior department is opening a 45-day public comment period for a new plan that it says will help grow the economy.  Green groups have promised in response to mobilize the coastal communities that successfully implored the Obama administration not to open up new areas to drilling, due to fears over the effect of potential oil spills and noise pollution upon livelihoods and wildlife. “Trump’s appalling actions threaten every ocean and coastline in the country,” said Kristen Monsell, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “We’ll be fighting tooth and nail to make sure his disgraceful administration doesn’t endanger polar bears, whales, local economies and our climate with more dirty drilling.” US crude oil and natural gas production have soared in recent years and several analysts have voiced doubts that many companies will be interested in offshore extraction, given the low cost of a barrel of petroleum and the falling cost of drilling on land. However, in a speech on Thursday, Trump again promised to “unleash” American fossil fuels. The event was part of what has been touted by the administration as “energy week”, although the week was instead dominated by the healthcare debate and the president’s tweets about a TV host’s face.  “America will be allowed to access the vast energy wealth located right off our shores,” Trump said. “And this is all just the beginning – believe me. The golden era of American energy is now under way. And I’ll go a step further. The golden era of America is now under way. Believe me.”  Trump said the US had an “extraordinary energy abundance”, including “more than 250 years’ worth of clean, beautiful coal”. This bounty had been neglected due to Obama-imposed restrictions, the president said, adding that sweeping away various regulations would bring about “American energy dominance”.  “We will be dominant,” said Trump, whose administration has lifted a ban on new coal mining on public land, crafted an executive order calling for more offshore drilling and approved the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines.  “We will export American energy all over the world, all around the globe.” The president said he “didn’t take any heat” over the pipeline approvals, despite subsequent climate-themed protest marches having attracted about 200,000 people to Washington DC.  On Thursday, the state department approved permits for the New Burgos pipeline, which will run close to Penitas, Texas, and cross the border into Mexico. Trump said the pipeline, which will deliver 108,000 barrels of refined petroleum a day, would “go right under the wall, right?”  “You know, a little like this,” he added, with an undulating hand motion.  Trump’s speech, which did not mention climate change, was witnessed by an audience including the energy secretary, Rick Perry, and the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt.  Both men have recently dismissed longstanding scientific understanding that carbon dioxide is a primary driver of global warming. Pruitt was part of the effort to persuade Trump to exit the Paris climate agreement and is in the process of rewriting the clean power plan.  The fossil fuel industry welcomed Trump’s speech. Jack Gerard, chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, said it was “critical” that the US developed offshore oil and gas along all of its coastlines.   “The US oil and natural gas industry has a long history of safe operations that have strengthened US energy security and contributed significantly to our nation’s economy,” Gerard said.   “It’s important that the next five-year plan includes the ability to explore our resources in the Arctic, Atlantic, and the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which would spur investment and economic activity, could create thousands of jobs, and provide billions in government revenue.”"
"“I think a lot about electric cars,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk famously said at a party at the very end of the 80s. “Do you think a lot about electric cars?” The problem with thinking a lot about electric cars is that certain things become impossible to unthink: powering a car with fossil fuels, meeting 21st-century challenges with 19th-century answers, become more than irresponsible. It becomes ridiculous. You’ll never know when the tipping point is – it’s possibly as little as five minutes – but think enough about electric cars, especially if you’re a car manufacturer, and wham … you’re Volvo. They were rolling along perfectly happily until they thought too hard: about their business model and benefit to society; about climate change and their future customers; and so they made the decision that all their cars would be fully electric, or at least hybrid, by 2019. Not one car solely powered by internal combustion engine will come off a Volvo production line by 2020.  It is impossible to overstate the significance of this, and not because you are ever likely to buy a brand-new Volvo. If every branded car is a Veblen good – that is, something you want precisely because it is expensive, to flag to the world your ability to own it – then the Volvo is a peculiar inversion, the car you buy that looks less flash than it is, to show the world that you’re not the kind of person who shows off what they’ve bought. Nope, nobody here is buying a brand-new Volvo in 2019. Yet this will instantly change the charging infrastructure for electric cars: there have already been pretty extraordinary advances in charge speed. You can fully charge an electric vehicle – one with a range of about 105 miles – in half an hour from a supercharger in a garage, which is the difference between being able to use an electric car in a normal way, and having to rebuild your life around it. However, there aren’t enough superchargers, in Europe or the US, and, maddeningly, a lot of the slower chargers – which take four to six hours – still call themselves “high speed” because that’s what they were when they were installed. Volvo will shunt progress forward worldwide on genuinely high-speed charging points, as well as battery production and research and development into battery storage. Perhaps the greater impact still will be on other car manufacturers: those which have an electric vehicle (EV) model – such as Nissan with its Leaf, BMW with the quirky i3, Hyundai and the delightful Ioniq – will look altogether less weird. For a car manufacturer to reject the technology altogether will start to look luddite to the point that it will probably become untenable. Hybrid cars, meanwhile – which ultimately still rely on petrol, however good their regenerative braking is – have overnight become a kicking-off point in climate-conscious development, rather than the compromise solution. This will be annoying for Toyota, but the Prius has had a good run. The car industry is always taught as a classic in the MBA model of business behaviour: it seeks to make a profit, and does so. Its product has massive, devastating consequences for the world, but nobody can see them. The necessity for improvement would therefore come from one of two places – consumers demanding less polluting vehicles, which would damage profit; or innovators from outside, producing something cleaner, which can’t happen with cars because of the high barrier to entry. And so, the argument goes, the car industry, perceiving electric cars to be a threat to the profitable petrol model, and facing no challenge from modernisers, has simply done what a business does – put shareholder value maximisation first and ignored the negative externalities. This reading is blind to an emotional dimension that’s far more important than profit: petrol versus electricity is a culture war, a battle between the petrol head and the hippy, the self-sufficient Randian hero and the bleating environmentalist. Who Killed the Electric Car?, a 2006 documentary, tells the story of General Motors and their EV1, an electric car it made in the 90s. The car failed not because nobody wanted one, but because too many did: GM became anxious that it would look as though California legislators – who had launched a zero-emissions target – had won. Other states might have followed, and the mighty car giant would become the bitch of some democratically elected representatives, the prospect of which was so appalling, they recalled all the cars and crushed them. This story is not about money: it is about raw human emotion, played out at an institutional level. A comparison often made is to the tobacco industry, which kept itself going by indignantly denying claims that its products caused death. But if a cigarette had come along that did the same job and didn’t cause cancer, would it have seriously quashed it simply to protect its existing manufacturing model? And if it had, would that have been business or pleasure? There is another, related precept, relevant to climate change: the classic understanding of the relationship between government and industry. The state is meant to enforce social good through regulation, tax, and funding, while industry is supposed to respond by innovating to meet those challenges and restrictions. This overestimates the smooth pursuit of social benefit by government (well, maybe except for Sweden) but, more critically, underestimates the human beings who run the companies. The profit-model effectively removes moral agency from commerce, turning its CEOs into donkeys, to be directed only by carrots and sticks. We then bemoan their mulishness and sly ways, as they avoid the stick and do backroom deals with the carrot-holder. We cannot split the world into those who want the best for it on one side, and those who will make a profit under whatever conditions are available on the other. If we’re to believe in positive collective action enough to pursue it, we have to re-imagine business as a human activity whose profit motive is partial, not paramount. Clearly, the environment would benefit most if we were to stop driving altogether. Electricity is only cleaner if it’s made in a cleaner way, and long-term, the goal has to be an electric car powered by renewable energy. There is a case to be made about the looming crisis of our lithium demands, as all our waking activities hop from one battery to another. Those are conversations to have alongside, and not instead of, the electrification of cars. The American physicist and environmentalist Amory Lovins gives a lecture about catastrophic climate change and our prospects for avoiding it. It starts with him arriving with a helmet on his head and inviting people to hit it. It’s made of the chassis material of the future. It doesn’t look particularly impressive, he looks like a nerd with a bowl on his head. It’s hard to conceive, from a standing start, what car chassis material ought to look like, yet you have to admit, it should not weigh much. The talk ends with a portrait of a car that is so light that it can incorporate its own solar panel, so modern that it can store its own energy, so efficient that its range, give or take a bit of wear and tear, is infinite, and its cost, less the purchase price, nil. This is not a component of the fight against climate change, this is the component. This is the single biggest change that would alter the course of history. We are some discoveries away from perfection – solar power storage isn’t there yet – but the main factor is speed. It will change all our lives if we get there fast enough, and mire us in catastrophe if we don’t. Volvo just made it faster."
"Two weeks ago, Senator Al Franken (D-MN) had an exchange with Trump’s Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry about climate change.  Perry’s responses perfectly summarized the Republican Party’s current position on the subject. The problem is that it’s an indefensible position. The Republican position is based upon a rejection of established climate science. When confronted with the conclusion that global warming is 100% due to human activities, Perry responded, “I don’t believe that ... don’t buy it.” But of course it’s not a matter of belief – that’s what the scientific evidence indicates. There have been dozens of studies quantifying the various contributions to recent global warming. I summarized ten of them in the chart below (details here), and the answer is clear: That’s why the latest IPCC report likewise included a best estimate that humans are responsible for all of the global warming since 1950. During that time, solar activity has slightly declined, and there haven’t been any significant natural warming factors. Perry talked about “the warming and cooling of our ocean waters,” but the oceans have likewise steadily absorbed heat due to human-caused global warming. On this issue there’s a 97% expert consensus whether you survey climate scientists or their public statements or their peer-reviewed literature. And the greater the climate science expertise of those surveyed, the higher the consensus.  Many Republican policymakers will now admit, like Perry, that humans have “some impact” on the climate. That simply represents an acceptance of 150-year-old science. They don’t deserve much credit for finally accepting science that was first established when John Quincy Adams was president. There’s a chance the less than 3% fringe minority of contrarian climate scientists are right. It’s a slim chance, given that their research doesn’t withstand scientific scrutiny, is full of errors, and their alternative explanations are all contradictory, but it’s not impossible.  But that’s like saying there’s a chance that if I chain smoke cigarettes for 50 years I won’t develop lung cancer. Or that I’ll never get in a car accident, or that my home will never be broken into or catch fire. Those are all possibilities, but people generally don’t like to take big risks with our health, or important purchases like cars and homes without having an insurance policy. With Earth’s climate, there is no insurance policy. Either it remains stable and habitable or it becomes increasingly unstable and uninhabitable. In that sense the smoking analogy is quite apt. The more we smoke, the more we increase our chances of developing cancer. The more carbon pollution we dump into the atmosphere, the more we increase the odds of destabilizing Earth’s climate. We can either take that risk, or we can cut down our smoking or carbon pollution to minimize it.  As it stands, climate change may represent humans’ worst-ever risk management failure, and climate inaction is decidedly anti-conservative. Currently, most Republican policymakers don’t want to take any action to curb America’s carbon pollution (with the exception of about 10% of House Republicans). Like Rick Perry, they will often cite concerns about economic impacts to justify climate policy opposition. That’s exactly backwards. In reality, climate inaction is the expensive route, and climate polices could potentially save tens of trillions of dollars. That’s the conclusion not of some tree-hugging environmental group, but of Citibank – America’s third-largest bank. Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions published a report in 2015 finding that investment costs alone in a climate action scenario would be $2 trillion lower than in an inaction, fossil fuel investment scenario. In other words, even if the 97% consensus is wrong, investing as though it were correct would save money. And if the 97% consensus is right, Citi found that slowing global warming would save tens of trillions of dollars more. It’s not just the Citibank report; there’s a 95% consensus among economists that the US government should commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Only 1% of economists disagree. 41% of economists think climate change is already hurting the global economy, 63% think it will by 2025, 89% by 2050, and 97% by 2100. Sadly, today’s wealthy policymakers won’t feel the impacts of their climate policy obstruction. Today’s youth, and especially people in poorer countries who are least responsible for the problem will most suffer the consequences. America is the world’s biggest net carbon polluter, one of the world’s wealthiest countries, and has joined Syria and Nicaragua as the only countries rejecting the Paris climate agreement. Nicaragua objected that the agreement was too weak, and Syria was mired in a civil war. Essentially, Trump and the Republican Party stand alone in rejecting the need for climate action, despite the country’s responsibility for the problem and resources available to address it. We’re forcing the rest of the world to clean up our dangerous mess. It’s a grossly immoral and unethical position. There’s simply no way to defend the Republican Party’s climate policy obstruction. The scientific evidence is clear, which is why there’s a 97% expert consensus. It’s possible (however unlikely) that those scientific experts are wrong, but risking the stability of the climate on which every living organism on Earth relies on such a long shot is a terrible failure of basic risk management.  Moreover, doing so would badly hurt the economy. There are climate policies that would grow the economy, that have bipartisan support and have been proposed by Republican thought leaders. Every other world country agrees on the need for climate action, and yet most Republican Party leaders are unwilling to even engage in the climate policy debate. These are the reasons why the Republican Party stands alone in climate denial. They will eventually pay the political price for this indefensible, immoral stance, much as they lost huge segments of the American electorate due to party positions on civil rights and gay marriage. The problem is that we only have about three years left to avoid dangerous climate change. Time is running out."

"Last Friday, the Australian government finally released the latest greenhouse gas emissions report, showing emissions have risen in the past year. When excluding emissions from land use, 2016 saw Australia release a record level of CO2 into the atmosphere. It confirms the failure of the government’s environmental policy at a time when electricity prices – despite the absence of a carbon price – continue to rise at levels above inflation. The government has a history of being scared to release the greenhouse gas reports. Last year it released the March 2016 and June 2016 reports on the Thursday before Christmas – not exactly peak viewing time. It also meant the March report was released nine months after the March quarter had actually finished. And once again the government held off releasing the latest report. But in a level of coincidence equal to that of Bill Heslop running into Deirdre Chambers in the Porpoise Split Chinese restaurant, on the day that the Australian Conservation Foundation released FOI documents showing that the government had been sitting on the report for more than a month, the government released the latest report. And in an effort that rather stretches the meaning of “quarterly”, the government “incorporated” the September quarter figures into the December report. It says something about how poorly this government values the issue of climate change that over a month ago we had the figures on the entire production that occurred in Australia during the first three months of this year, and yet here we are in July and we still only know the level of greenhouse gas emissions up to December last year. The figures in the report quickly made it obvious why the government has held off releasing them. They stink. And as every report since June 2014 has shown, the end of the carbon price has led to an increase in emissions. The poor departmental officials try to paint a happy picture. The release leads with the line that “total emissions for Australia for the year to December 2016 (including Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry) are estimated to be 543.3 Mt CO2-e.” They note that this is 2.0% below emissions in 2000, and 10.2% below emissions in 2005. Oddly, they don’t note that is it 1.0% above the emissions in 2015.  The inclusion of land use, land use change and forestry is a fairly dodgy measure. As Lenore Taylor and Graham Readfern have reported, the inclusion of that measure in the Kyoto protocol in 1997 was essentially an “Australia clause” – because then environment minister Senator Robert Hill pushed for it to be counted as it allowed us to take advantage of changes to land clearing after 1990. But the benefits from those changes have finished (though pointedly the Paris agreement from 2005 still includes them):  Excluding the “LULUCF” means focusing on actual greenhouse gas emissions rather than including the reductions in emissions from planting trees or in agreeing not to clear land. But the news on emissions excluding LULUCF is less able to be painted in a positive light. In December, they increased 0.4% relative to September and were up 1.4% compared to December 2015. While looking at individual quarters is interesting, a better picture is gained by looking at the sum of emissions over a 12-month period. And here we see that 2016 recorded a record level of emissions:  The biggest contributor to our emissions is the electricity sector – around 35% of all emissions:  But in 2016 the biggest increase to emissions came from “stationary energy” – that is emissions that come via combustion fuels used in industry – and fugitive emissions which occur during the production, processing, transport, storage, transmission and distribution of fossil fuels:  The electricity sector however is the most important, not only because it is the biggest, but also because it is the sector for which renewable energy is most viable. In this sector, the impact of the carbon price and its removal is particularly stark:  Whatever else you want to say about the Direct Action plan of the government, it has utterly failed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That’s a problem for the government because even on its “business as usual” projections, it expects electricity emissions to fall sharply in the next few years:  And those business as usual projections would see total emissions by 2030 at just 0.5% below 2005 levels, rather than the 26%-28% lower level we are aiming to achieve under the Paris agreement:  And this is where the problem for the government really hits. The Finkel Review recommends implementing a clean energy target that would lead to a 28% reduction in emissions from electricity by 2030. But that alone would not get Australia’s total greenhouse gas emissions down to the 26% target. Were electricity emissions to fall 28% and the rest of the economy continue on a business as usual cases, our total emissions would only fall by around 8% below 2005 levels – and the biggest contributor would be counting the falls in land use and land use change that occurred from 2005-2013. If you excluded the LULUCF category, our emissions would have actually risen by 3%:  Clearly a 28% cut to electricity emissions alone is not enough. But to achieve cuts in other sectors of the economy there would need to be not just a clean energy target or an emissions intensity scheme which targets the electricity sector, but an economy-wide carbon price. Right now the government won’t even commit to a clean energy target, even though the Finkel Review found that it would lead to lower electricity prices as well as lower emissions compared to business as usual. A report by energy analysis firm RepuTex this week also showed that that a more ambitious target of 45% below 2005 levels would see even lower electricity prices by 2030 due to the increase in renewable energy production and a lower reliance on gas – which is the main cause of a 10% rise in electricity prices in Sydney over the past year and a 7.7% rise in Melbourne. At some point, this government will have to realise that if it wants lower electricity prices the best way to go about is to also lower greenhouse gas emissions. Because its currently policy is doing neither."

"Donald Trump has made a gushing show of friendship to the French leader, Emmanuel Macron, saying the two countries had an “unbreakable bond” , pledging to draw up a road map for post-conflict Syria, and asserting that the two leaders could work together despite clear differences on climate change. But when he appeared alongside Macron under the golden chandeliers of the Élysée Palace after two hours of talks about Syria, Iraq and counter-terrorism, Trump immediately faced fresh questions over allegations that his family sought to collude with Russia to win the 2016 US election. He swiftly defended his son over accusations he had met a Russian lawyer during the US presidential campaign, describing Donald Trump Jr as a “wonderful young man” and saying “most people would have taken that meeting.”  Trump remained non-committal over the US eventually rejoining the global climate agreement that he pulled out of last month to the dismay of Macron and other world leaders. At first, he hinted that he might change his mind and bring the US back into the agreement, saying: “Something could happen with respect to the Paris accord. We’ll see what happens. We will talk about that in the coming period of time.” But he quickly followed up with a shrug, adding: “if it happens that will be wonderful, and if it doesn’t that will be OK, too.” Trump acknowledged that France and the US had “occasional disagreements” but said that would not disrupt a friendship that dates back to the American Revolution. Macron acknowledged sharp differences with Trump over climate change, but he said he and the US president were able to discuss how best to combat “a global threat with enemies who are trying to destabilise us”, with a focus on counter-terrorism Trump said his recent meeting with Vladimir Putin had led to a ceasefire in a part of southern Syria and said that he was working on “a second ceasefire in a very rough part of Syria”. He suggested that other parties would become involved in the deal, saying “and all of a sudden you will have no bullets fired in Syria”. As Trump began his 24-hour visit to Paris, the two leaders’ body language was under close scrutiny. Macron chose to move on from the aggressive handshake he offered the US leader at their initial meeting in May, instead styling himself as Trump’s new “straight-talking” best friend on the international stage.  The invitation to the US president to attend this year’s Bastille Day celebrations was in the pipeline long before both Macron and Trump’s election because 2017 marks the 100th anniversary of the entry by the US into the first world war. The Trumps were greated with great military pomp by the Macrons at the vast military complex at Les Invalides, built by the Sun King Louis XIV, where Trump joined the French leader in inspecting the troops.  This appeared to flatter the US president, who has described himself as “a big military person” fond of army parades. He patted Macron on the back several times and, during a number of handshakes, both men were measured, not repeating their earlier white-knuckled standoff in Brussels. But when Trump took the hand of Brigitte Macron for the first time, he pulled it firmly towards himself and awkwardly did not let go for some time. Soon afterwards, the presidential couples toured the historic military site and visited Napoleon’s tomb, with Trump remarking on France’s “great history”. Trump turned at one point to Brigitte Macron and said: “You’re in such good shape,” remarking to her later: “Beautiful”. Trump patted Macron repeatedly on the shoulder and both seemed to slip into buddy roles. After visiting Napoleon’s tomb, Trump turned to Macron and said: “You wanna ride?” He then gave the French president a lift to the Élysée Palace in “the Beast”, the US presidential armoured car.  Arriving at the Élysée with Macron as his passenger, Trump appeared so self-assured he seemed to be hosting the event himself. He mouthed a silent “thank you” to waiting journalists as if to an applauding audience. Inside, there was yet another official handshake, which White House reporters described as “less feral” than the previous death-grip encounters, with Trump willingly letting go first.   Macron’s strategy was to set up a kind of of persuasive bridge-building with Trump after observing the US president’s increasing isolation on the western stage.   The Élysée deliberately added what one official called a personal “postcard” tourism touch: instead of dining at the Élysée Palace, Macron and his wife, Brigitte, invited the Trumps to eat a meal cooked by the chef Alain Ducasse in a restaurant on the second floor of the Eiffel Tower. Brigitte Macron also took Melania Trump on a tour of Notre Dame cathedral where the American first lady appeared to stop for a prayer and they then took a boat tour up the river Seine. The US first lady visited the Necker children’s hospital in Paris earlier in the day, where she spoke to children in French. For the Macrons, it was a deliberate attempt to show the French capital was still “welcoming” after Trump told a rally that “Paris is no longer Paris” following a string of terrorist attacks.    Trump was asked by journalists about his previous comment on France being overrun with terrorists and being not fit to visit, Trump said Paris “is going to be just fine” mostly because France now has “a great” and “tough” president. Trump then joked to Macron that the French leader better not make him look bad.  The military pomp of the Trump visit reflected Macron’s new style of showmanship diplomacy, seen when he invited Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to the Palace of Versailles. It is aimed at highlighting French prestige and grandeur and is aimed as much for his domestic audience as foreign leaders.  Macron and Trump will attend the Bastille Day military parade on the Champs Élysée on Friday morning, before the Trumps return to Washington.  Security for the visit was tight. Far from the official events, anti-Trump protesters were gathering at a “No Trump Zone” at Place de la République, where organisers linked to the Paris’s Nuit Debout movement said they would stand against Trump’s “anti-migrant positions, sexism, Islamophobia and racism”.  Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the leftwing party France Unbowed, said last month that Trump was “not at all welcome” on Bastille Day.  • This article was amended on 14 July 2017. An earlier version referred to a restaurant at the top of the Eiffel Tower. The Jules Verne restaurant is on the second floor of the tower."
"More than a million residents of Rome are facing water rationing for up to eight hours a day as the prolonged heatwave that has ravaged southern Europe takes its toll on the Italian capital. Some businesses are already reporting sporadic disruption to their supply, while last month mayor Virginia Raggi turned off thousands of the city’s public drinking fountains in an effort to save water as the drought set in.  Officials from the Italian utility Acea, the Lazio region that contains Rome, and the environment ministry will meet this week to discuss the possibility of rationing the water supply to about half of the city’s 3 million residents. Lazio’s governor, Nicola Zingaretti, has ordered that a ban on drawing water from drought-hit Lake Bracciano, which lies about 40km from the capital and supplies some of its water, will come into force on 28 July. “They are working on it and looking at some hypotheses; a decision should be made on Wednesday,” a spokesperson for Acea told the Guardian. Water rationing in the Italian capital would be the latest consequence of a series of heatwaves in southern Europe this summer that have fuelled wildfires, exacerbated droughts and led Greek authorities to close some of the most popular tourist sites. Blazes have broken out across southern Italy and Sicily, where temperatures have climbed well above 40C. Wildfires near the Calampiso seaside resort west of Palermo, the Sicilian capital, forced the evacuation by boat of more than 700 tourists earlier this month. High temperatures compounded by strong winds have helped fires spread after months of below-average rainfall. Farm animals perished while several farms and more than 150 hectares of pine forest were destroyed in a blaze in Sicily this month. In Spain, drought has devastated cereal crops and could threaten the grape and olive harvests. The country endured an early heatwave last month. Though the phenomenon is not uncommon in July, authorities said the temperatures were especially high. Last month scientists, using temperature records and up-to-date computer models, published a study concluding that human-caused climate change has dramatically increased the likelihood of such extreme heatwaves. The analysis by World Weather Attribution (WAA), an international coalition of scientists that calculates the role of climate change in extreme weather events, found the heatwave that struck Portugal and Spain in June was 10 times more likely to have occurred due to global warming. There has been significantly less rainfall across Italy this year – up to 80% lower than average in some areas. Meteorologists said on Sunday that the country had experienced its driest spring in 60 years. The drought has ravaged two-thirds of agricultural land across the peninsula, causing an estimated €2bn (£1.8bn) worth of damage, according to Coldiretti, the farmers’ association. Drought in the northern agricultural provinces of Italy prompted the government to declare states of emergency. Beppe Grillo, leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, has called for a similar response to the wildfires. In southern Italy the heatwave has sparked at least 20 wildfires, including on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius near Naples.  In Rome some guesthouse owners say they are already having problems with their water supply, although it is unclear if this is solely due to the drought or partly due to ageing infrastructure. The city loses as much as much as 45% of its water due to a chronically leaky network of pipes. “Some of the guesthouses that we run with our partner in the Santa Maggiore area have been affected,” said Steve Brenner, who owns the Beehive hotel close to Rome’s Termini railway station. “The first time it happened was in the middle of the night. We thought that maybe Acea [the water authority] was working on something, but we were told there were no works going on.” When residents in Santa Maggiore reported the first drop in water supply to Acea, the company blamed ageing pumping systems in the buildings. Brenner said: “This has been going on for decades. So much of the system doesn’t work, but the drought makes it critical.” Raggi, Rome’s mayor, said on Monday she would try to avoid any rationing of the city’s water supply. “It is unacceptable that over one and a half million Romans should be without water,” she told Il Messaggero newspaper."
"Torres Strait residents face being forced from their homes by climate change, as their islands are lost to rising seas. On Boigu Island, the most northerly inhabited island in Australia, just six kilometres from Papua New Guinea, the community’s cemetery faces inundation and roads are being washed into the sea. A seawall installed to protect the community is already failing. Boigu elder Dennis Gibuma says the situation is worsening every season. Every year I have moved my shed back from the beach another few metres. “Our seawall is no longer any good,” he says. “When the high tide and strong winds come together, it breaks. We pray we don’t lose our homes. We don’t want to leave this place.” Masig Island, to the south-east of Boigu, is less than three kilometres long, and just 800m across at its widest point. Also known as Yorke Island, the low-lying coral cay is steadily being lost to the waves. “The island is being eaten,” says Songhi Billy, an engineering officer on Masig. “This is a big issue. I kind of feel hopeless in a sense. Our land is part of us. “In the short term, we can do what we can. We can’t stop the erosion, our hope is to slow it down.” But he says he has to face the possibility that his people may have to abandon their ancestral home. “Long term, we may have to evacuate the island,” he says. “But I am not going. Slowly, I see Masig Island getting out of something I can control.” Fisherman Joseph Billy says his community is losing land every year. “Last five year, every year, I have moved my shed back from the beach another few metres. We used to have a road that went all around the island but now it is broken. We will lose our land eventually.” Sea levels around the world are expected to rise between 75cm and 1.5m by the end of the century, depending on greenhouse gas emissions. According to the Australian Department of Environment and Energy, a rise of just 50cm would increase the risk of flooding around Australia by 300 times – making a once a century flood likely to occur several times a year. In some areas of Australia, flooding risk would rise much more – up to 10,000 times. The precise sea level rise around the Torres Strait, and the projected inundation, has not been calculated but low-lying islands are expected to experience a much greater flooding risk than mainland Australia. The department identifies the remote islands of the Torres Strait as some of the most vulnerable, as does the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which warns communities they may be forced to relocate. The chief executive of Oxfam Australia, Helen Szoke, who visited the Torres Strait at the invitation of the Torres council mayor, Vonda Malone, says the people of the strait have contributed almost nothing to the causes of climate change but are being “hit first and hardest by its impacts”. “The islands face a combination of risks including coastal erosion and inundation from rising seas, damage to the critical marine ecosystems on which their livelihoods depend, higher temperatures and shifting rainfall. Roads are being washed away and seawalls cannot protect communities from flooding.” The “strong, flourishing communities” of the Torres Strait have a powerful connection to their land and sea country, Szoke says.  “The gravest fear among community members is the loss of their connection to land and culture if they are faced with the last resort – being forced to leave their islands. The longer-term challenges, including the threat of eventually being forced from their land, are complex and extremely confronting for communities with such a deep connection to their islands.” We have been advocating for years but it just does not seem to get enough attention. Malone says leaving the islands is a last resort and the people of the Torres Strait want to do everything possible to remain. “These communities are facing ongoing challenges in retaining their foreshore and their gathering places – this is their land and the land of their ancestors. These communities are seeing their land washed away. We have been advocating for years but it just does not seem to get enough attention.” Malone says while some funding for climate change adaptation is filtering through, there were few resources to address the social impacts of potential dislocation. “There is a feeling of hopelessness as communities do not know where this is going to lead to,” Malone says. Displacement caused by climate change is forecast to be a driver of massive forced migration movements in the 21st century. Low-lying islands in the Pacific – and Torres Strait islands like Masig and Boigu – are likely to be at the forefront of forced displacement but large and densely populated countries such as Bangladesh also face widespread inundation. Some forecasts have predicted up to 150 million people could be forcibly displaced by climate change by 2040 – larger than the record number of people already forced from their homes globally. The US and other militaries have said that climate change poses the greatest security threat to the Asia-Pacific. But the global legal framework for resettling people displaced from their homes lost to natural disasters or climate change is unclear. The refugee convention – established in 1951 to regularise the resettlement of those displaced by the second world war – does not recognise someone forced from their home by rising seas, or natural disaster, as requiring protection. Already, more than a dozen Pacific Islanders have attempted to claim refugee status in New Zealand on the grounds that their homes are uninhabitable because of rising seas or climate-related disaster. All have had their claims rejected. On Masig Island, Hilda Mosby says climate change is already affecting the marine ecosystems on which communities depend for their livelihoods. Climate change is already affecting her community “big time”, she says. But the greater existential threat for her home lies ahead. “When we talk about relocation, it is clear this is very much a last resort,” Mosby says. “This is our home. No one is willing to leave, to lose their cultural ties, the loved ones they have laid to rest here. We want to try everything to keep our community here.” "

"It sounds like a distant dystopian crisis: a world where global food and water supply chains buckle under the strain of overpopulation and climate change, before being contaminated by weapons of mass destruction unleashed in a desperate fight for access to what little is left. While the crisis may not be as unrealistic or far away as it seems, scientists are already coming up with potential solutions. One is the curiously named metal organic frameworks (MOFs), a powder of nano-engineered crystals with an apparently endless variety of uses.  One teaspoon of these crystals contain the surface area of an entire football field, and scientists have been able to customise them to absorb and store vast quantities of a desired substance.  In 1998 Prof Omar Yaghi, a chemist who now works at the University of California, Berkeley, made a key breakthrough that built on earlier work by Prof Richard Robson and Bernard Hoskins who showed it was possible to craft structures that can be imagined as metal scaffolding at a molecular level, bound together by organic links. Less than two decades later, MOFs are being applied to purposes that even he could not have imagined, many of which would be particularly handy in a world falling apart – such as fabrics that can protect against chemical weapons, devices that can artificially replicate photosynthesis to transform carbon emissions into oxygen, and glowing crystals that can detect and trap contaminants in water. Yaghi himself has developed a MOF that enables the harvesting of moisture out of the sky, and unlike other technologies that can already do this in high-humidity areas, the device using Yaghi’s powder works in the dry desertified conditions that are gradually expanding around the globe. “We are living in an uncertain time,” Yaghi observes, “and fresh water is going to be one of the most precious and sought-after resources to humanity.” In 2014, Yaghi reached out to MIT mechanical engineer professor Evelyn Wang about creating a machine capable of using his MOF technology. Wang and her team developed a transparent box with a top surface painted black to absorb solar heat, which prompts a reaction that delivers enough drinking water for a person’s daily needs with 1kg of the powder, even in areas of 20% air humidity. “During the night, these MOFs soak up the water from air, and when the sun comes up, the MOFs will release water to be collected due to the warmth of the sun,” Yaghi says. “Then these empty MOFs will be ready to absorb water from the air at night again.” Yaghi hopes these devices will enable people to access what he calls “personalised water” – off-grid and free of any impurities. MOFs can be applied to just about any purpose. The obstacle has long been producing enough of them at a cheap enough cost to be of any practical use. Some cost upwards of $10,000 per kilo to produce at a painstakingly slow pace.  Over in Australia, at the CSIRO, Professor Matt Hill is leading the charge to find a way to make what he calls his “magic powder” commercially viable. When he and his team first started pitching MOFs to companies in 2008, Hill says there was plenty of interest: “People asked ‘could you just send us a bit to try out – maybe 50kg?’. The trouble was, we could only produce a teaspoon a week.” Today CSIRO’s startup MOFWORX can produce 10kg per hour on their pilot reactor (named Mindi, after a giant serpent of Indigenous Australian mythology that was said to spit out white powder) using a continuous process 20 times more efficient than the conventional batch process. In September 2016, the first ever commercialisation of a MOF was announced by another Australian – Paschal McCloskey, the CEO of UK-based MOF Technologies, a spin-out company from Queen’s University Belfast. The MOF in question can capture and store a gas that inhibits the hormone that prompts fruit and vegetables to rot, allowing for the safe storage of such foods for up to 12 months. This would enable further efficiencies for a food production process already being hampered by climate change. McCloskey says it is already in use in the US where fruit and vegetable storage provider Decco Worldwide has achieved FDA approval to roll it out, and is undergoing approval processes in countries across Europe and Africa.  The company has 15 different MOFs they are seeking to commercialise, including two that MOF Technologies hopes to sell to carbon-intensive industries as a way to capture and convert carbon emissions. MOF Technologies have expanded their production facility in preparation for capacity of between five and 10 tonnes of MOF production per year from 2018. The obscure and complicated nature of the technology makes it “tricky to get the foot in the door with big companies”, concedes MOF Technologies commercial director Phil Patterson, but he has found a pitch that resonates: “I tell them it has the highest surface area of any material known to man – that usually gets their attention.” An American Chemical Society study released early this year found that MOFs were approaching the projected costs of $10/kg for natural gas storage – the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy target – while a Royal Society of Chemistry study identified that further commercialisation of MOFs would require refinement of downstream processing, as methods used at the laboratory scale limited production rates. Back at Berkeley, the father of these super-absorbent structures believes scientists have “just scratched the surface” of the “essentially limitless” applications of the technology. Yaghi says it is “a pleasure to see that chemistry could combine molecular beauty and function in such a brilliant way as demonstrated by MOFs”. “Imagine, any slight change of the metal ions, the organic components, the shape and topology, or the combination of them could give you a completely different MOF to be used for different purposes. I am not surprised at all to see MOFs being applied to so many different purposes, and I believe more amazing things are going to come. “We have shown the world how it works; the rest is just fine tuning.” "
"That equality matters in terms of health and happiness has been clear for some years. But it is also better for the environment. The evidence (which is still emerging) suggests the most unequal affluent countries contribute more to climate change via pollution than their more equal counterparts. A large section of their people may suffer more, too. A new report predicts the United States will see its levels of economic inequality increase due to the uneven geographical effects of climate change – resulting in “the largest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in the country’s history”, according the study’s lead author.  In a 2016 report, Oxfam found that the greatest polluters of all were the most affluent 10% of US households: each emitted, on average, 50 tonnes of CO2 per household member per year. Canada’s top 10% were the next most polluting, followed by the British, Russian and South African elites. In more equitable affluent countries such as South Korea, Japan, France, Italy and Germany, the rich don’t just pollute less; the average pollution is lower too, because the bottom half of these populations pollute less than the bottom half in the US, Canada or Britain, despite being better off. In short, people in more equal rich countries consume less, produce less waste and emit less carbon, on average. Indeed, almost everything associated with the environment improves when economic equality is greater.  When you buy an item, you don’t think about junking it. But you will eventually throw away almost everything you buy. Some of it you may recycle, but recycling is not only never fully efficient, it also uses a great deal of energy and hence generates pollution itself. Not buying things you don’t need is far better, but in a world where the main function of advertising is to get you to buy things that you could live without, that is hard. In more unequal societies, there is a proliferation of products that are designed not to last, so as to allow greater profits to be made. Producing endless must-have new versions exploits the higher levels of emotional insecurity that living with great inequality generates. The success of the clothing industry is an interesting example. People buy far greater quantities of cheaper clothes and throw them away more frequently in the most economically unequal countries. A recent UK survey of 2,000 women suggested that the majority of clothes are bought because they are seen as fashionable and are worn, on average, just seven times before they are discarded. A third of women see them as old after they have been worn three times. The chart above, in which each country is sized according to its population, tracks an environmental indicator (the vertical axis) against levels of inequality (the horizontal one). Countries to the right are more unequal, while countries that are high up produce more waste. If the correlation between the two were perfect, they would all line up along a line drawn from the bottom left to the top right. Inevitably there are outliers that don’t fit – in this case Denmark and Switzerland, and this could be because they do a better job of collecting data on waste than other countries. But the tendency of the more unequal countries to produce more waste is still striking overall – and would be even more so if the 50 US states were included separately as smaller circles. In Japan people on average buy and throw away half as much as people in the US – of everything! In economically unequal countries the pressure to buy items to keep up with your peers, with “people who count”, is enormous, especially when it comes to clothes, fashion, new cars and other status symbols. We are encouraged to be aspirational, to better ourselves, not for the greater good, but for selfish reasons – ultimately to be able to get all that stuff. A good job is no longer one which benefits society, but one that pays you well. Eating a lot of meat is not good for you or the planet. The amount of crops that have to be grown and transported to feed the animals that we eat is far greater than the amount that would be needed if we just ate the crops themselves. So, the more meat per person that is eaten in a country, the less environmentally friendly the people of that country collectively are. By weight (if we ignore insects and fish), most of the animal life on our planet is now intensively farmed for our own consumption. Those animals produce enormous amounts of greenhouse gases during their short lives, with cattle being the worst polluters of all. The most common bird on the planet is now the domestic chicken, reared solely because so many of us in the rich world have become so used to eating cheap meat. This chart suggests that the more unequal countries (again sized according to population) tend to consume more meat. Again, there are a few outliers – notably Australia and New Zealand/Aotearoa, possibly because their cultural histories are bound up with the rearing of sheep and cattle and their high levels of meat production. But the general trend is clear. Increasing meat consumption has not made us healthier. In some countries, we are now eating so excessively that it is making many of us obese. Obesity rates are much higher in affluent countries that are more economically unequal. One theory as to why is that the poor in such countries have to resort to cheap fast food, which is advertised to them aggressively and often includes lower-grade meat. Another theory is that in more equitable countries, the population tends to be better educated and so can more easily see through the folly of fast-food advertising and gluttony. What we do know is that people in more economically unequal countries in general eat more meat per person by weight. Whatever the reason, the world needs human beings to eat less meat if we are to avoid depleting our soils, increasing greenhouse gases and also reducing the biodiversity of the planet to such an extent that monocultures prevail and we lose habitats. We mainly extract water for agricultural uses, to water the crops that we then feed to the animals, but we also use water for industries that produce more stuff and more packaging for that stuff than we actually need. The final use we have for water is for ourselves, for domestic use, and here, just as with meat, we can see huge variations between countries that are otherwise similarly wealthy. And again the variations appear to be related to economic inequality. In more unequal affluent countries, people on average consume more water for personal use – or are far more wasteful over their use of water. This chart measures domestic water consumption against economic equality for the 25 most affluent countries in the world. Again, the excessive use in the US stands out: consumption per person there is about three-and-a-half times higher than in Germany. It is not as if the US has ample rainfall: you can look at the US Drought Monitor any week of the year to see their ongoing problems. The relationship between water consumption and inequality seems clear, though there is quite a lot of variation. The UK may use a little less water than might be predicted from its levels of economic inequality, partly because the climate of the UK makes it less useful to have private outdoor swimming pools if you are rich. In contrast, more water is used per head in Australia than might be expected from its level of inequality, presumably because of its warmer climate. So why are people in Canada, Singapore and the US using so much more water for domestic purposes than those in Germany, France or Japan? Possibly there is a lot less concern about wasting water in more unequal countries. Toilet cisterns may be less “eco-friendly”, people may worry a little less about watering the garden with a chlorinated supply designed for human consumption, not for plants. It is not that people are cleaner and wash more often in the more inequitable countries (per person, the Japanese buy the most soap worldwide), and it is certainly not that they are drinking more water. What is happening is that they are wasting more, and that may be related to a more general ethos that people should be free to do as they wish and damn the consequences for others – an ethos that appears to be far more prevalent in more inequitable countries. The most damaging form of pollution (in terms of absolute effect) is the carbon dioxide (CO2) we are responsible for releasing into the atmosphere. Residents of the US contribute more emissions of CO2 than any other of the 25 rich countries featured. US emissions per person are almost twice those of the Japanese, and more than three times those of the French. In general, the more economically unequal a rich country is, the more CO2 it emits. There are exceptions of course: the UK is a relatively low emitter because it currently has access to natural gas from the North Sea and has already mined and burned its most accessible coal; 75% of France’s electricity production derives from nuclear power, which emits less CO2 but creates much longer-lasting radioactive waste. In contrast, Australia mines and burns a great deal more coal (and also, incidentally, mines a large amount of uranium). In 2016 Oxfam reported in detail on why emissions from some countries were so much greater than others (see chart above). Collaborating with economists including Thomas Piketty, it discovered that what drove excessive consumption in any particular affluent country was economic inequality, because the best-off in a country tend to waste more energy, heat their homes more than they need to, drive more than they need to in bigger gas-guzzling cars, take more flights and require more cement and other materials to construct their larger-than-needed buildings – while at the same time buying and throwing away more items. Globally, half the CO2 emissions associated with individual lifestyles are due to the actions of the richest tenth of humanity, who disproportionately live in the more unequal of the world’s most affluent 25 countries.  Our excessive use of motor vehicles contributes not only CO2 but also other damaging gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, as well as pumping particulate matter into the air we all breathe. Among the most affluent 25 countries, three stand out as extreme in this regard: the US, Canada and Australia. These three are among the least-densely populated countries in the rich world, and driving distances between homes and workplaces are often long, but they have chosen to arrange their cities in this way. That choice was again affected by economic inequality and the beliefs associated with it: that individual aspirations should trump the collective good, and that “the car is king”. Relatively low petrol/gasoline use in the UK, Singapore and Israel shows that very unequal countries need not necessarily use huge amounts. In these three cases, there are large dense urban areas that can only function with good public transport such as underground trains, buses and trams. But it is worth noting that no relatively equal affluent country consumes more than half as much gasoline as people in Canada and the US do each year. All of us will have to consume far less fossil fuel in the near future, and those reductions will be far more easily achieved in a country that sees the provision of efficient, low-polluting public transport as a collective good rather than a dangerous precedent. Consider the proportion of people who cycle or walk to work in each country. This ranges from 50% (in the Netherlands) to less than 5% (in the US). Everything is connected. People are fatter in the US because they eat more food; because they sit in cars more often and for longer; because they are exposed to more advertising and eat more and buy more cars as a result; because they live in greater fear of crime and so are afraid of not driving; and because they are surrounded by other obese people and therefore don’t feel so unusual if they are also fat. But behind all of these factors lies the basic difference in how human beings are ranked. Rank them sky high by paying them many times more than other people, and they can become so conceited that they more easily treat others who are less well-off poorly, with no respect and with little empathy. When pay differentials are less and no-one’s income is out-of-this world, people realise they have far more in common with others. They then argue for cycle routes, pavements, good public transport, and to be able to afford to live near where they work. Even in the US, there is still much hope – new learning occurring and new understanding growing – but it is happening locally rather than nationally. In Seattle, a 20mph limit was agreed in 2016 for all residential streets in the city. The downtown arterial roads in that city will now be limited to 25mph, making it far safer to cycle along those roads and to cross them as a pedestrian. Such measures, of course, also encourage people not to believe their car will get them from place to place more quickly than others can travelling by bus or, where it is available, by light rail. One way in which the residents of affluent countries can pollute less is by flying less. Many of the flights we undertake are unnecessary, but we take them because we can. Of course, most people – even in affluent countries – will not fly in any given year, while a few will fly often. Those who pollute the most (per person) are executives flown around in private jets. It is at take-off that aircraft use most fuel, so this chart shows the average number of airplane take-offs per person per year in each country. Again there is a relationship with inequality – and again, a few of the outliers can be explained by the presence of many remote settlements, or by a country being an island (in the case of New Zealand/Aotearoa). The US dominates, and if circles for all its separate states were drawn, the overall pattern would look even more obvious. It could instead have chosen to develop a series of high-speed rail lines across its land, as other affluent countries have done and as even less affluent ones such as China are now doing. The US is notable for the number of people living there that have never left their own country, so most of its air flights are internal. It is also well known for preferring free enterprise and competition to social planning. High-speed rail lines require planning and timetabling. In the majority of the 25 countries, less than one plane takes off per year for every 100 people living there. In the UK it is nearer two planes, in the US three, in Canada four and in Norway five. Norway is famously equitable, but it is also remote and has access to relatively cheap aircraft fuel from its oilfields. Being more equitable is no guarantor of better environmental behaviour, but it tends to be associated with it. In 1443, Shinto priests who lived on the edge of Lake Suwa in Japan began recording the day when the lake froze over in winter and when the temperature changes created a ridge of ice across the surface. They believed the ridge was formed by the feet of the gods as they walked over the lake, and so they carried on recording the day the ridge was formed each year after that, to the present day. In the first 250 years of the priests’ recordings, the lake only failed to freeze over three times. Between 1955 and 2004, it failed to freeze over 12 times. Between 2005 and 2014, it failed to freeze over five times – every other year. Since 2014 it has not frozen over. There are many different records of global warming, but the Lake Suwa records are the longest and most striking. It is only since the late 1970s that the 25 rich countries focused on in this article have begun to diverge widely in their levels of economic inequality. Because they have done so, a set of natural experiments has been set up which today allows research into the effects of these differences. The preliminary conclusion, based on these natural experiments, is that the more economically equitable countries tend to perform better across a wide range of environmental measures. Once we know what the driving forces are, and become fully aware of the damage that is done by inequality in environmental as well as social terms, we will know how necessary it is to embrace change.

"Hopes that the world’s huge carbon emissions might not drive temperatures up to dangerous levels have been dashed by new research.  The work shows that temperature rises measured over recent decades do not fully reflect the global warming already in the pipeline and that the ultimate heating of the planet could be even worse than feared.  How much global temperatures rise for a certain level of carbon emissions is called climate sensitivity and is seen as the single most important measure of climate change. Computer models have long indicated a high level of sensitivity, up to 4.5C for a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere. However in recent years estimates of climate sensitivity based on historical temperature records from the past century or so have suggested the response might be no more than 3C. This would mean the planet could be kept safe with lower cuts in emissions, which are easier to achieve. But the new work, using both models and paleoclimate data from warming periods in the Earth’s past, shows that the historical temperature measurements do not reveal the slow heating of the planet’s oceans that takes place for decades or centuries after CO2 has been added to the atmosphere. “The hope was that climate sensitivity was lower and the Earth is not going to warm as much,” said Cristian Proistosescu, at Harvard University in the US, who led the new research. “There was this wave of optimism.” The new research, published in the journal Science Advances, has ended that. “The worrisome part is that all the models show there is an amplification of the amount of warming in the future,” he said. The situation might be even worse, as Proistosescu’s work shows climate sensitivity could be as high as 6C. Prof Bill Collins, at the University of Reading, UK, and not part of the new research, said: “Some have suggested that we might be lucky and avoid dangerous climate change without taking determined action if the climate is not very sensitive to CO2 emissions. This work provides new evidence that that chance is remote.” He said greater long term warming had implications for melting of the world’s ice sheets and the rise of sea levels that already threatens many coastal cities. The reason the historical temperature measurements indicated a lower climate sensitivity than models or paleoclimate data is because the Earth has a fast and a slow response to increases in carbon emissions, Proistosescu said.  Land, mostly in the northern hemisphere heats up quickly. But there is also a slow response, he said: “This is mostly associated with warming over the oceans. They are big and full of cold water, especially at depth, and take a long time to heat up.” Furthermore, when the slow warming does kick in, it is likely to reduce the cloud cover that shades the Southern ocean and the eastern tropical Pacific, amplifying the heating.  The new research shows the 4.5C upper limit for climate sensitivity is real and means projections for global temperature rises cannot be reduced. The global temperature is likely to be 2.6C to 4.8C higher by the end of the century if emissions are not cut, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or 0.3C to 1.7C if sharp emissions cuts begin in the next few years. The world may already be seeing the increasing rises in temperature, said Prof Piers Forster at the University of Leeds, UK: “It may already be happening – the rapid increase in temperatures since 2014 could be partly due to the eastern Pacific catching up.” Reconciling all the estimates of climate sensitivity has also shown that climate models are not flawed. “Historical observations give us a lot of insight into how climate changes and are an important test of our climate models,” said Prof Peter Huybers, a colleague of Proistosescu’s at Harvard University. “But there is no perfect analogue for the changes that are coming.”"
