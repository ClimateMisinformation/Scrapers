"David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband have signed a joint pledge to tackle climate change, which they say will protect the UK’s national security and economic prosperity. The agreement of the three party leaders is highly unusual and comes amid a general election campaign that is becoming increasingly bitter.  The prime minister, deputy prime minister and leader of the opposition have all clashed over green issues, but the joint declaration states: “Climate change is one of the most serious threats facing the world today. It is not just a threat to the environment, but also to our national and global security, to poverty eradication and economic prosperity.” “Acting on climate change is also an opportunity for the UK to grow a stronger economy, which is more efficient and more resilient to the risks ahead,” the joint statement says. “It is in our national interest to act and ensure others act with us.” A senior UK military commander has warned previously that climate change poses as grave a threat to the UK’s security and economic resilience as terrorism. The declaration was hailed as “inspiring leadership” by Al Gore, former US vice president and by multinational business leaders as a clear message that the UK is a good place for climate-friendly investment. The cross-party agreement in the UK contrasts sharply with the US, Australia and Canada, where right-of-centre politicians argue against the need to act on global warming. The world’s governments have pledged to tackle climate change and have set a UN summit in Paris in December as the deadline for a global deal. The Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour leaders have pledged “to seek a fair, strong, legally binding, global climate deal which limits temperature rises to below 2C”, the level seen as the threshold of dangerous global warming. The leaders have also pledged “to work together, across party lines, to agree [UK] carbon budgets”, which are required by law but which caused serious cabinet clashes in 2011. The leaders’ third pledge is “to accelerate the transition to a competitive, energy-efficient low-carbon economy and to end the use of unabated coal for power generation.” The UK green economy has grown strongly, even during the years after the global economic crisis in 2008, and employs about a million people, but has been hit by political uncertainty due to rows over wind farms and solar power. “This agreement represents inspiring leadership and true statesmanship by all three men,” said Gore. “The political courage it represents on all sides is exactly what our world most needs in order to solve the climate crisis.” Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever, said: “The importance of this pledge cannot be overstated. In this critical year, this sets a terrific example for other countries to follow.” Polman warned in an article for the Guardian this week that “powerful vested interests in high-carbon businesses are desperately opposing these changes”. Juergen Maier, CEO of Siemens, which started building on a £310m wind turbine factory in Hull in January, said: “The low-carbon transition represents a major economic opportunity and this demonstration of cross-party support sends a clear message that the UK remains a good place for global companies to do low-carbon business.” The joint statement, brokered by the Green Alliance and other NGOs, was released on Saturday, the same day that the Go Fossil Free movement persuading investors to dump their fossil fuel stocks is holding a global day of action, with events in over 50 countries. The fast-growing divestment campaign has already seen 180 institutions worth a combined $50bn get rid of their fossil fuel investments, including local governments, universities, churches and health-care providers. A series of analyses have shown that the coal, oil and gas industry already have three times more fossil fuels ready to be extracted than can be burned, if the pledge by the world’s governments to keep global warming under 2C is to be kept. The campaigners argue that the fossil fuel industry is therefore not just a threat to the climate, but also to investors’ money, as trillions of dollars is being spent exploring for fossil fuels that will be worthless if climate change is tackled. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, told the Guardian in 2014: “We need an apartheid-style boycott to save the planet.” Banks that fund fossil fuel investments are also being targeted on the day of action in the UK, South Africa and Australia. In the UK, at least 1,400 people will switch their accounts away from the big five banking groups in protest at the £66bn they invested in fossil fuel extraction in 2012 alone."
"Back in January, the Guardian carried a story about Forum for the Future having decided to no longer work with Shell or BP. I explained the grounds on which we came to that decision, and while acknowledging “our failure” to turn what were once good working relationships with both those companies into anything resembling sustained traction, I also reminded readers that this experience had, if anything, reinforced our commitment to working with those companies in other sectors intent on bringing about real transformation. The response to the article has been illuminating – broadly supportive, apart from a number of hostile voices pointing out that we should have severed our ties with Shell and BP many years ago. But I’ve been particularly struck by the reaction from old colleagues either still working in the sector, or only recently out of it, reminding me yet again of the very personal dilemmas faced by many people working in “big oil” and other fossil fuel businesses. First, an historical anecdote. Back in 1997, John Browne (BP’s CEO at that time) made a bold decision to pull out of the Global Climate Coalition, the principal voice of climate denialism inside the industry in those days. Externally, the response was uniformly positive, apart from the other oil majors, who were vitriolic in their contempt. Internally, this decision (and Browne’s subsequent initiatives under the Beyond Petroleum rubric) was enthusiastically received. As Browne himself said at the time: “You need the will and the minds of the people inside a company to achieve anything.” It went down particularly well when exposed to the “dog and duck test”: among friends and families, BP employees noticed a marked uplift in warmth and positive reactions to their company. One of my BP colleagues at the time described it as the Beyond Pariah effect. It is impossible for most BP and Shell employees not to have some kind of personal stake in the overall positioning of their companies on climate change. And that stake is all about the interface between science and personal morality. As we all know, the science of climate change is highly dynamic. But almost without exception, most climate scientists would now agree that the evidence of accelerating, manmade climate change has got increasingly robust since the late 1980s, let alone since 1997. Teams of people inside these oil majors track the state of that science carefully, and as the consensus deepens around the threat of severe (and possibly irreversible) impacts of climate change on humankind, the personal moral dilemmas deepen proportionately. For a few, it gets to the point where they can no longer justify working in the sector. For many, the level of discomfort may be somewhat amplified, but the pros of sticking in there continue to outweigh the cons, not just because of financial reasons, but because of loyalty to colleagues and (rather more rarely these days) a feeling that it may still be possible to turn their particular oil tanker around. It’s only fair to add, in my experience, that most employees do not spend a huge amount of time explicitly defining that discomfort threshold. After all, their companies have a clear and continuing licence to operate from governments, regulators and citizens alike, they do their best to stay the right side of the law, and many of them as individuals are as uncertain or complacent about the potential impacts of manmade climate change as the rest of society. But once acquired, through proper application to the science, knowledge about causes and consequences cannot easily be put aside. Many Shell and BP employees are themselves scientists and engineers, and correspondingly uneasy about decision-making processes in society that may present themselves as evidence-based policy but are, in effect, exactly the opposite. Let’s personalise this for a moment. Imagine a relatively senior employee, perhaps in strategy, investor relations or upstream, diligently tracking the cut-and-thrust of the scientific debate, fully informed about the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and curious enough to track down the work of the outliers – both on the heading towards apocalypse end of the scale and those in the more sceptical or outright denialist camps. Then imagine that those inquiries led that person to the following unavoidable conclusions: 1. That climate change is indeed predominantly manmade.2. Is already impacting the lives of hundreds of millions of people.3. Is likely to get much worse, much faster.4. Is giving rise to phenomena in the Antarctic and the Arctic that are already described by some scientists as potentially irreversible. At that point, the personal moral dilemma may well become too onerous to bear. Or at least, too onerous if their company has shown no serious sign of transforming their role in the energy economy. I’m trying to avoid being judgmental here, in some kind of absolutist way. It’s always much more nuanced and complex than an article like this can ever do justice to – which means I have little time for the kind of extremist critics who describe all employees in fossil fuel companies as morally bankrupt. And though I’m a huge admirer of the eminent US economist and commentator Paul Krugman, I find it hard to buy into his idea that anyone who denies the evidence about climate change should be “punished in the afterlife” on the grounds that “this kind of denial … is an almost inconceivable sin”. But neither am I prepared to condone those who think it’s somehow OK to go on living out one’s well-paid working life in a morality-free zone. No one has that right. And as the moral dimensions of accelerating climate change become more present in our debates, I suspect that more and more employees in the world of fossil fuels will find anxiety slowly turning to anguish.

"To mention the Caribbean is to conjure up images of sun, sand and sea. Yet the island region’s reputation for crystalline blue waters washes over a critical problem for many of its 30 territories: water scarcity. Hard as it might be to believe, water-related risks in picture-postcard Caribbean islands such as Saint Lucia, Barbados, Antigua and Jamaica compare to those in the Western Sahara and parts of the Middle East, according to the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct rankings. Some islands, such as Curaçao and Aruba, simply lack decent rainfall. For most, however, it’s a case of “feast or famine” between wet and dry seasons, observes Paul Choules, senior vice president of business development at Water Standard, a Houston-based water treatment firm. In addition, changes in weather patterns in the Caribbean due to climate change are exacerbating existing water challenges. “Places are not getting rain where they used to get rain, and places are getting rain where they [used not] to”, Choules says.  Desalination is not new to the Caribbean, but extracting clean water from seawater is becoming an increasingly integral part of the region’s search for water security. Since 2007, 68 new desalination plants have been built across the Caribbean, which now boasts an installed capacity of 782,000 cubic metres of purified water per day, according to the Caribbean Desalination Association (CaribDA).  Some islands, such as St. Martin, St. Thomas and the British Virgin Islands, where UK-based water treatment firm Biwater just inaugurated a new $43m (£28m) plant with a 10,400 cubic metres daily capacity, are almost entirely dependent on the technology for their domestic water supply.  A lot of these islands could not survive without desalination. Their overall economies would collapse “A lot of these islands could not survive without desalination. Their overall economies would collapse”, says Choules, who describes the technology as a “drought-proof solution” in a world facing ever more erratic weather patterns. Desalination isn’t without its challenges, however. By far the biggest and most obvious relates to energy consumption. Huge amounts of power are required to operate commercial-scale desalination – power that is often produced by importing expensive fossil fuels. With large natural gas deposits offshore, Trinidad and Tobago is a rare exception to such import dependency. The fact that the twin island country is home to the largest reverse osmosis desalination plant in the Western hemisphere - Desalcott - is therefore perhaps no coincidence. “We’ve got industry that can afford to pay for it [desalinated water] and large water demand … but desalination in general is relatively expensive, [so] it’s more difficult for small islands that don’t have the industry”, says John Thompson, general manager of Desalcott and president of industry group CaribDA. Energy typically amounts to one-third of a typical plant’s operating costs, increasing to as much as two-thirds in some cases, says Thompson. Being quick to adopt energy-efficiency innovations has therefore become a hallmark for the region’s desalination operators.  It’s a view echoed by Gerard Pereira, vice president of engineering at Consolidated Water, a desalination firm based in the Cayman Islands where electricity costs around $0.40 per kilowatt hour – more than four times the price in the US. “Just out of necessity, we design and build the most efficient plants in the world”, says Pereira. Consolidated Water was among the early adopters of isobaric energy recovery devices, which Pereira credits for helping recover up to 98% of the unused energy in the waste streams of desalination plants. The Grenadine islands of Petite Martinique and Curaçao, meanwhile, recently installed two solar-power desalination plants in a $2.1m project part-funded by UK development agency DFID. “The Caribbean has tended to be where a lot of firsts have happened”, Pereira says, pointing out that Aruba and Curaçao built the first commercial desalination plants more than 80 years ago.  Advances in membrane and pump technologies present further ways of reducing desalination’s energy requirements, but the sense from industry experts is that many of the big energy-saving wins may already have been had.  “There is a thermodynamic limit for desalination”, says David Maingot, regional sales manager at LG NanoH20, a manufacturer of nanocomposite membrane technology that has carried out about 20 retrofits in the Caribbean over the last three years. “We’re getting close to that, so it’s kind of limiting unless you change the actual reverse osmosis technology.” Alongside its dependency on expensive - not to mention carbon-intensive - power supply, environmentalists have raised concerns over the impacts of large-scale desalination on marine life. In particular, open intakes of seawater can cause fish and other larger organisms to become trapped. A potentially safer alternative lies in subsurface intakes from coastal aquifers, a technique that extracts seawater from beneath the seafloor or beaches. This is now being carried out in a handful of Caribbean locations (pdf) where site conditions are suitable. CaribDA’s Thompson admits that desalination is no panacea. Ideally it should constitute only “one choice out of a number of options”, he says, and not necessarily the top one either. However, while desalination may be more expensive and energy-intensive than some options, desalination remains the crucial answer to freshwater access in regions with heavy dry seasons.

"Reforms to strengthen the EU’s flagship policy for cutting carbon, the emissions trading scheme (ETS), will start at the end of 2018 following a vote by MEPs on Tuesday. The carbon market is supposed to drive Europe’s transition to cleaner sources of energy, but a cocktail of recession, free allocations to polluters and over-achievement on green energy targets have created a flood of 2bn allowances. That has led to a carbon price of around €7 (£5) per tonne, too low to encourage power companies to switch from polluting fuels such as as coal.  Under the new compromise proposal, around 1.6bn surplus allowances will be taken off the market and put into a market reserve, two years ahead of the commission’s preferred timetable. “We still believe that this reform should come sooner rather than later,” the Labour MEP Seb Dance told the Guardian. “However, the compromise deal does represent a significant improvement on the suggested start date of 2021. We have ensured that the number of backloaded and unallocated allowances will be reduced and won’t be returned to the market, which would lead to further destabilisation.” The market reform should prevent nightmare scenarios, such as a 4.5bn carbon credit glut by 2020 forecast by the environmental think tank Sandbag. A new report today by analysts Reuters Thomson Point Carbon estimates that by 2020, the reforms could nudge carbon prices up to €20 per tonne.  From April, the UK will have its own carbon floor price of £18 a tonne, pushing British prices close to the €30 a tonne price envisaged at the ETS’s inception, which could trigger fuel switching from coal to gas.  The energy minister Ed Davey called for reforms to be introduced even earlier, by 2017, in a joint ministerial statement signed by his counterparts in countries including Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. “Ambitious and early action is good for Europe, providing the certainty needed to create investment, jobs and growth as we move to a low-carbon economy,” Davey said. “Delay will only cause investor uncertainty, raise costs for businesses and ultimately leave consumers to pay the price.” Reuters Thomson Point Carbon say that a one year difference in start dates will only add a Euro to prices.  But environmentalists argue that the reforms do not dispatch underlying questions about the ETS’s effectiveness as 400m allowances will be allowed to trickle back on to the market before 2030. Another 300m carbon credits will go to an innovation fund, whose low carbon credentials are yet to be proved. In the meantime, the delay until 2019 will allow further carbon allowance surpluses to accrue.  “Postponing necessary reforms until 2019 is simply irresponsible in times of a climate crisis,” said Femke de Jong, a policy officer at Carbon Market Watch. “Every year we wait with setting up the reserve, the surplus that is suffocating the EU carbon market will grow bigger, pushing the EU’s cornerstone climate instrument closer to the brink of collapse.” Keith Taylor, the Green MEP for South East England added that “with big climate change talks coming up in Paris in December it’s crucial to create effective mechanisms to ensure that excess carbon allowances cannot undermine emission reduction targets.”  The EU expects carbon markets to play a major part in international emissions cutting efforts, and UN-accredited offsetting under an exotic array of schemes can be used by countries to meet their carbon reduction targets. This has led to criticisms of schemes for human rights abuses and scams involving the destruction of industrial gases in Asia. Until a ban in 2011, over 80% of the EU’s offsets were spent on these latter projects, which the EU’s then-climate commissioner later admitted had a “total lack of environmental integrity”. One Carbon Market Watch report estimated that “up to 70% of all offset credits issued from the [UN’s] clean development mechanism between 2013 and 2020 may not represent real emissions reductions”. Nonetheless, carbon trading schemes have already been set up in South Korea, California and Quebec, with China due to roll out a regional carbon market next year that could fully cover the country by 2020. International spot carbon prices vary from around US$13 (£8.4) a tonne in California to $6 a tonne in China and $9 a tonne in South Korea. "
"An investigation by Greenpeace and the Climate Investigations Centre reported in the Guardian and New York Times this weekend showed that the work of Willie Soon — an apparently ‘scientific’ voice for climate scepticism — had accepted more than $1.2 million from the fossil-fuel industry over the 14 years. As Suzanne Goldenberg’s report stresses, although those seeking to delay action to curb carbon emissions were keen to cite and fund Soon’s Harvard-Smithsonian credentials, he did not enjoy the same sort of recognition from the scientific community. He did not receive grants from Nasa or the the National Science Foundation, for example — the sorts of institutions who funded his colleagues at the Center for Astrophysics. Moreover, it appears that Soon violated ethical guidelines of the journals that published his work by not disclosing such funding. It seems to be a story of someone working outside the usual codes of modern science. But Soon is not a singular aberration in the story of science’s relationship with the fossil fuel industry. It goes deeper than that.  Science and engineering is suffused with oil, gas and, yes, even coal. We must look this squarely in the eye if we’re going to tackle climate change. The fossil fuel industry is sometimes labelled anti-science, but that’s far from the truth. It loves science — or at least particular bits of science — indeed it needs science. The fossil fuel industry needs the science and engineering community to train staff, to gather information and help develop new techniques. Science and engineering also provides the industry with cultural credibility and can open up powerful political spaces within which to lobby.  In the UK, BIS/ DECC 2013 oil and gas strategy is an especially brazen example of how science is expected to serve the fossil fuel industry’s interests. Aside from a bit where the government agrees to consider its role in improving public perception of the UK oil and gas industry, the strategy expresses much concern over the supply of skilled staff and R&D spend in the sector, with a clear expectation that the government should support industry here.  But this relationship runs deep, just think of how many geology departments are still known as a School of Mines. And it’s not a problem of history, or something pushed simply pushed on science by the government. Take, for example, the UCL/BHP Billiton Institute for Sustainable Resources, or the BP/ Manchester materials lab. There are also deals like NERC and Shell, or Cambridge and Shell, or the long list of industrial sponsors at the Heriot-Watt Institute of Petroleum Engineering. Members of the scientific community sit on fossil fuel company boards — e.g. Imperial’s Alice Gast and Chevron — and vice versa. And there’s science communication too. Museums, for example. And news media (there might well be an advert for an fossil fuel company above this article). This relationship sits at the heart of many key scientific institutions. It’s not just a matter of a few embarrassing cases in the corner. This isn’t climate change denial. It’s also, in many ways, totally understandable. The fossil fuel industry remains a large part of the economy, and universities feel it is their responsibility to work with them (and it rarely means working in the manner Willy Soon seems to have). Still, that doesn’t mean it’s not also problematic, that it’s not also sometimes still managed badly, and that it’s not also locking us into particular types of futures, leaving others — less polluting — options under-developed.  In trying to ‘practise what you preach’ we sometimes see scientists argue about whether they should fly to conferences or not. Which is fair enough, perhaps (and, incidentally, may help open up science to women, but that’s another issue). But also possibly a distraction from much larger, much deeper questions.  The scientific community warned us about the link between fossil fuels and climate change. They continually tell the rest of the world to be more evidence-based. Can they heed their own advice?"
"To Washington insiders he is Dr Evil: the hidden orchestrator of industry campaigns against the Humane Society, Mothers against Drunk Driving, and other seemingly uncontroversial groups. Now Richard Berman, a one-time lobbyist turned industry strategist, has zeroed in on another target: Barack Obama’s new power plant rules.  Over the last year, Berman has secretly routed funding for at least 16 studies and launched at least five front groups attacking Environmental Protection Agency rules cutting carbon dioxide from power plants, the Guardian has learned. The rules, the centre-piece of Obama’s climate agenda, are due to be finalised in mid-summer. They have come under sustained assault from industry and Republican-controlled Congress – and Berman is right at the heart of it. The attacks may be gaining traction. The EPA chief, Gina McCarthy, suggested in a speech this week the rules were likely to change in response to public comment. From the offices of Berman’s PR firm in Washington, at least five new front groups have launched attack ads against the EPA, environmental groups, fishermen and sportsmen, and green building organisations. The groups all use Berman’s address. Meanwhile, the Employment Policies Institute, a tax-exempt organisation headed by Berman and operating out of his office according to tax filings, funded a series of reports by an ultra-conservative thinktank, the Beacon Hill Institute.  The reports, claiming the power plant rules would lead to rolling blackouts, send electricity prices skyrocketing, and devastate local economies, are being published in 16 states by a network of pro-corporate and ultra-conservative thinktanks.  All of the reports were funded by EPI, according to Suffolk University, the host institution for Beacon Hill. Suffolk released a list of such grants. Berman did not respond to requests for comment. However, a spokesman, Jordan Bruneau, confirmed that EPI was funding the analyses of the EPA regulations.  “Currently IPA is working with economists to determine the effects of certain EPA regulations on particular states,” he said in an email. He said the research was entirely funded by foundations but refused to identify those funders. Those familiar with Berman say he is a prime example of a new industry strategy of bypassing traditional lobbying organisations, and using thinktanks, foundations, experts, and social media to shape the public conversation and – ultimately – legislation. “Richard Berman is very well known for certain front groups and for taking money from anonymous sources to fund aggressive campaigns in the interests of the individuals and the corporations who fund him with the understanding that that funding will be kept secret,” said Nick Surgey, research director of the Center for Media and Democracy. Indeed, Berman claims his ability to hide the funding sources for such campaigns as a particular expertise.  “People always ask me one question all the time: ‘How do I know that I won’t be found out as a supporter of what you’re doing?’” Berman told a conference of energy executives last year. The talk was secretly recorded and leaked to the New York Times.  “We run all of this stuff through non-profit organisations that are insulated from having to disclose donors. There is total anonymity. People don’t know who supports us,” Berman told the energy executives.  He claimed at the time to have already collected six-figure sums from some of the companies in the room – and solicited $3m more to defeat opponents of fracking. On such a scale, the funding for an economic study taking down the EPA rules appears relatively economical. Beacon Hill received $41,500 from the Employment Policies Institute for a study of the EPA rules, according to the grants list maintained by Suffolk University. The funds were allocated to produce reports on the impact of the EPA rules in 16 states including: Iowa, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Tennessee, Wisconsin, South Carolina, Virginia, Louisiana, Rhode Island, Washington Ohio, Alaska and Utah, a spokesman for Suffolk University said. The university spokesman said in an email that the grants followed university protocol. “Suffolk does not accept research funds from unknown sources,” the spokesman said in an email. Beacon Hill is associated with a network of ultra-conservative groups working with the American Legislative Exchange Council and funded by patrons of anti-government causes such as the Koch brothers and Searle Freedom Trust. Its director, David Tuerck, appears on the roster of experts at the Heartland Institute, which adopts an extreme-sceptic position on the existence of human-caused climate change. Tuerck has also featured as a keynote speaker at Heartland’s climate conferences. He told the Guardian he had mixed views on climate change. “I am not certain that those emissions are significant enough to offset other factor changing the climate,” he said. But he was categorical that efforts to cut emissions were “a waste of time”. “We are just heaping unnecessary costs on the American economy,” he said. “It’s as obvious as the nose on anybody’s face these EPA regulations are inevitably going to drive up electricity rates.” Over the years, BHI has been accused of using discredited economic models to exaggerate the costs and downplay the benefits of government regulations.  “I think what is dangerous about BHI is that on the face of it appears to be an academic institute producing independent reports but when you peel back the first layer of the onion you find that Beacon Hill often skews reports in favour of their funders,” Surgey said. In 2013, Suffolk University publicly repudiated Beacon Hill after the Guardian reported the organisation told prospective funders its studies could undermine a regional climate change initiative. The claim did not follow Suffolk University rules for grant proposals, the university said.  Jay Duffy, a legal fellow at the Clean Air Task Force, said the current BHI analysis of the EPA rules did not meet the usual academic standards. “BHI’s interpretation of EPA’s analysis just doesn’t hold up,” he said. “BHI has skewed timelines, underestimated the social cost of carbon, and overestimated the effect on electricity prices. As a result, their study badly inflates the costs and minimises the benefits of EPA’s draft rules.” BHI defended the study. “Our costs are within the broad range of costs that the EPA produces,” said Paul Bachman, who directly oversaw the study. “It’s just that we don’t include – we exclude – what they call the co-benefits of the proposal.” Berman’s other forays into the environmental arena this year have been hard-hitting.  One prime example was the Environmental Policy Alliance – a mirror image of the government agency – which, according to the website, is “devoted to uncovering the funding and hidden agendas behind environmental activist groups and exploring the intersection between activists and government agencies”.  The group oversees four projects aimed at discrediting the government agency and environmental and conservation groups. In a full page ad in Politico last year, one of the projects, EPA Facts, asked: “What would you call a radical organisation that threatens to shut down 25% of our electrical grid?” The ad crossed off responses including anarchist, terrorist and militia before coming to Obama’s EPA. Another Berman creation Big Green Radicals claims environmental groups are funded by Russian oil interests close to Vladimir Putin, put up billboards on the Pennsylvania turnpike attacking Lady Gaga, Robert Redford and other celebrities who oppose fracking, and sent a poison Valentine to the fossil fuel divestment campaign.  Green Decoys takes on sportsmen and fishermen who support the power plant rules. Leed Exposed opposes green building codes. The claims, which many think are outrageous, are a key part of the strategy, Berman has claimed. “Berman and Company isn’t your average PR firm,” his company website said. “We don’t just change the debate. If necessary, we start the debate.” • This article was amended on 4 March 2015 to clarify the opening sentence of the final paragraph."
"Hearing about climate change may bring heat waves and sweltering summers to mind, but in most regions in the US, winter temperatures are also on the rise. In spite of last year’s East Coast blizzard and polar vortex, winters have, on average, been getting warmer since the 1970s. One of the starkest examples of this is the overall drop in the number of nights below freezing in most cities. For many Americans the idea of fewer freezing nights is a welcome prospect. But warmer winters can have negative impacts: ski resorts need freezing temperatures for snow, some crops rely on a chill period, and pests can flourish year-round if winter temperatures aren’t cold-enough for them to die off. Climate models project that freezing temperatures will become even less frequent as greenhouse gas emissions further increase global temperatures. What will these warming winters feel like? For our Winter Loses Its Cool interactive we have projected the number of nights below freezing for the end of this century for 697 cities, and then showed which US city currently experiences that number of freezing nights. Several striking examples are highlighted above, but explore the interactive to find out how the cold season will be affected in your city. By the end of the century, assuming current CO2 emissions trends continue until the end of the century, Helena, Mont, will see about 85 fewer freezing nights, which is comparable to Lubbock, Texas, today. Buffalo, NY, which currently experience about 124 freezing nights each year, will only see about 57 a year in 2100, making it more like Charlotte, NC. Ann Arbor, Mich, will see less than half its current number of nights below freezing (131), which is more like Huntsville, Ala(60). In fact, more than 80% of the cities we analyzed — 593 of the 697 — could see at least a 50% reduction in number of nights below freezing, and more than 20% — 145 of the 697 — could see at least a 75% reduction. There are even 28 cities, mostly those that currently experience between 10 and 20 nights below freezing, that may see at least a 90% reduction. For these cities, freezing nights will become a rare event that occurs about once a year, comparable to the current conditions in Brownsville at the southern tip of Texas. This analysis only accounts for daily minimum temperatures, which typically occur at night, and doesn’t incorporate windchill, which contributes to how winters feel. This projected warming also assumes greenhouse gas emissions keep increasing through 2080 as they have been for the past few decades.

"Creationism, climate denial and anti-vaccination rage: long before the measles outbreak in the US, a deep mistrust of scientists infected some strands of the American conservative movement. Conservatives are not alone in their rejection of scientific experts and evidence. But the sentiments this week from potential Republican contenders for president – first New Jersey governor Chris Christie in London, then Kentucky senator Rand Paul wagging his finger during a television interview, then a cavalcade of clarifications – have exposed a number of tendencies in American conservatism.  There is the deep resentment of government. And a fierce concern for family privacy. More and more conservatives have a strong libertarian streak. But the aversion to vaccinating children – and the departure from mainstream thinking on public health and other issues – is not really a question of science, experts on the movement said. It’s about the clash between science and deeply held beliefs. “As with any kind of science denial, it’s never the science itself. It’s these cultural fears,” said Joshua Rosenau of the National Center for Science Education. On evolution, conservative mistrust stems from the clash with the very foundations of morality for believers – that humanity was created in its present form by God. On stem cell research, it’s the idea of destroying human embryos that causes concern. On climate change, it’s the argument – exploited and propagated by fossil fuel interests – that government has no place telling companies what to do. And on vaccines, as on home schooling and sex education, anti-science sentiments largely have to do with the idea that parents – and parents alone – are the ones who should make choices for their children. “They don’t want the government telling them what to do,” said Ronnee Schreiber, who teaches gender and politics at San Diego State University. “It’s about being anti-government regulation and ‘preservation of the privacy of the family’.” Rosenau said some studies suggested that those confronted with evidence that contradicted deeply held beliefs may become more sceptical of unrelated scientific claims. Creationists can be drawn to climate denial or mistrust of vaccines – even though there is universal acceptance of climate change by the world’s top scientists and the eradication of measles through mass vaccination campaigns is seen as a singular public health achievement.  But there is no firm evidence that Republicans are more distrustful of vaccinations than Democrats – or, leaving aside party identification, that conservatives are less likely than liberals to protect their children from disease. The Pew Research Center, in a poll released last week, found two-thirds of Americans supported mandatory vaccines. But there was a deep strain of suspicion among those under 30 years old, with 41% thinking vaccines should be a parental choice. More than one-third of Republicans polled thought vaccines should be left up to parents – compared to 26% in 2009. But the figure was about the same among voters who called themselves independent in the newest poll. Some 22% of Democrats thought parents should decide on vaccines, compared with 27% in 2009. A 2013 survey showed 26% of Republicans believe the now-demolished claims that vaccines cause autism – compared to 16% of Democrats.  But other research showed no real political divide among the outliers who fear childhood vaccinations.   Paul, a libertarian Republican, is an eye doctor, but his comments insisting that most vaccines “ought to be voluntary” and citing “many tragic cases” run counter to the guidelines of the American Medical Association, which says physicians have an ethical responsibility to encourage universal childhood immunisation. But the anti-vaccination movement much more typically skews to the left. The environmental lawyer Robert Kennedy Jr dismayed many colleagues when he refused to let go of the argument that preservatives used in vaccines caused a spike in autism – long after those claims had been discredited. Religious and social conservatives did object to the HPV vaccine, which some on the right claimed would encourage young girls to have sex. Fiscal conservatives lashed out when Barack Obama allocated funding under the 2009 stimulus to promoting the H1N1 flu vaccine. But American conservatives for the most part have had no quarrel with vaccines – unless they are on a collision course with other deeply held beliefs, said John Evans, who teaches bioethics at the University of California at San Diego and is married to Schreiber. “Religious conservatives are totally whole-hog with applied science, or what we call medicine,” he said. “They are all in favour of inventing new vaccines, but they have these moral lines.” But it’s hard to discount entirely signs of growing distrust of scientists among some Republicans, even before more than 100 cases of measles were discovered in the US this year, in 14 states and Washington DC. Climate scientists, in particular, have been accused of pursuing an ideological agenda for urging cuts to the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing global warming. “One strand in all of this is definitely the growth within the Republican right of scepticism about scientists as authority figures,” said Theda Skocpol, professor of government and sociology at Harvard. “They just don’t accept that scientists are public authority figures.” She also said that scepticism was growing among young people across the political spectrum – people who are not as familiar with the risks of childhood diseases because of the overall effectiveness of vaccination programmes. Evans agreed: “It’s the Tea Party ideas of ‘don’t tread on me’ and total freedom,” he said. Even if it carries a toll."

"All the recent declarations that 2014 was the hottest year on record seems to have prompted a spate of panic denial among climate change contrarians, denialists and ideologues. We’ve had a declaration of one of the “most extraordinary scandals of our time” from UK climate science manglers Christopher Booker and James Delingpole.  The accusation is that climate scientists have been “fiddling” the world’s temperature data with the express motivation of showing the world is warmer than it really is. This was sparked by a blog from a retired accountant and climate sceptic who “discovered” that data from three temperature stations in Paraguay had been altered when NASA compiled its global temperature record. Fellow Guardian blogger Dana Nuccitelli has a rundown. But more on this in a bit, because I’d like to turn to the button-down mind of Maurice Newman, Tony Abbott’s handpicked chief business advisor. Newman, who thinks human-caused climate change is a “myth” and a “delusion”, also bought into the great new conspiracy that climate scientists are fiddling temperature data. But Newman also decided he would try and pin the deaths of thousands of British pensioners at the feet of renewable energy policies and “political elites” who back action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Writing in The Australian (where else?), Newman claimed:  It is a fact, according to British charity Age UK, 3.5 million elderly Britons are at risk from winter cold. It is estimated 25,000 “excess winter deaths” across Britain will result from the inability of the poor to afford power because renewable energy policies have driven it beyond reach.  … Back in the real world, the poor are dying of the cold while the political elites and their friends bask in the warmth of cosy conferences, taxpayer subsidies and research grants. Did Age UK really say those excess winter deaths would result from “the inability of the poor to afford power because renewable energy policies have driven it beyond reach”, as Newman claimed?  I sent Newman’s article to Age UK and asked them about this claim. They sent me a statement from the charity’s director Caroline Abrahams. She said: The sad fact is that many of these deaths could have been prevented. Cold homes, caused by a number of factors including poor insulation and high energy costs, are a major cause of excess winter deaths. In the short term we would urge all older people to claim the benefits they’re entitled to so they can afford to turn the heating up and stay warm. However the only long-term solution to this problem is an ambitious government-led programme to bring all our housing up to a high energy efficiency standard. Notice there’s no mention of “renewable energy policies” which Newman claimed the charity had blamed for driving energy prices higher. In fact, the charity says the key to reducing the risk of death from cold among pensioners is to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. Newman is not only misrepresenting the charity’s position, he appears to be making up positions that the charity simply does not hold.  But what about those high energy prices in the UK mentioned by the charity?  Research from the UK’s government-backed Committee on Climate Change found that between 2004 and 2011 the average annual energy bill in the UK went up from £610 to £970.  Only £30 of that £360 increase was due to costs related to low-carbon power generation. Most of the increase, the analysis said, was down to higher gas prices and network costs (maintaining poles and wires). In my view, Newman’s attempt to pin the blame for the deaths of UK pensioners on renewable energy policies is either disgustingly dishonest or pathetically sloppy. Of course this isn’t the first time Maurice Newman has misrepresented research to service his paranoia and conspiracy theories over climate change.  We’ve played this game of whack-a-mole before.  In January, analysis of global temperature data from NASA found that 2014 was likely the hottest year on record, although the fine print shows that statistically it tied for first place with 2010 and 2005. Tying for NASA’s fourth hottest year were 1998, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2013.  According to NASA’s analysis, the 15 warmest years on record have all occurred from 1998 onwards (the year at which many ‘sceptics’ claim, wrongly, that global warming stopped). The UK’s MetOffice also put 2014 as a tie for the warmest year on record.   The Japanese Meteorological Agency had 2014 as outright warmest, as did the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (there’s a good explainer on different measures of global temperature at NASA’s Earth Matters blog). Analysis of satellite measurements of the lower troposphere also had 2014 in the top ten warmest years. As the World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Michael Jarraud pointed out, the ranking of any individual year isn’t as important as the longer term trend. Fourteen of the fifteen hottest years have all been this century. We expect global warming to continue, given that rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the increasing heat content of the oceans are committing us to a warmer future. All this talk of hottest years put the climate denialist community into a tailspin, with Booker, Delingpole, Newman and others claiming the whole thing was a scam. Again I’d refer you to Dana Nuccitelli’s analysis. But let’s be absolutely crystal clear about what is being alleged. The allegation is that climate scientists in agencies across the world are altering temperature data taken by some thermometers and that this alteration is motivated entirely to make it look as though the world has been warming more than it really has. There is not a shred of evidence for this global conspiracy. There is no secret tape of climate scientists and meteorologists huddled together agreeing how this elaborate scam will be pulled off. No email trail where scientists discuss the records they’ll choose. No grand scam hidden in the methodology. At the same time, there is more than ample information in the public domain – where it has been for many years – showing how global temperature records are put together from the millions of pieces of data generated by thermometers across the planet on land and floating in oceans. Neither do these so called ‘sceptics’ (generally they are not sceptics) mention the rapid and accelerating melting of ice sheets at both poles, the heat build up in the world’s oceans or the rising sea levels – all of which are clear signals of a warming planet before you’ve even shot a glance at a thermometer. What some conservative commentators and bloggers are doing is denying or discarding this information and replacing it with innuendo and a conspiracy theory for which they have no evidence.  The reason there’s no evidence for it is because this conspiracy theory is pathetic and embarrassing bunk. In August 2014 we saw this exact same evidence-free conspiracy theory play out after Australia experienced its hottest year in the Bureau of Meteorology’s record going back to 1910  The claim then was the same – that scientists had been selectively employing a technique with the deliberate aim of making things appear warmer  Again, it is not a secret that some temperature readings do undergo changes – and those changes can return higher or lower values.  As a NASA spokesperson explained to Media Matters, “the largest adjustment in the global surface temperature record occurs over the oceans” and this “actually lowers global temperature trends”. But why would you selectively change some data collected by thermometers when you analyse it?  When networks of weather stations were set up around the world, they were not designed to be a long-term record of the climate. Rather, they were there to record the weather from one day to the next. Let’s say that you have a record of temperature readings from a weather station at, oh I don’t know, Denierville (not an actual place). In Denierville, temperature readings are written down every day for decades, with only the occasional missing day. For that temperature to give a true reflection of Denierville’s climate over the decades, you need to know a few things.  For example, was the temperature taken at the same time each day? Was the thermometer always in the same place, or was it moved across town or around the corner in a shadier spot? Have trees or buildings popped up around the thermometer, or have they been taken down? How about if your thermometer was out in the open air in full sun but sometime ago was placed inside a box or a piece of standard equipment (like a Stevenson Screen), biasing the new temperatures low? Would you allow for that? What if you want your Denierville temperatures to be part of a network of climate records? Were your thermometers calibrated and checked in the same way as all the others? Unless you make allowances for things like this, then the raw data you plot on a graph becomes unreliable as a consistent record of Denierville’s climate over time.  What if you plot all the temperatures and notice a jump in the data where things suddenly get hotter or colder?  Do you ignore that, or do you check to see if the thermometer was changed or moved or if other temperature stations in the region also show the same jumps around the same time?  If the other temperature stations don’t show the same jumps, suggesting its not a natural change but something else, what do you do then? Should scientists just ignore all of this or make an allowance for it? If you decide to allow for changes like this, are you part of a global conspiracy, or are you just doing solid science? As climate scientist Professor Neville Nicholls explained to me last year: A scientist can’t ignore those effects. It’s not science to just go ahead and plot that raw data. But what if you did plot the raw data anyway?  A member of the team of global temperature analysts at Berkeley Earth, Zeke Hausfather, was curious.  Does it confirm the suspicions of the climate science denialists? I’ll let you decide. Turns out that global temperature adjustments actually reduce the long-term warming trend, mostly due to oceans. pic.twitter.com/WccfMXnhQi"

"Recently, in an effort to embarrass Republicans pandering to their scientifically challenged base, Senate Democrats proposed a series of votes on climate change. While most Americans and the overwhelming majority of scientists believe climate change is real and people are the primary cause of it, Republican voters are evenly divided on whether it exists at all, and reject the idea that we are responsible. One amendment, by the Democratic senator Brian Schatz, stated simply that climate change is real and human activity significantly contributes to it. Republican senator John Hoeven offered a compromise: take the word “significantly” out. When asked why, he said: “It was about finding that balance that would bring bipartisan support to the bill.”  Reaching across the aisle in search of compromise and consensus is the professed goal of almost every candidate for public office in the US, particularly in recent times, when presidents have come to personify not unity but division. Over the past six decades, the 10 most polarising years in terms of presidential approval have been under either George W Bush or Barack Obama. As a means, bipartisanship is, of course, an admirable goal: the more politicians are able to work together, put the interests of their constituents first and get things done, the better. The grandstanding, bickering and procedural one-upmanship that characterises so much of what passes for politics is one of the things that makes electorates cynical and drives down voter turnout. But as an end in itself, bipartisanship is at best shallow and at worst corrosive. For it entirely depends what parties are joining together to do. This is particularly true in America, where constituencies are openly gerrymandered, both parties are funded by big money, and legislation is often written by corporate lobbyists. Bipartisan efforts over the past couple of decades have produced the Iraq war, the deregulation of the financial industry, the bank bailout made necessary by that deregulation, the slashing of welfare to the poor, and an exponential increase in incarceration. As the hapless Steve Martin says to his hopeless travel companion, John Candy, in Planes, Trains and Automobiles: “You know, I was thinking, when we put our heads together … we’ve really gotten nowhere.” Comity in the polity is overrated and should certainly not be mistaken for what is right or even popular. And even if it wasn’t overrated, bipartisanship is not always possible. Half of Republicans still believe the US did find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, over half believe climate change is a hoax, and almost half do not believe in evolution. There is a limit to how much agreement you can reach with people with whom you disagree on fundamental matters of fact, let alone principle. But if the parties cannot work together, they are at least supposed to work separately. What has become evident since Republican victories in November’s midterm elections, which delivered them both houses of Congress, is that they don’t just have a problem compromising with Democrats – they cannot even compromise with each other. For the past four years they have revelled in their dysfunctionality, using Obama as a foil. Apparently unaware that brinkmanship is supposed to take you to the edge, not over it, they have shut down the government and almost forced the nation to default on its debts through a series a spectacular temper tantrums. As the Republican congressman Marlin Stutzman pointed out in a particularly candid moment 18 months ago, when Republican obduracy caused a government shutdown, “We have to get something out of this. And I don’t know what that even is.” These hissy fits have invariably been aimed at forcing Obama to undo the very things he pledged to do if elected, and to which Republicans have no plausible, coherent response: during his first term that was Obamacare; now it is immigration reform. Opposition, in short, had become not a temporary electoral state but a permanent ideological mindset in which their role was not to produce workable ideas but to resist them. When they won the Senate as well as the House, they were supposed to work together to produce Republican legislation that Obama would be forced to veto, definitively exposing the real source of the gridlock. In fact, they are simply imploding under the weight of their own obstinacy. They’ve run out of people to blame for not compromising with them. So now they’re blaming each other. “The Republicans are like Fido when he finally catches the car,” the Democratic senator Charles Schumer told the New York Times. “Now they don’t have any clue about what to do. They are realising that being in the majority is both less fun and more difficult than they thought.” Their current internal feud was prompted by Obama’s executive order for modest immigration reform, which was enacted last November. It aims to prevent the deportation of up to 5 million undocumented immigrants living in the US, provide many with work permits, and shift the focus of immigration control to deportations of convicted criminals and recent arrivals. The Republican-controlled House, where funding bills must originate and legislation can be passed by a simple majority, has voted for a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) bill that would eviscerate Obama’s reforms. But to get the bill through the 100-seat Senate they need 60 votes. Senate Republicans have only 54 seats and Democrats, who are unanimously opposed to the bill, keep filibustering it. In a functional party the Republican Speaker, John Boehner, would work out what changes he could make to the bill to give the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a fighting chance of getting the requisite majority to pass legislation they could both take credit for. Instead, Boehner has offered McConnell not compromise but commiserations. “He’s got a tough job over there; I’ve got a tough job over here. God bless him, and good luck.” The House has sent the same bill to the Senate twice. The Senate has failed to pass it several times. In effect, they’ve treated the Republican-controlled Senate no differently to how they treated its Democratic predecessor, with similar results. Reflexively, House Republicans have their bottom lip extended and at the ready. “We sent them a bill,” representative Michael Burgess told Politico, “and they need to pass it. They need to pass our bill.” A tantrum is not far off. “Politically, [McConnell] needs to make a lot of noise,” says representative John Carter. Senate Republicans, meanwhile, roll their eyes, count to 10 and wait patiently for the noise to give way to reason. “We can go through the motions, sure, but I don’t think we’re fooling anybody,” said Republican senator Jeff Flake about the prospect of another doomed vote. “Because we need [Democratic] support to get on the bill.” If they don’t find a solution by 27 February, then the DHS will be shut down and Obama won’t have had a thing to do with it. The true source of the gridlock over the past six years will be clearer than ever. The emperor will be out there, twerking, in the buff. “It’s not an issue of commitment, it’s a matter of math,” said the Republican senator John McCain – perhaps failing to realise that math, like science, is no competition for blind faith and bad politics."
"“Save the world and make a little cash on the side.” That’s the motto of Russ George, the colourful entrepreneur behind Planktos Science who wants to put geoengineering into practice now. George is convinced that by adding iron sulphate to the oceans, he can stimulate plankton blooms and so suck enough carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to offset human emissions from burning coal and oil. In 2007, backed by a Canadian real estate developer, the Planktos ship set sail from San Francisco bound for the Galapagos Islands and loaded up with iron sulphate. George was going to make a killing by selling carbon offsets to whoever wanted them.   George believed, and told whoever asked, that ocean fertilization could become a $100bn business and hinted to journalist Jeff Goodell that America’s biggest coal-burning utility was interested in buying his carbon credits. The venture soon collapsed, leaving a cloud of mistrust hanging over all research into iron fertilisation. Not long after Russ George set the regulatory alarm bells ringing, the London Convention, which regulates ocean dumping, and the Convention on Biological Diversity both passed resolutions banning iron fertilisation experiments except under restrictive conditions. Rogue geoengineers like Russ George drive respectable researchers crazy, not to mention those business people who think there really are profits to be had from a plan B. On this question, last week’s report by the US National Research Council (NRC) stresses that carbon dioxide removal is expensive and limited by “technical immaturity”. A range of companies have identified business opportunities in technologies designed to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it somewhere more or less permanently. Those who believe they can profit from carbon credits because polluters with emission caps will pay for them point to the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism, which allows parties to meet their emission reduction obligations by paying developing countries to grow forests onto land cleared long ago.  More trees means more carbon dioxide soaked up in vegetation rather than in the air, at least for a time. However, worried about the verifiability and permanency of carbon dioxide stored in trees, the European Union does not allow credits generated that way to be traded in its emissions trading scheme. And the commercial promise of other methods of carbon dioxide removal is likely to be very limited. Credits for using giant machines to remove the gas are not likely to be accepted internationally for a long time, if at all, not least because the industrial infrastructure needed for extraction would need to be about as big as the infrastructure that puts it there – oil wells, coal mines, railways, pipelines, power plants, refineries and so on. Neverthless “air capture” technologies are being developed by firms like Carbon Engineering, a Canadian company founded by Harvard physicist and geoengineering enthusiast David Keith. They are ventures looking for a rationale, but that has not stopped Alberta oil sands billionaire N Murray Edwards and Bill Gates from investing in the company. The prospects are awful when fossil fuel companies play both sides of the fence – oil companies such as Shell and ConocoPhillips have also put money into geoengineering. Is it ethical for the polluters to promote technologies that may allow them to continue to pollute?  If the promises made by geoengineering erode the political incentives requiring polluters to cut their emissions, will we see fossil fuel corporations begin lobbying to get political endorsement for climate modification? The ethical and political difficulties deepen when we get to the other kind of geoengineering scheme reviewed in the NRC report, “albedo modification” – formerly known as solar radiation management – schemes to reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface. No one will ever make money out of trading emission reduction credits in global dimming. But some commercial outfits can envisage a desperate world paying them princely sums for access to the technology for doing it.  There have been a flurry of patents being issued, 28 at the last count, including one for a hose suspended by blimps in the sky that would spray sulphate aerosols. Branded the StratoShield it’s owned by a firm named Intellectual Ventures, which markets the device as “a practical, low-cost way to reverse catastrophic warming of the Arctic – or the entire planet.” Among the investors in Intellectual Ventures who perhaps see themselves making a motza from planetary catastrophe are Nathan Myhrvold, formerly chief technology officer at Microsoft, and Bill Gates himself. If the future of the world comes to depend on the Stratoshield, will they play hardball? So here’s the bottom line: if you want to make money out of global warming invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy companies.

"On January 19, 2011, I got a phone call from two men who told me they were consultants for the CIA. Roger Lueken and Michael Canes, analysts for the Logistics Management Institute, asked, among other things, “If another country were trying to control our climate, would we be able to detect it?” I told them that I thought we could, because if a cloud in the stratosphere were created (the most commonly proposed method of control) that was thick enough, large enough, and long-lasting enough to change the amount of energy reaching Earth, we could certainly see it with the same ground-based and satellite instruments we use to measure stratospheric clouds from volcanic eruptions. If, on the other hand, low clouds were being brightened over the ocean (another suggested means of cooling the climate), we could see telltale patterns in the tops of the clouds with satellite photos. And it would also be easy to observe aeroplanes or ships injecting gases or particles into the atmosphere.  At the same time, I wondered whether they also wanted to know if others would know about it, if the CIA was controlling the world’s climate. Given that the CIA is a major sponsor of the recently released US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) reports on geoengineering (which they have renamed “climate intervention”), the question arises as to the possible interest of the CIA in global climate control. Let me be clear. I completely agree with all the NAS findings. Global warming is real and is being caused by humans, mainly by burning coal, oil, petrol and natural gas, which puts carbon dioxide – a greenhouse gas – into the atmosphere. Global warming will result in major harm to humanity if left unchecked. The solution is to stop using fossil fuels for our energy supply and switch to solar and wind power, and to adapt to some of the coming climate change. Geoengineering by blocking sunlight should not be implemented now, as its risks and benefits are too uncertain, but we need more research on the various proposed scenarios. Taking carbon dioxide out of the air is a good thing, but currently extremely expensive, and we need research on that, too. The 2014 US Quadrennial Defense Review makes clear that climate change poses a major threat to the US and the rest of the world. It says: “The pressures caused by climate change will influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on economies, societies, and governance institutions around the world. These effects are threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability, and social tensions – conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.” Certainly it is the job of the US military and the CIA to help protect our country from such threats, and it is not surprising that the CIA is interested to learn about geoengineering. In fact, the CIA opened a Center on Climate Change and National Security in 2009. When it was forced by Congress to close it in 2012, it said they would continue working on these issues anyway. Whether you see the role of the CIA in climate change as nefarious or protective depends on how you weigh evidence with your preconceived notions. There is a long history of weather and climate control being proposed for military purposes, as described brilliantly in the 2010 book by James Fleming, Fixing the Sky, but there is no evidence the CIA is doing anything wrong on this issue. I know of no way to control local or regional climate with geoengineering without effects elsewhere, but while it is possible that such techniques could be developed by research, geoengineering for hostile purposes is prohibited by the United Nations Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques. I don’t want to be working on geoengineering. But I don’t yet see the political will in the world to address global warming. If the US enhances its research efforts on geoengineering, we will learn about both the potential risks and benefits of its implementation, so that future policymakers will be able to make informed decisions, and not hasty ones in a panic if confronted by environmental dangers. My recent work lists five potential benefits and 26 potential risks of stratospheric geoengineering, and the number one benefit – if stratospheric geoengineering is possible at all (an important research question) – is that it could cool the planet, reversing some of the dangers of global warming. But will we ever be able to overcome the governance and ethical issues? Thus further research is urgently needed. In the meantime, we need to vigorously move to a carbon-free energy system."
"A new paper published in Global Change Biology summarizes the results of a 23-year experiment monitoring how global warming is impacting certain ecosystems. At the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, the scientists have monitored ten 30-square meter plots of meadowland since 1989. Above five of those plots, overhead infrared radiators have been on constantly since January 1991, while the other five were used as the controls for comparison. The study reports, The microclimatic effect of experimental heating throughout the growing season has been to warm the top 15 cm of soil by ~2 °C and dry it by 10–20% (gravimetric basis) during the growing season, and to prolong the snow-free season at each end by an average of ~2 weeks. The scientists monitored the type of vegetation growing in the meadows. In both the controlled and heated plots, they saw a shift away from flowering plants, towards woody plants like sagebrush, with a bigger change in the heated plots. They also monitored the amount of carbon in the soil. In the heated plots, the amount of carbon stored in the soil decreased, but it later rebounded. In the control plots, the carbon storage decreased more slowly, and hasn’t yet rebounded after 23 years. Simulations suggest the soil carbon storage will continue to decline for about anther 40 years before it rebounds. The change in carbon storage was caused by the shift from flowering to woody plants. As lead author John Harte of UC Berkeley explained, When shrubs replace forbs [flowering plants], the rate of input of organic carbon to the soil declines because in these ecosystems forbs photosynthesize at a higher rate (per area) than do the shrubs and return more annual growth to the soil at the end of the growing season. The loss of all that annual production leads to a rather rapid decline in soil carbon (the quantity factor). But the soil carbon arising from dead shrub leaves is less digestible than is the soil carbon from forbs (the quality factor).  Over a period of decades, this leads to the eventual recovery of the soil carbon. The delay in the influence of the quality factor is due to the fact that until the soil carbon resulting from shrub production has built up to a sufficient level, most of the soil carbon will still be that from forbs. The study notes that a similar change happening as spruce forests convert to pine forests. This shift results in less carbon storage in both the short- and long-term, causing what’s called a “positive feedback,” as more carbon remaining in the atmosphere will amplify global warming further. I asked Dr. Harte if he could speculate about whether these results give us an indication about how we can expect carbon storage in the global biosphere to change in a hotter world. He told me, A basis for speculation at the global scale comes from ice core data showing that over the past hundreds of thousands of years, during periods in which earth is warming, atmospheric CO2 levels rise, and during periods in which earth is cooling, those levels drop. The oceans undoubtedly play a big role in this but it is likely that terrestrial ecosystems also factor in. While we can’t yet be quantitative, there is good reason to believe that the terrestrial contribution is on average, one of positive feedback (that is, contributing to the global trend revealed in the ice core data). While some of the changes in the heated plots were expected, the scientists were surprised that they saw similar changes occur in the control plots. Since 1991, the snow-free season has become extended, the soil has become hotter and drier, and there’s been a shift from flowering to woody vegetation. Harte said of his research,  We were actually very surprised to see such dramatic changes in the control plots. That the plant community could undergo such rapid change, from a carpet of wildflowers to sagebrush, in just a couple of decades under the artificial heaters was not a surprise. But that the same transition would be visible in the ambient plots was a surprise; we expected that such a transition would take at least 3 or 4 decades.  And even more surprising was the clear evidence after two decades that the ambient plots were losing soil carbon to the atmosphere. A number of soil scientists said that it was a waste of time to measure soil carbon because we would never detect change in the lifetime of an experiment. Not only could we detect it rather rapidly in the heated plots, but it is now apparent even in the ambient plots.  The results of the study are consistent with recent observations in North America, towards less soil carbon storage (due in large part to droughts), and toward more wooded shrub plants. Overall, the study shows that at least in mountain meadows and grasslands, ecosystems changes due to global warming are already being observed sooner than expected. And at least in these ecosystems, we’re seeing less soil carbon storage as the world warms. Based on data from past climate changes, shifts in ecosystems like these may act to accelerate global warming."

"The head of Shell has launched a stinging attack on increasingly vocal critics who are calling for fossil fuels to be left in the ground, accusing them of peddling naive and impractical solutions to climate change. Ben van Beurden urged fellow industry leaders meeting in London to be “more assertive” in debates over the future of energy. But Shell’s chief executive admitted that the oil sector had its own credibility problem, enhanced by the fact that too many energy industrialists had been slow to acknowledge global warming.  In a speech to be delivered on Thursday night to the International Petroleum Week annual dinner, Van Beurden will warn his colleagues that they must be prepared for ever more intense public discussion about the role of fossil fuels in the runup to the UN climate change conference in Paris later this year. “The outcome of the political process is uncertain, but the trends behind it are unmistakeable. Even more than the oil price, these trends will shape the future of the industry over the coming decades. For a sustainable energy future, we need a more balanced debate. ‘Fossil fuels out, renewables in’ – too often, that’s what it boils down to. Yet in my view, that’s simply naive,” he argues.  “Yes, climate change is real. And yes, renewables are an indispensable part of the future energy mix. But no, provoking a sudden death of fossil fuels isn’t a plausible plan,” he adds. The Shell boss’s comments are likely to be welcomed by those political leaders who feel pressurised by environmentalists over the green agenda but they are likely to lead to criticism over the company’s own record, particularly with regard to its drilling in the Arctic and investments into carbon-heavy tar sands of Canada.  The comments from Van Beurden indicate that the oil industry is beginning to become rattled by those talking about a “carbon bubble” of oil and gas reserves that should be left in the ground, and moves by the Church of England and universities to remove their investments from the large oil and coal extractors. The Dutchman was due to tell his audience that three billion people still lack access to the modern energy that many in the west take for granted. This is not just about having a television set, he will say, but about the difference between poverty and prosperity. He will warn that demand is growing with more people on the planet, more people living in cities and more people rising out of poverty. “The issue is how to balance one moral obligation, energy access for all, against the other: fighting climate change. We still need fossil fuels for a lower carbon, higher energy future,” he argues. The debate over climate change is being run by forces opposed to the fossil fuel industry so that it is unbalanced and this needs to be addressed by the oil companies becoming more involved, argues van Beurden.  “Our industry should be less aloof, more assertive. We have to make sure that our voice is heard by members of government, by civil society and the general public. I’m well aware that the industry’s credibility is an issue. Stereotypes that fail to see the benefits our industry brings to the world are short-sighted. But we must also take a critical look at ourselves. “You cannot talk credibly about lowering emissions globally if, for example, you are slow to acknowledge climate change; if you undermine calls for an effective carbon price; and if you always descend into the ‘jobs v environment’ argument in the public debate.” Van Beurden, recognised as one of the more articulate energy executives, has only been in the top job at Shell for a little over 12 months and after a relatively low-profile start has begun to emerge as a significant public performer. His rival Bob Dudley, the chief executive of BP, is preoccupied with the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon accident, while Rex Tillerson at ExxonMobil tends to avoid the limelight. "

"The Goolarabooloo people have their own name for James Price Point: Walmadany. It’s a spectacular bit of country in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, with soil the colour of burnt orange, and sapphire blue waters. But Walmadany is also a site of contention, and Woodside Petroleum’s plans for a $45bn gas hub on the site were met by mass protests. While those plans were eventually abandoned in 2013, talk of drilling for liquified natural gas won’t go away.  This is not the first time the remote and pristine Kimberley has resisted the intrusion of a mining company. In 1980, then WA premier Charles Court gave the nod to a 45-strong convoy of mining trucks and exploratory drilling in Noonkanbah, on the Fitzroy river. The convoy’s police escort had to clear a blockade of protesters that included traditional landowners. Broome-based dance company Marrugeku has devised a new work called Cut the Sky, premiering at Perth festival on Friday, which draws on these stories and seeks to give an Indigenous perspective on climate change. Marrugeku’s co-artistic director, Dalisa Pigram, says it has been “quite heartbreaking” to watch her people be torn in half by the creeping industrialisation of the land. The proposed gas hub placed an ultimatum on the community to protect one of Australia’s last remaining wildernesses or pay the price – “how to maintain that care for country and make life for our people better? Those traditional owners were forced to make those decisions.” While the work draws from the struggles of the Kimberley people, it is a much larger treatise on how Indigenous people around the world process the issue of climate change. The diverse cast and crew not only features Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, others hail from afar as India, Burkina Faso and Belgium. Together they share the difficult task set by Marrugeku: how to artistically engage with the issue of climate change. Pigram says the climate change discussion is dominated by “a lot of people coming from logic and science.” Cut the Sky attempts to access a very complex, global problem using a different language, of theatre and dance. And at its core the work is about “valuing an Aboriginal perspective of looking at country”. It becomes clear that it’s no easy feat to condense in just a few sentences the complicated and varied ways in which care for the land is embedded in Indigenous Australian social structures, philosophy and spirituality.  “You’re born with this responsibility to manage the balance of country,” says Pigram. These responsibilities are not forced upon but hang over every aspect of their culture and life, and they are always thinking “if we don’t keep that balance, there will be consequences.” Alongside Pigram sits Rachael Swain, Marrugeku’s other co-artistic director, who adds that climate change is essentially about balance, or more accurately, an environmental imbalance. “A big part of Indigenous knowledge systems is around the balance of the seasons,” says Swain, “and weather patterns changing.” The pair mention cast member Edwin Lee Mulligan, a custodian of Noonkanbah whose five poems make up the spoken element of the work. Mulligan’s descendants were some of the last Indigenous Australians to walk out from the Great Sandy Desert and their stories seem to illustrate how deeply attuned they were to a changing environment. Since the coming of time the spirits of the skies have been painting their pictures, telling the story of changing season. They reached to the earth choosing individual vibrant colours to paint the universal giant canvas. Calculating the mathematics of day and night, of rotating cosmos with our sun, stars and the moon. Second by second in an endless equation.  – An excerpt from Cut the Sky, by Edwin Lee Mulligan “There’s a lot more to it than a few dreaming stories,” says Pigram. “Our culture is the oldest living culture for a reason. There are things to value there.” Swain says the piece is split into five mediations on “what happens if we don’t listen to country”, and zig-zags through time. “We did that to break up the tyranny of some kind of lineal progression to climate change. Because that was killing us, artistically, having to carry the weight of that idea.” The non-linear storytelling also shakes the audience free from their default mode of logic, instead opening up their ability to feel. “That’s the way Indigenous performance functions,” says Swain. “They engage with an audience from a place of feeling: feeling a different point of view, feeling a way of dealing with this information. Rather than understanding it in the way Western theatre operates where information is much more spoon-fed: ‘you will think this now’, ‘you will feel this now’.” In her choreography work, Pigram set about creating a space in which the audience must actively enter. “To not be observing what’s going on over there, but to really come to us.” Perth festival – like almost all the major city festivals around the country – is financially supported by resource giants, in their case Chevron, Rio Tinto and Woodside. These companies have not specifically funded Cut the Sky – a foundation called Wind Over Water, consisting of private donors, has sponsored the theatre work. Julian Donaldson, the festival’s general manager, said there was “nothing difficult” about having a work like Cut the Sky on the bill, as well as Rio Tinto a sponsor of the festival. “Our resources companies are in the arts because they have a belief in what the arts can offer Western Australia, to make us a more liveable, viable, sustainable place.” Donaldson says no mining company has ever imposed any curatorial will on the festival, nor “shied away from a debate”. Swain and Pigram recognise that the festival retains the right to make their own choices about sponsorship, and that the answer to arts funding is “not one size fits all”. Meanwhile the production has been looking at how to reduce its own carbon footprint by switching to more energy efficient LED lights. Pigram doesn’t seem optimistic about the immediate future for Walmadany, which she predicts will be forced to come to the negotiation table and choose between a royalty agreement or compulsory acquisition. “WA laws say you can’t say ‘no’ to anything that’s going on.”  And just as they did Noonkanbah over 30 years ago, such discussions cause a painful riff in the community. “There’s still so much divide in the community with fracking and people’s opinions on water contamination. Sometimes you just want to hide away and not think about any of it.”  • Cut the Sky premieres at Perth festival on 27 February and runs until 1 March"
"“First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you,” said Mahatma Gandhi. The climate change campaign to divest from fossil fuels seems to be moving through those stages at express speed, with a sudden barrage of attacks from the coal and oil lobbies ahead of its global divestment day on Valentine’s day. The speed is appropriate given that the campaign, which argues the fossil fuel industry is a danger to both the climate and investors’ capital, is the fastest growing divestment campaign yet seen, moving quicker than those against tobacco and apartheid. It’s moving fast in the financial world too, with one finance executive calling it “one of the fastest-moving debates I think I’ve seen in my 30 years in markets”. Let’s take the “laugh at you first”. This unintentionally hilarious cartoon, from a front group for a well-known anti-environmental PR firm, suggests that divestment will kill your “love affair” with fossil fuels, basically leaving you living in a dark cave. The suggestion that divestment is about ending all fossil fuel use tomorrow is a complete fantasy. The actual demand is for investors to stop purchasing new stock and rebalance their portfolios out of fossil fuels over five years.  The justification is that there is already three times more fossil fuels ready to be extracted than can be burned, if the pledge by the world’s governments to keep global warming under 2C is to be kept. Yet the fossil fuel industry spent $670bn in 2013 exploring for more coal, oil and gas reserves that will be worthless if climate change is tackled.  In a similar vein, but closer to fighting than laughing, is the claim that coal is “the bedrock of modern life” from the American Energy Alliance, a group with links to the fossil fuel industry.  “We have a moral imperative to make sure that people can refrigerate their food and medicines, grow crops and plants with fertilizer, and keep their homes lit at night and warm during winter,” write the straight-faced AEA analysts. “All of this is what divestment activists are asking us to divest from — the bedrock of modern life.” About 80% of all coal reserves are going to have to stay in the ground to tackle global warming, so it’s worth noting at this point that the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, backed by 194 governments, recently concluded that doing so was both affordable and essential to alleviating global poverty. A further attack on the divestment campaign came directly from the oil industry on Wednesday. The new report commissioned by the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) - ignoring the key investment caveat that the past is an unreliable guide to the future - goes back half a century to conclude that if all US universities divested from fossil fuels, they could lose up to $3.2bn a year. The work, conducted by retired Chicago Law School professor Daniel R Fischel, looked at the performance of portfolios with and without energy stocks over the last 50 years.“Every bit of economic evidence available to us today demonstrates that fossil-fuel divestment is a bad idea,” said Prof Fischel. “The costs of divestment are clearly substantial and stand to have real financial impacts on the returns generated by endowment funds.”  Barry Russell, president and CEO of IPAA, weighed in too: “This first-of-its-kind study confirms that the costs associated with divestment are real and enormous.” It appears Fischel and Russell have their heads stuck firmly in the oil sands.  The overwhelming majority of the economic evidence I have seen shows the exact opposite. Here are some studies, not funded by the oil industry, which indicate recent divestment would, if anything, have had a positive impact on returns and can reduce investment risk: MSCI, Advisor Partners, Impax, Aperio, S&P Capital IQ and BNEF. I have seen one report, from Mercer, that said “divestment is likely to have up-front and recurring costs”. But investors need to look forward. “It is completely wrong to assume the drivers of stock performance in the last 50 years will be same for the next 50 years,” says Ben Caldecott, at the University of Oxford’s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment.  The AEA’s attack also ignores this by delving back into history not 50 years, but 500: “Coal solved the first energy crisis,” it crows. “In the late 1500s and early 1600s, the English faced what was possibly the world’s first energy crisis—they were running out of wood.” Returning to the modern day, and reality, every nation on the planet has pledged to tackle climate change, meaning the long-term prospects for the fossil fuel industry look uncertain at the very least. But don’t take my word for it, the president of the World Bank and the governor of the Bank of England have among others warned of the risk posed to fossil fuel assets by climate change action. The divestment movement does not seek to financially bankrupt the vastly wealthy fossil fuel industry. Instead, the campaign is aiming for moral bankruptcy and is supported by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who testifies to the power of divestment in helping defeat apartheid in South Africa. With their opponents now taking the threat of divestment seriously, the campaigners will be hoping to they are another step closer to the final stage of Ghandi’s analysis: “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.”"

"22 months and counting “Will we go ahead?” asked Shell CEO, Ben van Beurden, rhetorically, about the oil company’s plans to drill in the Arctic. “Yes if we can. I’d be so disappointed if we wouldn’t.” Van Beurden had the grace to concede that his plans “divide society,” but he seemed unable to comprehend that they might condemn it.  From new research showing that recent sea level rise is “far worse than previously thought”, to updated confirmation of how far we are transgressing our planetary environmental boundaries, an almost daily accumulation of evidence seems unable still to connect van Beurden’s words to their full implication.  What if, instead, he had said to the press conference gathered to hear Shell’s quarterly financial results a few days ago: “We wish to inform you that our business plan is to destabilise permanently the climate on which you, your families and society depend.” Harsh? Perhaps, but their strategy will end the party for the rest of us, so that their corporate party might continue. In fact, it seems that extreme weather in the form of drought is already breaking hearts in Brazil by forcing cities to cancel carnival, the greatest party of all.    It’s ironic. Those who argue it’s a good idea to respect nature’s various thresholds (like not making farming so toxic that you poison the bees who kindly pollinate our food crops) traditionally get labelled as fun-free spoilsports. But it seems it’s those who recognise no limits at all who represent the greatest threat to life’s party. While the global industrial exploitation of nature drives a mass extinction event on land and sea, it becomes ever clearer that our own well-being is dependent on the general condition of the environment. Our health, both physiological and psychological, is deeply connected to and relies on the diversity of life. Now, a new global calculator developed by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, suggests a course of action to prevent irreversible warming that could be as good for the web of life as it is for our quality of life. Radical changes to farming, transport, food and fuel will be needed, but it envisages a world of spreading forest canopies, clean, quiet electric transport and healthy, increasingly vegetarian diets. With such a potential win-win, why would anyone choose bad times with business as usual? The status quo is tenacious.  If you look at the UK’s biggest lobbying groups at the centre of European power in Brussels, their scale seems to be in direct proportion to the damage they do and how likely they are to resist progressive change. Oil, finance and aviation are all in the top five. And, even as the economics of fracking and remote oil exploration, such as in the Arctic, have fallen apart, their lobbies remain persistent and audacious. How else could a Conservative party, which extols the notion of an English person’s home being their castle, be persuaded to promote changes in the trespass law to allow fracking firms to drill beneath homes without the owners’ permission? Logic, consistency and science become inconvenient to indefensible positions. When the US Senate last month voted on whether climate change was real and caused by human activities it was creating future folklore. Accepting the first, but not the second proposition, the Senate put its debate on a par with the famous, and now seen as absurd, 1925 Scopes ‘Monkey’ case in theUS, which effectively put the theory of evolution on trial.  History is littered with the sorrow of foreknowledge of terrible things about to happen. “We wish to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families,” a line written in a letter by Tutsi pastors in 1994 must be among the saddest words ever written, as they proved correct and became the title of a book on the Rwandan massacres. Like the Holocaust of half a century earlier, there were signposts pointing toward impending atrocity. Yet, a strange disbelief about the possibility of truly extreme action left even informed observers paralysed.  Don’t we now have enough foreknowledge on global warming to call a halt in the face of those who would not only burn all currently known fossil fuel reserves, but search for more? Knowledge and learning from history are themes in The Edge of Extinction: Travels with Enduring People in Vanishing Lands, by the author Jules Pretty who draws a map of hope from the mountains of China to the Russian steppe and the snows of Canada. He describes an astonishing diversity of human experience in which our species has learned to live well with, rather than against, nature and often each other.  Done intelligently and not dogmatically, we might still make a pleasant and lasting home for everyone on our blue and green planet. But, to make the most of it and keep the party going, we’ll have to stop clinging to dead economic models which wreck our environmental foundations. Because, sadly, for those excited by the possibility of planetary relocation, the nearest known other Earth-like planet is around 13 light years away and would probably take a few hundred thousand years to get to. That’s a long time to wait to get another party started, when you can keep the one you’re already at going strong."

"Governments should set a clear target of making the world’s economy free from carbon emissions by mid-century, Sir Richard Branson and a group of other prominent businesspeople have urged. The goal – of eliminating the net impact of greenhouse gases, by replacing fossil fuels and ensuring that any remaining emissions are balanced out by carbon-saving projects such as tree-planting and carbon capture and storage – is more stretching than any yet agreed by world governments. The G8 group of rich nations has pledged to cut emissions by 80% by 2050, and some developing countries to halving emissions by then.  Branson, long a vocal advocate of action on climate change, said that setting such a goal would galvanise businesses into reducing their reliance on fossil fuels and cutting carbon dioxide. “Taking bold action on climate change simply makes good business sense,” he said. “It’s also the right thing to do for people and the planet. Setting a net-zero GHG emissions target by 2050 will drive innovation, grow jobs, build prosperity and secure a better world for what will soon be 9 billion people. Why would we wait any longer to do that?” Governments will meet in Geneva next week under the auspices of the United Nations to hammer out the draft of a text that could form the basis of a new global agreement on climate change, scheduled to be signed at a crunch conference in Paris in December. The US, China and the EU have already set out their targets on emissions beyond 2020, when current commitments made at the climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009 run out. Other nations are expected to follow suit by submitting their post-2020 national emissions targets to the UN from now to April, after which they will be evaluated to check that they are fair and add up to a global cut in emissions that will put the world on a path to avoiding the worst effects of climate change. The call to governments to pledge a zero-net-emissions target for 2050 was made by the B Team group of international business leaders. It includes Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata Group manufacturing conglomerate; Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever; Mo Ibrahim, the telecommunications billionaire; Guilherme Leal, the Brazilian billionaire; Francois-Henri Pinault, chairman of the luxury goods group Kering; Arianna Huffington, the media entrepreneur; and a handful of others. Paul Polman called on other business leaders to join in: “A target of net-zero emissions by 2050 is not only desirable but necessary. This is the time to redouble our efforts and further accelerate progress to decarbonise our economy. This is not going to be easy, but the earlier we act, the greater the economic opportunities will be.” The group said the transition to a net-zero emissions economy could, if managed correctly, bring economic benefits to all countries, rich and poor, as well as cleaner air and a healthier environment. Mary Robinson, the UN’s special envoy on climate change, said: “A transition to net-zero [emissions] will succeed only if it is done fairly. The necessary technology for sustainable development must be an available and affordable option for all countries. Without this, developing countries will have no alternative to dirty energy for their development, locking themselves into fossil fuel infrastructure for the long term, and we will fail to secure a safe climate future.”"

"Local authorities were slow to react to the problems that climate change would cause them. The prime example of this was the persistence of planners in granting permission for housing estates on flood plains despite warnings from the Environment Agency. The developers walked away with the profits, leaving the householders and the local authorities to cope when, some years down the line, the rivers overflowed. Research 12 years ago showed that part of the reason for this was that officials and councillors had difficulty translating complex climate science into an understanding of what might happen in their locality. There followed an effort by government to simplify the message and prepare for heatwaves and floods.  A new report shows that this has been successful and that the need for simple changes, like larger capacity drains and balancing lakes to cope with heavier rain, is fully understood. But now there is a snag. Government cuts have meant that many of the officials whose job it was to factor climate change into local policies have lost their jobs, and in any case there is no money to take action on adaptation. Local government is barely able to finance its core statutory duties, without thinking ahead to the effects of climate change. So no long term planning is possible. The only exceptions are local authorities that have “rebranded” climate adaptation and called it resilience to severe weather – in other words an emergency that might happen at any moment. That is the only way to get climate change back into this year’s budget."

"A prominent academic and climate change denier’s work was funded almost entirely by the energy industry, receiving more than $1.2m from companies, lobby groups and oil billionaires over more than a decade, newly released documents show. Over the last 14 years Willie Soon, a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, received a total of $1.25m from Exxon Mobil, Southern Company, the American Petroleum Institute (API) and a foundation run by the ultra-conservative Koch brothers, the documents obtained by Greenpeace through freedom of information filings show.  According to the documents, the biggest single funder was Southern Company, one of the country’s biggest electricity providers that relies heavily on coal. The documents draw new attention to the industry’s efforts to block action against climate change – including President Barack Obama’s power-plant rules. Unlike the vast majority of scientists, Soon does not accept that rising greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial age are causing climate changes. He contends climate change is driven by the sun. In the relatively small universe of climate denial Soon, with his Harvard-Smithsonian credentials, was a sought after commodity. He was cited admiringly by Senator James Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who famously called global warming a hoax. He was called to testify when Republicans in the Kansas state legislature tried to block measures promoting wind and solar power. The Heartland Institute, a hub of climate denial, gave Soon a courage award. Soon did not enjoy such recognition from the scientific community. There were no grants from Nasa, the National Science Foundation or the other institutions which were funding his colleagues at the Center for Astrophysics. According to the documents, his work was funded almost entirely by the fossil fuel lobby. “The question here is really: ‘What did API, ExxonMobil, Southern Company and Charles Koch see in Willie Soon? What did they get for $1m-plus,” said Kert Davies, a former Greenpeace researcher who filed the original freedom of information requests. Greenpeace and the Climate Investigations Center, of which Davies is the founder, shared the documents with news organisations. “Did they simply hope he was on to research that would disprove the consensus? Or was it too enticing to be able to basically buy the nameplate Harvard-Smithsonian?” From 2005, Southern Company gave Soon nearly $410,000. In return, Soon promised to publish research about the sun’s influence on climate change in leading journals, and to deliver lectures about his theories at national and international events, according to the correspondence. The funding would lead to “active participations by this PI (principal investigator) of this research proposal in all national and international forums interested in promoting the basic understanding of solar variability and climate change”, Soon wrote in a report to Southern Company. In 2012, Soon told Southern Company its grants had supported publications on polar bears, temperature changes in the Arctic and China, and rainfall patterns in the Indian monsoon. ExxonMobil gave $335,000 but stopped funding Soon in 2010, according to the documents. The astrophysicist reportedly received $274,000 from the main oil lobby, the American Petroleum Institute, and $230,000 from the Charles G Koch Foundation. He received an additional $324,000 in anonymous donations through a trust used by the Kochs and other conservative donors, the documents showed. Greenpeace has suggested Soon also improperly concealed his funding sources for a recent article, in violation of the journal’s conflict of interest guidelines. “The company was paying him to write peer-reviewed science and that relationship was not acknowledged in the peer-reviewed literature,” Davies said. “These proposals and contracts show debatable interventions in science literally on the behalf of Southern Company and the Kochs.” In letters to the Internal Revenue Service and Congress, Greenpeace said Soon may have misused the grants from the Koch foundation by trying to influence legislation. Soon did not respond to requests for comment. But he has in the past strenuously denied his industry funders had any influence over his conclusions. “No amount of money can influence what I have to say and write, especially on my scientific quest to understand how climate works, all by itself,” he told the Boston Globe in 2013. As is common among Harvard-Smithsonian scientists, Soon is not on a salary. He receives his compensation from outside grant money, said Christine Pulliam, a spokeswoman for the Center for Astrophysics. The Center for Astrophysics does not require scientists to disclose their funding sources. But Pulliam acknowleged that Soon had failed to meet disclosure requirements of some of the journals that published his research. “Soon should have followed those policies,” she said. Harvard said Soon operated outside of the university – even though he carries a Harvard ID and uses a Harvard email address.  “Willie Soon is a Smithsonian staff researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, a collaboration of the Harvard College Observatory and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory,” a Harvard spokesman, Jeff Neal, said.  “There is no record of Soon having applied for or having been granted funds that were or are administered by the University. Soon is not an employee of Harvard.” Both Harvard and the Smithsonian acknowledge that the climate is changing because of rising levels of greenhouse gas concentrations caused by human activities. Pulliam cast Soon’s association with the institutions as an issue of academic freedom: “Academic freedom is critically important. The Smithsonian stands by the process by which the research results of all of its scholars are peer reviewed and vetted by other scientists. This is the way that the scientific process works. The funding entities, regardless of their affiliation, have no influence on the research.”"

"America’s biggest state pension funds came under rising pressure on Tuesday to dump coal companies from their combined $500bn portfolio, in a major escalation of the fossil fuel divestment campaign. The California senate leader, Kevin de Leon, said he was introducing a bill on Tuesday calling on the two state funds – CalPERS, the public employees’ pension fund, and CalSTRS, the teachers’ pension funds, drop all coal holdings.  The bill is part of a larger package of climate measures – endorsed by Governor Jerry Brown – aimed at gearing up California’s efforts to fight climate change. The former US vice-president and climate champion Al Gore spoke to the CalSTRS board in Sacramento last Friday. Gore has long argued that fossil fuels are a risky proposition as a long-term investment. “Our state’s largest pension funds also need to keep their eyes on the future,” De Leon, a Democrat, said in an email. “With coal power in retreat, and the value of coal dropping, we should be moving our massive state portfolios to lower carbon investments and focus on the growing clean-energy economy.” The two state funds are the biggest targets so far of a divestment movement that has moved from college campuses towards mainstream financial conversation. CalPERS manages about $300bn in assets, including 30 coalmining companies valued at about $167m, according to a fact sheet prepared by De Leon’s office. CalSTRS with assets of about $190bn has about $132m in coal assets. But the divestment movement is showing momentum. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund – the legacy of a business empire founded on oil – shed all fossil fuel holdings last September. Stanford University also committed to divesting from coal companies. Meanwhile, Harvard University is being taken to court by students for refusing to divest. In a separate initiative, fossil fuel activists are pushing the University of California to eliminate its $90bn in fossil fuel holdings. De Leon’s proposal calls on managers of both state funds to withdraw from all coal companies, and make no new investments in coal within 18 months after the bill becomes law. It further calls on the two funds to explore the feasibility of expanding its divestment, by divesting entirely from fossil fuels – including natural gas – and report back to the state legislature by 2017. CalPERS refused to respond directly to the divestment call until it had seen the proposals. “There have been no discussions or decisions on this topic,” a spokesman said in an email. But the fund told reporters in a statement last month: “We are a founding member of the Investor Network on Climate Change and most recently we partnered with more than 100 global institutional investors, representing more than $13tn, to call on governments and policy makers to take action on carbon pricing, to provide regulatory support for energy efficiency and renewable energy, and to fully support innovation and deployment of new low-carbon technologies by the end of 2015.” CalSTRS said it would work with the legislature. “We are not saying ‘no’. We are going to work with the legislature to come up with a solution that is amenable to all within our overall strategy, which is to double our investment in clean energy and technology over the next five years,” said Michael Sicilia, a spokesman for CalSTRS. “We are very concerned about global climate change and the impact it has on our portfolio.” Managers of the two funds balked when De Leon first unveiled his divestment proposals. But divestment activists said the two funds had been amenable to shareholder pressure in the past, and that they were hopeful of negotiating a withdrawal from coal. The divestment call was bundled with a suite of measures intended to solidify California’s efforts to fight climate change. The proposals would commit California to generating half of its electricity from wind and solar power by 2050 – up from the current target of 33%. They also call for a 50% reduction in the use of gasoline for fuel by 2030, through a combination of fuel efficiency measures and investments in public transport. Existing buildings would be required to cut their energy use by 50%. Brown embraced a number of those goals in his inaugural address last month. But the measures are in for a fight from oil and electricity companies and even some Democrats, the Los Angeles Times reported. In introducing his proposal, De Leon said he was taking his cue from the growing momentum of a divestment movement which has now spread to 300 college campuses. “We need to listen to the values of the next generation and make sure our investment strategy reflects their priorities,” he said. • This story was amended on 11 February to correct CalSTRS spokesman Michael Sicilia’s reference to the fund’s investment in energy over the next five years."

"Growing up near small, affordable ski resorts, I was part of a close-knit community that instilled a life-long love for winter sports for me: I learned to ski at Suicide Six in Vermont in the late 1980s; I rode my first snowboard in 1995 at Pat’s Peak, an independent resort in central New Hampshire. Fortunately, thsse small mountains are still open today – but hundreds of other small ski resorts across the United States have not been so lucky. Some folded after several consecutive years of poor or unreliable snow; others because they couldn’t keep up with the necessary snowmaking, afford the liability insurance, or compete with the offerings or prices at bigger resorts. Light and unreliable snow has an enormous impact on the ski resorts that attract the 50-60mn skiers every year in the US and the economic significance of snowfall is clear: resorts fair much better in years with abundant natural snowfall. During the 2011-2012 winter, which saw highs of more than 80ºF in mid-March, resorts experienced a 15% drop in skier visitation compared to the previous season. Seasons like that can cost the winter tourism economy an estimated $1.1nn and 13,000-27,000 jobs.   The drastic differences in snowfall between the East and West coast mountains this winter are caused by a wavy jet stream that has led to more big snowstorms –nor’easters – along the East Coast, making this the year to ski the East. More than six feet of snow had fallen in Boston before this weekend, when it got more than another foot. Record warm sea surface temperatures off the Northeast coast are fueling moisture that is mixing with cold Arctic blasts, much to the delight of ski resorts and other winter recreation enthusiasts. By contrast, the West Coast mountains of California, Oregon and Washington are struggling to accumulate even 50% of normal snowpack thanks to the ridiculously resilient ridge (or Triple R) of high pressure that is blocking moisture from reaching the region. Colorado, meanwhile, sits at about average snowpack and a storm arrived just in time for President’s Day skiing.  Whether wavy jet streams and extreme winters will become more common in a world warmed by greenhouse gases is the subject of a very fascinating scientific debate; the precise causes of the wavy jet stream (be it more autumn snow in Siberian, Arctic sea ice extent, or warmer waters in the western equatorial Pacific to name a few hypotheses) remain unclear.  What scientists do know is that winters are warming, and a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. A meteorological sweet spot for snow exists between 28º and 32ºF, where excess moisture can be released as abundant snowfall. Once above the freezing point, that moisture falls as rain and melts existing snowpacks – the death knell for skiing.  Mid-winter snowfall might result from slight warming, if the temperatures get closer to that “sweet spot”. However, warmer temperatures, and increased rainfall at the start and end of winter, would shorten the ski season.According to the National Ski Areas Association Kottke End of Season Reports from 2009-2011, ski resorts see as much as 20% of their skier visits in the holiday period between Christmas and the New Year’s holiday; loss of this critical early period due to rain could shake a resort’s financial foundation. Mid-winter rainfall could bring them to their knees.  Winter tourism –which is an estimated $12.2bn dollar industry – can probably weather the winter extremes while preparing for inevitably warmer winters, but it will likely come at the cost of the smaller resorts that have traditionally served as feeder programs to the sport. And, only six of the previous 19 Winter Olympic venues are expected be cold enough to host the Games by 2090. The resorts that survive will continue to adapt to warmer winters and less reliable snow by adding more summer programming, investing in ever more energy efficient technology for snowmaking and other resort operations and committing to advocating for US policy action on climate change.  As a scientist, I want to understand how climate change is impacting winter. As a skier and snowboarder for more than 20 years, I want to protect the winter sport I love from the threat of warmer winters. As a mother, I want to preserve snowy winters for my four-month-old son to someday enjoy with his own children.  But snow also provides water for drinking and irrigation, regulates climate by reflecting the sun’s energy, and supports healthy ecosystems. Cold temperatures in winter keep invasive insects and pests at bay and provide the chilling hours necessary for crops like apples and blueberries. We know that winters are warming and that we’ve already committed to more heat coming down the pipeline. We need more politicians dedicated to playing the long game on climate change, or else not being able to ski will be the least of our concerns."
"I’ve just had a book published entitled Climatology versus Pseudoscience: Exposing the Failed Predictions of Global Warming Skeptics.  The book covers a wide range of climate-related topics, starting with a history of some key discoveries in the field of climate science beginning nearly 200 years ago. Along the way it debunks some common climate myths, progressing forward in time to the 1970s, when scientists’ ability to model the global climate began to advance rapidly. It examines the accuracy of a variety of global warming projections, starting with J.S. Sawyer in 1972, through the recent IPCC reports, as well as some predictions by contrarians like Richard Lindzen.  Accountability was one of my prime motivating factors for writing this book. While contrarians often criticize the accuracy of climate models, their projections have actually been quite accurate. Not only were climate scientists and their models correct to project global warming resulting from the increasing greenhouse effect, but they’ve been quite good at projecting the right amount of warming. Climate scientists don’t take nearly as much credit as they should for these accurate projections. On the flip side of the coin, climate contrarians have predicted anything from minimal warming to rapid global cooling. Their predictions have generally been terribly inaccurate, and yet the same people who have made these wrong predictions are still treated as credible experts by certain segments of the media. It seems as though their history of inaccurate predictions has no effect on their credibility. When scientists with a history of inaccurate predictions are treated with the same credibility as those who have made accurate predictions, that’s a problem. The book discusses the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming and the details of our 2013 study that was the latest to arrive at that result. It also looks at the scientific evidence that underlies that expert consensus. After all, the consensus itself is just an indicator of the strength of the underlying scientific evidence. Climatology versus Pseudoscience is extensively researched, with over 100 references to peer-reviewed climate studies. One chapter focuses specifically on some recent scientific research on continued global warming and the causes of the temporary slowdown of surface warming. This is an important topic, because the temporary so-called ‘pause’ or ‘hiatus’ has been so overblown in the media. In fact, holding the media accountable for inaccurate and unrepresentative climate coverage was another factor that motivated me to write this book. The less than 3% of contrarian climate scientists like fossil fuel-funded Willie Soon (and worse, contrarian non-experts) have received a disproportionate media coverage. This is why people vastly underestimate the expert consensus on human-caused global warming, and it’s one of the main reasons why people don’t view climate change as an urgent issue. This problem of false balance in climate reporting has even plagued normally reliable media outlets like the BBC and The Telegraph. Finally, the book considers what our future holds. The more global warming we cause, the more dangerous climate change impacts we’ll trigger. These potentially include widespread species extinctions, crop failures leading to famines, costly loss of coastal property, and so forth. However, the book ends on a note of optimism. There are palatable policy options that could take us a long way toward avoiding the worst climate change impacts while allowing economies to keep growing, and improving air quality and public health as a side benefit. My hope is that this book will serve as a useful and understandable resource of climate science information, highlight the credibility gap between mainstream climate scientists and contrarians, and show that we have a clear path forward toward minimizing the threats posed by rapid global warming. We just need to choose to take that path."
"In 2010, science writer Eli Kintisch called geoengineering “a bad idea whose time has come”. It is considered by many to be the ultimate admission of our failure to curb carbon emissions – a tech-fix that excuses continued carbon gluttony in the industrialised world. A report released on Tuesday by the US National Academies of Sciences (NAS) said tinkering with the global climate now would be “irrational and irresponsible” and climate change can only be avoided by cutting emissions. But the influential group of 16 scientists who authored the report urged policy makers to commit to further research into some geoengineering techniques. Should there come a time when the world must consider more extreme interventions in the climate, asked Marcia McNutt, the chair of the committee: “Do we want those decisions to be kneejerk reactions? Or do we want them to be made with a wealth of information?” The two-volume report separates geoengineering into two distinct classes. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) techniques would suck the greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere and lock it away underground or in the oceans. Albedo modification (AM) involves increasing the reflectivity (albedo) of the earth so the warming effect from the sun is diminished. A number of techniques have been proposed within these classes. These range from the sensible – replanting forests – to the outlandish – enclose the earth in a ring of space dust to block the sun’s rays. In between lie dozens of technologies, most still theoretical, with the potential to ameliorate or reverse the effects of climate change. In general the report finds that removing carbon from the atmosphere had the advantage of being less risky but more expensive and a long way off. Whereas tampering with the earth’s reflectivity could be done now, at less cost but could have massive unintended consequences. Stuart Haszeldine a professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh said: “The US National Academy report makes a smart distinction between slowly and deliberately putting carbon back underground, and tinkering with sunlight reflection and adjusting the atmosphere. The first is slower, do-able, visible, and controllable but will cost more. The second is cheaper in the short term, but is poorly understood, will create global regions who are losers, and also means that humans have to keep maintaining the earth’s annual atmospheric injection.” If the global community were to engage in AM, the most likely way would be to send sulphur-burning planes into the stratosphere or within clouds. The compounds released, known as aerosols, absorb and scatter sunlight and affect the brightness of clouds. Modelling suggests that enough aerosols could have a substantive cooling effect. The NAS warned the side effects of such a programme were unpredictable and there could be far reaching human and environmental impacts, including further depletion of the ozone layer and changes to rainfall. Aside from the scientific uncertainty, the deployment of AM would raise serious geopolitical questions. Because it is simple and relatively cheap, a single nation could decide to send sulphur into the atmosphere. Professor Steve Rayner, from Oxford University geoengineering programme and co-author of one of the most influential reports on the subject in 2009, said this type of unilateral action could lead to conflict. “There are issues to do with the perceptions of the technology that make doing the stratospheric aerosol injection something that would be politically very dangerous to do without an international agreement… If you were to do it, any negative event that occurred would be attributed by some party or another to that intervention.” Levels of short-lived aerosols will need constant replenishment, locking the human race into a project of climate maintenance that could last hundreds of years. And in the end, spraying aerosols into the atmosphere does nothing to help the original problem – the accumulation of greenhouse gases that are warming the planet. It is a solution that requires another solution. Nevertheless, the report calls for more research and even small-scale field trials of the technology. This would represent a significant step beyond the current science. One of the authors of the report, Raymond Pierrehumbert, told the Guardian that much of the research required into AM was useful, fundamental climate science. But given the large questions over the practicality of the technology further steps would be a mistake. “What is the point? What is it actually good for? What is the point of actually investing in a research programme that is specifically targeted at some aspects of the technology of albedo modification that you wouldn’t do for understanding climate in general. The report leaves the door open for doing some of those things… But my own feeling is that albedo modification really is a distraction from the main job of keeping the carbon dioxide emissions down.” The other proposed climate intervention is the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Designs for this range from assisting natural processes that lock carbon away – reforestation, planting crops that replenish soil carbon and fertilising the oceans with iron – to technologies that remove carbon from the air and then store it underground – bioenergy and carbon capture and storage (Beccs). The fertilisation of oceans would create a bloom of marine plants that store carbon, die and sink to the sea floor. However, like albedo modification, this would be an experiment that would occur in the global commons and could have unintended, border-crossing consequences. “On the other hand... you could build the CDR [Beccs] technology within national territories, without the need for an international agreement to do this,” says Rayner. In the most significant and comprehensive report on climate change to date, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) noted that almost all pathways towards a safe climate involved the deployment of Beccs. Power stations that burn plants for energy would be fitted with devices to capture the carbon released. This would be pumped underground and stored for eternity.  Beccs would actually reduce atmospheric carbon levels, allowing the world to overshoot its carbon budget (which looks increasingly likely). There’s only one problem – there is currently no such technology. A few pilots have been tested but Beccs is still largely being done on paper. “You have to build an industry that is essentially reverse engineering two hundred years of the fossil fuel industry on a global scale,” says Rayner. “There are real problems there with the length of time it would take to ramp up an industry on a scale that is actually going to make a difference to the atmosphere.” The NAS authors stress that geoengineering is a poor alternative to reducing the carbon emissions that cause climate change (known as mitigation). But they go on to say: “Mitigation, although technologically feasible, has been difficult to achieve for political, economic, and social reasons that may persist well into the future... For that reason, it may be prudent to examine additional options for limiting the risks from climate change.” In other words, despite being more expensive, more dangerous and less likely to work, geoengineering technologies should be considered because they do not conflict with the interests of the world’s most powerful and influential companies and countries. Clive Hamilton, a professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University in New South Wales, Australia, believes this could have serious implications for the politics of climate change. “The report treats as only a theoretical concern the possibility that a major geoengineering research program would reduce political incentives to reduce carbon emissions. But anyone who has watched world leaders seize on carbon capture and storage as a means of having our cake and eating it can see what is coming. The world lost 10 years chasing the chimera of ‘clean coal’.” In her recent book on climate change, social activist Naomi Klein devoted an entire chapter to geoengineering. She said geoengineering could be seen as a kind of Noah’s ark, a last minute, supernatural intervention. “If geoengineering has anything going for it, it is that it slots perfectly into our most hackneyed cultural narrative… It’s the one that tells us that, at the very last minute, some of us (the ones that matter) are going to be saved.” Rachel Smolker of NGO BiofuelWatch goes further, suggesting that geoengineering research is being actively promoted by vested interests.  “The geoengineering clique is taking advantage of this situation to promote their planetary technological manipulations. Some of the most avid promoters of geoengineering have links to the fossil fuel industries and to institutions that have backed climate denial.” These links have previously been reported by the Guardian. Some geoengineering technologies are ill-contrived. Albedo modification is dangerous and does not address the initial problem of atmospheric carbon.  But removing some carbon from the atmosphere may buy us some time in the difficult transition ahead. Slowing climate change means saving lives and reducing suffering in the world’s most vulnerable communities and, although it may look like failure, must be considered."

"Tony Abbott’s prime ministership continued to unravel with Monday’s meeting of the Liberal party room, where he begged his rebellious colleagues for six more months. There’s been a lot of talk about how the decision to knight Prince Philip fatally damaged him, but an earlier humiliating encounter with a foreign dignitary was even more telling.  Back in November, Barack Obama flew into Brisbane from Beijing, where he had announced an historic climate change agreement with China’s Xi Jinping. Having been greeted by a radiant George Brandis, Obama stood before an audience of students at the University of Queensland and rebuked the Abbott government for its approach to climate change.   His address affirmed the science that many in the Coalition deny: that climate change will have particularly ruinous effects for Australia, in the form of “longer droughts, more wildfires. The incredible natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef is threatened”. He pointed to Australia’s outsized production of carbon emissions and demanded that Australia “step up”, both in terms of seriously attempting to limit emissions and in contributing more to the international Green Climate Fund.  Before turning to his next topic he told the assembled students: You have the power to imagine a new future in a way that some of the older folks don’t always have.  As a way to commence a visit to an ally, it was brutal. Abbott, who had tried to keep climate change off the G20 agenda, was immediately forced onto a footing of damage control, and his government was soon briefing against the leader of the free world.  Rather than the foreign affairs showcase Abbott had been hoping for, the G20 underlined how Australia was now out of step with the leadership of almost every major economy. Efforts to cosy up to Canada’s Stephen Harper in the hope of forming a “carbon bloc” only illustrated how convoluted and marginal the international politics of denial have become.  After a polling mini-recovery of sorts for Abbott between July and September, November – the month of the G20 and Obama’s address – marked a turning-point. Between September and November, Abbott’s always-poor net satisfaction ratings had improved and stabilised a little; from November they declined rapidly to where they are today. In some polls, Abbott now has more than half the voters saying that he should resign. November was also the month in which Bill Shorten decisively overcame Abbott as preferred prime minister, and Shorten’s lead is now wider than ever. From November until now, the ALP has enjoyed an unbroken ascent in the polls. The latest Newspoll gives Labor its biggest-ever lead on a two-party-preferred basis, of 57% to 43%. After Obama’s Queensland speech, howls went up from conservative columnists (some of the same ones who delighted in calling Bush critics “anti-American”) accusing the president of treachery. As far as they were concerned, sabotaging climate change policy was the reason Abbott was in the Lodge, and was integral to the meaning of his prime ministership. In a sense, they were absolutely right. Absent his willingness to take a certain line on climate policy, Abbott would never have been Liberal leader or prime minister.  The flaws that Abbott has displayed since he took over as opposition leader in 2009 – the meltdowns, the appalling political instincts, the anachronistic attachments, the sexism – have been evident since he entered public life. He has never been popular, and he was only elevated because of a freak-out from the denialist wing of the Liberal party over Malcolm Turnbull’s proposal to deal with Labor on an emissions trading scheme. There has been a lot of analysis in recent weeks of Abbott’s peculiar personality, but not enough recollection of the reason that it’s on such prominent display. He’s the leader because he promised his party’s right wing to make no deals on climate, and to blindly oppose any meaningful policy response.  Ultimately, Abbott and the Coalition have been brought undone by the same failure that has defeated a decade’s worth of Australian national leaders: the failure to generate a credible response to the most pressing global crisis. John Howard dragged his feet in the midst of drought, and was brought low by an ALP leader who promised vigorous action. Kevin Rudd called climate change the “greatest moral challenge of our time”, only to reveal that he wasn’t up to it, which began his fatal slide in the opinion polls. Julia Gillard offered a response she couldn’t readily explain, allowing her carbon price to be framed as a tax, and therefore a lie, by Abbott.  Now Abbott, who was promoted beyond his abilities in order to obstruct any action – to “Axe the Tax” – finds himself out of alignment with the global mood, and threatened by Turnbull, the man he tore down.  This obvious thread in Australia’s recent national history is ignored by those who would rather point to social media, or indeed democracy itself, as the source of political instability. More arguments have been made this week that politicians are somehow crippled by voluble public disaffection that social media facilitates. Fewer have been willing to consider that causation runs in the opposite direction: that the anger at politicians across the spectrum in recent years should be read as an outcome of the unwillingness of national leaders to face up to long-standing crises. Fewer still have wondered whether this may be because the orthodoxies about possible solutions to climate change and other fundamental problems – like growing inequality – produce policies that are bound to fail.  Economic historian Philip Mirowski considers market-based responses to climate change, of the kind proposed in Australia for a decade on both sides of politics, are a form of “bait and switch”. They mean that: ... political actors originally bent upon using state power to curb emissions are instead diverted into the endless technicalities of the institution and maintenance of novel markets for carbon permits, with the not unintended consequence that the level of emissions continues to grow apace in the interim. Some will say that this overstates the matter, but it works uncomfortably well as a potted summary of Australian national politics since 2007. The rise (and eventually fall) of Abbott is a direct result of our political class taking their eyes off the prize, and getting lost in the details."

"The London Metropolitan Police have backed down on their refusal to police two protest marches next month after criticism from campaigners and London mayor Boris Johnson. But the police maintained that protesters have no ongoing right to assistance from Scotland Yard and future protests remain in doubt.  The Met had previously told organisers from the Campaign against Climate Change (CACC) and Million Women Rise (MWR) that they would have to hire a private firm to organise traffic management, road closures, barriers and stewards for two separate protests on 7 March. Protest groups said the move amounted to an assault on the right to protest. On Wednesday the Met told CACC that they would facilitate their protest in the same way they have in the past.  “An agreement was reached with the organisers to ensure that the event will take place. They have agreed to provide stewards for the event, traffic authorities have agreed to write a temporary traffic regulation order to facilitate road closures,” said a police statement. The Guardian understands that the MWR march has also been cleared by the Met. The Met said the u-turn did not represent a change in policy and managing protests fell “beyond our policing responsibility”. Future marches will have to negotiate with the police in order to secure their services. The Met cited budgetary constraints for its original decision to cease its support for protesters.  The move attracted criticism from campaigners, politicians and legal experts. More than 60,000 people signed an online Avaaz campaign calling on the Met to reverse their policy and twelve campaign groups told the Met that they refused to pay private firms to manage protests. The CACC and MWR said they had received indications from traffic management companies that their involvement would cost several thousands of pounds. Lindsay Alderton, an organiser for the CACC said: “We were deeply alarmed to find ourselves, two months before an election, at risk of not being able to express these basic democratic rights at our protest on 7 March. The privitisation of protest would have veered dangerously towards a situation where only those with money would be able to pay for the privilege.” Under questioning from Greens London Assembly member Jenny Jones, Mayor Johnson said on Monday he did not agree with the Met’s stance and he was trying to talk them down. “I’m in discussion with the Met about that. And for your guidance and the assembly’s guidance, I’m very much of the view that the police do a fantastic job of managing about 5,000 protests of one kind or another every year. I think it’s important that they should continue to do so.” He said the withdrawal of police from peaceful marches may encourage “the opposite result”. “I’m concerned that that should not be the way forward. I’m probably at one with you Jenny in wanting to see the Met continue to police protests in London,” said Johnson. Jones said: “The Met police have got themselves into a mess on this. It’s obvious they didn’t discuss the decision with the Mayor, who clearly disagrees with them, and they certainly didn’t think through the impact on the part of their job that means they must facilitate the democratic process. It’s a cost-cutting move that has backfired.” The People’s Assembly has an anti-austerity march planned for June. National secretary Sam Fairbairn said they have been told by the City of London Police that their policy was in line with the Met and their march would not receive police support. “We’ll shut the roads ourselves if we have to,” Fairbairn told the Guardian."
"A landmark directive with the potential to ban tar sands oil from Europe has been reprieved, the Guardian has learned.  The EU’s most senior energy official confirmed that the fuel quality directive (FQD) to encourage greener road fuels will not be scrapped at the end of the decade, as had been thought.  Around 15% of Europe’s carbon emissions come from road transport and ambitious plans for cutting emissions from vehicles are expected to form a significant chunk of the bloc’s ‘Energy Union’ proposals next week. Asked by the Guardian whether that meant the FQD would continue after 2020, the EU’s vice president for energy union, Maroš Šefčovič, said: “My first reaction is yes. We just have to adjust it to all the lessons learned from biofuels, and all the [other] lessons learned from the previous time.” The FQD has been a platform for measures intended to price tar sands out of the European market – and for targets to provide 10% of Europe’s transport fuel from low carbon sources, mostly biofuels, by 2020. Transport fuels are the only European sector in which emissions are still rising and the directive mandates a 6% reduction in their greenhouse gas intensity by 2020. But specific measures to bring this about in the FQD were strongly opposed by Canada, which threatened trade retaliation if the EU acted on scientific advice and taxed tar sands oil at a higher rate because they are more polluting than conventional oil. Environmentalists also complained that the 10% target for biofuels was driving deforestation and pushing up commodity prices. Last year, the commission appeared to wash its hands of the whole issue, saying that it did “not think it appropriate” to establish new greenhouse gas intensity targets for transport fuels after 2020. The news that this position seems to have changed under a new commission was applauded by Friends of the Earth Europe. “It’s vital the Commission tackles Europe’s transport emissions, which will be the largest source of emissions by 2030,” said Colin Roche, a campaigner for the group. “What’s absolutely crucial now is that any renewal of the fuel quality directive is a real deterrent to European imports of climate-killing tars sands and damaging crop-based biofuels,” he added. “Europe cannot afford to ignore this black hole in their climate strategy.” The Cooperative, which has an ethical investment policy, believes that a continuation of the FQD opens up new possibilities for investor action on tar sands.  “It would be incredibly useful for responsible investors to be able to look at the carbon intensity of different oil companies’ products – to put pressure on them to reduce it, and speed the shift to a a low carbon economy,” said Colin Baines, the bank’s campaigns manager. A reprieve for the directive will also improve the chances of a positive vote on sustainability criteria for biofuels in the European Parliament, according to Jos Dings, the director of the Transport and Environment think tank. “This is an important and very significant announcement,” he told the Guardian. “If the commission is prepared to look again at the clean transport fuel issue, it can only be an encouragement to do the right thing in parliament next week.” "

"Yesterday, President Barack Obama became the first president who has taken a stand to stop climate change. Actually, that isn’t quite true. President Obama took that stand from his first step into the White House. He has put into place a series of initiatives that actually give us a chance at stopping the most serious consequences of climate change. Much of his actions have gone with little public notice. That changed yesterday with his veto of the ill-proposed Keystone XL pipeline.   Vetoing this pipeline, which would increase the rate of extraction of the world’s dirtiest fuels (bitumen and the byproduct petroleum coke), was a no-brainer for anyone concerned about climate change. In fact, it is not possible to be in favor of the Keystone pipeline if you accept the science of climate change. The reason this story is so big isn’t just about carbon dioxide emissions (although that matters). It is more about the strong stand taken by the President against a well-funded campaign to force the pipeline through. It is also important because of the signal it sends to those intent on long term dirty-fuels extraction. Let’s quickly summarize why the Keystone pipeline was a bad idea to begin with. First, by lowering the production costs, it will increase the rate of extraction of the dirtiest fuels in the world. Second, it will actually raise fuel prices in the United States where much of the tar sands is now sold at a discount. Third, the pipeline will lock in decades of production of dirty fuel even as the costs to deliver wind and solar energy are falling fast and becoming comparable with fossil fuels. Finally, the pipeline would have traversed the United States and would have presented a large spill risk. Why can’t the Canadian government just put the pipeline through their own country? The reason is, their own citizens object. Back to President Obama. His actions on climate change are numerous and significant. As outlined in his Climate Action Plan, his administration has overseen large investments in renewable energy industries in the U.S. that are creating high-pay and high-skill jobs. He has enacted increases in fuel-efficiency standards which not only reduce emissions but also save money. He has worked on international agreements to reduce hydrofluorocarbons and methane emissions, two potent greenhouse gases.  Even more significantly, he has overseen the plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the nation’s new and existing coal plants; the EPA’s Clean Power Plan rewards state-level initiatives to find flexible solutions to reduce their emissions. And also significantly, the President has achieved a huge agreement with China to curb and reduce carbon pollution. I spoke with Anthony Swift at the National Resources Defense Council about the Clean Power Plan. He said,  The Clean Power Plan and the rejection of Keystone XL go hand in hand in a national policy to reduce our carbon emissions. On one hand, Clean Power Plan is an ambitious proposal to significantly reduce carbon emissions from our existing energy system; while on the other, rejecting tar sands infrastructure projects like Keystone XL ensures that we don’t undermine those reductions by bringing in new, dirtier fuel sources.  What does all this mean, and how is it related to Keystone? It means that Obama’s legacy is now cemented. He has done more on climate change than any predecessors, by a long shot. Importantly, he has trusted the science. When we look back on his presidency, this will be what he is remembered for. It also cements the legacy of those who voted in favor of Keystone. It was largely along political party lines; however, in the recent House vote, 29 Democrats voted for the pipeline and one Republican voted against it (Justin Amash), although his reasoning had little to do with climate impacts.  I asked Dr. Joe Romm, founding editor of Climate Progress for his thoughts. He responded,  Future generations suffering from the consequences of our inaction will be bewildered that the legislative body of the richest country in the world could devote so little effort to ameliorating the climate problem and so much effort to making it worse. What’s clear is that the oil and gas industry contributed a significant amount of money to congresspersons who voted for the pipeline. According to an article in the International Business Times, “yes” voters received an average $45,000 from the oil and gas industry. Senators who voted for the pipeline received approximately $250,000 from the industry. What is also clear is that as the costs from droughts, floods, more severe storms, and heat waves mount, we can all think back to defining votes like the ones taken in the U.S. Congress this winter."

"Communities around the world are feeling the impacts of climate change already, but many of the most severe effects will be felt in the decades to come, particularly from mid-century onwards. Nowhere is this more apparent than in sub-Saharan Africa which will be one of the hardest hit regions of the world. Right now, African countries are busy investing in infrastructure and development to help support current economic growth. Many of these long-lived investments – such as ports, large dams, and social infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools – will most likely last well beyond 2050. But by then, Africa’s climate may look quite different to what it does today. Factoring climate change into long-term investments and planning decisions is essential for supporting climate-resilient development – but it’s not happening.  New research, coordinated by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) and Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN), shows that governments and businesses across sub-Saharan Africa are failing to consider long-term climate information in their investments and planning decisions. This includes studies from Zambia, Malawi, Rwanda, Ghana and Mozambique. The worst case scenario is that poor use of climate information could lock societies into patterns that make them highly vulnerable to droughts, floods, high temperatures or sea-level rise in the future. Why do decision-makers have this blind spot? First and most importantly, other challenges such as eradicating poverty and promoting access to primary and secondary education are extremely pressing, forcing decision-makers to think and act in short time frames. Secondly, long-term climate information is often ill-suited to informing local economic, social and environmental contexts in sub-Saharan Africa. Knowing what the average temperature in 2050 will be for rural Nakuru County, Kenya, is of little practical use. What decision makers really want to know is how higher temperatures are likely to influence water resource availability or crop yields: outcomes that affect local people most. But what decision makers ask for is not often technically possible as there is a lack of information that combines knowledge of future climate with other disciplines such as hydrology or ecology. There is also a communication mismatch between the producers and users of climate information. The information delivered to decision-makers is often overly technical and easy to misinterpret. Likewise, decision-makers’ needs are rarely fed back to climate scientists. So what should be done to address this? Perhaps the most obvious starting point is enhancing the quality and quantity of African climate observation networks and scientific capacity in sub-Saharan Africa. Not only will this help to establish information about past and current climates, it will also help to ‘ground-truth’ climate science by generating local knowledge, perspectives and expertise. Also, these people will be able to act as intermediaries among scientists, policy-makers and practitioners and help with presenting climate information in a format that decision-makers can act upon. Spending time and resources to understand the local political context, and engaging with local partners, can also help funders and knowledge brokers to communicate climate information more effectively. Above all, funding for climate-related programmes in sub-Saharan Africa needs to shift away from short funding cycles, rigid structures and targets, and donor-driven agendas, and move towards longer-term partnerships between international and national partners.  Importantly, climate information has to be taken up by the people and policies that matter most. Adaptation to climate change still falls under the mandate of ministries such as environment or natural resource management, which are relatively weak in governments. It is only when influential ministries, such as those responsible for economic growth and development, have the incentive and responsibility to act on climate-related issues that effective action occurs. A large part of this is engaging with high-level ‘champions’ to drive the climate agenda forward. These champions are often vital in gaining legitimacy for climate change discussions and overcoming political obstacles to the use of climate information. In Rwanda, president Paul Kagame’s strong backing for national action on climate change, alongside involvement from relevant ministries, led to climate change being at the heart of the country’s development planning processes. Lastly, the research raises a number of ethical challenges. Is it justifiable to push for a long-term development agenda in places where addressing current concerns, such as meeting basic economic needs and promoting the wellbeing and development of local communities, is a higher priority? Should we be pushing a long-term agenda where there is little immediate appetite or demand? Sadly, few donors, development agencies or governments are willing to address these questions.  A failure to promote honest and transparent communication of climate information can therefore only result in a further push-back from local decision makers, continuing to put vital infrastructure and long-term development in Sub-Saharan Africa at risk of future climate change."

"Some of Harvard’s most prominent graduates – from Hollywood star Natalie Portman to environmentalist Robert Kennedy Jr and the scholar Cornel West – called on the world’s richest university to dump fossil- fuel companies from its $36bn endowment. In an open letter, released on Friday as the university was being taken to court by its own students, more than 30 former Harvard students signed on to a campus campaign calling on the university to fight climate change by divesting from coal, oil and gas companies.  The alumni included Maya Lin, the architect of the Vietnam war memorial, Nobel laureate Eric Chivian, Pulitzer prize-winning author Susan Faludi, academics, preachers, former US senators and Securities and Exchange commissioners as well as Bill McKibben, the founder of the group 350.org, which has driven the campus divestment campaign. “As Harvard’s own researchers have done so much to show, global warming is the greatest threat the planet faces,” the letter says. “From the typhoon-battered Philippines to the disappearing islands of the Pacific to the water-starved towns of California’s drought-ridden Central Valley, this issue demands we all make changes to business as usual – especially those of us who have prospered from the systems driving climate change. The letter, released just hours before the university faced a hearing in a lawsuit filed by students arguing that Harvard has a duty to fight climate change by pulling out of fossil fuel investments, suggests Harvard will face continued pressure in the months ahead over its endowment policies. The alumni called for an old-style teach-in at Harvard on 12 April, followed by several days of sit-ins and rallies. Over the last two years, the university has faced rising demands from students and faculty to set an example by winding down its direct investments in coal, oil and gas companies, thought to be worth at least $79m. It is believed indirect investments in fossil fuels are much greater. Since then, a number of other universities have taken steps to divest. Stanford last May announced it would get rid of investments in coal companies. The heirs to the Rockefeller oil fortune decided to move out of fossil fuels last September. Meanwhile, the steep fall in oil prices has helped the financial case for divestment, the letter argues. However, Harvard’s president, Drew Gilpin Faust, has said repeatedly that the university will not commit to divestment, and will fight climate change through research and other work. Last week, Faust accused student divestment campaigners of resorting to “coercive” methods after they staged a sit-in at her offices. “We do not believe that divestment from the fossil fuel industry is the appropriate answer to this challenge,” a Harvard spokesman, Jeff Neal, wrote in an email. “We are deeply disappointed that divestment advocates have chosen to resort to a disruptive building occupation as a means to advance their view. Such tactics cross the line from persuasion to disrespectful and coercive interference with the activities of others.” Friday’s letter argues that divestment is an effective strategy, and that Harvard – as the world’s richest university – had an obligation to do more. “Harvard’s the most important non-profit in the world probably and the lead that Harvard takes is watched by everybody else. Other people who are timid will hide behind Harvard skirts if Harvard doesn’t do anything,” said Tim Wirth, a former Democratic senator from Colorado and climate change official in the Clinton administration, who signed on to the letter. “It is very important that Harvard recognise this leadership responsibility. So far it’s been very disappointing.” McKibben, whose 350.org organisation set off the divestment movement that has now spread to some 300 campuses, said that a number of former students were disappointed by Harvard’s stand. “A lot of alumni were depressed by the news that Harvard had reacted to the huge interest from students and faculty by increasing their investments in dirty fossil fuel,” McKibben said. “I also think Harvard may have been underestimating just how much its alumni care about climate change. I think there are a lot of us we are at an age where we are thinking about our children and grandchildren and the kind of world we are leaving behind, and we want to address this biggest crises in all the ways that we can.” McKibben said that Harvard risked being left behind by other institutions. “In a world where the Rockefellers decided to divest from fossil fuel probably Harvard can too,” he said."
"The right to stage demonstrations in Britain could be threatened following a demand that climate change protesters planning a march next month hire a private firm to oversee it – a role previously carried out by the police. The Campaign Against Climate Change (CACC) says it is effectively being made to “pay to protest”, after learning that its demonstration in London, which could attract up to 20,000 people, will carry a bill of thousands of pounds.  Following negotiations with the Metropolitan police, the Greater London Authority and Westminster city council, the organisers of the Time to Act march – which is supported by the People’s Assembly Against Austerity, the Stop the War Coalition, Global Justice Now, Avaaz and Friends of the Earth – have been told the police will no longer facilitate the temporary closure of roads along the agreed route. A similar march last September, which was the largest of its kind in history, attended by 40,000 people as part of a global day of action, was policed by the Met. “In previous years, the MPS may have undertaken this role but following a review of what services we provide, we have stopped doing this,” a Met spokeswoman confirmed. New, more restrictive, interpretations of traffic laws, coupled with constrained policing budgets, lie behind the Met’s decision. A large protest, which will block off roads, requires a temporary traffic regulation order to ensure public safety is maintained and congestion managed. However, Westminster council says it will issue an order only when the organisers of the march have produced a traffic management plan outlining who will steward the event and how. These bureaucratic obstacles have angered campaigners seeking to push a green agenda before the election. “Protest is a fundamental right,” said Sam Fairbairn, national secretary of the People’s Assembly. “This will make it virtually impossible to hold a protest unless you have rich backers.” The organisers asked the Met to provide the traffic management plan, but were refused. “The campaign has organised several marches over the past decade and we’ve always worked with the police and other agencies to ensure they are safe and successful,” said Claire James, of the CACC. “We’ve been told that the police will no longer close roads for protests and we need to hire a private traffic management company, both to draw up a plan for diverting traffic and to provide a team of specialist stewards on the day. Effectively what this means is we have to pay to protest.” The organisers estimate that they will need to hire scores of stewards at £120 a shift to ensure their protest can go ahead. The Met spokeswoman said the police’s core responsibilities were “preventing and detecting crime, maintenance of the Queen’s Peace and protecting life and property”. She said that because the proposed demonstration, on 7 March, was expected to be crime-free there was little requirement for it to provide a policing operation. But James Welch of human rights group Liberty, questioned this: “The police, councils and GLA shouldn’t be impeding protest by imposing conditions that a march organiser can’t comply with, or by bickering over whose responsibility it is to close roads. Protest is an important democratic right. Public authorities should be facilitating peaceful protest, not obstructing it.” Organiser Lindsay Alderton vowed the march would proceed but was concerned about the consequences for other protests. “We’re a tiny organisation with two part-time staff and a fantastic team of volunteers. To hire a traffic management company is simply beyond our resources. But it’s not just about the money. We feel that in complying we would set a dangerous precedent: that protests on public roads will be limited to those who can afford to pay.”"
"Rising global demand for energy over the next two decades is at odds with the fight against climate change, the head of BP said on Tuesday, as he outlined the oil giant’s forecasts showing unsustainable increases in carbon emissions. BP’s annual energy outlook predicted that the world economy would double in size in the next 20 years, resulting in demand for energy rising by almost 40%. The company said two-thirds of this demand would be met from fossil fuels – oil, gas and coal – and that this would lead to a 25% increase in carbon emissions. BP said slower growth in China and India coupled with greater energy efficiency would mean that demand would rise by 1.5% a year over the next two decades, rather than the 2.5% a year recorded during the past decade. Even so, the company said carbon emissions would be growing by 1% a year – “well above” the path recommended by scientists to keep emissions below the ceiling of 450 parts per million that would provide a 50% chance of stabilising global temperatures at 2% above pre-industrial levels. The most likely path for carbon emissions, despite current government policies, does not appear sustainable. Dudl added that the environmental risks put pressure on politicians to come up with a deal at this year’s climate conference in Paris. “The projections highlight the scale of the challenge facing policy makers at this year’s UN-led discussions in Paris. No single change or policy is likely to be sufficient on its own. “And identifying in advance which changes are likely to be most effective is fraught with difficulty. This underpins the importance of policymakers taking steps that lead to a global price for carbon, which provides the right incentives for everyone to play their part.” BP said the continued increase in emissions would come in spite of less reliance on coal over the coming decades. China has been heavily dependent on coal during its rapid industrialisation since 1990, but demand is expected to grow at 0.8% a year in the period up until 2035, down from 3.8% a year since 2000. Even with the expected rapid growth in the use of renewable forms of energy over the next two decades, they will still only account for 8% of energy demand by 2035, BP said. Fossil fuels will account for 81% of energy, down from 86% at present. “Fossil fuels are projected to provide the majority of the world’s energy needs, meeting two-thirds of the increase in energy demand out of 2035,” Dudley said. “However, the mix will shift. Renewables and unconventional fossil fuels will take a larger share, along with gas, which is set to be the fastest-growing fossil fuel, as well as the cleanest, meeting as much of the increase in demand as coal and oil combined. “Meanwhile, coal is now expected to be the slowest-growing fuel, as industrialisation in emerging Asian economies slows and environmental policies around the globe tighten.” BP believes the recent fall in oil prices will prove temporary, putting the decline from $115 a barrel to a low of $45 a barrel down to increases in supply caused by the US shale revolution. Recent weeks have seen a partial recovery in the oil price, with the cost of a barrel of Brent crude standing at around $62 a barrel last night. The oil company said growth in supply from the new US fields would slow but that global demand would continue to increase, leading to higher prices. The forecasts suggest that the US will be self-sufficient in energy by the 2030s, but that the fracking revolution will not spread to other parts of the world. Spencer Dale, BP’s chief economist, said: “After three years of high and deceptively steady oil prices, the fall of recent months is a stark reminder that the norm in energy markets is one of continuous change. It is important that we look through short-term volatility to identify those longer-term trends in supply and demand that are likely to shape the energy sector over the next 20 years and so help inform the strategic choices facing the industry and policy-makers alike.” BP anticipates a slowdown in US shale oil allowing for Middle East output to start regaining lost ground at the start of the next decade, according to the report. The 12 members of the Opec (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries) cartel will expand output by 7 million barrels a day while non-Opec supply will increase by 13 million barrels by 2035. Opec will keep its market share of 40% of total global crude production by 2035, according to the report. “These reports of the demise of Opec seem to me greatly exaggerated,” Dale said. The group decided in November not to cut its production target in order to keep its market share against a backdrop of rising supplies from non-Opec nations, a move that accelerated the fall in oil prices at the end of 2014. The company produced alternative forecasts for global energy demand based on China and India growing at 4% a year rather than the 5.5% a year expected in the base case. In those circumstances, energy demand would rise by 25% rather than 37% in the next two decades – with the difference equivalent to the total energy needs of the European Union in 2035. Over the same period, North Sea oil production is expected to decline to around 500,000 barrels per day as fields in the basin deplete.  “The North sea is a very mature oil and gas province and it will inevitably go through a decline. It peaked in 1999 at around 2.9 millions barrels per day and our projections are that it will be half a million barrels in 2035,” Dudley said. "
"The Queensland government may adopt tough new regulations to tackle the amount of pollution flowing onto the Great Barrier Reef, with the state’s first ever reef minister vowing to strengthen protections to avoid the ecosystem being listed as “in danger” by the UN. The new Labor government has promised to slash the amount of nitrogen flowing on to the reef from key catchments by 80% by 2025, while also cutting total suspended sediment reaching the reef by 50% by the same year.  While some progress has been made in encouraging farmers to change practices to stop harmful chemicals running off their land on to the reef, Labor has indicated new regulations may be introduced to achieve its targets. “I don’t want to pre-empt any discussions but there are a range of levers available, from regulation to education to innovation and we’ll be looking to all of those to make sure it works,” Steven Miles, Queensland’s newly-appointed environment minister told Guardian Australia. Miles has also been given the new title of minister for the Great Barrier Reef. “It’s certainly a big job to achieve those ambitious targets and we need to find ways to do it,” Miles said. “We are working out the details now. But we will work with all the stakeholders involved. “We think there needs to be a substantial improvement in the quality of water running into the world heritage area. I don’t want to disparage previous efforts on this, but we want to really aggressively reduce run-off.” Unesco’s world heritage committee will meet in June to decide whether to list the reef, which is in declining health, as “in danger”. Miles said he would ensure Labor’s new reef policies will be submitted to the UN this month for consideration. “The in-danger listing is a real possibility, it’s something we’re concerned about,” he said. “It’s not just the optics of it, but the fact the reef will actually be in danger. Our approach will be guided by the science to convince the scientists at the world heritage committee that we have a strong plan.” A federal government-commissioned report last year warned while a voluntary approach to reducing pollution had worked with some land managers, there is no “urgent reason for action” for those who don’t want to take part. “It is widely acknowledged that agricultural land use in catchments that drain into the Great Barrier Reef is largely ungoverned by the suite of legislative and regulatory arrangements in place,” the report states. While the previous Liberal National party government stressed it was spending $35m a year to improve water quality, its scientists reportedly warned that the reliance on voluntary schemes had proven ineffective, with the amount of pesticides flowing on to the reef causing feminisation in some male fish. Chemicals such as nitrogen are also thought to spur the growth of crown-of-thorns starfish, which eat their way through reef systems. According to the federal government, around half of horticulture and cane growers are improving their practices, with the sediment load falling by 11% in the past five years. Labor has promised $100m to improve water quality over the next five years, although this is far short of the amount required, according to the groups that oversee the catchments flowing onto the reef. The new state government has also pledged to halt the dumping of dredged sediment in the reef’s world heritage area, as well as scrap an LNP plan to dump spoil from the expanded Abbot Point port on to the nearby Caley Valley wetlands, which is regarded as nationally significant area for wildlife. Adani, the Indian mining firm that wants to create Australia’s largest mine and ship the coal from Abbot Point, is keen to press ahead with the dredging, but the process will be delayed until a new dumping site is found. “The dumping had to stop now as the plan for proponents of the Abbot Point coal terminal was to be dredging in March, which was a very imminent threat,” said Miles. “They certainly won’t be dredging in March. We are looking for an environmentally responsible place to put it. “We are committed to working with the business community to deliver economic growth but people clearly voted for a government that won’t dump spoil on sensitive wetlands. We were elected on that platform and we have to work out other options, but I won’t put timelines on that.” Miles said he was “clearly concerned” about climate change, which has been cited by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority as the leading long-term challenge for the reef, but that water quality and dumping are the two most immediate threats to the ecosystem. The new environment minister said a commission will be set up to assess feed-in tariffs for solar energy, in order to meet a Labor goal of one million solar rooftops by 2020. Separately, Labor has committed to banning uranium mining in Queensland, while Miles said he’d have “serious concerns” about any proposal to dump nuclear waste in the state. Dermot O’Gorman, chief executive of WWF Australia, said it was an “important signal” that Queensland now has a minister for the Great Barrier Reef and that the new protections for the reef were “urgent”."
"French foreign minister Laurent Fabius launched a round of global climate talks in Geneva on Sunday and warned that world security, as well as the environment, depended on their success. The week-long meeting is the first in a series that is meant to culminate in a globally binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Paris in December, with a target of limiting the rise in global temperatures to 2C above pre-industrial times.   Countries, companies and other organisations are expected to announce commitments to cut emissions in the run up to the Paris meeting. The cumulative commitments, backed by a financing mechanism and a binding global agreement that is being shaped at the series of meetings, must be enough to hit the 2C goal.  “Without sounding too grandiose, the survival of the planet itself is at stake,” Fabius told reporters in Geneva. “You have rising sea levels, acidification of the oceans, immigration sparked by climate change, droughts that are much more severe.  “And then there’s an aspect that we don’t talk about much: the impact on security. If you have climate degradation, global security as a whole is degraded, there is immigration, and the fact that we fight over resources, be it oil or water.”  Fabius said 20,000 delegates and a similar number of guests, plus 3,000 journalists, were expected to attend the Paris talks. He said 195 countries would be represented, but it was not decided which heads of state or government would come.  He described the mood at the Geneva talks as “extremely positive” but said the goal was ambitious and the task would not be easy.  Earlier, Peruvian environment minister Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the current president of the talks, urged nations to avoid a repeat of a summit in 2009 in Copenhagen, where the outcome fell far short of expectations.  “We cannot go back to the past. The world is not willing to accept our failure,” he told the opening session.  He urged all to compromise and said there were “many good signals” from governments, people and businesses of willingness to act. “This is not a competition among us. This is one team for one planet.“  Governments are due to submit their national plans by an informal deadline of 31 March to give time for the United Nations to compile them before Paris. China, the United States and the European Union – the top three emitters of greenhouse gases – have already outlined their plans."

"A senior US scientist has expressed concern that the intelligence services are funding climate change research to learn if new technologies could be used as potential weapons. Alan Robock, a climate scientist at Rutgers University in New Jersey, has called on secretive government agencies to be open about their interest in radical work that explores how to alter the world’s climate.  Robock, who has contributed to reports for the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), uses computer models to study how stratospheric aerosols could cool the planet in the way massive volcanic eruptions do. But he was worried about who would control such climate-altering technologies should they prove effective, he told the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Jose.    Last week, the National Academy of Sciences published a two-volume report on different approaches to tackling climate change. One focused on means to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the other on ways to change clouds or the Earth’s surface to make them reflect more sunlight out to space. The report concluded that while small-scale research projects were needed, the technologies were so far from being ready that reducing carbon emissions remained the most viable approach to curbing the worst extremes of climate change. A report by the Royal Society in 2009 made similar recommendations. The $600,000 report was part-funded by the US intelligence services, but Robock said the CIA and other agencies had not fully explained their interest in the work.  “The CIA was a major funder of the National Academies report so that makes me really worried who is going to be in control,” he said. Other funders included Nasa, the US Department of Energy, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The CIA established the Center on Climate Change and National Security in 2009, a decision that drew fierce criticism from some Republicans who viewed it as a distraction from more pressing terrorist concerns. The centre was closed down in 2012, but the agency said it would continue to monitor the humanitarian consequences of climate change and the impact on US economic security, albeit not from a dedicated office. Robock said he became suspicious about the intelligence agencies’ involvement in climate change science after receiving a call from two men who claimed to be CIA consultants three years ago. “They said: ‘We are working for the CIA and we’d like to know if some other country was controlling our climate, would we be able to detect it?’ I think they were also thinking in the back of their minds: ‘If we wanted to control somebody else’s climate could they detect it?’” He replied that if a country wanted to create a stratospheric cloud large enough to change the climate, it would be visible with satellites and ground-based instruments. The use of the weather as a weapon was banned in 1978 under the Environmental Modification Convention (Enmod). Asked how he felt about the call, Robock said he was scared. “I’d learned of lots of other things the CIA had done that didn’t follow the rules. I thought that wasn’t how my tax money was spent,” he said. The CIA did not respond to requests for comment over the weekend. The US dabbled in weather modification before Enmod was introduced. In the early 1960s, researchers on Project Storm Fury seeded thunderstorms with various particles in the hope of diminishing their destructive power. A similar process was adopted during the Vietnam war, with clouds seeded over the Ho Chi Minh trail in a bid to make the major supply route for North Vietnamese foot soldiers too muddy to pass.  “I think this research should be out in the open and it has to be international so there won’t be any question that this technology will used for hostile purposes,” Robock said. "
"It has become increasingly accepted in corporate boardrooms that sustainability is an important business issue, but the business schools that train the managers of tomorrow – and the students themselves – have not always kept pace. In the past, issues such as climate change, labour condition and access to resources were not widely recognised as factors that could make a big difference to the bottom line and students were encouraged to focus on maximising shareholder value, short-term profits and the narrow interests of individual businesses rather than society and the economy as a whole. “It used to be painful to teach sustainability issues,” says Matthew Gitsham, director of Business and Sustainability at Ashridge Business School. “There was lots of resistance and even anger among the students, many of whom thought sustainability was irrelevant and even a waste of the money they had spent on fees.” Sustainability scholars used to struggle to reach out to their colleagues in business schools, says Frederik Dahlmann, assistant professor of global energy at Warwick Business School. Talking about sustainability can also make it harder to get papers published in academic journals, he adds. “There’s no clear reason that should be the case, but you almost always have to downplay the sustainability aspect and talk about operational issues. It is partly because so many journals are based in the US, where sustainability is less accepted as a business issue than in Europe.” However, the situation is changing, he says. “Students see this as an area that they can no longer choose to ignore. Many business schools are now driving it as an area where they can have a competitive advantage.” Gitsham agrees that sustainability is now a selling point for business courses. “The shift in student attitudes over the last 10 years has been phenomenal. We know that some people choose us specifically because we have a focus on this area. Some of them do so because they see the importance of the issue to today’s businesses, while others are coming at it from a values point of view.” Ashleigh Dueker, an MBA student at Lancaster University, signed up to her course after a stint working as a member of the Peace Corps in a rural village in Mali. “The most sustainable approach to development is through empowering local people by letting them make their own money rather than handing out aid. I was helping to promote local business start-ups for income generation but based on what I thought, having done an undergraduate degree in neuropsychology. I knew I needed to come to business school to learn how to promote business better.” Having secured a job at the consultancy Grant Thornton, she plans to do pro bono work in the community where she previously volunteered. It was the financial crisis that triggered a widespread change in attitudes, partly because many of the accreditation bodies that assess business courses – such as EQUIS (European Quality Improvement System), AMBA (Association of MBAs) and AACSB (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) – built into their criteria a requirement that business schools should include sustainability as part of the syllabus, according to Dr Morven McEachern, director of the Centre for Social Business at Salford Business School. “The accreditation platforms came to us [the academic community] and said ‘you have to do something’. There is more pressure on business schools to provide a balanced view,” she says. “As part of our responsibility to educate and develop people, we have a responsibility to show them what is happening in the world and the impact of what we do.” Mark Stoddard, director of operations at AMBA, says sustainability is now incredibly important for all MBA stakeholders. “In research carried out by AMBA over the last few years, students, alumni and employers highlighted the value of sustainability, and its increasing importance over time. Almost 80% of business schools agreed that sustainability is an important part of the MBA curriculum, with a similar figure believing in the shift to a stakeholder approach to management and business.” Primary school children spend more time learning about the ancient Egyptians than learning about the environment This shift in attitude is evident among employers as well, says Andy Cartland, co-founder of sustainability-focused recruitment company Acre. “We are seeing sustainability being embedded more deeply into businesses. It is being seen as a skill that people can’t do without. If we are not addressing these issues at business schools, we won’t capture the huge opportunities that sustainability issues create.” However, Jonathan Grant, director, sustainability & climate change at PwC, says the focus on sustainability in business schools is too little, too late. “If we start teaching sustainability at MBA level, we are too late. Primary school children seem to spend more time learning about the ancient Egyptians than learning about the environment. Children should have at least one hour per week at primary school on sustainability and climate change, and this should increase as they get older. After all, children starting their education this year will leave university in 2030 – at that point, the low carbon transition should be well under way.” The leadership hub is funded by Xyntéo.

"The University of Sydney will cut its fossil fuel investments by reducing the carbon footprint of its AUD$413m (£212m) listed share portfolio by 20% over three years.  The decision announced on Monday makes the university the first in Australia to commit to a strategy of phasing out carbon emissions from all the companies in its portfolio rather than exclusively targeting those in fossil fuels. The university’s total investment portfolio is worth $1.36bn.  The Australian National University pulled all of its investments out of fossil fuels last October, a move that prime minister Tony Abbott called “a stupid decision”. Such divestment is an approach advocated by campaign movements at 350.org and Greenpeace, and has been adopted by Glasgow University in the UK and partially embraced by Stanford University in the US. However, the University of Sydney has distanced itself from straight divestment, saying that the policy does not account for the carbon footprint of non-fossil fuel companies and risks cutting out fossil fuel companies which are also working on renewable energy.  Sara Watts, vice principal (operations), said: “If you divest from a particular company or a sub-sector, it’s a really blunt instrument. The new strategy balances the university’s obligation to manage funds wisely on behalf of our students, staff, donors and alumni with its desire to address climate change and protect Australia’s heritage. It signals to the entire market that investors are concerned about the impact of climate change and expect contributing sectors to respond with plans to reduce their emissions.” The university will join the Portfolio Decarbonisation Coalition, an initiative launched by the United Nations Environment Programme in September 2014. It is designed to bring together a “critical mass” of investors committed to reducing the carbon footprint of their investment assets by USD$100bn USD. It also includes two of the largest asset managers and pension funds in Europe.  The coalition does not stipulate how investors should decarbonise their portfolios, although they must publish their carbon footprint and commitments annually. The university will not divest from any sector entirely, meaning that in theory it could retain its investments in Whitehaven Coal. The company is developing Australia’s biggest new coal project in New South Wales, in southern Australia. In 2014, Greenpeace activists built a mock mine-site on the University of Sydney campus to highlight the investments. The Sydney decision follows a student campaign and referendum last year in which 80% of students voted in favour of the university divesting from fossil fuels. The university thereafter committed to a comprehensive review of its investments. Greenpeace Climate and Energy Campaigner Nikola Casule said: “The University of Sydney has taken an important step in the fight against dangerous climate change. However, the university must declare which companies will be affected if its policy is to be credible.”"
"Climate change and extreme weather events are threatening the future of sport in Australia, a report warns. Sports venues and heat policies must improve dramatically to protect the health of athletes at both professional and amateur level, a study by the Climate Institute says.  “The future holds questions around the viability of outdoor summer sport as we know it, and whether major international tournaments should be moved to different seasons of the year,” the report says. Public health expert Dr Liz Hanna said athletes ran the risk of doing serious damage to themselves if they got too hot while exerting their bodies. “You will end up in a contest of who copes best in the heat more than who is the best in their sport,” she said. “They will be putting their bodies under a lot of strain and the trouble is the ones who have million-dollar deals won’t feel they can pull out as their sponsors won’t be happy.” She said the onus should be on organisers to postpone or cancel events if temperatures rose too high. “The optimal temperature for human physical performance is 11C,” she said. “Once you get up to 21C it really starts to decline.” Increased warming, more extreme heat, changes in rainfall and more intense storms are also putting people off attending outdoor games and tournaments, leading to losses in revenue for venues. Sport brings about A$13 billion a year to the national economy, but events such as the 2014 Australian Open, which had a drop of 12,000 to 15,000 spectators a day due to the heat, will continue to suffer due to climate change, the report warns. Last year was the world’s hottest year on record, and the frequency of extremely hot days in Australia has doubled since 1960, the study says. And days over 35C are set to rise. Rain is also falling less frequently but in more intense episodes.  Experts are calling for more consistent temperature policies to be applied. They also want more sporting venues to have features such as retractable roofs as well as equipment and energy efficiencies to compensate for increased cooling costs."
"Australia’s hottest year on record would not have happened without climate change, according to a new report. The country experienced its hottest day, month, season and calendar year in 2013, registering a mean temperature 1.2C above the 1961-90 average.  The Climate Council says recent studies show those heat events would have occurred only once every 12,300 years without greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. “In fact, we can say the 2013 record year was virtually impossible without climate change; it wouldn’t have happened,” said Will Steffen, the author of Quantifying the Strong Influence of Climate Change on Extreme Heat in Australia. “I mean, no one would bet on odds of one in nearly 13,000.” Based on analyses of data and model outputs, the report says climate change triples the odds that heatwaves of the 2012-13 Australian summer will happen as frequently as they do. It also doubles the chances of them being as intense. “We’re looking at pretty hard numbers on the odds of those things happening without the underlying warming trend due to greenhouse gases,” Steffen said. “In my view, it’s extremely powerful, conclusive evidence that not only is there a link between climate change and extreme heat, climate change is the main driver of it.” Steffen found record hot days had doubled in Australia the past 50 years, and that during the past decade heat weather records were set three times more often than cold ones. The report also says heatwaves across Australia are becoming hotter, lasting longer, occurring more often and starting earlier. The Climate Council’s co-founder Tim Flannery said the research strengthened the case for immediate action on climate change. “Australians are already feeling the impact of climate change making Australia hotter,” he said. “Carbon emissions must be reduced rapidly and deeply if the worst of extreme heat in the second half of the century is to be avoided.”"
"It shouldn’t need to be said, but the Earth really is warming. Air and ocean temperatures are rising fast, ice is melting across the planet, ecosystems are shifting, sea levels are rising, and so on. The latest zombie climate myth to rise from the dead involves the oldest form of global warming denial. It’s a conspiracy theory that the Earth isn’t really warming; rather, fraudulent climate scientists are “fiddling” with the data to introduce a false warming trend.   In The Telegraph, which is a mostly serious UK newspaper, Christopher Booker calls scientists’ adjustments to temperature data “the biggest science scandal ever.” These accusations have echoed through conservative media and online blogs, even being aired on Fox News (three times). In reality climate scientists process the raw temperature data for very good reasons. Sometimes temperature monitoring station locations move. Sometimes the time of day at which they’re read changes. Sometimes changes are made to the instruments themselves. In each case, if adjustments aren’t made, then biases will be included in the data that don’t reflect actual changes in temperatures. Richard Muller at UC Berkeley was skeptical that climate scientists were doing all these adjustments correctly, so he assembled the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) team to check the data for themselves. The biggest initial financial contribution to the project came from the Koch brothers.  As Muller discusses in the video below, his team confirmed that the Earth’s surface temperatures are warming. In fact, BEST finds that NASA, NOAA, and the UK Met Office have slightly underestimated the warming over the past 15 years. Zeke Hausfather, another member of the BEST team, has also shown that the adjustments act to slightly reduce the long-term warming trend as compared to the raw data. Turns out that global temperature adjustments actually reduce the long-term warming trend, mostly due to oceans. pic.twitter.com/WccfMXnhQi Kevin Cowtan, who along with colleague Robert Way created another surface temperature data set similar to that of the BEST team, also put together this video explaining why another recent specific accusation of ‘data fiddling’ (in Paraguay) made by Booker is baseless. This particular conspiracy theory is an old one, but it’s easy to understand its origins. Certain groups have an ideological opposition to the government policies that would solve the global warming problem. If the problem doesn’t exist because scientists are fudging the data, then voilà, those distasteful policies aren’t necessary.  Global warming denial can usually be traced back to this sort of ideological bias. That’s why contrarian attempts at scientific arguments like Booker’s are so poor, contradictory, and transparently wrong. These myths are just a means to an end; that end being the opposition to climate policies. Any argument that seems to justify that climate opposition will suffice, no matter how flimsy. Unfortunately, the problem we face is a real one. Scientists only make adjustments to the data where they’re scientifically justified. The accuracy of those adjustments has been confirmed over and over and over again. And the adjustments slightly reduce the long-term global warming trend. Moreover, even if you distrust it, “fiddling” with data doesn’t make ice melt or sea levels rise. Nature’s thermometers register global warming too. Along similar conspiratorial lines, Senator James Inhofe (R-OK), who recently became the chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, calls human-caused global warming “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.” These accusations that tens of thousands of climate scientists are all part of a vast hoax can only be described as a conspiratorial denial of reality. Denial can be a dangerous thing. While we’re busy denying they exist, problems often become worse. Think of the alcoholic who denies he has a drinking problem. Eventually we reach a point where something so bad happens, the problem becomes undeniable. While Nero fiddled, Rome burned. As a society we’ve usually been smart enough to acknowledge the dangers we face and take action to mitigate them, even with environmental threats. When people resort to conspiracy theories and slip into denial, it’s time to stop listening to them and instead look for serious voices who are trying to find palatable solutions to the problem."

"The CIA was one of the funders behind yesterday’s National Research Council (NRC) reports on geoengineering, or so the rumours have it. If the intelligence community feels it is important to learn more about “climate intervention”, might not the same be true for the business community? In other words, is there money to be made here? The NRC, the major body in the US providing scientific and technical information to policymakers, released two reports. They show two very different approaches to reducing climate change from greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2) removal and albedo modification.  The gases in power plant smokestacks contain typically 10% or more CO2, whereas the atmosphere contains only 0.04% CO2. Why would anyone want to try to capture CO2 from a more dilute gas when more concentrated gases are all too readily available? Small start-up companies, such as Carbon Engineering and Climeworks, are attempting to develop technologies that could remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in centralised facilities. Since the price of CO2 on available carbon markets is less than what it costs to remove CO2 from the atmosphere using these technologies, existing carbon markets are probably insufficient to drive widespread deployment. However, there is demand for carbon dioxide for use in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations, and many of these operations are far from suitable sources of CO2. Enhanced oil recovery operations therefore represent a possible market for these technologies. It has even been suggested that if CO2 could be captured from air on a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the nuclear power could be used to split CO2 and water molecules, and the carbon and hydrogen could be combined in a chemical processing facility to produce aviation fuels. The military, therefore, is another potential market for CO2 air capture technologies. Albedo modification technologies aim to cool the Earth by causing more sunlight to be reflected to outer space. With less sunlight absorbed by Earth, the planet will cool. One leading approach for doing this involves emulating the effects of large volcanoes. Large volcanoes cool the Earth by injecting large amounts of very fine particles into the stratosphere that reflect sunlight back to space, so the Earth absorbs less sunlight. It is thought that a single fire hose constantly releasing materials into the stratosphere would be enough to offset all warming anticipated for the rest of this century. In practice, it would likely be most efficient to do this with a fleet of airplanes shuttling material up to the stratosphere. It has been estimated that the total direct cost would be about $10bn (£6.5bn) per year and require a scale of effort that would be about 1% the scale of today’s commercial aviation industry. Since no one is likely to do this soon, and there are no existing commercial drivers of this activity, it is hard to see how to make much money from these ideas. Nevertheless, there has been some activity in this area by for-profit corporations. For example, Intellectual Ventures has applied for a patent on a balloon-based system to release materials into the stratosphere – although it is unclear whether there is a direct way for the company to profit from this patent. Another way to reflect sunlight to space might be to brighten clouds over the ocean, for example by making a very fine mist of seawater. Armand Neukermans, who was part of the team that developed ink jet printers for Hewlett Packard, has recently produced a nozzle that can produce a fine enough spray to make the tiny particles needed to make clouds brighter. Neukermans knows a lot about nozzle design in a profit-driven environment, but his motives for developing this nozzle are, I believe, altruistic. While there is no market for brightening marine clouds, could this extraordinary nozzle technology find commercial applications in high-tech industrial processes? In an economically efficient world, carbon prices would equal the damage caused by the release of an equivalent amount of carbon into the atmosphere. If carbon prices get high enough and the cost of carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere could be made low enough, there may be potential for profit in the business of removing carbon dioxide. In contrast, it is hard to see how substantial profits can be made from global-scale albedo modification efforts. However, both of types of climate intervention research and development could potentially create important spin-off technologies. Insofar as these approaches can reduce the risk of dangerous climate change, they should affect prices in economically efficient carbon markets. If we think society will get serious about the climate problem soon, then investing in near-zero emission energy technologies could be the winning ticket. Unfortunately, the global community is not terribly serious about reducing emissions, and much venture capital has been lost on creative new start-ups in the energy sector. The longer we take to transform our energy system so it no longer uses the sky as a waste dump, the more likely that we will have to rely on climate intervention technologies. Perhaps then there will be greater potential to profit from investments in these technologies. The technology and innovation hub is funded by BT.

"The US south-west and the Great Plains will face decade-long droughts far worse than any experienced over the last 1,000 years because of climate change, researchers said on Thursday. The coming drought age – caused by higher temperatures under climate change – will make it nearly impossible to carry on with current life-as-normal conditions across a vast swathe of the country. The droughts will be far worse than the one in California – or those seen in ancient times, such as the calamity that led to the decline of the Anasazi civilizations in the 13th century, the researchers said. “The 21st-century projections make the [previous] mega-droughts seem like quaint walks through the garden of Eden,” said Jason Smerdon, a co-author and climate scientist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Researchers have long known that the south-west and Great Plains will dry out over the second half of the 21st century because of rising temperatures under climate change. But this was the first time researchers found those droughts would be far worse even than those seen over the millennia. The years since 2000 give only a small indication of the punishment ahead. In parts of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas, 11 of those years have been drought years. As many as 64 million people were affected by those droughts, according to Nasa projections. Those conditions have produced lasting consequences. In California, now undergoing its fourth year of drought – and the worst dry spell in 1,200 years, farmers have sold off herds. Growers have abandoned fields. Cities have imposed water rationing. But future droughts could be even more disruptive, because they will likely drag on for decades, not years. “We haven’t seen this kind of prolonged drought even certainly in modern US history,” Smerdon said. “What this study has shown is the likelihood that multi-decadal events comprising year after year after year of extreme dry events could be something in our future.” The study, Unprecedented 21st-Century Drought Risk in the American Southwest and Central Plains, was published in a new online journal Science Advances. The researchers said the effects of drought would likely be exacerbated by population growth in the south-west and rising demands for water. Already current demands for water – for agriculture and for daily life – have drastically reduced groundwater sources in California and across the south-west. Under the current warming trajectory, the south-west and Great Plains could expect to see chronic water shortages, making it impossible to carry out farming and ranching under current methods. “Given the likelihood of a much drier future and increasing water resources demand, groundwater loss and higher temperatures will likely exacerbate the impacts of future droughts, presenting a major adaptation challenge,” the paper said. The researchers used data derived from tree rings, whose growth patterns show the effects of dry and wet years, sampled across North America, and soil moisture, rainfall and evaporation records, and 17 climate models to study the effects of future temperature rise on the region."
"One small mystery that surrounds Greenland’s melting ice is a little closer to being solved as scientists in the US confirm that surface meltwater can drain all the way down to fill concealed lakes under the ice. This means that atmospheric warming can reach thousands of metres below the ice sheet − warming the glacial base and potentially increasing its rate of flow.  One group, led by geologist Michael Willis, of Cornell University, and another team led by glaciologist Ian Howat, of Ohio State University, report in two different journals on separate but related studies of Greenland’s plumbing system: what happens to meltwater. The ice sheet of Greenland adds up to about four-fifths of the mass of the vast frozen island, and there is evidence that, as a consequence of global warming, the rate of melting has begun to accelerate. This has already begun to make a measurable difference to global sea levels, and were the entire island to shed its burden of ice – a process that would take a considerable time − then sea levels would rise by seven metres or more. So what exactly happens to the water that forms on the surface and collects in lakes each summer, and how much of it gets into the sea, has become an important but perplexing problem. Surface lakes are now appearing much further inland, and at higher altitudes, than recorded in the past. Dr Howat and his colleagues report in The Cryosphere that they measured a two kilometre-wide depression 70 metres deep in the icecap of southwest Greenland, which they then identified as “the first direct evidence for concentrated long-term storage and sudden release of meltwater at the bed”. The slumped crater suggested a holding capacity of more than 30 million cubic metres of water, which had suddenly drained away. “The fact that our lake appears to have been stable for at least several decades, and then drained in a matter of weeks – or less – after a few very hot summers, may signal a fundamental change happening to the ice sheet,” Dr Howat said. The Cornell team worked in northeast Greenland, and in 2011 found a collapsed basin 70 metres deep. Dr Willis and colleagues report in Nature journal that between 2011 and 2014 they watched as summer meltwater made its way down fissures in the depression and refilled a lake basin at the base of the icecap.  “We’re seeing surface meltwater make its way to the base of the ice where it can get trapped and stored at the boundary between the bedrock beneath the ice sheet and the ice itself,” they say. “As the lake beneath the ice fills with surface meltwater, the heat released by this trapped meltwater can soften surrounding ice, which may eventually cause an increase in ice flow.” The researchers do not yet know whether the draining water is increasing glacial flow, and nor can they be sure how many such depressions in the Greenland ice mask buried meltwater storage tanks. But melting of glacial ice is likely to accelerate anyway, according to new research in the journal Climate Dynamics. Earth scientist Patrick Applegate, of Penn State University, reports that computer models confirm that the more temperatures increase, the faster the ice will melt. Were all Greenland’s ice to melt, sea levels would rise catastrophically. At least one billion people live on coasts and estuaries vulnerable to a mere one metre rise. The Arctic is already the fastest warming place in the northern hemisphere, and the Penn State scientists wanted to see how present warming could play back into future warming. Engineers call this positive feedback. “If we are going to do something to mitigate sea level rise, we need to do it earlier rather than later,” Dr Applegate said. “The longer we wait, the more rapidly the changes will take place and the more difficult it will be to change.” • This article was amended on 6 February 2015 as it originally had an incorrect figure about the rate of water flowing to the lake basin at the base of the icecap."
"An Indian court has barred the former head of a UN climate change panel from leaving the country as police investigate a sexual harassment complaint against him, lawyers have said. Rajendra Pachauri, who stepped down as chairman of the Nobel prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on Tuesday, is also not allowed to enter his workplace as part of interim bail conditions made on Thursday.   Pachauri, 74, is accused of harassing a 29-year-old female employee of his organisation, the Energy and Resources Institute (Teri). “The court ordered him not to enter the Teri office and not to leave the country without [the] court’s permission,” Prashant Mendiratta, one of the woman’s lawyers, told AFP. The court bailed Pachauri until 27 March. Pachauri, who has been facing growing calls for his resignation from the Delhi-based thinktank, is also barred from contacting the complainant or any other Teri employees. His resignation from the IPCC comes at a crucial time, as the panel tries to pave the way for a high-profile climate change summit in Paris in December where world leaders hope to strike a deal to curb global warming. Pachauri’s lawyer, Shankh Sengupta, said the bail conditions were normal, adding that the veteran scientist was recovering from a heart problem in a Delhi hospital. He has also taken a leave of absence from Teri. “These conditions are normal … We informed the court that he would be happy to abide by these conditions,” Sengupta said. Pachauri was admitted to hospital last week. He has been receiving treatment since a procedure to unblock his arteries in 2010. The female employee claims Pachauri repeatedly harassed her, including through emails, text and WhatsApp messages. Pachauri denies the allegations, claiming his emails and mobile phone were hacked. Lawyers and women’s rights groups have demanded Pachauri’s resignation, saying employees deserved an atmosphere free from sexual harassment and discrimination against women."
"More than half a billion Africans are smallholder farmers. In some countries they make up as much as 85% of the population. Even in Africa’s most urbanised countries that figure only drops to 55%. Smallholders produce 70% of the world’s food, but they are particularly vulnerable to climatic and economic shocks, with many living from one harvest to the next. Poor harvests, or sudden massive price drops, can and do have catastrophic effects. In the wake of ongoing food crises, everyone acknowledges the sector needs developing, the question now is: how? Marc Pfitzer, a managing director of non-profit consulting firm FSG, which works with businesses, nonprofits and governments, says “the consensus is that the more developed a country is, the larger its farms will be”. But he says that it is better “for farmers to gradually consolidate over generations … You can’t shock the system and leapfrog it into plantations because you will end up with massive unemployment.” The answer, he says, is to intensify and diversify smallholder farms, but for that to happen, investment is needed. “If you want to develop an agricultural country you are going to have to go through a process of investing in smallholder farming. Development will follow over several generations.” In 2003, African heads of state signed the Maputo Declaration pledging to increase their spending on agriculture development to 10% of their national budgets within five years. Twelve years later, just eight out of over 50 countries have achieved this goal. So, we know that national governments aren’t stumping up the cash, but what else do smallholder farmers need? And are they getting it? One recent report from Africa Smallholder Farmers Group (ASFG) says that diversification and training are priorities. Diversification is a high priority because it helps protect smallholders from economic risks, such as market collapses, and helps prevent land degradation. But steps towards achieving diversification are being hampered by governments and businesses that encourage dependency on fertiliser, specify which seeds must be used and encourage farmers to grow a single crop. ASFG member Find Your Feet (FYF) works in Malawi. Director Dan Taylor says the NGO has a “close working relationship” with the Malawi government which is at once “friendly and quite critical”, because FYF doesn’t agree with the fertiliser subsidy and the Malawian government’s decision to focus on maize.  Taylor says depending on just one crop is a risky strategy in a time of climate change and the fertiliser subsidy is dangerous because it nudges farmers down the route of growing a particular crop, which goes against the need for diversification. Over-reliance on fertiliser is leads to soil degradation, pollution, and lack of adaptability on the part of the farmer. Composting and crop rotation would be better alternatives, Taylor says. “You could see the Malawian government’s decision to focus solely on maize grown with subsidised fertilisers as modernisation, or you can regard it as a cynical ploy to buy votes, because fertiliser buys votes,” Taylor says. “Presidents have used the fertiliser subsidy to gain political upmanship. So while there is a commitment to do something about small-scale agriculture, they are short term in their outlook. Rather than giving people subsidies which aren’t continued and are donor-funded, steps should be taken to minimise external inputs.” Switching from fossil-fuel made, and privately-funded fertiliser inputs, to compost-making is suggested by several NGOs. “We’ve done a lot of work on compost-making as an alternative to fertiliser,” says Taylor. “Compost-making is on the increase, because the government is recognising that it’s not going to be able to afford fertiliser subsidies indefinitely and are quite worried about the potential devastation that climate change is likely to cause in the future.” But as long they are still handing out free fertiliser, the message is mixed, and that, according to Taylor is “problematic.” Another factor that can help smallholders is knowledge. Good agricultural education would ensure that farmers were savvy enough to avoid risks. Pfitzer says there is “definitely not enough training available for smallholder farmers” and the quality of some of what is provided is questionable. Chris Henderson, agricultural lead at Practical Action, said training provided by the governments tends to be unpopular because the civil servants who provide it “are not doing a particularly good job”.  Pfitzer is also scathing about the performance of the civil servants who deliver national training projects, and thinks training works best when business gets involved. He says the private sector has a real incentive to deliver training and “will invest because it will increase productivity of the farmer, who will extend his/her services back to the business”. He says this creates “a feedback loop that reinforces the desire of the private sector to provide good training”. The main obstacle to training is literacy, he says, “so a lot of training has to be farmer-trains-farmer, or it has to be visual, or it has to be co-op-based where people meet and discuss things – you can’t just post out a booklet, or post a text on a website.” This shows that you can’t tackle the development of smallholder farming without addressing primary education. Pfitzer says that for development hasn’t worked in the past because NGOs worked in silos. “We did a project, we built a school, we built a well, we got some nice technologies – but we never did all of these things at the same time in the same place so we failed.” He adds that he believes the right approach is “place-based”. He says: “We talk about community and productivity pillars but it goes even beyond that: politics, infrastructure, land rights, ultimately you want all of these things to come together.” As well as an awareness of place, Pfitzer says that to make a real difference in the development of smallholders, projects need time, and lots of it. “At least a decade because you need at least half a generation to achieve anything.” He says that the private sector is more likely to invest for the long-term than politicians who only think about the next election. “Sustained national leadership is key. We don’t get that from government, but we are getting that from business now because they see that see the long-term view.” • This article was amended on 13 February 2015.

"Lawyers for Harvard University will appear in court on Friday to fight off attempts to force the world’s richest university to dump coal, oil and gas companies from its $36bn (£23bn) endowment. A lawsuit filed late last year by seven law students and undergraduates argues the university has a duty to fight climate change by pulling out of fossil fuel companies.  The university and the state of Massachusetts, which is also named in the lawsuit, are asking the judge to dismiss the case. But a student sit-in at the Harvard president’s offices last week – and the rapid expansion of the campus divestment movement – suggest that the university can expect continued pressure. We're sitting in outside Faust's office for fossil fuel divestment! @350 @GoFossilFree @betterfuturepro @350Mass pic.twitter.com/z2NkZ0PXlR “This is important to us because climate change is supposed to be a huge problem and so far our existing institutions have been unable to address it in a way that is commensurate with the problem,” said Alice Cherry, a second year law student and one of the seven bringing the suit. “We think it is past time for our legal system to have something to say about it.” The lawsuit argues that Harvard, by continuing to invest in fossil fuels, is putting current and future generations in danger. “Such investments contribute to current and future damage to the University’s reputation and to that of its students and graduates, to the ability of students to study and thrive free from the threat of catastrophic climate change, and to future damage to the university’s physical campus as a result of sea-level rise and increased storm activity,” the complaint contends. The students are calling for Harvard to withdraw immediately from an estimated $79m in direct investments in coal, oil and gas companies, and begin phasing out all other investments containing fossil fuel stocks. The lawsuit puts a growing spotlight on Harvard, as the world’s richest university. Over the last few years, the divestment movement has jumped from college campuses to charitable foundations and pensions funds – with the recent crash of oil prices strengthening the financial argument for getting out of fossil fuels. Last week, 34 Harvard students staged a sit-in outside the offices of the university president, Drew Gilpin Faust. More than 230 faculty members have signed a letter calling on Harvard to drop oil and coal companies. So far, Harvard hasn’t budged on its refusal to divest. In 2013, when Harvard was first confronted with divestment demands, Faust responded that the endowment was set up to support academic aims, and not serve other purposes. The university said its lawyers would urge the judge to dismiss the lawsuit. “Climate change poses a serious threat to our planet. Harvard agrees that this threat must be confronted, but we have focused our efforts on supporting the research and teaching that will ultimately create the solutions to this challenge,” Jeff Neal, a university spokesman, said in an email. The email accused last week’s sit-in protesters of coercion, and said they had crossed the line into unacceptable forms of protest.  “We are deeply disappointed that divestment advocates have chosen to resort to a disruptive building occupation as a means to advance their view. Such tactics cross the line from persuasion to disrespectful and coercive interference with the activities of others.”"

"Is 2015 the year when the world will finally decide on a major new global agreement on climate change? Pundits are beginning to put their cases as to whether the Paris summit in December will “save the earth”, or will end up as another Copenhagen, as in 2009 when massive anticipation resulted in inevitable post-conference disappointment. In a speech this week Prince Charles insisted that 2015 will be a make-or-break year for the climate. But is Paris where the real action will be? Like it or loathe it, it’s now about the money. Cost curves, China, India, bankers, entrepreneurs and the concept of “loss and damage”, in other words, financial risk versus opportunity, are now more important to what is happening to try and prevent irreversible climate change than any of the technical details of the negotiations.  Let me throw some numbers at you. Solar has now moved so far down the cost curve that if you live in Queensland, you can buy a 6kW rooftop solar PV system for $7,800 ($4,000 with the RET subsidy). Ignoring subsidies now and then, such a large system would have cost $54,000 five years ago. This system will supply you with electricity at a fraction of the price you currently pay to your electricity retailer. At a global level, the dramatically positive positions of solar and wind on their respective cost curves mean that the $310bn invested in clean energy last year paid for almost twice the clean electricity capacity compared with three years ago. China has understood for many years that clean energy development would bring them greater energy independence (although they are still significantly reliant on Russian gas) as well as trade income, so has sought to dominate solar manufacturing worldwide. As a result, four of the five largest solar panel manufacturers globally are Chinese companies and China is investing US$294bn in renewables over the five years to 2015 (that’s not a typo; it’s 3% of China’s GDP). In turn, Germany has gone from selling solar panels to selling solar manufacturing equipment to China. India has recently announced plans for a $100bn expansion of solar power by 2022. Not $1bn or $10bn, but $100bn – enough for almost 100,000 MW of clean energy (which would be more than 10% of India’s total generation capacity). As part of the US-India climate agreement announced by Obama and Modi on Sunday, the US agreed to assist with financing India’s clean energy development. Entrepreneur Elon Musk has led electric car startup Tesla through a series of near-death financial crises to make the company’s innovation available to others. Last year, Tesla declared its patents available for anyone to use in good faith saying “it is impossible for Tesla to build electric cars fast enough to address the carbon crisis”. Tesla is also building a $5bn battery factory in Nevada, just one of multiple investments that have experts agreeing that battery storage will also quickly fall down the cost curve to be commercial for mass deployment within a decade. Citigroup’s latest report says this will be a US$400bn industry by 2030 – just 15 years away. Forward-thinking banks have been investing on this rising tide. In 2007 Citigroup set an investment target of US$50bn over 10 years in alternative energy, clean technology and other carbon-emission reduction activities, which it has already exceeded. US$11bn of climate-themed bonds were issued in 2013, $35bn in 2014 with $100bn estimated for 2015. Climate bonds include financing for a wide range of emissions reducing activities from rail lines to forestry to water recycling. The Green Climate Fund has reached its start-up goal of $10bn with an ambition of reaching $100bn a year by 2020. These funds will be invested in developing countries to limit or reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and assist them to adapt to climate change. This is a partial response to calls for the developed world to compensate for “loss and damage” inflicted on countries that have not significantly contributed to the causes of our altered climate. So there is plenty of money to be made. And then there is money to be lost. On the flip side of finance, there is the growing momentum around divestment. The Fossil Free divestment campaign started by American environmentalist Bill McKibben and 350.org has been growing fast. Organisations, from the Australian National University to the Uniting Church in NSW to the heirs of the Rockerfeller oil fortune, have signed up to a total withdrawal sum of $50bn from fossil fuel investments. Even UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has been urging reduced investments in fossil fuels and, more subtly, World Bank president Jim Yong Kim has called for financial regulators to enforce disclosures of climate risk. As Matthew Yglesias notes in Slate, such a campaign is as much moral as financial.  Divestment says: If you make your fortune digging fossil fuels out of the ground and poisoning the air by burning them, then people are going to shun you and your business. However, the concept of the “carbon bubble” or “unburnable carbon” – that 80% of fossil fuels on the balance sheets of public and private companies and governments must stay in the ground if temperatures are to stay below 2C – is gaining credence. A report by analysts at Citigroup in mid-2013 warned of the likelihood that fossil fuel reserves in Australia will face significant value destruction in a carbon constrained world. Insurance underwriters too are heeding their actuaries and are already incorporating climate change risk into their models – and adjusting premiums and coverage terms and conditions at all levels. Similarly, the call for an end to fossil fuel subsidies is growing louder. It was made jointly by the World Bank, the IMF, the International Energy Agency and the OECD in October last year. Now even the Economist is calling for the annual $550bn of subsidies for the extraction and use of fossil fuels to be removed (you’ll note that figure is the largest one in this article). And, Australia notwithstanding, carbon pricing is now in place or scheduled to be implemented in 39 national and 23 sub-national jurisdictions. The world’s second largest carbon trading market opened for business this month in South Korea. When financial flows start changing because the people who control the purse strings see the future, then you know change is underway.  Reducing climate change mitigation to a financial conversation might be abhorrent to Naomi Klein, but unless financial institutions can see a way of making a dollar, then we are not going to make the change as fast as needed. Of course international agreements and global leadership is absolutely vital, especially in setting the policy and regulatory framework. Solar PV would never have become so cheap so fast without the German government’s policy settings, including feed-in-tariffs. But solely focusing on the Paris negotiations can distract us from the national, regional and city policy changes that are needed (including re-instating a carbon price in Australia) and the regulatory and financial support needed for disruptive innovations (for example, removing fossil fuel subsidies would lower the barriers to entry for clean energy). It might seem deflating or unethical, but someone has to get rich reducing carbon pollution. Just as new business models developed with the end of the African slave trade or the introduction of water restrictions, threats to vested interests are opportunities for others. The particularly good news in the case of climate change is that a lot of that money is going to be made bringing clean energy to people who don’t have it today or reducing the amount of energy the rest of us use. That means solar powered lights in Africa, electric buses in Brazil, cleaner cookstoves in Cambodia, and yes, some fat banker bonuses in London, Songdo and Beijing."

"The £487m MPs’ pension pot is in danger of taking a financial hit due to the failure of its trustees to acknowledge the economic risk posed by fossil fuel investments, a group of 11 MPs and two Lords have warned. The trustees of the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund were challenged last year by the group, which include Green party MP Caroline Lucas, to shift its investments from oil and coal companies because of widespread fears that they are overvalued.   Heavyweight figures, including the governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, have endorsed the idea that investors face a “carbon bubble” because the market value of big players in the fossil fuel industry is based on carbon reserves that cannot be burnt without the world experiencing dangerous climate change. A growing number of institutions – including the Rockefeller Brothers fund, Stanford University and Glasgow University – have signed up to a global divestment campaign urging investors to pull their money out of the fossil fuel industry. But the chair of the MPs’ pension fund board of trustees, Labour MP Brian Donohoe, rejected the idea, saying the trustees’ lawyers had advised that for the trustees to exclude a sector would be incompatible with their “legal and fiduciary duties of investment”. He added that as MPs held a wide range of views, it would be impossible they “would share a moral view viewpoint in one area of investment”. Now the MPs and Lords have accused Donohoe of failing to understand the economic dimension of their case, and of putting MPs’ pensions at financial risk. “As we stated in our [original] letter [sent in October 2014], climate change has significant financial implications for pension funds. It is not merely a matter of morals or ethics. Accordingly, we remain concerned that a failure to acknowledge the risks of continued investment in fossil fuel industries would in fact be to the financial detriment of the scheme,” they write. The letter, signed by Labour, Liberal Democrat, Green and SNP MPs but no Conservatives, adds: “We are concerned that the trustees, in regarding climate change and fossil fuel exposure as a moral issue, have not undertaken a proper evaluation of the financial impact these risks may have on the fund.” Donohoe told the Guardian that the letter had been sent on to the trustee’s lawyers and investment managers for their views, which he would defer to. “I have to go on the basis of advice I’m given by investment managers who are saying to the contrary [to what Lucas argues]. Other trustees are similarly minded, to go on the advice of our lawyers.” On his personal view of fossil fuel divestment, he said: “I suspect I would be the majority view, that I don’t necessarily go with the whole concept which her and her colleagues go by. If you follow it to the conclusion, we will go and live back in a cave. I don’t know how she would commute back and forwards from her constituency other than by walking as she wouldn’t even be able to have a bike [without fossil fuels].”  Among the other nine trustees is Conservative MP Peter Lilley, an outspoken critic of climate change action and renewable energy. Lucas has also tabled an Early Day Motion, signed by 16 MPs, calling for MPs to show leadership on climate change and for the trustees of the pension fund to quantify and review its investments in fossil fuels. The fund does not disclose how much is invested in oil, coal and gas – a figure the MPs and Lords request in their new letter.   Last week the California senate called on two state pension funds to pull their combined $500bn (£325) portfolio from fossil fuels, and there was a coordinated global day of events backing the divestment campaign.  Energy and climate secretary Ed Davey added his voice at UN climate talks in Lima last year, saying that pensions faced future risks from fossil fuel investments. He warned that financial authorities must examine the risks posed by what he called “the sub-prime assets of the future.”"

"Business is traditionally associated with a ‘profits first, everything else second’ mentality. This has led to serious problems – for people, the planet and for the very resources that companies rely on, including land, water supplies and indeed employees themselves.  Yet there are examples of companies looking beyond the short-term as they make significant strides to ensure sustainable business practices. Take Interface Europe’s Mission Zero plan, which has already seen the carpet tile company reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 90% since 1996 at its European manufacturing facility in Scherpenzeel, Holland as the company works towards zero environmental impact by 2020. Its progress to date has saved the company €7.6m (£5.6m) per year. The question is, how do we learn from the handful of companies pioneering truly sustainable business practices? Some argue that a key answer lies in external engagement – specifically in public policy intervention, but does everyone agree that this is the way forward?

"Climate change has advanced so rapidly that the time has come to look at options for a planetary-scale intervention, the National Academy of Science said on Tuesday. The scientists were categorical that geoengineering should not be deployed now, and was too risky to ever be considered an alternative to cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. But it was better to start research on such unproven technologies now – to learn more about their risks – than to be stampeded into climate-shifting experiments in an emergency, the scientists said. With that, a once-fringe topic in climate science moved towards the mainstream – despite the repeated warnings from the committee that cutting carbon pollution remained the best hope for dealing with climate change. “That scientists are even considering technological interventions should be a wake-up call that we need to do more now to reduce emissions, which is the most effective, least risky way to combat climate change,” Marcia McNutt, the committee chair and former director of the US Geological Survey, said. Asked whether she foresaw a time when scientists would eventually turn to some of the proposals studied by the committee, she said: “Gosh, I hope not.” The two-volume report, produced over 18 months by a team of 16 scientists, was far more guarded than a similar British exercise five years ago which called for an immediate injection of funds to begin research on climate-altering interventions. The scientists were so sceptical about geo-engineering that they dispensed with the term, opting for “climate intervention”. Engineering implied a measure of control the technologies do not have, the scientists said. But the twin US reports – Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration and Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool the Earth – could boost research efforts at a limited scale. The White House and committee leaders in Congress were briefed on the report’s findings this week. Bill Gates, among others, argues the technology, which is still confined to computer models, has enormous potential and he has funded research at Harvard. The report said scientific research agencies should begin carrying out co-ordinated research. But geo-engineering remains extremely risky and relying on a planetary hack – instead of cutting carbon dioxide emissions – is “irresponsible and irrational”, the report said. The scientists looked at two broad planetary-scale technological fixes for climate change: sucking carbon dioxide emissions out of the atmosphere, or carbon dioxide removal, and increasing the amount of sunlight reflected away from the earth and back into space, or albedo modification. Albedo modification, injecting sulphur dioxide to increase the amount of reflective particles in the atmosphere and increase the amount of sunlight reflected back into space, is seen as a far riskier proposition. Tinkering with reflectivity would merely mask the symptoms of climate change, the report said. It would do nothing to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. The world would have to commit to continuing a course of albedo modification for centuries on end – or watch climate change come roaring back. “It’s hard to unthrow that switch once you embark on an albedo modification approach. If you walk back from it, you stop masking the effects of climate change and you unleash the accumulated effects rather abruptly,” Waleed Abdalati, a former Nasa chief scientist who was on the panel, said. More ominously, albedo modification could alter the climate in new and additional ways from which there would be no return. “It doesn’t go back, it goes different,” he said. The results of such technologies are still far too unpredictable on a global scale, McNutt said. She also feared they could trigger conflicts. The results of such climate interventions will vary enormously around the globe, she said. “Kansas may be happy with the answer, but Congo may not be happy at all because of changes in rainfall. It may be quite a bit worse for the Arctic, and it’s not going to address at all ocean acidification,” she said. “There are all sorts of reasons why one might not view albedo modified world as an improvement.” The report also warned that offering the promise of a quick fix to climate change through planet hacking could discourage efforts to cut the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. “The message is that reducing carbon dioxide emissions is by far the preferable way of addressing the problem,” said Raymond Pierrehumbert, a University of Chicago climate scientist, who served on the committee writing the report. “Dimming the sun by increasing the earth’s reflectivity shouldn’t be viewed as a cheap substitute for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. It is a very poor and distant third, fourth, or even fifth choice. |It is way down on the list of things you want to do.” But geoengineering has now landed on the list. Climate change was advancing so rapidly a climate emergency – such as widespread crop failure – might propel governments into trying such large-scale interventions. “The likelihood of eventually considering last-ditch efforts to address damage from climate change grows with every year of inaction on emissions control,” the report said. If that was the case, it was far better to be prepared for the eventualities by carrying out research now. The report gave a cautious go-ahead to technologies to suck carbon dioxide out of the air, finding them generally low-risk – although they were prohibitively expensive. The report discounted the idea of seeding the ocean with iron filings to create plankton blooms that absorb carbon dioxide. But it suggested carbon-sucking technologies could be considered as part of a portfolio of responses to fight climate change. It would involve capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and pumping it underground at high pressure – similar to technology that is only now being tested at a small number of coal plants. Sucking carbon dioxide out of the air is much more challenging than capturing it from a power plant – which is already prohibitively expensive, the report said. But it still had a place. “I think there is a good case that eventually this might have to be part of the arsenal of weapons we use against climate change,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University, who was not involved with the report. Drawing a line between the two technologies – carbon dioxide removal and albedo modification – was seen as one of the important outcomes of Tuesday’s report. The risks and potential benefits of the two are diametrically opposed, said Ken Caldeira, an atmospheric scientist at Carnegie Institution’s Department of Global Ecology and a geoengineering pioneer, who was on the committee. “The primary concern about carbon dioxide removal is how much does it cost,” he said. “There are no sort of novel, global existential dilemmas that are raised. The main aim of the research is to make it more affordable, and to make sure it is environmentally acceptable.” In the case of albedo reflection, however, the issue is risk. “A lot of those ideas are relatively cheap,” he said. “The question isn’t about direct cost. The question is, What bad stuff is going to happen?” There are fears such interventions could lead to unintended consequences that are even worse than climate change – widespread crop failure and famine, clashes between countries over who controls the skies. But Caldeira, who was on the committee, argued that it made sense to study those consequences now. “If there are real show stoppers and it is not going to work, it would be good to know that in advance and take it off the table, so people don’t do something rash in an emergency situation,” he said. Spraying sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere could lower temperatures – at least according to computer models and real-life experiences following major volcanic eruptions. But the cooling would be temporary and it would do nothing to right ocean chemistry, which was thrown off kilter by absorbing those emissions. “My view of albedo modification is that it is like taking pain killers when you need surgery for cancer,” said Pierrehumbert. “It’s ignoring the problem. The problem is still growing though and it is going to come back and get you.”     "

"The US security establishment views climate change as real and a dangerous threat to national security. But Canada takes a very different view, according to a secret intelligence memo prepared by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The memo, stamped “Canadian eyes only”, repeatedly casts doubt on the causes of climate change – the burning of fossil fuels – and its potential threat.  The 44-page intelligence assessment of Canada’s environmental protest movement was prepared for the government of Stephen Harper, who is expected to roll out new anti-terror legislation. In the memo, obtained by Greenpeace and seen by the Guardian, the RCMP repeatedly departs from the conclusions of an overwhelming majority of scientists – and the majority of elected leaders in the international arena – that climate change is a growing threat to global security. Instead, the memo on the “anti-Canada petroleum movement” presents continued expansion of oil and gas production as an inevitability, and repeatedly casts doubt on the causes and consequences of climate change. It mentions the “perceived environmental threat from the continued use of fossil fuels”. It suggests that those concerned with the consequences of climate change occupy the political fringe. “In their literature, representatives of the movement claim that climate change is now the most serious global environmental threat and that climate change is a direct consequence of elevated anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions which, reportedly, are directly linked to the continued use of fossil fuels,” the memo says. It does not refer to the findings of the United Nations’ climate science panel, the IPCC, and its exhaustive reports on the causes of climate change and its consequence. The language and tone of the RCMP memo are strikingly at odds with perceptions of climate change within the security establishment of Canada’s closest ally, the US, and with the current findings of the world’s best scientists. Scientists have known for decades that the burning of fossil fuels is the main driver of global warming, and parts of Canada are in line for some of its gravest consequences. The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world. In terms of security perceptions, Barack Obama in a national security assessment earlier this month called climate change “an urgent and growing threat”. The CIA and Pentagon both view climate change as a serious threat to international order, and factor sea-level rise, drought, and extreme weather into their future security planning. The US military has been tasked with reducing its carbon footprint at all of its military bases and in war zones. The Globe and Mail, which was the first to report on the memo, said the tone of the RCMP memo reflects the hostility of the Harper government towards environmental activists. The memo warns: “Violent anti-petroleum extremists will continue to engage in criminal activity to promote their anti-petroleum ideology”. The memo also echoes the accusations of former Harper officials of foreign funding of environmental protesters.  “There is a growing, highly organized and well-financed anti-Canada petroleum movement that consists of peaceful activists, militants and violent extremists who are opposed to society’s reliance on fossil fuels,” the memo says. “If violent environmental extremists engage in unlawful activity, it jeopardizes the health and safety of its participants, the general public and the natural environment.”  The RCMP did not respond to repeated requests for comment."

"Today the EU will unveil its latest commitment to fighting climate change – a pledge to cut internal emissions by at least 40% by 2030. The new target represents a good step forward, a hard-fought political compromise at a time of considerable economic difficulty.  The EU hopes to leverage this pledge at December’s climate talks in Paris, when Europe will press other nations to forge a new agreement to reduce global climate pollution 60% by 2050. Yet, the EU’s climate plan has a critical flaw: it is incomplete. The EU’s regulations would only reduce emissions within Europe, whereas success on climate depends on Europe also taking steps to cut pollution outside of Europe as well.   To have any chance of reaching the 60% goal, EU must negotiate and finance partnerships to cut pollution in the developing world too. The EU hopes that by leading at home it will inspire other nations to do the same. That strategy may work to a point. But unfortunately the domestic-only climate policy cannot succeed — the numbers won’t add up.  The domestic emissions cuts that the EU and other major economies are expected to pledge unilaterally by Paris, even if fully implemented, would deliver at most half of the pollution reduction needed through 2030 to keep global warming to 2C — the level nations and scientists have agreed is necessary to avoid unmanageable risks of climate catastrophe. Unilateral pledges in the Paris agreement alone would not create an emissions trajectory in line with a 60% global reduction by 2050. One simple fix would be for all major economies to do more at home — but this is politically unrealistic in the near-term. China and the US, the two largest climate polluters, have already set their domestic carbon pledges and are not likely to change them this year. Even the EU may lack the political will to do more internally right now. Fortunately, there’s an affordable solution that does not depend on additional domestic action in these nations. Many developing nations – from Colombia to India and Indonesia – have an abundance of low-cost opportunities to cut climate pollution. Since 2005, for example, Brazil alone has cut more carbon pollution than the entire EU, simply by reducing deforestation in the Amazon. Massive forest conservation and restoration on a global scale holds great promise to help meet the 60% goal, as does building low-carbon cities, factories and power plants across the developing world.  While all nations should take climate action, one cannot expect developing nations to do more than their fair share: after all, they have done less to cause the problem and have fewer resources to stop it. A system that depends solely on unilateral, self-financed pollution targets by all nations is bound to fall short, with developing nations cutting emissions far less than the optimal amount.  If the world could find a way to truly work together, the potential for progress would become enormous. A new breed of international climate partnerships that supplement, rather than replace, unilateral climate action could accomplish great things. They could virtually eliminate tropical deforestation and phase-down climate super-pollutants known as HFCs, while also doubling down on progress in emerging economies on energy efficiency and renewable energy. Europe must lead the way towards this collaborative approach before Paris. In addition to internal EU pollution cuts, Europe should pledge to enter into bilateral and multilateral partnerships to reduce at least one billion tonnes of CO2 per year outside the EU, starting no later than 2020.  Helping poor and emerging economies pursue climate-smart development would cost a fraction of large additional carbon cuts within the EU. Accelerating climate action in these emerging nations would not only deliver tremendous local development benefits, but would also create jobs in Europe by expanding markets for EU companies. The EU should challenge the US, Japan and other developed countries to make comparable international carbon pledges. As host of the G7, chancellor Angela Merkel is in a unique position to put this proposal to her peers at a leaders’ summit in Germany this June. Negotiating pollution reduction partnerships with developing nations is the type of action that president Obama could pursue using his foreign policy powers and other existing legal authorities, without the recalcitrant Congress. Japan’s prime minister Shinzō Abe is looking for new ways to lead on climate change internationally following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, which has made reducing Japan’s emissions more difficult. Last year the EU took a half step toward this type of collaborative climate policy. In September 2014, at the UN climate summit, the EU endorsed the New York Declaration on Forests, which committed the EU and other developed countries to put in place large-scale economic incentives to eliminate natural forest loss globally by 2030.  Making good on that promise and spreading it to other economic sectors this year would remove the two largest obstacles to forging a strong global climate pact in Paris. Currently, vulnerable African and island nations are ambivalent about the emerging Paris agreement because it may not do enough to reduce climate pollution or spur economic investment in those nations.  Strong pledges from the EU and other developed nations to reduce climate pollution outside their borders would address those concerns and seal an ambitious climate deal in Paris. "

"As we move into 2015, many UK-based NGOs are wondering how to meet the challenges of a crucial year. What is the unique and distinct value that each organisation, and the UK sector as a whole, brings to international development, and how might this change in future?  To help the sector get on the front foot we have identified seven “megatrends” and posed a few questions to highlight some of the key choices NGOs might need to make. At the end of next week we’ll be concluding a consultation with DfID on the future of the sector – all your thoughts are welcome.   As evidence mounts that the impacts of human-caused climate change are already upon us, the future of international development cannot be considered in isolation from the need to adapt. Furthermore the Earth’s natural systems are under enormous pressure, with huge consequences for the world’s most vulnerable people. As UNep’s 2012 Global Environment Outlook assessment concludes: “Scientific evidence shows that Earth systems are being pushed towards their bio-physical limits, with evidence that these limits are close and have in some cases been exceeded”. The global population could reach 9.6 billion by 2050 and 10.9 billion by 2100. In 2000, for the first time, there were more people over the age of 60 in the world than children under five. By 2050, four-fifths of older people will live in developing countries, where 80% of them will have no regular income. Youth unemployment is also growing. In 2012, 15- to 24-year-olds made up 40% of the total unemployed population. Globally, more people live in urban than rural areas and this is expected to gather pace. But the urban transition is taking place at different rates in different parts of the world. By 2050 most northern regions are expected to be at least 84% urban. In contrast, even by 2050, Africa’s urban dwellers are projected to make up just 62% of its total, and Asia’s 65%. Even in Asia and Africa, though, rapid rural-to-urban shifts are taking place. Urbanisation is a key engine of economic growth, but with this comes the risks of social marginality, conflict and exploitation. Demographic pressures create food and water insecurity, and supplies of non-renewable natural resources including fossil fuels are depleting. Scarcity could push prices up, creating further hardship for those most in need. Notwithstanding the current low oil price, from 2000 to 2013 metal prices rose by 176%, energy prices by an average of 260% and food prices by 120%. Depending on political responses, this may drive humanitarian crises, population movements and a rise in protectionist or nationalist policies. In 2012, the Brics countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa were reported as being responsible for more than 25% of the world’s GDP based on purchasing power parity and home to 40% of the global population. The axis of the world’s economic and geopolitical power has shifted – and will continue to shift – from west and north to east and south. Poverty patterns and distributions are changing alongside the wider geopolitical shifts, and donor policies are changing alongside them. Declining overseas development assistance to middle income countries and new donors entering the landscape are reshaping the nature of aid. Moreover, there is a risk that some growing political powers restrict the space for civil society action. Technological innovation could have a very significant impact on the ability of people to meet their needs and to adapt to climate change. The world is becoming hyper-connected. Technological changes and the rapid diffusion of information and communications technologies, particularly among young people, have also broken down many of the old barriers between northern and southern publics. By 2030, it is estimated that 50% of the global population will have internet access. There is also growing appreciation of how technology links to human and environmental systems, escalating conflict or cooperation. Economic growth in at least 40 countries has helped to lift many hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. It is important not to allow rising GDP per capita in middle-income countries mask remaining underlying challenges – including rising inequality, weak social protection, poor infrastructures (particularly in urban areas), environmental degradation, and rising citizen expectations. Already, according to an Oxfam report, 85 billionaires have the same wealth as the bottom half of the world’s population. In 2012, 71% of the world’s population was reported to live in nations where income inequality is increasing. As well as stifling economic growth, inequality has a significant negative impact upon health and educational outcomes as well as security. These trends will shake some of the foundations around which our past approaches to programmes and conversations with the public were built. If we don’t address these and show how we will evolve then the sector itself could be broken. Over the next month the Global Development Professionals Network will be looking in more depth at these themes and their implications. Next Thursday’s live Q&A will be focused on how UK NGOs can face the challenges of the next 10 years. Email globaldevpros@guardian.co.uk to recommend experts for the panel.

"Governments across the world should make reducing food waste an urgent priority in order to save as much as £194bn annually by 2030, according to a report. Cutting food waste leads to greater efficiency, more productivity and higher economic growth, it said, but achieving such an aspiration would involve consumers cutting their own food and drink waste by as much as half.   One third of all food produced in the world ends up as waste, with food wasted by consumers globally valued at more than £259bn per year.  But that cost could soar to £388bn as the global middle class expands over the course of the next fifteen years, according to new figures from the UK government’s waste advisory body Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) for the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.  Their new report, ’Strategies to achieve economic and environmental gains by reducing food waste’, also identifies significant opportunities to improve economic performance and tackle climate change by reducing the amount of food that is wasted at various stages in the supply chain - in agriculture, transport, storage and consumption. It highlights how practical changes, such as lowering the average temperatures of refrigerators or designing better packaging, can make a big difference in preventing spoilage. Approximately 25% of food waste in the developing world could be eliminated with better refrigeration equipment.  In the UK, the most recent data from Wrap showed that households threw away seven million tonnes of food waste in 2012, enough to fill London’s Wembley Stadium nine times over. Avoidable household food waste in the UK is associated with 17 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. Reducing food waste worldwide can make a significant contribution to tackling climate change, the report said. It found waste is responsible for around 7% of all greenhouse gas emissions globally, 3.3bn tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) a year. Wrap estimates that emissions from food waste could cut by at least 0.2bn tonnes CO2e and possibly as much as 1 billion tonnes CO2e per year - more than the annual emissions of Germany.  Dr Richard Swannell, director of sustainable food systems at WRAP said: “Food waste is a global issue and tackling it is a priority. This report emphasises the benefits that can be obtained for businesses, consumers and the environment. The difficulty is often in knowing where to start and how to make the biggest economic and environmental savings.” Consumers had a vital role to play, he added: “In the UK, where we are based, the majority of food waste occurs in the home.” Helen Mountford, global programme director for the New Climate Economy, a programme of the commission, said: “Reducing food waste is good for the economy and good for the climate. Less food waste means greater efficiency, more productivity, and direct savings for consumers. It also means more food available to feed the estimated 805 million that go to bed hungry each day.  “Reducing food waste is also a great way to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. These findings should serve as a wakeup call to policymakers around the world.”"
