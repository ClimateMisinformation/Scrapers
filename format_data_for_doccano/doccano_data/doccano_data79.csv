Share this...FacebookTwitterOne reason for all the hysteria throughout Germany, and elsewhere, is because there are people out there who don’t know what they are talking about. Here’s an example: Cem Özdemir, a leader in Germany’s Green Party, said on national ARD television:

You know, we know the arguments. The arguments are not that new. At peak times, that is not in normal use times, then energy consumption is at a maximum in Germany around noon, between 11 and 12, we consume about 80 gigabytes, but we produce 140 gigabytes, that is about one and half times what we really need.”
Hey! My computer has a memory capacity of 2000 gigawatts.

And that’s why Germany doesn’t need any nuclear power, according to Özdemir.
Imagine if Sarah Palin had said such a thing. But because Cem Özdemir is a greenie, he gets away with it. Luckily this is on Youtube and so the networks can’t bury it. To be fair, Mr Özdemir appears to have been up all night, stoking the flames of hysteria, and so he can blame this gaffe on exhaustion.

Hat-tip: reader J. James
You’d think the Council would have its plate full with all the unrest in the Middle East, the real threats of terrorism, Iran, Afghanistan and global financial crises. Not Germany. The country prefers not to deal with these pressing problems, and chooses to ignore reality and make believe it is rescuing the planet from a fantasy destruction hundreds of years in the future, and hopes the world will regard it as some kind of action hero for it.
I’d regard such behaviour as not that of a hero, but of a mental patient. Worse, the lives of millions is in the hands of that mental patient.
Germany last held the Chairmanship in 2003 in the run-up to the Iraq war. So what urgent topic of debate has Germany decided to focus on in the midst of all the other world’s real crises? Sea level in the year 2200 of course! Deutsche Welle writes.
Every presidency holds an ‘open debate,’ and Germany has selected climate change as the topic of their debate. It will be about the security implications of climate change, said Ambassador Wittig.

“Key points of the debate will be about the rise of sea levels and the disappearance of entire states,” said Wittig. “From the United Nations 192 states, for the first time several states could completely disappear,” he added.
The issue is not exactly new, but fits in with Germany’s profile within the United Nations as a pioneer of environmental and climate protection.
Seriously, if you look at the sea levels, you see it would take hundreds of years before some coastal countries would begin to disappear. In fact sea levels are dropping at many locations.

Meanwhile terrorists are plotting now, today. Fortunately the chairmanship gets rotated to saner minds from time to time, and as Deutsche Welle writes:

Only a small portion of time will actually be dedicated to the issues specifically put forward by Germany.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere are lots of stories flying about, some quite wild. Here’s what the IAEA Director says.

The situation at the Fukushima power plant is very serious. Damage to the cores of the three units, unit 1, units 2 & 3, have been confirmed. There has been no serious change since yesterday. The cores remain uncovered, one to two meters. We do not know the exact situation inside the reactor vessels. But the pressure inside remains at about atmospheric pressure. This suggests that they remain largely intact.”

"The mainstream transatlantic left has been acting different lately. Having been subsumed into third-way politics for several decades, it seems we are growing back some teeth in our bite on the big systemic issues of today. From Labour calling for a national climate emergency, to prominent Democrat congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez declaring capitalism “irredeemable” – we are slowly unzipping ourselves from the straitjacket of incrementalist politics. The left has a new centre, and it’s not messing about. It is nonetheless critical to ground these struggles in their long history. Indeed, many post-independence struggles in the global south have been struggles against capitalism and the political and ecological injustices it produces. Take climate change. We are finally seeing something of a start to the kind of mass mobilisation and political will needed to rise to the challenge. Most importantly, Labour’s successful call to declare a national climate emergency marks a well overdue shift from the idea we can solve this by changing individual behaviours, in which climate change becomes the responsibility of working-class people who just need to behave themselves – eat less meat, use fewer plastic bags, have fewer kids. If real action follows, the move signifies promising recognition that this crisis requires rapid, large-scale political action and systemic change – and it is the companies and institutions responsible for the crisis that need to pay. However, alongside the hope, we also need to acknowledge we are miles away from where we need to be. While our political leadership has continually acted as if rising global inequality and conflict is merely bad management of an otherwise rational system, communities in the global south and indigenous populations have been giving their blood, sweat and tears to resist an economic system that puts profit above people and planet. Whether it’s Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was murdered in his struggle to break the political bond between Shell and the Nigerian government, or the 1977 Egyptian bread riots, in which hundreds were killed resisting the IMF-mandated neoliberalisation of the economy, the connection between capitalism as a system and its injustices is something the global majority is well-versed in. This isn’t limited to popular movements – governments across Latin America and the Pacific Islands have harboured an organised resistance to the manifold ways in which global capitalism poses an existential threat to the lives and livelihoods of millions. Many of these efforts have not only been ignored, but actively sabotaged by US and European state leaders. This history of resistance does not emerge from some kind mystic internal knowledge held by black and brown people. It is down to the material fact of white supremacy, which means the brutalities of neoliberalism have been felt in their most extreme by what we call “developing countries”. The IPCC report declaring us to be in “decade zero” was not a shock in Dominica, where a single hurricane set back development by a generation. Or in Pakistan, where the 2015 heatwave claimed 2,000 lives. 1.5C might seem like new science to us, but the chant “1.5C to stay alive” has been screamed from across the global south for years. However, a certain colonial mindset sees many of these struggles as heavily localised; as part of the pathological conflict of black and brown people, rather than politically salient movements we could do with learning from. And this can be seen in the framing of the US and UK as “leading” the fight against neoliberal capitalism and climate change. Not only is this historically wrong, but it risks sabotaging the very aims of our movement going forward. We certainly have a role in the urgent action required to face up to the crisis. We must contribute our fair share to the global effort to stay under 1.5C warming. This means no more incrementalism: it means immediately dismantling the neo-colonial role played by our energy companies throughout the world; contributing our fair share to the global transfer of wealth needed for mitigation programmes in the global south, and breaking the political bond between the City of London and the fossil fuel industry. It also means radically changing the role we play in global climate negotiations, which has historically been one of talking over those suffering the sharpest edge of climate chaos. These negotiations need to be democratised, legally binding and a space in which we listen, learn and then take action. This means understanding that any “Green New Deal” or “green industrial revolution” cannot be bound within our nation’s borders, or prioritise the wellbeing of westerners over black and brown lives in the rest of the world. As we make these moves towards climate emergency, it is important that progressives do not internalise the colonial principles that got us in this mess, either by simply ignoring the global historical context of resistance to emergency issues, or even actively arguing we should under-develop “Bombay” to deliver growth in Wigan. Indeed, the industrial revolution was financed and sustained by the blood money and infrastructure of slavery and colonialism; a “green” version of this is no better. By centring ourselves in the resistance to neoliberal capitalism and ecological crisis, we will likely repeat the mistakes of the past. A “green colonialism” or “socialist imperialism” is no victory worth claiming, and it is the default left position if we do not actively fight for a different vision. We must come into this space not as self-appointed leaders, but figures of solidarity. We are the last to join the party – let’s not behave once again like the world’s policeman and have it shut down before it’s even begun. • Dalia Gebrial is a PhD candidate at the London School of Economics, and an editor at Novara Media"
"As political leaders travel across Australia to deliver their election talking points in farms, factories and sports fields, they are criss-crossing a country in the grip of a rolling climate emergency. In the year leading up to the election on 18 May, huge swathes of eastern Australia have endured their worst droughts in a century. There have been apocalyptic scenes along the Murray Darling river system in which up to 1 million fish have died. In Queensland, floods have wiped out half a million cattle and bushfires have burned close to pristine rainforests. In the usually cool southern state of Tasmania more bushfires have raged across 190,000 hectares of land and devastated old-growth forests. Last year was Australia’s hottest year on record and as winter begins many of the country’s major cities are staring down the barrel of water restrictions with Sydney, Melbourne, Darwin and Brisbane all facing the prospect of dams at just 50% capacity. But on the campaign trail, through warming cities, blackened bush and scorched outback, the two contenders for prime minister are trumpeting starkly different messages about what, if anything, should be done to address the crisis. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, represents the ruling conservative Liberal party. The slogan-loving former head of Tourism Australia came to power after toppling his more moderate predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, in 2018. Morrison’s stance on climate change can be summed up by an address to parliament in 2017 while brandishing a lump of coal. In a speech supporting fossil fuels, he goaded the opposition: “Don’t be afraid. Don’t be scared. It won’t hurt you. It’s coal.” The idea that many in Morrison’s party consider climate change and its effects to be something to be laughed at is not hyperbole from the left. In 2015, the former prime minister Tony Abbott – who once called climate change “crap” – was caught on camera laughing at a joke about rising sea levels in the Pacific. In this election, the ruling Liberal and rural National Coalition – or “COALition” as they have been dubbed in attack ads – are pushing for a “climate solutions” fund that pays polluters to lower their emissions, with the aim of meeting Paris commitments of lowering emissions by 28%. The country’s environment minister, Melissa Price, has been labelled the “invisible minister”, notable for her absence at the sites of environmental calamities, and her refusal to meet environmental groups. The party is also embroiled in a scandal dubbed “Watergate” involving the $80m purchase of water from a company with links to the Cayman Islands that was co-founded by the energy minister. Morrison himself kickstarted a scare campaign based on the opposition’s ambitious electric car policy as a “war on the weekend”, suggesting that pick-up trucks, which are beloved by Australians, will become unaffordable. But in rural areas a number of high-profile Liberal and National party MPs are facing independent and minor party challenges on the climate, the conflict between farming and mining, and sheer anger at being ignored on water management, as well as integrity issues. Independents are also chipping away at the Liberal vote in cities. Meanwhile, the Labor party, which is leading in the polls by 52-48%, has promised significant action on climate change. In his speech launching Labor’s official campaign, the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, a former union man who has struggled with the perception that he is uncharismatic, said: “If we have the privilege to serve as the next government of Australia, I will not bring lumps of coal to parliament for a laugh while temperatures soar and bushfires rage and flood and drought batter our land.” Labor has made itself a “big target” in this election campaign, laying out a suite of policies including controversial tax reforms and the target of reducing emissions by 45% by 2030. Despite this, the party can’t bring itself to fully commit on climate change, and is refusing to say whether it would stop a highly controversial proposed coalmine that environmentalists say will threaten the Great Barrier Reef. Labor’s equivocation on the Adani project led the Australian Conservation Foundation to give the party a score of 56% on its environmental policies ahead of the election. The Liberal party scored just 4%. Meanwhile, the Greens, the fourth-largest party after the Liberals, Labor and the Nationals, was given a score of 99% by the ACF. The Greens have just one federal MP but are a force in the Australian Senate, with nine out of 76 senators. They are pushing for much more serious action on climate change, but have been accused of strategic blunders after they voted down Labor’s carbon pollution reduction scheme in 2009 on the grounds it did not go far enough, which helped hamstring Australian climate policy for a decade. Australians are acutely aware of the climate emergency. A poll conducted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation of more than 100,000 voters found that the environment was the number one issue for most respondents, with 29% rating it as their biggest concern, up from 9% in the 2016 election. Australian social researcher Rebecca Huntley said voters had started to connect the climate change debate with competent governance, or lack of it. “The focus on climate change comes and goes but there is always a foundational concern around air, water and soil that would unite most Australians no matter where they sit politically,” Huntley said. “Voters are searching for the party that can provide a pragmatic and tangible approach and they are asking whether the political system can deliver solutions.” The Wilderness Society’s federal policy director, Tim Beshara, agrees. “The public want action but the level of trust in government is low,” he said. “So if any political insiders still see the environment or climate as some inner-city non-core voter issue, then they are missing the wider view, which is that it’s an opportunity to demonstrate leadership, trustworthiness and competence.” Labor wants the election to become a great climate showdown. “On this issue,” Shorten has said, “perhaps above all others, the contrast and the case for change is night and day, black and white.” Morrison’s conservative government, meanwhile, is trying to frame this as an election about economic management, saying that a vote for Labor is “an economic leap in the dark”. “What is the cost to the economy?” Morrison asked Shorten about his party’s climate policy in their leaders’ debate. “I mean, if there is going to be a change … Australians deserve to know what is the cost of the change.” This is not the first Australian election in which climate change has been a defining issue, but last time did not work out well for those demanding action. Abbott rode to power in 2013 on a campaign of three-word slogans, promising to “Stop the boats” (of refugee arrivals) and “Scrap the tax” (repealing Australia’s cutting-edge carbon pricing scheme). Labor is hoping that Australia – burned from that experience – has moved on. "

"How long before the Europhobic tabloid press and the xenophobic Brextremists hold up the recent Uefa Champions League semi-finals results as irrefutable proof that European Goliaths are no match for plucky British Davids and the UK can show Johnny Foreigner what it’s like to be a world leader? However, before wrapping themselves even more tightly in the union flag, I do hope a brief glance at the winning players’ names and origins and those of their respective managers will bring them down to earth and explode the myth of British superiority in all things.

" Three of the largest ports in Europe – Rotterdam, Antwerp and Ghent – are to be used to capture and bury 10m tonnes of CO2 emissions under the North Sea in what will be the biggest project of its kind in the world. The ports, which account for one-third of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg region, are to be used to pipe the gas into a porous reservoir of sandstone about two miles (3km) below the seabed.  It is hoped the project could be completed by 2030 but the scale of the storage, in two empty gas fields, is unprecedented and raises questions about how the CO2 will affect the deep subsurface, according to the Dutch government. An application for EU project of common interest status for the development has been made, which would open the door to subsidies for building the network. The goal is to construct the CO2 network in the port of Rotterdam by 2026, with work then to be completed in the following four years on a cross-border pipeline to Antwerp and the North Sea port by Ghent. A further expansion beyond the initial 10m tonnes of C02 is expected after 2030. The total emissions of the business activities in the ports amount to more than 60m tons of CO2 a year. By comparison, the UK’s net carbon emissions last year came to 364 million tonnes The purpose of carbon capture is to aid the transition of industry towards the elimination of the burning of fossil fuels, and to help reach climate change targets set in the Paris agreement. The Dutch government is targeting a 49% reduction in emissions by 2030. Scientists in Belgium and the Netherlands have largely welcomed the plans. Prof Mark Saeys of Ghent University told De Morgen newspaper: “Of course I would prefer to see investments in renewable energy, but you have to be realistic: as long as we as a society remain dependent on fossil fuels, underground CO2 storage may be a crucial lever for achieving our climate targets.” The world’s first large-scale carbon storage project was developed in 1996 off the Norwegian coast, injecting nearly 1m tonnes a year into a space 800 to 1,100 metres beneath the seabed. But the development of carbon capture and storage has been stilted in Europe. In 2009, the European commission committed €1bn to finance six pilot projects with the hope of having 12 schemes up and running by 2015. Due to the high costs, none of the projects were developed. More than 70% of the 30m tons of CO2 captured annually by facilities for use or storage is captured in North America. The largest initiative in the world to date is the Petra Nova project in Texas, which was launched in 2017 and is attached to a coal-fired power station. It has an annual capture capacity of 1.4m tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of the emissions produced by 350,000 cars. The pipeline planned for the European ports project, known as Porthos, would have the capacity to transport 5m tonnes of CO2 a year."
"Scientifically, the life-threatening dangers of global warming in the Arctic are increasingly understood. But political understanding – and action – lag far behind. Attempts by Donald Trump to sabotage initiatives by Arctic Council countries, who meet in Finland this week, are a disgrace and must be vigorously resisted. The Arctic region is particularly sensitive to climate change and is warming roughly twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Observed effects include rapidly melting ice and permafrost, coastal erosion affecting indigenous communities, loss of habitat for polar bears and other animal and plant species and disrupted, extreme weather patterns. These negative effects are cyclical and felt globally, most obviously in rising sea levels. New research suggests the release of methane and carbon dioxide from thawing Arctic permafrost, combined with loss of heat-deflecting white ice, will greatly accelerate warming, add up to $70tn to climate-related costs and disproportionately affect poorer countries. United Nations experts predict that Arctic winter temperature rises of 3C to 5C above pre-industrial levels are now inevitable by mid-century, even with greenhouse gas emission cuts agreed in the 2016 Paris climate change accord. This has raised fears of a “tipping point” when warming becomes irreversible. “What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic,” said Joyce Msuya of the UN environment programme. Most members of the Arctic Council, a forum comprising Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and representatives of indigenous peoples, seem to accept urgent action is needed. But one member, the US, disagrees. American obstructionism now threatens to prevent meaningful progress on joint ameliorative measures. Trump officials have tried to block any mention of climate change in summit documents. The US also rejected any reference to the Paris agreement, which Trump, a notorious climate change denier, withdrew from in 2017. The American position reportedly softened after other countries strongly objected, but big questions remain over what the summit can actually achieve. Attempts within the US to overcome Trump’s pigheadedness have had mixed success. The latest National Climate Assessment, the work of 13 federal agencies and hundreds of scientists, warned “devastating” climate change could cost the economy $500bn a year by 2099. Last week, the House of Representatives voted to require the White House to adhere to the Paris accord. And an Alaska court has blocked Trump’s efforts to allow Arctic offshore oil and gas drilling. But Trump is not budging. He said he “did not believe” his own government’s climate assessment. The Democrats’ House resolution has little chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate. And the White House is pushing back, unveiling a new strategy to challenge the scientific consensus that fossil fuels are the leading cause of climate change and pose growing security, economic and health threats. Yet even as he denies climate change, Trump wants US businesses to exploit Arctic resources, including vast oil and gas reserves, which is only possible due to thawing ice and increased accessibility. It’s a prospective bonanza that Russia and China also eye greedily. There is even talk of a “polar Silk Road” as part of Beijing’s Belt and Road trade initiative. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state and climate change sceptic who will attend the Finland summit, has other priorities. Last week, his spokesman warned China, which has Arctic Council observer status, to keep out. What most worries Pompeo and the Pentagon is increasing Chinese (and Russian) investment – and expanding military bases – not a drowning, dying planet. Intensifying great power competition in the Arctic is a foolish distraction from incomparably more urgent global climate concerns. Arctic Council members must stand up this week. They should tell the US to get real – or get lost."
"A devastating new UN report shows the planet is in serious danger from the accelerating decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems. Here we look at 10 of the key points from the report – and their relevance for Australia.  More than one million plant and animal species are now threatened with extinction, including 40% of all amphibian species, 33% of reef-forming corals and a third of all marine animals. Terrestrial native species have declined in abundance by 20% since 1990, and 690 vertebrate species have gone extinct since the 16th century. Australia alone has lost 27 species of mammal in just over 200 years of colonisation. If unchecked, loss of biodiversity could lead to the collapse of entire ecosystems. “We are eroding the very foundation of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health, and quality of life worldwide,” the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services chair, Sir Robert Watson, said. Modern agricultural practices have seen the diversity of species grown for human consumption narrowed to the most productive varieties. Those varieties are used in place of local species that were farmed previously. As of 2016, 559 of the 6,190 domesticated breeds of mammals used for agriculture were extinct and a further 1,000 are threatened. Wild relatives of domestic crop species are also under threat. The report said this “poses a serious risk to global food security by undermining the resilience of many agricultural systems to threats such as pests, pathogens, and climate change.” Nature is declining less rapidly in land that is owned or managed by Indigenous peoples, but it is still declining due to competing interests including mining and unsustainable agriculture and fishing. About 25% of all land globally is traditionally owned, managed, used or occupied by Indigenous peoples, including 35% of all formally protected areas and 35% of all remaining terrestrial areas with very low human intervention. The report found that despite Indigenous peoples “proactively confronting” problems of both climate change and habitat loss, regional and global plans to combat biodiversity loss and climate change do not make use of Indigenous knowledge. It recommends promoting Indigenous knowledge and land management systems in drafting the global and regional response to looming environmental threats. About 40% of Australia’s land mass is formally recognised either under native title or land rights laws. According to the UN, we need to bump that number up. Promoting Indigenous governance and self-determination through the recognition of land tenure is a global recommendation from the report. Doing so will promote positive contributions of Indigenous peoples and local communities to sustainability. Restoring native ecosystems is an “indispensable” part of both staving off mass extinction and mitigating the effects of climate change, but what is good for one may harm the other. The report warns that reforestation of cleared or previously un-forested areas, as well as large-scale bioenergy plantations, risks establishing monocultures. That is bad for biodiversity, could threaten food and water security, undermine local jobs and “intensify social conflict”, the report said. Scientists have already warned of a version of this occurring in Victoria’s central highlands, where Mountain Ash forests continue to be logged at what experts warn is an unsustainable rate. If logging continues that ecosystem is projected to collapse by 2067 and potentially be replaced by an open acacia woodland, with dire consequences for several threatened species and the security of Melbourne’s water supply. Urban areas have doubled globally since 1992. In Australia, one of the fastest growing areas is in western Melbourne, where 55% of the 1,200 native plant species in the remaining grasslands are under threat of extinction in the next 100 years. The report recommends maintaining green spaces or green wedges in the city as wildlife corridors and cleaning up metropolitan waterways is a key measure to protect biodiversity in urban areas. It also recommends promoting rooftop gardens, urban agriculture movements, and expanding native vegetation cover in both existing urban and peri-urban areas and in new developments. More than one-third of the world’s land surface and nearly three-quarters of all available freshwater resources are devoted to crop or livestock production. Crop production occurs on about 12% of all ice-free land worldwide, and grazing on 25% of total ice-free land and 70% of drylands — which includes all of Australia. The report recommends measures including protecting wetland biodiversity areas, limiting the expansion of unsustainable agriculture and mining, reversing the de-vegetation of catchment areas, reducing fertiliser use that causes polluted run-off, and minimising the negative impact of dams. It also recommends investing in water efficiency measures – in Australia that would include converting open irrigation channels to closed pipelines – as well as encouraging the use of household rainwater collections. Economic incentives traditionally reward business practices that deliver strong economic returns, often at the price of environmental harm, over those that promote conservation or restoration. By getting rid of environmentally harmful subsidies and promoting economic incentives that measure value in environmental and social terms, as well as economic terms, we would increase sustainable land and sea management. That move will be opposed by vested interests, the report says, but will promote better outcomes. Half of the live coral cover in the world has been lost since the 1870s and that loss has accelerated in recent decades, notably in the Great Barrier Reef. If global temperatures increase by 1.5C coral reef cover is expected to decline again, to 10-30% of former levels. In a 2C future coral reef cover will be just 1% of what it was before the industrial revolution. Losing the reefs will increase the risk of floods and hurricanes impacting between 100 million and 300 million people who live in 100-year coastal flood zones. The only way to stave off this damage is to keep climate change below 2C. That includes setting quotas, protecting key marine biodiversity areas, and reducing pollution from run-off. About 33% of global fish stocks are overfished while only 7% are under-fished. The companies and profits behind industrial fishing are concentrated in a few countries but cover 55% of the oceans, mainly in the northern hemisphere. We need to develop legally binding global agreements for responsible fisheries and urgently work towards eliminating illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing."

This video is the work of Kilez More, see http://www.kilezmore.com/.  The politically misfitted rapper in the video tells us that warmist climate science is a hoax, is all about money and control, and that the science is cooked up at the CRU and other institutes. I don’t know who is behind the video – could even be some renegade fringe types, who knows.
So are the youth turning against the Great Hoax? Looks that way.
I took a shot at translating the German lyrics in English below (first 2 parts only!). Of course you lose some doing that, and you can’t get the rhymes in. My English version below is only to give non-German readers and listeners the gist of the lyrics. Readers are welcome and urged to improve it.
Kilez More – Climate Change Lyrics in English)
You thinking of climate change and you’re screaming for laws
You’re thinking about CO2 and saying “let’s stop it”
Global catastrophes happening all because of man
We did too much driving, now the planet is too warm
If we don’t do something soon then the ice will melt
A flood is gonna kill us and the future’s gonna fall
No it aint…I’m telling you you’re off the wall
Man aint causing climate change, yeah you
think I’m crazy and making no sense
But just look at the climate institutes and you’ll see
what they do, they’re fudging the data making it hot

We aint done a thing, history shows us so
History books show in 1100 the planet was warm
In North England people were pickin grapes and making wine
And that wasn’t because of factories run by knights and
The shield industry driving the climate up
Then in sixteen hundred the Baltic froze over and it
Wasn’t because they stopped CO2 with ‘reform’
That’s pure arrogance when man thinks he’s got the power
To control the whole climate on the entire globe
Truth is only 1 to 3 percent comes from man
Comes from processes that are natural – so they’re lying
Inside the brainless walls of these fear-mongering crackpots
They want more power, more money, more control, more global tax
And every skeptic is getting branded by them
Being defamed and compared to Holocaust deniers

"The US is a hotbed of climate science denial when compared with other countries, with international polling finding a significant number of Americans do not believe human-driven climate change is occurring. A total of 13% of Americans polled in a 23-country survey conducted by the YouGov-Cambridge Globalism Project agreed with the statement that the climate is changing “but human activity is not responsible at all”. A further 5% said the climate was not changing. Only Saudi Arabia (16%) and Indonesia (18%) had a higher proportion of people doubtful of manmade climate change. Americans were also more likely than any other western country polled to say they did not know whether the climate was changing or people were responsible – a total of 13% said this. But despite these views, the great majority of US citizens do accept the science of climate change, with nearly four in 10 saying human activity was at least partly responsible, potentially with other factors, and a further third taking the stronger view that human activity is the dominant cause. The project is a new annual survey of global attitudes in 23 of the world's biggest countries, covering almost 5 billion people.  The 2019 survey canvassed 25,325 people online across much of Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia in February and March.  Questions about populist attitudes and convictions were inserted in order to derive a ""populist cohort"", and discover what this group of people think about major world issues from immigration to vaccination, social media and globalisation. The full methodology can be found here.  Scientists overwhelmingly agree that people are causing climate change through the exponential increase of greenhouse gas emissions over the years. Global emissions are still rising, and the last four years have been the hottest since records began. Last October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of the world’s leading climate scientists, warned of the dire consequences of continued global warming, indicating the window of opportunity for action had narrowed to as little as 12 years. A global movement of young people calling for action has sprung up as a result, spearheaded by the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, giving way in London to a more feisty display of street protest orchestrated by the Extinction Rebellion group. In the US, street protests have been less visible but the political landscape around climate change has been transformed by the Green New Deal, an effort by the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to spur a second world war-level mobilisation to stem the increasingly severe hurricanes and wildfires that are racking the country. This week a UN global assessment report, compiled over three years by more than 450 scientists and diplomats, warned that a million species are at risk, largely as a result of human actions that are accelerating the decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems at an alarming rate. But wider denial of climate science is down to a concerted campaign of misinformation by fossil fuel interests and aspects of American character, according to Margaret Klein Salamon, a clinical psychologist who founded the advocacy group Climate Mobilization. “The Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry have put billions of dollars into lying to the American public, even sending literature to science teachers in schools,” Salamon said. “They are so well organised and have managed to turn climate change into a controversial subject that gets shut down. It’s clearly working. “There is also the issue of American individualism, remnants of manifest destiny, that don’t set us up well for understanding that we are part of the web of life. The American dream is quite self-involved. We need a new American dream.” Americans also appear unusually prone to climate-related conspiracy theories, the YouGov data suggests. A total of 17% of those polled agreed that “the idea of manmade global warming is a hoax that was invented to deceive people”. Belief in this conspiracy theory, which was previously invoked by Donald Trump, who falsely claimed climate change was made up by China, increases with age and also conservative political ideology. A total of 52% of Americans who described themselves as “very rightwing” to YouGov insisted global warming was a hoax.  In Europe, fewer than one in 10 people across the major countries surveyed thought the climate was not changing or not changing owing to human activity, with only Poland showing a slightly higher number, with 12% taking one of these views. In the UK, the public’s appetite for stronger action on climate change appears to have increased markedly in the past few weeks alone, after this polling was carried out. The Extinction Rebellion mass protests have met with broad support, and the youth activist Thunberg was greeted by senior politicians, including the Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the environment secretary, Michael Gove. Last week the UK government’s statutory adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, recommended ways in which the UK could reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by mid-century, and the UK parliament voted that the world was in a state of “climate emergency” and that action must be taken accordingly. Individuals often shrug that there is little they can do on their own – but the YouGov survey found people are already examining their own shopping habits for environmental reasons. A clear majority of those surveyed across all countries took the view that it was fairly or very important to buy ethical goods made in socially and environmentally responsible ways. Perhaps surprisingly, support for ethical shopping was weakest in Germany, with only 54% of people regarding ethical shopping as important, while 40% of people in the UK and the US viewed it as unimportant. The YouGov polling data, published exclusively by the Guardian, shows a clear majority of people around the world think climate change is happening and that it is all or partly down to human actions. Though holdouts still remain, particularly among people with self-described very rightwing political views – a third of whom either took a sceptical stance or said they did not know when asked about climate change – there appears a mandate in this data for politicians to take a bolder approach to dealing with global warming, said Wendel Trio, the director of Climate Action Network Europe, a civil society group. “Poll after poll confirms that there is a large majority of citizens who recognise that climate change is happening and is manmade,” said Trio. “Citizens expect governments to act and reduce our negative impact on the climate. Governments have the obligation to drastically increase emission reductions and protect their citizens from climate disasters.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal temperatures continue their overall stagnation that has taken hold over the last decade or so, and have plummeted over the last three months, defying the global warming alarmists predictions of a temperature spiral as CO2 emissions continue to rise.
Roy Spencer just released the UAH MSU March global lower troposphere temperature data. Here’s the trend over the last 10 years for sea surface temperature:

 Co2 driving the climate is a joke, a ruse – tantamount to saying Mexico drives the world economy. Sure it is a factor, but a small one. When I look at all the people running around with CO2 reduction as their new religion, I just shake my head. Duped! What a con-job.
This brings up our Climate Bet here with warmist Rob Honeycutt, who boldly bet $5000 that the 2011-2020 decade will be even warmer than the previous 2001-2010 decade. So far the first three months of the new decade are slam dunks for the COOLIST column, and have opened up an early lead 3 – o.
YR MON GLOBAL NH SH TROPICS
2011 01 -0.010 -0.055 0.036 -0.372
2011 02 -0.020 -0.042 0.002 -0.348
2011 03 -0.099 -0.073 -0.126 -0.345
The status of the bet has not changed since the last update here.
Sure there are still another 117 months to go before the bet is concluded, but I’m not in hurry for these months to pass by. So far ocean cycles are showing that they run the place, and not a trace gas. As the negative PDO takes hold and AMO heads south, more cooling is in the pipeline. The weak solar cycle also bodes ill for the warmists.
That cracking noise you hear is not the spring ice beaking up – it’s the sound of AGW science breaking apart.

"Labor will promise to overhaul environmental protection law and establish a National Environment Protection Authority, as Bill Shorten and Scott Morrison resume campaigning after the second leaders’ debate in Brisbane on Friday night. Green groups and the internal Labor environmental action group Lean have been pressing Labor to make a specific election commitment on the regulatory overhaul, which was first flagged by Shorten at last year’s national conference. After some pre-event controversy, Shorten committed last December to introduce a new Australian environment act and create a commonwealth environmental protection agency if Labor wins the election. There was concern Labor could pull back from those undertakings under pressure from business concerned about more stringent environmental hurdles, but on Saturday Shorten will make a $50m commitment to the new regulatory framework, a $100m commitment for a new native species protection fund and also allocate $62m to tackle coastal erosion and prepare the coastline for the impact of climate change. This week Shorten has gone on the offensive over climate change, declaring Australian politics is “broken” because the parliament has been unable to rise to the challenge of delivering credible policy. On Friday the Coalition promised $203m to increase recycling, reduce waste and protect threatened species and waterways. Public debate about the adequacy of the environmental protection framework was sparked after a rushed environmental approval for the controversial Adani coal project, which the Morrison government ticked off just before calling the election. Labor initially seemed to be making the case that it would review the groundwater approval, but Shorten has pulled back, saying there are “no plans” to go down that path. Environment groups pointed to the groundwater approval as evidence that the regulatory framework needs an overhaul. The national convener of Lean, Felicity Wade, told Guardian Australia she was satisfied with the election commitments. “Australians want a prosperous future but also a safe one, and we want the beauty and ease of our unique natural environment to be looked after by government. “The Coalition has handed it all to big business to do as they please but Labor will ensure private interests can’t destroy our shared natural legacy. Better laws and better oversight will deliver this,” she said. Shorten delivered the commitments at national conference in response to a concerted lobbying effort by Lean. The policy shift was endorsed by 498 local party branches before the national conference, and since the conference 77 branches have passed a motion calling on the party to deliver “a full election policy announcement to underpin this major reform as a high priority for the first term of a Labor federal government”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve noticed that German skeptic sites who were vigorously publicizing the rap video (here with English lyrics) yesterday (like Achse des Gutens) have abandoned ship today, and removed the story. I’m told that Kilez More is indeed very controversial, and is into all sorts of crazy conspiracy theories, and thus ought to be avoided. Tell me which artist isn’t!

Kilez More is a very young man who is obviously going through a growing-up stage – one that many people go through at one time or another in their lives, especially in their late teens and early 20s. It’s a stage of rebellion and questioning. That’s what most young people do.

He also has the talent of rap, and so is using it to express his doubts and to question society – just as many artists do. He provokes. Oh the crime of being young! What the warmists are trying to do is to suppress his questioning – asserting authority and insisting the discussion is over. It’s a shame even the skeptics have turned their backs on him. It’s a tune by a rapper, and nothing more.
Of course I probably don’t agree with most of More’s ideas (haven’t looked into them) but I do agree that he has the right to pose questions, especially about climate science, and that his encouraging young people to ask questions is correct. He makes climate assertions. Let his viewers hear them, and let them make up their own minds. Maybe he is wrong on every other subject. So what!
The only wrong questions are the ones that never get asked.
His Climate Swindle video is only telling young people to be careful, and to look deeper into the issues before accepting them at face value. Claims to authority aren’t good enough. That’s important. Young people eventually will do their own research and decide for themselves what the truth is. I haven’t looked at the content of his other music videos – no doubt some may be very controversial – but that’s another discussion.
Questioning authority cannot and must not be criminalized, and must not be a right that is exclusively reserved for a few. 
I get the feeling he is increasingly being viewed as a dangerous man for doing just that. The attempt to shut him up will backfire. Keep rapping, Kilez – they’re scared.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSometimes the old wisdom turns out to be the better one – that is wisdom from the analog world, during a time when there were neither bits nor bytes, nor model calculations to explain the world to people. One of these wisdoms is: The search for missing persons using concentric circles around the last known position. Had the French aviation authority BEA followed the old wisdom, the wreckage of Air France Flight 447 would have been located within just a few weeks after it crashed off the Brazilian coast on June 1, 2009.”
This is how an online story here appearing in Germany’s flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) began its story on the recent discovery of the wreckage of doomed Air France Flight 447, an Airbus 330-200 with 228 on board, which crashed into the ocean en route to Paris – almost 2 years ago.
Hat tip NTZ reader: Marcus K
So why did it take so long to find the wreckage in the Atlantic Ocean, in an area where the water is 4000 meters deep? The FAZ explains why. Instead of using the old concentric circle search method, authorities opted to rely on mathematical models from oceanographers and mathematicians. The result: they searched in the wrong area for almost 2 years.
In this case here, claiming the methodology was flawed but the answer is correct isn’t going to wash. Officails still don’t know why Flight 447 crashed. To find out, it is important to recover the flight data recorder. The sooner it is found, the quicker you can find the cause of the crash and implement possibly crucial technical modifications to the rest of the fleet in order to prevent the accident from happening again.
Unfortunately in this case, although the plane was found just recently, almost 2 years time was wasted – thus possibly put passengers in subsequent flights at needlessly higher risk.
The FAZ story writes that once a plane crashes, the flight recorder’s beacon sends out a signal for 30 days to make it easier to pinpoint its location. Already on June 10, 2009, an entire fleet of ships was searching an area, one was even equipped with Towed Pinger Locator, but there was no success. After 30 days, i.e. around July 1st, the flight recorder’s power ran out and the signal stopped. The first attempt to find the wreckage failed.
A second search attempt began on July 27, 2009, and included a French oceanography ship of the Ifremer Research Institute which used an ROV to search the ocean depths. But that search attempt also ended in failure on August 17, 2009.

Computer models send searchers on a wild goose chase
So what next? According to the FAZ (emphasis added):
Still in the summer of 2009, the French BEA contracted renowned oceanographers and mathematicians from France, Great Britain, USA and Russia to calculate the probable crash area. The task was to back-calculate the drift of the bodies and pieces of the wreckage that had been found north of the Last Known Position (LKP) on June 6, and trace it back to the time-point of the crash, taking currents, wind and waves into consideration. The highly complex calculations of the Drift Group were then summed up in a 2000 sq km probable crash area and presented in January 2010. The calculated area extended 60 km north of the last known position [LKP]. The 3rd phase of the search began on April 2, 2010.
This calculated search area is shown on the diagram, click here. Note how the mathematical computer model calculation produced an area all around where the wreckage was actually located. The last known position (LKP) is denoted by the green dot. The actual site of the wreckage is marked with an “X” and is only 10 km from the LKP!  The initial search area of 2009 is denoted by the light blue box at the top of the graphic. Finally, the computer modelled mathematical calculated search area is denoted by Phase 3.
Needless to say, the models sent the rescue efforts on a wild goose chase from April 2 to May 24 2010. The computer-model guided Phase 3, too, ended in failure.
Eventually, it wasn’t until officials had spent €30 million and almost 2 years time (and gotten a stroke of luck) that they were able to claim success in late March 2011. The French Marine had placed electronic buoys and monitored them for weeks and found out that currents behaved unpredictably and changed very often. The modelers had made wrong assumptions.
They couldn’t even model a 2000 sq km area for 5 days
Keep in mind that the modellers here only had to calculate the dynamics of one grid cell on the planet – and that for only a period of 5 days – and not the entire planet for 100 years (which climate modellers now claim they can do). A relatively small area for a only few days – and they still got it all wrong! (I’m not making fun of the mathematicians here – I’m just saying the task is extremely complex, and so you have take results cautiously).
This really ought to be a lesson for people and policymakers who rely on computer models to tell them what the climate is going to be like for the entire planet 10, 50 or 100 years into the future. Folks, it’s nothing more than wild guessing.

"The Greens have hailed a “phenomenal” set of local election results in which the party has so far gained nearly 90 seats, including some in distinctly non-traditional Green areas such as in north-east England. In another sign of a shift away from the major parties, independent councillors gained more than 300 council seats. However, even with Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party not represented, Ukip lost the majority of its councillors.  The Green co-leader Jonathan Bartley said that while the party had been building gradually in many of the areas where it gained new councillors, it had also benefited from pro-remain sentiment and from the recent prominence of global warming protests. With 148 of 248 councils fully tallied, the party had won 108 councillors, an increase of 86 on 2015. The Greens had done well in 2015, in contrast to the other big winner in Thursday’s elections, the Liberal Democrats, whose gains came after terrible results four years ago. The 2015 poll was held on the same day as a general election in which the Greens won more than 1m votes, 3.8% of the total. Bartley’s co-leader, Siân Berry, said the party had won its first councillors in areas not seen as traditionally Green areas, including South Tyneside, Sunderland, Colchester, Folkestone and the Cotswolds.  “We’ve broken through on to the councils to become the new voice,” she told BBC News. “We’ve done that through hard work, basically. I can pretty confidently say we’re going to have a record number of Greens on a record number of councils.” In Sunderland, the Greens defeated Labour in Washington South. In South Tyneside, the party crushed Labour as its candidate took more than two-thirds of the vote to become the first Green member of the council. Bartley called it “a phenomenal set of results so far”. He told the Guardian that the gains came from a combination of concerted local efforts coupled with a boost from both the Brexit impasse and the prominence of climate change issues after the Extinction Rebellion protests and the young Swedish activist Greta Thunberg’s UK visit. “You can clearly see the result of that work, but also there has clearly been a natural lift in results, which helps,” he said. “You’ve got that underlying groundwork, but also that few percent on top of that because of Brexit and climate.” On Brexit, Bartley said, the Greens were also tapping into “what underlies the Brexit vote, which was that anger of neglect and people not listening, and the safe seats which never changed hands”. But he acknowledged there was also a direct benefit to the party from disgruntled remain-minded Labour supporters switching sides. He said: “That’s undoubtedly true. We’ve had 2,000 new members in April, and a lot of them were former Labour supporters. It’s the focus on climate, the anti-austerity approach and being unequivocally pro-remain – and that kind of trinity is unique, there’s no one else doing it.” In contrast, it was shaping up to be a terrible election for Ukip, which was fighting only 16% of all seats, against 44% in 2015. It had so far lost 71 councillors, winning only 18 seats. Independents, with their haul of more than 300 seats, more than doubled their combined numbers across councils."

"4 April, 1.35pm As the Twin Otter plane engines roar into action, the familiar sound triggers a tingle of excitement in my stomach: I’m out on fieldwork.  We are the European Space Agency (ESA) land ice ground team. Our goal is to make measurements of the snow density and layering on the Greenland ice sheet. We will use the data to validate satellite altimetry measurements of the ice sheet surface, to improve the accuracy with which we can monitor how it has changed over time. As we take off from Ilulissat airport, looking out of the plane I can see a mess of broken icebergs and sea ice in the ocean. Small fishing vessels are dotted around in Disko Bay, leaving a trail of white frothy ocean in their wake. The boats are dwarfed by the vast size of the giant icebergs that surround them, and serve as a permanent reminder that “normal” life in this part of the world sits at the extreme edge of where humans can live. We were grounded in Ilulissat for three days before leaving because of a storm passing through. It’s normal to have bad storms in April, but none of us expected rain so early in the spring. A local dog sled owner I spoke to said that he had never seen it rain in Greenland at this time of year. Rain is just temporary weather and shouldn’t be mistaken for longer-term more permanent climate change. However, records from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) show that the frequency of abnormally warm temperatures in Ilulissat is increasing, so rain storms such as the one we experienced are further evidence that the polar regions are changing rapidly. 4 April, 3pm Time on the ice is limited today. We waited on standby all morning hoping for the wind speed to lower enough for us to take off, and for satellite images to show the cloud clearing up on the ice sheet. Weather delays can pull the plug on the best laid plans at any moment. Now in the air, crammed in between the radar and ice coring kit (essential for our scientific experiments), a heap of down jackets, boxes of Icelandic chocolate bars and the spare fuel tank, we plan our time carefully. Our field site is located next to Jakobshavn Isbrae, the fastest glacier in the world, which satellites have shown is thinning at a rate of over 20 meters per year at its terminus. That’s ice the height of a five-storey building, lost every year. 4 April, 4.30pm As the plane touches down, we bounce over hard sasstruggi, and special skis fixed around the wheels prevent us from sinking into the snow. These snow “dunes” are formed by persistent winds blowing the snow into sculpted ridges. The moment we land, a blast of cold dry air hits us and our breath is immediately visible, growing in clouds around us. It’s -36C outside, but there is barely any wind so it’s a beautiful day for ice coring. Ines, our PhD researcher, starts the magnaprobe experiment, using an instrument that measures the depth of the very top snow layer. She looks like a hi-tech ghostbuster, walking around the site with the backpack on and a large probe. For Ines, this campaign is particularly exciting as it’s her first time on an ice sheet, but this will be my fifth trip. As with every research project I work on, our team is an international group of scientists from France, the UK, Denmark, Brazil, Portugal, Italy and the US. We only have an hour on the ground, so Sebastian Bjerregaard Simonsen,a colleague from the Danish Technical University,and I work together as a slick team, systematically drilling down through the ice sheet roughly 80 centimetres at a time, then hauling the heavy drill out of the ground. As we huddle round the barrel to push the section of core out, we are both excited to see the layers of snow and ice revealed for the first time. The ice core looks like layers of a cake, with thicker opaque white sections of snow interspersed with thinner layers of water ice. The thickness of the layers isn’t even, and it tells us a story about warm melt events that have taken place over the last 10 years on the Greenland ice sheet. 4 April, 5.30pm Just as we hit our target depth of seven metres for the ice core, the airborne team overfly us, collecting radar measurements of the snow layering. With all the experiments successfully completed, we fly back to Akureyri. 4 April, 7.30pm As dusk turns to night we touch down at Constable Point on the east coast of Greenland for the final refuelling stop before heading back to Iceland. We will be analysing the ice cores through the night. Once the cores are pulled up from the ground it’s a race against time to collect the measurements we need before these long tubes of ice start to melt. There are no freezers big enough to preserve the intact cores so we have to burn the midnight oil. 5 April, 5am By sunrise the next morning we are all wide-eyed and exhausted, but it’s a small price we are happy to pay. The future most likely holds extreme change for our planet’s environment, and the polar regions are already evolving rapidly. The data we have gathered on this campaign will be used to improve how satellites measure changes in the ice sheets. This data is critical as it is currently the only method we have of monitoring sea levels in Greenland, and are used for flood defence planning along coastlines around the world. It’s a privilege to be in the field contributing to that understanding first hand. Anna Hogg is a research fellow in the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds"
"Some want a clear conscience. Others want to see if they are up to the challenge. But none of them want to wait until 2050 to cut their carbon emissions down to near-zero. Across the country, environmentalists of all ages – from seven to 75 – are taking action now to lead low-carbon lives.  Last week, the government’s official advisory body, the Committee on Climate Change, recommended that the UK set a legally binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. The committee’s report acknowledged that cutting emissions to zero would be challenging and spell the end of petrol and diesel cars, as well as gas boilers. To achieve this target, people will have to fly less, waste less and eat less meat. But many people are already living like this, and some are even doing so in eco “superhomes” – houses which have been adapted to achieve a 60% or more reduction in carbon usage. The Observer spoke to three residents to find out how they have adapted their homes and their lives to reduce carbon emissions. “My husband Chris and I are Quakers. Eleven years ago, we downsized to a semi-detached house in Bournville. To make our new home energy efficient, we insulated as much as we could – even under the floorboards. We installed double glazing and put solar panels on a pergola in the garden. In total, we’ve reduced our home’s carbon emissions by 85%. We open the house to show people what we’ve done. Our diet is now 60% to 70% vegan, and the remainder vegetarian. We grow a lot of our fruit and vegetables on our allotment. We eat seasonally and I bake my own bread. Even though we own a car, we rarely drive and try to walk as much as we can or take the bus. We avoid flying, preferring to travel by train. We mend our clothes and furniture. When I feel I need to buy something, I try to get it from a charity shop, borrow it from a neighbour or ask for it on Freecycle or Freegle, where people advertise things they want to get rid of. We bank with Triodos Bank. It costs us a few pounds each month, but it means we know our money will be used for ethical and sustainable purposes, not fossil fuel exploration or companies.  I feel guilty about what people of my generation have done. I don’t want to leave behind a damaged world for my four grandchildren. But I think what really drove me to make changes was wanting to see just how sustainable we could make our lives now. It has been an enjoyable challenge, educating myself and adapting my lifestyle. It’s fun.” “I’m disabled and live with my parents Pat, 66, and John, 71, in a 1958 bungalow. We’ve done the obvious things like changing our boiler, adding insulation and installing solar panels but we’ve also taken some more unusual steps to lower our carbon emissions. For example, we’ve converted a chest freezer into a fridge, using a gadget that cuts the power once it reaches a certain temperature. The cold air doesn’t fall out like it did with our previous front-opening fridge, so it uses half the electricity. We charge our electric car with our solar panels and, on sunny days, we use a ‘sun oven’ to cook outside – it uses mirrors to concentrate the heat and it’s a real joy, eating a meal or cake baked with just sunshine. We also use a method called haybox cooking to cook inside: bringing a soup to boil and then putting it in an insulated box for an hour or two. It carries on cooking in its own heat, saving fuel. The waste water from our sink drains into our toilet cistern, so we reuse the water the next time we flush the toilet. All our vegetables are seasonal, grown either in our garden or on a local organic farm. My meals are 80% vegan, and 20% vegetarian. Vegan food is delicious – it’s a cuisine. I try to reuse and repair my belongings. I use the money I save to spend more on products I do buy. My clothes are either secondhand or organic. I have a Fairphone – it’s designed so that the individual parts can be easily replaced when they break. I don’t buy wrapping paper, I reuse an old duvet cover I cut up into squares. In total, we’ve reduced our home’s carbon emissions by 93%. I’ve enjoyed making all these changes – they’ve been fun – and I feel part of a big movement. I want to be able to say to the next generation: I tried to prevent runaway climate change. If I didn’t, I would feel I was committing a wrong.”  “My wife and I have two kids: Anouk, 12 and Laurie, seven. We used to live on a boat. Ten years ago, we moved into a freezing cold 1920s terraced house in Shepherd’s Bush. Straightaway, we started converting it – I did a lot of the work myself. I insulated it and added energy efficient windows, electric underfloor heating and an air-source heat pump. I also installed solar panels and a battery bank. This provides most of the energy our family needs all year round. We increased our energy efficiency by nearly 70%. I reckon we must be saving £1,000 a year on our energy bills. We buy organic food from Lidl, grow our own fruit using harvested rainwater and have cut down the amount of meat and dairy we eat, saving us about £60 a month. Our kids love vegetables and vegetarian meals, because they’ve always had them. Our favourite family meal is pea soup. We all enjoy shopping in second-hand clothes shops and getting bargains for £2, but the children do shop at Primark too, and will sometimes eat at McDonald’s and buy plastic toys or electric gadgets. We don’t try to restrict them. We just try to recycle and repair, and promote a green lifestyle. They do get a bit fed up of me preaching about renewable energy, but at the same time, I know they feel very strongly about climate catastrophe. I’m not just doing this for my kids and my community. I’m also doing it for myself. I want to be able to say, in the future: I have not taken part in the destruction of this planet. I can’t make a massive difference alone. But I can help a little and that’s what I’m doing. So when there are water shortages one day and floods the next, storms, heatwaves and bug infestations, when we are living in a horror movie in 10 or 20 years time, I will have a clear conscience.”"
"The former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams has welcomed an “urgent change” by Cambridge University, after it agreed to provide fully costed plans setting out how it could divest multibillion-pound endowments from fossil fuel corporations. The university’s management accepted a motion, known as a grace, which urged Cambridge to “set out fully the advantages and disadvantages, including the social and political ones”, of divestment from global coal, oil and gas companies. The grace, agreed without adjustments by management, follows an escalating campaign by staff and students concerned about Cambridge’s financial backing for the fossil fuel industry. Williams said: “It is an important message to our own society and national institutions, but also to all those vulnerable populations across the world who are most at risk from climate change; and it is good to see that clear and focused advocacy in the university has produced so welcome and urgent a change.” The grace was signed by 324 academics, which campaigners said represented one of the largest totals in the university’s history. The academic and Green party MEP candidate Jeremy Caddick, who helped push the motion, said: “Two years ago, we asked the university to divest from fossil fuels. Since then, the administration has done everything it can to avoid the question, so I am delighted that the council have accepted this latest grace.” This year, Clare Hall, the college of the vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Toope, became the latest to commit to fully divest funds from fossil fuels. The college also said it would withdraw money invested in the university’s £3.2bn central fund if it did not divest within five years. Awareness of the scale of the ecological crisis has been growing. Last month, more than 1,000 people were arrested during civil disobedience protests across London. Last week, parliament became the latest body to declare a climate emergency. And on Monday, a UN report detailed the urgent threat to human society from the loss of Earth’s natural life. Campaigners say Cambridge is too closely entwined with the fossil fuel industry. In January, the Guardian revealed the university had been offered two multimillion-pound donations from global fossil fuel corporations at the same time it was considering calls to divest its endowment fund. The author and Cambridge academic Robert Macfarlane said it was time for the university to act with urgency. “It is good news that Cambridge has at last accepted the need to re-evaluate its position on divestment,” he said. “Every week, new research, some of it coming out of Cambridge itself, further clarifies the severity of the climate crisis and the speed with which change is happening.” A spokesperson for the Cambridge zero carbon society, the group campaigning for divestment, said: “The university must produce costed strategies for how it can divest, alongside an evaluation of the social and moral factors in divestment, as hundreds of academics have demanded. “This is a second chance for the university to end their complicity in the climate crisis and align its economic policy with the scientific evidence produced at this very institution.” A spokesperson for the university said it recognised climate change was “a real and present danger” and had made two appointments to underline its commitment in the area. Cambridge said Emily Shuckburgh from the British Antarctic Survey had been appointed as the first director of the university’s carbon futures initiative. Toope described it as a critical role. “Emily is the ideal person to lead this initiative, which will pool research from across the university to address the greatest challenge the world faces today,” he said. The university has also appointed Ellen Quigley to “work with the chief financial officer to establish a programme of research into responsible investment”."

Klimaretter has a useless piece here where the author calls the Fukushima event the spark that is setting off the Green Industrial Revolution, and can hardly contain his glee. That may be true in some countries, at least for now.
Industrialisation of rural and natural areas. Photo credit: http://www.treehugger.com
But what the author does not mention is that many true greens are getting awfully uneasy about the current wide-scale massacre and mechanisation of the the world’s most beautiful mountain ridges, coastal areas and rural landscapes. And unless this madness is stopped, you aint seen nothing yet.
Groups like Klimaretter, irreversibly blinded by dogmatism and anti-carbon fanaticism, hacks of the green industry, anti-carbon religion and Big Green Finance, are unwittingly pushing for the mass desecration of natural landscape and rural beauty. Yes – let’s ruin the surface of the planet because we think it’ll tame and preserve the behaviour of the atmosphere.
“This is atop the breaks in the caprock just south of San Jon, NM.” Source: http://www.wuest.org/mark/NYAdventure.html
True greens and skeptics may not agree on a lot of things, but we can all agree that the industrialisation of our countryside is a mortal sin against our natural heritage.
This is big industry, aided and abetted by the government, making a ton of money at the expense of little guys.
My hope is that the true greens will some day SOON realise that all this hype about CO2 causing climate change is wildy exaggerated by special interests (GE, Big Gas, banks and carbon traders, reinsurers, etc.) and that all this ugly mechanisation is for literally nothing.
My plea to greens is that they reconsider all this – and join up with the budding resistance to this madness – to fight for the preservation of our landscape. Let’s use the legal system to choke these vandalising bastards.
I was born and raised in northern Vermont in some of the most beautíful countryside you can imagine. Today, when I go back and visit, I get so depressed. The Green Mountains are now getting transformed into the Machine Mountains. Mountain tops are being cleared of forests, flattened, and scarred by service roads.

Vermont’s beauty in many of its most treasured rural areas is now gone forever -at least in my case. I will never again see these areas in their original natural beauty- not in my lifetime. Worse – far more of this is on the way. Local residents and their rights have no chance against the might of the industry. They are being steamrolled.
It’s heart-breaking enough to go back to my childhood farm my father owned and to find that it’s been parceled up and homes have been built on it. But it is far more depressing to see that all around the mountain ridges we once marveled have since been industrialised.
Is this what we really want? Is this how we protect the atmosphere and conserve its behaviour? We are living in a nightmare.
http://www.globalenvironmental.com/news/sheffield-wind-project-nearly-complete-123.php
This is only the very beginning – multiply all of this by 100, or even 1000. To fulfil the dreams of the wind energy industry and the financiers behind the carbon credit scheme, MANY MANY MORE are going to be put up. EVERYWHERE.
Thankfully the resistance to this madness has already begun. And so I am pleading for open minded true greens, like myself,  to take a look at grassroots groups that are resisting this massive industrial encroachment into our countryside treasures. See here for example. http://current.com/1cvfm4c, and join up with them.
Sheffield Vermont – mountain land clearing and result Photo credits: http://www.globalenvironmental.com/ and http://www.vermontenvironmentallaw.com
Above are photos of the crimes they have committed against a hilltops not far from my childhood farm. The days of seeing this natural landscape are gone – forever. Some day wiser people are going to say, “My God! what kind of madness and dogmatism could have possibly driven this?” I am sure they will. But in the meantime the price is going to be really high and the scars will take a long time to heal.
I bought some property 5 years ago and here are some of the views in the area.
Free of windmills for now. (Photo P Gosselin)
Rural Vermont – here still free of industrialisation. But how much longer? (Photo: P Gosselin)
I wonder how long it’ll be before that gets industrially vandalised. Worse, this is Vermont, where already 95% of its electricity comes from either hydro or Vermont Yankee nuclear power – i.e. practically carbon-free! So all the wind parks are just monuments of stupidity.
There is one exception in Vermont – in rich Chittenden county, where all the fat-cats live , many of whom are devout “environmentalists”. So much so that no windmills will be installed on the mountain ridges that they view from their mansions on Spear Street in Burlington. Here’s a view from Charlotte. As long as the fat cat environmentalists are living there, don’t expect to see windmills in their backyards. They belong elsewhere.

There are thousands of websites and photos that document the ravaging of the earth’s natural rural beauty. Remember, this is just the beginning of what these bastards intend to do. Again – “caused by arrogance, by dogma, by ignorance” (Jacob Bronowski).
So I strongly urge you all to seek out rural preservationist groups who are fighting to preserve rural beauty and to join their cause. There are other ways of producing energy that are far less destructive.

"The national debate about climate policy is off the rails again. We should be talking about positioning Australia economically for the low-carbon future, making use of our huge opportunities to produce low-cost clean energy, and mobilising investment. We should be having a serious conversation about what are the best policies needed for that. And we should understand the implications of Australia’s climate policy for our long-term competitiveness and international standing.  Instead it’s the carbon wars once more. A confected furore over the presumed cumulative economic cost dominates the headlines, provoked by a single short report with some scary-looking numbers. The paper by Brian Fisher is a private black-box modelling exercise of no particular standing that uses outdated assumptions. But we still have news reports citing its supposed findings that “the Labor emissions target would subtract at least $264bn from gross national product by 2030”, and numbers as high as $542bn have also been used. There is a tendency for climate policy modelling assumptions to be highly conservative. Fisher’s modelling is an extreme example, painting the picture of an inflexible economy where clean technology is exorbitantly costly. Just consider the carbon prices in some of the scenarios, of $300-400 per tonne of carbon dioxide. Any sensible policies to cut emissions will come at a small fraction of that. As a measure of how ridiculous such carbon prices are, consider that it would now cost less than half that amount to suck carbon dioxide straight out of the atmosphere and sequester it, using purpose built plants. That’s the highest cost option one might consider right now if the world were to go all out on climate action. In reality, carbon costs are far lower. The key for Australia is renewable energy. Wind farms and solar parks built now can provide energy for around $50 per megawatt hour. That is half the current average wholesale price which is set mostly by fossil fuel plants. Renewables keep getting cheaper, and they will push coal out of the market. Intermittent power output can be firmed through storage and better interconnections, at moderate cost. A $400 carbon price implies a penalty of around $350 per megawatt hour for a typical black coal fired power generator. Just a fraction of that would make all coal power stations immediately uneconomic. So it is not a question of high carbon prices or higher electricity prices. It is how governments can help that process of transition along. The answers include stable policy to give investors confidence, a carbon policy for the electricity sector that is integrated with carbon policy for the rest of the economy, sensible investment in transmission and energy storage, making coal plant closures more predictable, and helping with structural adjustment in regions where coal plants close. Industry will switch from coal and gas to using zero-carbon electricity, and do so faster with a price signal on carbon. Electric vehicles will quickly be cheaper on a lifecycle basis than petrol or diesel cars. All this is now in reach because clean technologies are becoming cheap. The modelling in the headlines this week seems to assume we’re stuck in the early 2000s. The Fisher paper also ignores the opportunities for cheap abatement in other sectors, particularly agriculture and land use. Lots can be done at low cost to reduce agricultural emissions and sequester more carbon in vegetation and soils. The Coalition’s Emissions Reduction Fund pays an average of $12 per tonne for emissions reductions from land projects. Under Labor’s policies, industry could fund land-based emissions offsets. There could also be R&D for low-emissions agriculture and rules to stop broad-scale land clearing. The key is to put policies in place that allow efficient, broad-based and durable action. An economy-wide carbon price would be the ideal centrepiece. That still seems too difficult politically, but a patchwork of price-based policies across the economy could evolve into a consistent system. And it makes sense to allow international trading of emissions. Australian businesses could trade in emissions markets in the EU, California and many other jurisdictions. The Australian government could partner with developing countries that are happy to do more to cut emissions if rich countries support them. Renewable electrification paid for by Australian aid in the Pacific and Eastern Indonesia comes to mind. The credit for emissions reductions achieved by 2030 could be shared between Australia and the developing country partners. If Australia met a 45% reduction target in this way, we would encourage other nations to do more, and make a contribution to the planned global ratcheting up of the Paris Agreement. If we stick with a 26% target this would be seen as weak. The longer term game holds huge opportunity for Australia. In a world that goes towards net zero emissions, Australia is superbly positioned. Thanks to geography and climate, we can produce practically unlimited amounts of cheap renewable energy. An almost fully decarbonized domestic energy supply is not the end point. Let’s talk about 200% renewables: half used here, half exported to countries that are less favourably endowed, in the form of hydrogen, higher order synthetic fuels and energy intensive commodities produced in Australia using renewable power. Then let’s talk about how to facilitate the massive investments for Australia’s renewable energy future, who gets what share of the profits, how we support economic diversification in regions where coal mining will cease, and how this relates to ideas about our future economic prosperity. Those are the conversations worth having. Frank Jotzo is a professor at the ANU Crawford School of Public Policy, and co-director of the Energy Transition Hub"

Share this...FacebookTwitterProf. Knut Löschke, a solid state physicist, who conducted research until 1986, founded PC-Ware AG, and then turned it into a European IT company before leaving in 2009, had some harsh words about climate science and policy in an interview with the magazine Smart Investor.
 This is reported in the German realist blog Ökowatch. Dr. Löschke:
What is happening with regards to the climate hypothesis today is that profound and far-reaching conclusions are being based on pure suspicions. That’s religion, and not science. There are also many other well-founded hypotheses on climate dynamics that allow completely other conclusions to be drawn. But strangely, they are being massively suppressed – simply because they don’t accommodate the political concept of rescuing the planet. That’s propaganda, manipulation, suppression of the freedom of expression and demagoguery. As ‘an educated citizen of former communist East Germany’, I’m experiencing grand déjà-vu.”
Today Löschke is also honorary professor at the Leipzig Technical University, a member of the supervisory board of the Deutsche Bahn AG (German Railway) and a board member of Softline AG.  In the interview with Smart Investor he added:
Rescuing the climate – which is absolute nonsense – and the discussion about energy systems and energy policy, which is absolutely necessary, are unfortunately all getting thrown into one pot and mixed into a formless slop. Moreover, environmental protection is getting lumped with ‘climate protection’, which in turn is only harming the correct idea of environmental protection. Not only does the German Railway (Deutsche Bundesbahn) have to preoccupy itself with the topic of energy, but so do many other large energy consumers. Not in relation to “climate”, but in relation to economics and environmental protection.”

According to reports, Joe does not expect to see an El Nino until 2012. That’s more bad news for the Honeycutt warmists (see my last post). Looks like the cooling streak will be extended for some time.

Share this...FacebookTwitter Hans Schellnhuber is back in the news blowing science hot air once again, and spreading his usual doom and gloom. Unless people accept his master-plan for the Great Transformation of our sinful society, the planet will die – and soon, he believes.
This is what he has just told Chancellor Angela Merkel and her equally gullible Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen. Hat tip: DirkH.
Read here (in German): Climate Scientist Believes 6°C Of Warming Possible
Schellnhuber on the future of warming:
Temperatures will rise 3 to 4°C by 2100. But after that it will not stop rising. According to our scenarios we are on course for 6°C warming or more by 2300. That would mean a totally different planet – for example the sea level would rise many meters.”

Schellnhuber on Kyoto II:
Kyoto appears dead. Perhaps it has indeed led us into a dead-end.”
Schellnhuber on the who are the “climate sinners”:
The USA has completely abandoned a powerful climate policy. Indeed also Canada and Australia, whose industries have grown because of fossil energies, belong in court in the dock. All developed countries are are slowing the process down , and are simply shifting greenhouse gas intensive industries, i.e. dirty industries, to China and India.
Schellnhuber on “patient earth” – is it dead?
No. The patient is still alive. But more and more voices are predicting death soon.”

"Microsoft has joined a conservative-led group that demands fossil fuel companies be granted legal immunity from attempts to claw back damages from the climate change they helped cause. The stated goals of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC) include a $40-a-ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions in return for the gutting of current climate change regulations and “protecting companies from federal and state tort liability for historic emissions”.  Microsoft has become the first technology company to join the CLC, which includes oil giants BP, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and ConocoPhillips among its founding members. Handing legal immunity to these oil companies would squash a cavalcade of recent climate lawsuits launched by cities and counties across the US, including one by King county, Washington, where Microsoft is based. “When Microsoft is underwater it should ask itself if this is a good deal,” said Matthew Pawa, a lawyer representing King county, which includes Seattle, in its lawsuit against five major oil companies. Pawa also represents New York City in its suing of the same five firms – BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell. “Microsoft and other tech companies have been looking for a whizz-bang technocratic solution to climate change and they think this is it,” he said. “But they don’t know what they are doing. This is a raw deal that would stick taxpayers with the bill for decades of carbon pollution. It’s much like the NRA trying to get Congress to give them a free pass from our system of legal justice.” Facing rising costs from sea level rise, storms and heatwaves, a growing band of elected officials from across the US have turned to the courts to force fossil fuel producers to pay compensation to ameliorate the escalating damages. Many of these claims point out that firms like Exxon privately knew of the consequences of climate change for at least 40 years, long before it was a public issue, only to deny the problem and block meaningful action to address it. This raft of legal action – waged by places including Rhode Island, San Francisco and Baltimore – would be nullified under the CLC plan, which was drawn up by veteran Republicans James Baker and George Shultz, both former secretaries of state, and backed by former Federal Reserve chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen. Citing the need for a “much-needed bipartisan climate breakthrough”, the CLC is lobbying Congress for a gradually rising tax on CO2 emissions, with the proceeds returned directly to Americans. Under the plan, this would enable regulations on coal-fired power plants to be scrapped and fossil fuel companies to be legally inoculated from any legal ramifications. “The details of our plan are being developed by the largest and most diverse climate coalition ever assembled with the single focus of finding a bipartisan solution to the greatest environmental challenge of our time,” said Greg Bertelsen, senior vice-president of the Climate Leadership Council. Microsoft has said it was motivated to join the CLC due to its support for a price on carbon, which it has backed in Washington state and sees as a key method to drive down emissions. The tech company already charges itself an internal $15-a-ton carbon fee on everything from employee travel to electricity used on its premises. By next year, Microsoft expects its data centers will use 60% renewable energy. “We are getting extremely impatient, frankly, for policy action on climate change,” Lucas Joppa, chief environmental officer at Microsoft, told the Guardian. “We support a carbon fee because we believe it’s a policy mechanism that works and accords with economic principles. For us, joining the CLC gives us the opportunity to have this debate at a federal level.” Joppa would not be drawn, however, on Microsoft’s support for the idea of handing legal immunity to fossil fuel producers. “There are a lot of details involved and we are interested in being part of the conversation,” he said. “The devil is in the detail. We are looking to take an inclusive approach. We need to transition away from the use of fossil fuels but that isn’t going to happen without the inclusion of the fossil fuel sector.” Aside from Microsoft, the CLC’s member companies include Unilever, Pepsico and Johnson & Johnson. A handful of environmental organizations also back the plan, including WWF and the Nature Conservancy. But other green groups have been sharply critical of the CLC and what they see as a problematic relationship between large oil companies and technology firms, in particular. Last month, more than 6,000 Amazon employees wrote to its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, and the company board to lambast Amazon’s offering of web services to oil and gas companies and its vague plan to reach 100% renewable energy. Google and Microsoft also offer a range of technologies for fossil fuel companies, with both businesses recently criticized for co-sponsoring a conference that featured groups that deny the science of climate change. “Microsoft is throwing King county taxpayers under the bus by endorsing the Baker-Schultz-Exxon proposal that would void the county’s lawsuit against Exxon, leaving King county residents on the hook for all the costs of climate adaptation,” said Richard Wiles, director of the Center for Climate Integrity. “The Baker-Schultz-Exxon plan is lipstick on a pig, or worse, and Microsoft’s endorsement doesn’t earn them any real climate kudos.” Putting a price on carbon is viewed by proponents as the most effective way of both slashing emissions and garnering support among Republicans who have refused to address the existential threat of climate change. The concept was bolstered last year by the Nobel prize committee, which handed its economics award to Yale’s William Nordhaus, who has long called for a tax on emissions. There is evidence that any carbon fee would have to be ratcheted up swiftly in order to change behaviour and transition the world away from fossil fuels. A landmark report by the UN last year estimated that governments would need to impose carbon prices of $135 to $5,500 a ton by 2030 to help avoid disastrous climate change, with this figure ballooning to $27,000 a ton by the end of the century."

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline FOCUS magazine interviewed German historian Wolfgang Wippermann on the subject of the WBGU and Hans Schellnhuber’s “master plan” for transforming global society: World in Transition – A Social Contract for Sustainability.The WBGU acts as Angela Merkel’s science advisory board (believe it, or not). Schellnhuber, its director, is also director of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK).
The Wippermann interview is the latest in a series of intense criticisms by German mainstream media aimed at the worrisome anti-democratic and authoritarian views expressed by factions of the German scientific community such as the PIK, WBGU and the German government lately, see here, here and here.
Wippermann, who is an expert on authoritarianism, fires extremely harsh words at the WBGU and its seemingly out-of-control Professor Schellnhuber, calling the authors of the WBGU social contract “fanatics” and the language “worrisome”.
What follows are summarized excerpts of the FOCUS interview.
=========================================
FOCUS: What does the language in the paper remind you of?
Wippermann: The language is scary and it makes me afraid. Those who speak like that behave the same way. It is a negative Utopia, a dystopia. When Utopian minds are at work, it is always dangerous.
FOCUS: What world view do you see in the text?
Wippermann: Here we are dealing with scientific fanatics who want to assert their ideas. It makes me wonder that we are discussing this for the first time, and how little it has been discussed in the public up to now.

FOCUS: What about the role of science in politics?
Wippermann: First off: the German government should have distanced itself from the WBGU long ago. It just cannot be. In short, you just cannot say that you demand some other democracy, a different state and a different world order. It is unacceptable.
FOCUS: How could scientists write such a paper?
Wippermann: I’m afraid this is not just thoughtlessness. It goes a lot further than how to make the world a better place. The authors are suggesting a climate dictatorship, the Climate State – and one that is truly extensive and far-reaching. For example, they want to abolish national states.
FOCUS: But this paper was written by leading scientists.
Wippermann: Also a science can become a religion. When they demand a transnational democracy – whatever that may be – it’ll be a dictatorship.
FOCUS: But they claim it’s for democracy
Wippermann: From history we know of enough people who wanted to make the world a better place after having prophesized the end of the world and bringing an undemocratic system that forces others to accept their views. And why is it that the Germans again have to save the planet, and not only prophesize its downfall? Does the world always have to be measured using a German yardstick? Who do the authors think they are? Such arrogance.
FOCUS: What spirit does the call to action radiate?
Wippermann: The paper disastrously follows the tradition of “Revolutionary Messianism“, which was analyzed by Norman Cohn. There’s a line of “Revolutionary Messianism“ from the Medieval Times to modern totalitarian movements.
FOCUS: Aren’t humanists more prone to all this than natural scientists?
Wippermann: Natural scientists deal directly with people. Think for a minute what emerged from “eugenics”. These scientists here can actually do politics.
Wolfgang Wippermann is a professor at the Friedrich-Meinecke-Institute at the Free University of Berlin. He also teaches at the University of Arts in Berlin. He was a guest professor in Innsbruck, Peking (Teachers College), Indiana University, University of Minnesota and Duke University. Wippermann’ s main area of research is ideology history. His primary areas include antiziganism, theory of fascism, history of communism, anti-Semitism and the historical role of demonology and demonization of societal fringe groups.  Wippermann is the author of numerous publications.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans Schellnhuber’s Master Plan for the “Great Transformation” of society announced in a Spiegel interview is now out. h/t: DirkH
If there was ever a document out there certifying someone has no clue about economics and democratic principles, this is it! And it’s as remote from reality that anything can get. Only reality-isolated, pointy-headed academics could come up with such a thing.
It even tops my wildest expectations. You can now read it here: A World In Transition – A Social Contract For Sustainability. This is what these world-rescuer academics, who never worked a day in their lives in private industry, recommend for changing society – to save us from junk science-based global warming.
To accomplish this so-called Great Transformation of society, the authors of the master plan advocate 10 bundles of measures to take.
Bundle No. 1: Improve the Proactive State with Extended Participation Opportunities
In the German they call it the “Designing State”. Here they call for a strengthening of the state and advocates “bonus-malus” solutions. That means: let’s make the state even more powerful, and if you don’t do what it tells you, then you get whacked.
Bundle No. 2. Advance Global Carbon Pricing. 
The WBGU believes that carbon pricing is the most important political measure for decarbonisation, and a necessary element of any regulatory framework for the transformation into a climate-friendly society. However, the price of carbon has to be set at a level that is high enough to achieve the transformative impact called for, i. e. it must be substantially higher than the current European emissions trading price level.”
Here we see this is remote of free market economy and it is all about state control. In the German version they call for a carbon price that must be “many times higher”.
Bundle No. 3. Expand and Deepen the Europeanisation of Energy Policy
That is what the title of the Bundle 3 is in the German version.
The goal of a common European energy policy should be the decarbonisation of the energy system by the middle of the century.
Here they propose the rapid expansion of renewable energies, energy storage systems and involving non-EU countries to help, such as Norway and Africa (i.e. $1 trillion solar plant in the Sahara called Desertec). That means becoming dependent on unstable North African countries like Libya. Forget that consumers can’t afford it.
Bundle No. 4. Accelerate promotion of renewable energies on a global level through feed-in tariffs
The transformation speed that needs to be reached to protect the climate and avoid the imminent risk of path dependencies on fossil energy technologies can only be achieved by accelerating and increasing the use of renewable energies.”
This is what they call for after a host of countries have just stopped subsidies because they are too expensive. But economics have never been a concern for reality-remote academics in ivory towers.
Bundle No. 5: Promote sustainable energy supply services in developing and newly industrialising countries

These countries need support with guaranteeing all of their people access to the basic essentials of a modern energy supply by 2030. They need support that allows them to establish a sustainable energy infrastructure.”
Like we don’t have enough to pay for already with our own huge deficits, demographic disaster, proposed super-expensive renewable energy supply system. Now we are also expected to pay for these systems in for the rest of the world. And then we should expect these poor folks to be able to pay for these pricey renewable energies. I’ve already read enugh to be convinced that these “wisemen” belong in group therapy of some sort. This is as remote from reality as it gets.
Bundle No. 6 Steering the World’s Rapid Urbanisation towards Sustainability
For currently rapidly growing urban structures, for example in Asia, high-carbon path dependencies must be prevented, as they would hinder low-carbon development for many decades.”
Hey Asia! (and the rest of the world), you’re going to build your cities the way we tell you to.
Bundle 7: Advance Climate-Friendly Land-Use
Priority of any globally sustainable land-use policy must be securing the food supply for just under a billion mal- and undernourished people. Furthermore, demand for agricultural produce is going to rise because of the growing share of animal products and the increase in biomass production for energy and industry.”
The modern agriculture that has done so much under the free market system is supposed to go back to failed Soviet style management. In their rush to rescue the planet from a hypothetical extreme climate change, they are proposing to rush a real destruction instead.
Bundle 8: Encourage and Accelerate Investments into a Low-Carbon Future
State policies must therefore aim to make investment into low-carbon technologies more attractive, and to abolish current disincentives and investment barriers.”
That means topple the free market system. Let the government run it. But which government?
Bundle 9: International Climate and Energy Policy
…a climate protection scheme that is limited to the more prosperous countries cannot solve the problem. Global cooperation is therefore necessary to ensure that the requisite funds for climate-friendly development are also available to poorer countries, and that all countries have access to climate protection technologies and the respective expert knowledge. International climate and energy policy is the forum for achieving a global consensus on transformation targets and ambitions.”
That means the rich countries are going to have to pay for the poor ones. Redistibution! The whole thing is a high risk economics experiment. Not to see if it’ll succeed, but to see how fast something can fail.
Bundle 10: Pursue a Revolution in International Cooperation
The world desperately needs a higher level of international cooperation if climate- and environmentally-friendly global development is to be achieved in the long-term.”
No. The world needs cooperation to tackle today’s real problems that are killing millions right now, and not fantasy problems 100 years from now. Pouring trillions into flakey energy systems while neglecting the poor is immoral.

"New polling from a respected foreign policy thinktank underscores the point that 2019 is the climate change election, with a majority of Australians saying global warming is a critical threat. The poll undertaken for Lowy says 64% of adults rank climate change number one on a list of 12 threats to Australia’s national interests, up six points from last year’s survey and a jump of 18 points since 2014. The 2019 result is the first time climate has topped the list of threats since Lowy began the research in 2006. After climate change, cyberattacks ranks second, terrorism third and North Korea’s nuclear program fourth. The Lowy result is consistent with private research undertaken by environmental groups and by the major political parties, which suggest climate change is surfacing as a concern in parts of the country normally sanguine about the issue. The new poll comes as a shocking new report from the United Nations this week finds biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, with one million species at risk of extinction, and human populations in jeopardy if the trajectory is not reversed. New analysis funded by the Australian Conservation Foundation suggests the vast majority of threatened species habitat destruction in Australia over the last two decades has been concentrated in 12 federal electorates, nine of which are held by Liberal and National MPs. In the Lowy poll, six in 10 of the sample say Australia needs to address the threat of climate change, even if that means incurring significant costs, which is a level of concern not seen in the data since 2006. While 60% favour prompt action, 28% favour gradual action so the costs of the transition are lowered. Only 10% favour waiting until further evidence emerges. The survey suggests climate change is a generational preoccupation. Three quarters of Australians aged 18-44 (76%, up six points from 2018) believe global warming is a “serious and pressing problem”, while fewer than half (49%) of Australians aged over 45 share this concern. Climate change has been front and centre in the federal election, with the Coalition campaigning to discredit Labor’s policy of imposing an emissions reduction target of 45% on the basis that the costs of action are too high. While the Coalition took a decision in December 2017 to use international permits as part of its climate policies – a decision it reversed in the lead-up to the campaign – Scott Morrison has spent the campaign attacking Labor for adopting the same stance in an effort to lower the costs of abatement. The government has also attacked Labor for flagging it will impose a pollution standard for vehicles despite pursuing the same policy objective itself before abandoning the push because of opposition from motoring groups, the Institute of Petroleum and the National party. Labor has countered the politicking by arguing climate change action incurs a cost, but the costs of not acting to deal with the threat are also high. Bill Shorten has declared that Australian politics is broken after a decade of partisan brawling about the issue, and the system won’t be restored to functionality until the parliament legislates a credible climate policy. The Greens, which argue Labor’s policies are not ambitious enough, have called on Labor to establish a collaborative policy development process for climate policy along the lines of a process adopted in the 43rd parliament in the event Shorten wins on 18 May. Shorten has rebuffed that overture. The Lowy poll indicates a majority of the sample believes Labor will do a more competent job at managing the threat of global warming than the Coalition. The Liberals are favoured over Labor on national security and economic management."

Share this...FacebookTwitterKilled more people than nuclear power.
Japan’s earthquake has unleashed a massive wave of hysteria throughout Germany as media outlets hyperventilate over the danger of a meltdown at the Japanese Fukushima nuclear power plant. Sure nuclear power is deadly dangerous if not properly used, and the situation in Japan is critical. But listening to the media, you’d think nothing could be more dangerous.
Now activists are demanding we switch immediately over to the-planet saving renewable energy sources, like wind power for example.
But just how safe is wind energy? Just how “safe” are many things out there? What about public transportation?
It turns out that nuclear power is a minor killer when the big picture is examined.
Zero nuclear power plant deaths in the USA 
Wind energy has killed more
The Japanese earthquake and nuclear reactor accidents is yet another example of the media’s distorted perception. It turns out that wind power has been a bigger killer than nuclear power in the USA. Here’s what treehugger reported awhile back:
According to one viewpoint of reports offering the comparison between wind versus nuclear energy, there has not been one single injury to a nuclear plant worker in all its 104 power plants and 40 years of service in the United States… not one!
The Wind Turbine Industry on the other hand, has quite a treacherous track record as you can see by the summary below:
Summary of Wind Turbine Incidents (December 2008):
• 41 worker fatalities –  includes falling from turbine towers and transporting turbines on the highway.
• 39 Incidents of blade failure – failed blades can travel over 400 meters, killing any unfortunate bystanders.
• 110 Incidents of fire – When a wind turbine fire occurs, local fire departments can do little but watch due to the 30-story height of these turbine units. The falling debris are then carried across the distance and cause new fires.
• 60 Incidents of structural failure- As turbines become more prevalent, these breakages will become more common in public areas, thereby causing more deaths and dismemberment’s from falling debris.
• 24 incidents of “hurling ice”- Ice forms on these giant blades and is reportedly hurled at deathly speeds in all directions. Author reports that some 880 ice incidents having occurred over Germany’s 13-years of harnessing wind power.”
Another way to save the planet and to “live safely” is to ride your bicycle. Well it turns out that bike-riding is far deadlier than nuclear power. In the USA in 2008, 716 bicyclists were killed in traffic accidents. About 53,000 bicyclists have died in traffic crashes in the United States since 1932. Compare that to the deaths caused by nuclear power in the United States – or even globally.
Candles kill more than nuclear
Indeed many things are far more dangerous than nuclear power plants, at least they have caused far more deaths and mayhem. Here are some annual death statistics from the USA that cause many more deaths, taken from here and here at Arthur Hu’s site. Why don’t we ban all of these menacing products?
Nuclear power plants – 0 deaths per year
Candles  – 126
Bicycles 1995  – 800
Agriculture  – 1,300
Motorcycles  – 2,500
Car Phones 2002   – 2,500
Alcohol – 100,000
Tobacco – 500,000
Candles kill 126 – in just a single year and in a single country! Having a reliable supply of electricity would mean less use of candles, and so lives would be saved. As far as I know, all of the above killer items are being sold without protest.  Here are some other killers:
Roller skates  – 10 
Window blind cords  – 13
Drawstring hoods  – 17
Dog Bites  – 20       
Skiing deaths  – 34       
Yes, even the lowly blind cord has killed more than U.S. nuclear power plants have.

Green transportation is a killer too
Let’s go green and hop on public transport. But wait, they cause more deaths than nuclear power too. Admittedly these US statistics aren’t so up-to-date, but they give you an idea of the risks involved.
1999 bus deaths  – 58
1999 railroad – 805
1999  struck by trains – 530
Dangerous occupations
And let’s move to ban all the following potentially catastrophic occupations. Actually they are not potentially – they simply just are! They are destroying the planet and kill humans. Occupations in USA; deaths/100,000:
Timber cutters  – 117.8 
Fishers    – 71.1 
Pilots and navigators  –  69.8 
Structural metal workers  – 58.2 
Drivers-sales workers   – 37.9 
Roofers – 37.0
Electrical power installers   – 32.5 
Farm occupations  – 28.0
Construction laborers –  27.7 
Truck drivers  – 25.0
We accept many of the risks these products and occupations pose because their benefits far outweigh the harm they do.
Automobiles are far more dangerous
If zero deaths in the United States from nuclear power is too much to take, then take a look at what the automobile claims every year:
Traffic deaths per year global: 1.27 million
Nuclear power has an excellent record
One thing that constantly gets ignored is the cost-benefit analysis of nuclear power. It has a far better track record than many other products or systems out there and it vastly improves our lives as a whole. Of course, there is a risk in generating power with nuclear reactions, but the benefits it offers are immense.
Sure accidents will happen. But as technology improves, these accidents will become rarer. It is indeed difficult to find a product that has given us so much for so little in terms of lives lost. Even if the worst happens in Japan, the loss of life will be relatively small.
I recall a few years ago 4 workers getting killed in a biogas plant here in northern Germany. Yet, the incident went practically unreported in the media. Imagine if these four workers had been killed in a nuclear plant.
The issue has little to do with safety, and much more so to do with politics and power.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEd Caryl has taken an in-depth look into wind energy as an alternative and finds it’s riddled with technical problems. In the end he calls it “a huge scam”.
====================================================
Alternative Energy Wind Power?
By Ed Caryl
Wind power in the U. S. is most available in harvestable quantities in the Great Plains states just east of the Rocky Mountains.

Figure 1: Brazos Wind Farm, Texas. Source: Wikimedia Commons. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GreenMountainWindFarm_Fluvanna_2004.jpg

Figure 2: Wind power in the United States. Source: Wikipedia Commons. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_Wind_Resources_and_Transmission_Lines_map.jpg
This is advantageous, as those states have vast areas with little population, flat terrain, good transportation for the long components, and lots of open, privately owned land that can be leased for wind farms and still be used for cattle grazing or farming.
At 30% Gross Capacity Factor, with 80 meter tower height, according to the U. S. Department of Energy, the limit for harvestable wind power in the 48 contiguous U. S. states is 38 PetaWatt-hours (38 X 1015 watt-hours [wh]). In the US we need to generate at least 30 PetaWh from all sources of energy (30 X 1015 wh), just to keep the U. S. current standard of living. So wind will generate all of what is needed. About 14% of all the energy used is electrical power. Last year, the United States used 4.1 X1015 watt-hours of electricity. Harvestable wind power would be almost 10 times the electrical power we currently use. But, the land area used would total over 22% of the land area of the United States, and would require 11 million 1 MegaWatt turbines.
Lets look at some real world examples of high-density wind farms. In California, power is generated in three high wind locations: Altamont pass east of San Francisco, Tehachapi pass east of Bakersfield, and San Gorgonio pass near Palm Springs. The largest wind farm field is San Gorgonio.
Figure 3a
Figure 3b
Figures 3a and 3b: San Gorgonio Pass, south and north sides of Interstate Highway 10, Palm Springs, California. Photos by the author.
The wind farms at San Gorgonio Pass cover 70 square miles. There are over 4000 wind turbines at this location. In all of California, there are over 12,000 wind turbines. In 2004, output totaled 4.258 GigaWatthours of electricity. In 2007, this had increased to 6.8 Gwh, 2.3% of the electricity generated in the state. This is approaching 7% of what can be generated by wind in the state of California. These three locations are the prime wind locations in California, and the best spots at each are taken. The rest of the wind power locations in California are on the coast, in very scenic locations. (For a sneak-peek at today’s California electrical use and the renewables availability see this site.)
In California, a transmission line from the nuclear plant at Palo Verde, Arizona to Los Angeles passes through the San Gorgonio wind farm area. The wind farm thus supplements the nuclear power. San Gorgonio generates less than 0.03% of the power generated at Palo Verde. Most Southern California electrical power comes from Arizona, Utah, and Nevada. Out of state generation accounts for 31% of California’s electrical power, 24% from other Southwest states, and 7% from the Pacific Northwest. Southern California has also imported power from the Cerro Prieto geothermal plant in Mexicali, Baja California Nord, in Mexico.
In the U. S. as a whole, 94.65 Twh were wind generated in 2010, also 2.3% of the electrical power generated (over 4,100 Twh or 4.1 X 1015 watt-hours). Two states, Iowa (15.4%) and North Dakota (12.0%) generate more than 10% of their power from wind. Minnesota (9.7%), South Dakota (8.3%), and Kansas (7.2%) are not far behind. (Source: Wikipedia) In these states wind power makes sense because the resource is available, the amount of power needed is low relative to the area, the power is used locally, and wind power is competitive with other sources. The percentage of wind generated power has not reached the point where backup power when the wind stops is a problem.
What are the downsides to wind generated power? There are several.
Wind power tends to drop when you most need it.
During the last few cold winters in the U. K. wind power generation dropped to very low levels during the coldest days. This happens everywhere. Wind power cannot be depended on to supply heating electricity when it is most needed. It must be remembered that all heating systems require some electricity to move the heat within the system. In California, wind power generation has a definite daily pattern, low in the morning and ramping up during the afternoon. But this pattern doesn’t happen every day. See A Grid Manager’s Nightmare. To provide power when the wind dies, a grid manager must have an equivalent amount of other generation available, usually fossil fueled, or the lights will go out. The U. K. solves this problem by importing nuclear power from France. Denmark imports hydroelectric power from the rest of Scandinavia. If all the euro-zone countries continue to expand wind power, there will come a point where sufficient backup power will no longer be available.
In California, a report by KEMA Inc. written in June 2010, states:

//-->




Researchers concluded that accommodating 33 percent renewables generation by 2020 will require major alterations to system operations. They also noted that California may need between 3,000 to 5,000 or more megawatts (MW) of conventional (fossil-fuel-powered or hydroelectric) generation to meet load and planning reserve margin requirements.”
Wind turbines are dangerous
There are several ways one can get killed by a wind turbine. Bird kills are just one downside. In the U. S. state of Montana, a study found that three times as many bats were being killed as birds. One reason is that bats don’t need be struck by the blades to be killed. A bat’s lung structure is such that the pressure change as the blade passes by ruptures lung tissue and kills the bat from the “bends”.
A wind turbine is a tall tower first of all. Falls from a tower higher than 20 meters usually has a bad outcome. This means that to work on a turbine requires a safety line. This leads to another problem. Outside the turbine nacelle there are the rotating blades and a shaft. If the line gets tangled in either, the wearer is pulled off the nacelle and into the blades or shaft… Not good. Inside the nacelle, there is the rotating shaft, gears, and the generator. If a safety line, clothing, or a hand, gets caught in the rotating machinery, the resulting escalating injuries are inexorably and agonizingly fatal.
One worker was killed inside a tower by falling ice. The falling sheet of ice nearly cut him in half. Ice throw by the turbine blades has been documented to 150 meters. Calculations have predicted ice throw to half a mile (nearly 1 kilometer). Blade failure throw has been documented to 1300 meters. The recommended distance to occupied housing due to blade throw, noise, and shadow flicker from blade rotation through sunlight, is 2 km. Shadow flicker can trigger epilepsy in sensitive individuals.
There have also been many fatal accidents during the transportation and construction process. Erecting a large wind turbine requires moving very long loads on the highways, and using very large cranes to erect the components. Both processes are hazardous. There have been a total of at least 78 people killed in the wind industry as of March 31st of 2011.
Wind turbines are noisy
Small wind turbines hum. Large wind turbines, as the blades pass the tower, make a low frequency thump as well as low frequency “swish – swish” sounds that can travel for miles. One reference mentioned that the Nazis used similar sounds for torture. Farmers near wind farms in the U. K. and Taiwan have reported livestock losses reportedly from lack of sleep.
Fire is a hazard for wind turbines
Electrical components can short out, overheat, or otherwise fail causing fire. Gearboxes can leak lubricants, overheat, and catch fire. Lightning can cause fire, and a wind turbine is a tall object that attracts lightning. A wind turbine contains many gallons of flammable lubricant and hydraulic fluid. To reduce weight, a wind turbine nacelle is often fiberglass or other plastic that can burn and melt, dripping flaming material onto the surroundings. Local fire departments usually respond to a wind turbine fire to simply watch it burn and control any spot fires on the ground, because they cannot fight a fire 50 or 80 meters in the air. Note in Figure 3b, above, that several towers no longer mount turbines. Their fate is not known for certain, but fire or “king-pin” failures (the shaft around which the turbines rotate to face the wind) are the likely reason. The “king-pin” is the only support that keeps the turbine on the tower.
Wind turbines are different from other generation methods in a way that exacerbates danger. There are no on-site operators. If something goes wrong that is not monitored and/or controlled electronically, a problem can spiral into disaster faster than remote operators can physically respond to the scene.
Eric Rosenbloom wrote an excellent paper in 2006 that details much of the danger from wind turbines. See his paper here.
What to do when the turbines wear out? 
The usual annual funds planned for maintenance and repair for a wind farm is 4 or 5% of the cost of installed equipment. The planned life is usually 20 to 30 years. This should be thought of as the half-life of a wind farm. In this period, half of the turbines will have catastrophically failed. Usually in older wind farms, after half have failed, the others are decommissioned and eventually abandoned. If the permitting agreements have not called for removal, old wind farms are often just abandoned by owners. This is happening in Hawaii and California as this is written.
The economics of wind power, or how do we make money on this?
In Texas and Denmark, wind farm operators often pay the grid operators to take their generated power. They can do this because the subsidies they receive from the government allow a small profit. This happens because the wind power is distant from the cities that need it, and transmissions costs are higher than what the power is worth. In Texas, the power is in the “panhandle” in the north, and the power is needed in Dallas/Ft. Worth and Houston in the central and south of the state. In the U. S., Subsidies include a 5-year accelerated depreciation schedule, as well as tax rebates, and Renewable Energy Credits. The accelerated depreciation schedule means that operators will sell the wind farm after five years, the next owner will take the depreciation for another five years, and sell it again. If the new owner is a European company, they get “carbon offset” credits for an additional subsidy.
In Denmark, wind power is backed by hydroelectric power in Norway and Sweden. When the wind is blowing, Norway and Sweden will back off their hydroelectric power production to save water in the reservoirs. Hydroelectric power is cheap, so Denmark gets little or nothing (sometimes less than nothing) for the wind power they are exporting. When the wind stops, Denmark then imports power from Norway, Sweden, and the rest of Europe at the spot price. As in the U. S., subsidies allow this to work, giving the operators a profit, no matter which way the wind blows.
Wind power is a huge scam. There is no other way to describe it. If it were not for subsidies, no one in their right mind would build a wind farm. To learn more, this author recommends following the links in this article for as long as your nausea level will allow.

"Democrats on Thursday passed their first significant climate change legislation since gaining control of the House of Representatives this year, directing Donald Trump to remain in the landmark international agreement to limit the pollution that is heating the world. The measure would not directly reduce the greenhouse gases causing worse heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and storms. It falls far short of the action scientists say is needed and the vision outlined by progressives and supported by many Democrat presidential candidates in the Green New Deal.  Only a few Republicans crossed party lines to vote for the bill, which the Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, said will “go nowhere”. McConnell said the US participating in the Paris climate agreement would have an “unmeasurable effect” globally and hurt the economy. “My colleagues on the left think these self-inflicted national injuries just feel like this greening of America is the right thing to do,” McConnell said in a statement. Republicans in the House have also sought to force a vote on the Green New Deal, expecting that many Democrats would not be able to stand behind the specifics and the costs of the sweeping proposal. Donald Trump made it a campaign promise, later carried through, to exit the 2015 Paris deal, in which almost all the nations in the world set voluntary goals for tackling climate change. His administration has aimed to roll back Obama-era rules meant to nudge the US toward its commitments. And his agencies have made efforts to bolster fossil fuels. The US in the global deal agreed to cut its climate pollution 26-28% by 2025, but data shows the country far off track from that goal. Democrats defended their efforts, calling climate change an immediate danger to the American public and the world. “Last year was an abject failure in addressing the climate crisis in both policy and real-world emission reductions. In the US and globally, we fell short,” said Illinois congressman Mike Quigley, a Democrat. “We cannot afford another year like it.” Trump cannot formally leave the deal until a day after the 2020 election. In a morning press conference ahead of the vote, the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, did not expand on her party’s climate plans, but noted the bill is one of many measures Democrats are passing that the Republican-controlled Senate will not consider. Jean Su, the Center for Biological Diversity’s energy director, called the bill necessary “but far from sufficient”. “The science demands an economy-wide mobilization to end our addiction to dirty energy and harness renewable sources on an ambitious new scale,” she said."
"Just seven months ago the United Nations told the world that we have 12 years to limit the climate change catastrophe. It means that to keep global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels we need to cut carbon pollution by 45% by 2030 and down to zero by 2050. Twelve years. Actually scratch that – now it is 11 years. Now ask yourself how often that has been raised during this election campaign?  At the time a co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group on impacts of climate change said: “It’s a line in the sand and what it says to our species is that this is the moment and we must act now. This is the largest clarion bell from the science community and I hope it mobilises people and dents the mood of complacency.” Oh bless. At the start of the 2019 federal election campaign Scott Morrison put out a video where he was all dewy-eyed about the future, saying “the next 10 years are important to everybody at every stage of life”. And yet not once – NOT ONCE – did he mention that the UN has given us 11 years to do something about a global catastrophe. No, instead it’s all standard of living and nothingness statements that would get shot down by any decent advertising firm in the first meeting. He did say one thing that is correct. He noted that “the decisions you make in one term of government last for a decade or more”. And in no area is this more true than with climate change. Every year we do less than enough, the ability to limit damage becomes less and the cost of doing so becomes larger. I’ve written in the past how climate change has destroyed the minds of conservatives. But it has also destroyed the media model that seemed to work so well for holding politicians to account: the model of balance and impartiality, where journalists who strive to be seen to take no sides and have no bias. It’s a model that only holds up so long as both sides are open to reality because it implicitly gives credibility to both sides. But over the past 30 years the conservative side has become hostage to cranks and charlatans. And as the conservatives lurched ever more towards lunacy the media has for the most part followed. It has led us to a position where the Liberal party’s utterly pathetic climate change policy is given credence. And where the big issue about the ALP’s less-worse policy is the cost, not from the point of view that it could be achieved with a more efficient price on carbon but that it costs more than does the LNP’s nothing policy. It is a position where editors give front-page space to modelling so redolent with bias that you can practically smell the coal dust on its pages. It has meant those wishing to actually do something about climate change have to not just argue their policy is better, but that the need for the policy is there. Election campaigns are often about costs – how much will your healthcare or education policy cost? But we do not as a rule talk costs to the economy, because such modelling is pretty nebulous and is reliant on assumptions that can distort any picture for better or worse. That does not render modelling irrelevant, but it means it is no fact check. And with climate change any costings that do not count the costs of inaction are worthless. It would be like doing a costing of investing in the polio vaccine in the 1940s and not considering the cost of people continuing to die and suffer from polio. Clearly the costs of inaction massively outweigh the cost of acting. The good news is we do have some research on the costs, because while in Australia we allow political parties to indulge the equivalent of arguing over which rat in a restaurant kitchen has the fewest number of fleas, in the UK things are rather more mature. This week in the UK the Committee on Climate Change released a report arguing the UK needs to reduce emissions emission to zero by 2050. In what should be a siren for all journalists, they note that “the costs of the low-carbon transition are critically dependent on the quality as well as the stringency of public policy”. Note the issue is quality of the policy, not whether or not there is some precise hit to GDP they can come up with. And what is quality? Policy with “long-term clarity on the regulatory landscape, prioritisation of the role of markets, and policy processes that are transparent, predictable, and based on cost-benefit analysis”. And for it to be successful “it will also need to be credible (actors must believe the government means what it says), consistent across time and governments, and across different policy sectors, and yet adaptive to new circumstances”. In other words: Tony Abbott and his ilk – your time is done. The report also notes that “the very word ‘costs’ to describe decarbonisation expenditures is somewhat misleading, because in a very real sense such expenditures are also investments”. What’s more, it suggests “the correct answer to the question ‘what will it cost?’” is that it depends on “what is done now”. Wait and it costs more; do it poorly now and it costs more; accept that a policy to reduce emissions by 26% including dodgy accounting as legitimate, and it will cost more. And if you really are worried about economic growth the report also concludes that “there has been no appreciable difference in rates of economic growth between those countries that have reduced emissions substantially and those that have not”. But importantly, “yet the former camp are arguably in a stronger position to benefit from a global transition to a zero carbon economy in years to come”. The report makes clear it is time to stop giving credence to cranks and demand better of our political parties – and there is no excuse for the media either. We need at a minimum a 45% reduction by 2030 and to get to zero net emission by 2050. So parties need to explain what they are going to do to get there and argue why their way is best. If a party is not even willing to come up with such a path then do not treat them with the respect that “balance” gives them. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist and economics writers"

"Independent candidate for Warringah, Zali Steggall, has pledged to address the health impacts of climate change if she wins Warringah as an independent. Like her fellow independent, Kerryn Phelps in Wentworth, Steggall signed up on Monday to the strategy developed by the Climate Health Alliance, which has more than one million health professionals behind it through their representative groups. It is pushing governments to start factoring climate change into their thinking about health policy, warning that a rise of 3C in world temperatures would have catastrophic consequences for the health of Australians. Among the health impacts of climate change are an expected jump in severe asthma attacks, more disease due to severe weather events such as flooding, increased mental illness due to prolonged droughts and higher death rates among the elderly and chronically ill due to more frequent very hot days. On 21 November 2016 thousands of people were taken ill and 10 people died in Melbourne due to  thunderstorm asthma. High temperatures, thunderstorms and windy conditions blew rye grass pollen into the city causing the mass incident. Melbourne has now implemented an alert system for epidemic asthma which operates during October and December each year when pollen levels are at their highest. Mary Chiarella, professor of nursing at Sydney university, said increasingly warm weather meant there would be more out-of-season pollen that would extend the asthma risk season. More hot days would drive hospital admissions putting additional stress – and costs – on the health system. “[Economist] Warwick McKibbon says no action is not a zero sum game. Just because you don’t spend the money taking action, doesn’t mean it will deliver a zero cost,” said Steggall. “We are in one of the most exposed regions to climate change,” she said. Steggall said she would be pushing for the expert panel to look into the climate change impacts on health outcomes and to advise the government on its response. “My point of difference [with Tony Abbott] is I do like facts and data,” she said, a reference to the criticism that Abbott has made of her expert panel proposal. At a debate last week, Abbott said Steggall would be shirking her responsibilities as a parliamentarian when she said she would be “led by experts” on climate change policy and what emissions cuts the nation should commit to. She also criticised Abbott’s focus on power costs due to measures to address climate change. “The more people understand the other impacts on them personally, the more the case for action,” she said."

=========================================================
Indeed, for those of us reading reliable reports, we get the sense that they are slowly gaining the upper hand over the problems.
On the other hand, listening to the media report on the Fukushima sitiuation is a bit like listening to a hysterical child who is convinced that he has just seen the boogey man under his bed. Here’s an example of media stupidity and sensationalism:
You just can”t rely on this kind of low level media for accurate, factual and cool-headed information. Not surprisingly, some Germans, who are 9000 km away from the reactors, are actually out buying iodine pills and Geiger counters. Some are probably even digging bomb-shelters by now.
So get the latest news from experts, instead. Here’s the latest update (reality):
From World Nuclear News here (emphasis added): ================================================================

Problems for units 3 and 4
16 March 2011
Earlier, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said that a blaze was spotted in the reactor building of Fukushima Daiichi 4 at 5.45am local time this morning. Attempts to extinguish it were reportedly delayed due to high levels of radiation in the area. A spokesperson for TEPCO said that by around 6:15am there were no flames to be seen. The incident at unit 4 is believed to be in the region of a used fuel pond in the upper portion of the reactor building.
FIRST PUBLISHED 0.25am GMT
UPDATE 1:14am GMT
Information from TEPCO spokesman and video feed
UPDATE 2: 4:10am GMT
Update title from ‘Second fire reported at unit 4’ and information on Unit 3 and 4 from Chief Cabinet Secretary Edano
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano has described problems that occurred on the morning of 16 March with Fukushima Daiichi 3 and 4. He also outlined plans to pump water into unit 4.
At 8:34am local time white smoke was seen billowing out of Fukushima Daiichi 3. Efforts to determine the cause of this development were interrupted as all workers had evacuated to a safe area due to rising radiation readings. Readings from a sensor near the front gate had fluctuated for some time, although Edano said that on the whole there was no health hazard. Earlier in the morning readings had ranged between 600-800 microsieverts per hour, but at 10am readings rose to 1000 microsieverts per hour. Readings began to fall again from around 10:54.
Edano said that one possibility being considered was that the unit 3 reactor had suffered a similar failure to that suffered by unit 2 yesterday, although there had been no reported blast or loud sound, which had been the case for unit 2. The immediate focus, said Edano was on monitoring of levels and checking pumping operations.
It was not clear whether the increase in radiation readings were due to the problems today with unit 3 or the ongoing problems resulting from the damage suffered by unit 2, yesterday.
Edano also outlined plans for units 4. Preparations were being made to inject water into unit 4, however the high levels of radiation from unit 3 were impairing those preparations. When possible, the water injection would be done gradually as there were safety concerns over pouring a large amount of water at once. The water will be pumped into the reactor building from the ground, plans to drop water from a helicopter having been abandoned. Although he said that “all things were possible” Edano did not believe that recriticality at unit 4 was a realistic risk.
Second fire at unit 4
Tokyo Electric Power Company issued a notice of an explosion at unit 4 at 6am on 15 March. This was followed by the company’s confirmation of damage around the fifth floor rooftop area of the reactor building. On that day, a fire was discovered but investigations concluded it had died down by around 11am. At present it is not clear whether today’s fire was a completely new blaze, or if the fire reported yesterday had flared up again.”

Here it is in a nutshell:
Reactors 1 and 2: There no news mentioned here about them. And there is a saying about “no news”. Let’s hope it stays that way.
Reactor 3: White smoke was seen, radiation levels went up, but have since come back down. They are monitoring levels and checking pumping operations. I can’t discern a disaster there.
Reactor 4: Here we see that a fire was spotted this morning at 5:45. By 6:15 there were no more flames to be seen.
Overall there are no reports that any of the reactors and containment facilities having melted down, let alone exploded like Chernobyl.
And if the World Nuclear News is not good enough, here’s the latest status report from:
IAEA (emphasis added):
==========================================

Japan Earthquake Update (16 March 2011, 03:55 UTC)
Japanese authorities have informed the IAEA that a fire in the reactor building of Unit 4 of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was visually observed at 20:45 UTC of 15 March. As of 21:15 UTC of the same day, the fire could no longer be observed.
Fire of 14 March
As previously reported, at 23:54 UTC of 14 March a fire had occurred at Unit 4. The fire lasted around two hours and was confirmed to be extinguished at 02:00 UTC of 15 March.
Water Level in Unit 5
Japanese authorities have also informed the IAEA that at 12:00 UTC of 15 March the water level in Unit 5 had decreased to 201 cm above the top of the fuel. This was a 40 cm decrease since 07:00 UTC of 15 March. Officials at the plant were planning to use an operational diesel generator in Unit 6 to supply water to Unit 5.
The IAEA continues to liaise with the Japanese authorities and is monitoring the situation as it evolves.”

In a nutshell, no news about Reactors 1-3, the Reactor 4 fire appears to be extinguished, and Reactor 5 seems to be threatening something, but the means of controlling that are at hand.
This all doesn’t mean that we are out of the woods. The next hours will tells us more. In the meantime be careful with all the Hollywood-type of drama and hype you hear from the clueless media and Greenpeace “experts”.
Also you can get press releases from the reactor operator TEPCO. But the press releases are confusing:

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Voice Of Russia website has an interview with John Ritch, Director General of the World Nuclear Association, based in London, UK. The interview starts as follows:
What kind of consequences could the decision by the German government have, both in political and economical aspects?
Well, let us return to the basics of what has occurred here. To be successful, democracy requires leadership rather than politician desperately chasing the latest polls. Missus Merkel’s desperate chase has now produced an act of monumental irresponsibility both for the global environment and for Germany’s economic interest. Germany will now pollute more, function less efficiently and depend more on imported energy…
Continue reading (with audio)“
Ritch doesn’t hold back in blasting Germany’s hysterical knee-jerk move away from nuclear power, adding comments as follows:
…excellent companies are being made to bear the burden of this political imbecility…will actually have little effect on the momentum of the world’s continuing shift towards nuclear power…they have become victims of a German experiment in the environmental ideology…has taken a serious step backwards into a dark yesterday…an example of misguided ideology…unfortunate to see such a sophisticated nation falling pray to this kind of ideological illusion…”
And here’s how Ritch views “green” technology industries and a German future based on them:
…they will benefit from it but only to the degree that the government is willing to create subsidies, because they operate technologies that cannot actually succeed in a competitive market…eventually the burden of such heavy subsidies will show up in the tax burden of the ordinary German citizen, and…will begin to notice that their government has led them down a completely silly path.”
In German there ‘s a saying that describes the country’s plan to reach this utopia: “Sie sind auf dem Holzweg!”
This is just the latest sequel to a bad film by Germany’s latest political directors. Call it: Germany Commits Suicide III.

"Eduardo Brondizio’s observation – “We have been displacing our impact around the planet from frontier to frontier. But we are running out of frontiers” – is crucial (Humanity facing ‘urgent threat’ from loss of Earth’s natural life, 7 May). This frontier-based structure of thought, in which there is always a beyond, an outside, a domain of otherness, underpins the dichotomies of class and hence of economics (capital and labour); of race, religion and migration; of gender and sexuality; as well as that of ecology. In every sphere, the uncivilised, untamed, more “natural” partner is positioned for exploitation and subordination. This is the basic structure underlying capitalism, but probably goes back much further to the beginnings of agriculture, when the land was first “tamed”. Its time is up. We have reached the final frontier and there is no longer any outside. The very concept of “nature” is misleading, since it positions human beings over and against something different called the natural world, and which therefore can be conceptualised as providing us with “services”. The concept should be junked.Richard MiddletonCrossmichael, Dumfries and Galloway  • There is a strong case for dating the start of the Anthropocene to 1950, since which time a million species have become threatened; 1950 coincides with the growth of international travel, leading to the introduction of alien species into vulnerable populations which then collapse. Back in 1950, world population was one-third of its current level. A combination of antibiotics, vaccination programmes and ineffective family planning have seen human numbers rocket past 7 billion, and they are still rising. Finally the demands of humanity have led to deforestation and widespread loss of habitat in every part of the globe. It is entirely appropriate that the UN and other institutions produce reports documenting the disappearance and decline of most species on Earth. But they will have no impact at all unless they are accompanied by measures to limit human numbers.Dr Robin Russell-JonesChair, Help Rescue the Planet • Obviously there are many uncomfortable changes we humans are going to have to make in our attempts to rectify our sorry situation, but a very simple, painless and cheap way of making some improvement to our biodiversity is to cease our ever-increasing manicuring of hedgerows and verges. In Sweden, there is legislation to forbid verge-cutting until October; why not here? While many of our remedies to alleviate the situation are costly, this change would actually save money.Judith WrightDarwen, Lancashire • Climate change is the greatest threat facing the countryside. From prolonged heatwaves and moorland wildfires to severe and more frequent flooding, our countryside is under severe pressure from the impact of climate breakdown – but it will also provide many of the solutions. It will take a cross-departmental approach to ensure reaching a net-zero target for greenhouse gas emissions is the top priority for all ministers (Emissions must stop by 2050, UK advisers say, 2 May). But by prioritising policies and funding that will see better land use across the countryside, dramatically reduce emissions from agriculture and halt the degradation of soils and increase the planting of hedgerows and trees, and by implementing an ambitious new strategy for the restoration of our peatlands, we can drive carbon back into the ground.Tom FyansDeputy chief executive, Campaign to Protect Rural England • Leading the way in becoming a net zero-carbon country would be a massive challenge, but there is a strong social case for doing so, as well as a practical, moral and strategic one (Editorial, 3 May). It affords us a timely opportunity to bring the country together in an act of national social renewal, by challenging individuals and communities to work together, share good practice and even compete with each other to become the greenest business, town or village in the land. Britain leading the world in carbon reduction could be a way to redefine patriotism for this century and move us on from all those outdated second world war references so beloved of rightwing politicians.Richard AldwinckleLondon • Extinction Rebellion rightly warns of looming catastrophe. Greta Thunberg rightly suggests panic is an appropriate response. Deciding on the best action is now critical. But here’s the problem: most people think reducing CO2 emissions is the “solution” to climate change. The reality is that we also need to start work: removing the trillion tons of CO2 that’s already overheating the planet; and refreezing the Arctic before meltdown becomes irreversible. The increase of CO2 in the atmosphere and the retreat of Arctic sea ice must be halted within a few years. Further intervention for two or three decades can restore the climate norms our grandparents enjoyed. The Foundation for Climate Restoration has been promoting an intervention strategy. It was founded last year by innovator and philanthropist Peter Fiekowsky, and has identified a number of safe and affordable intervention techniques for CO2 removal and sea-ice restoration. Past norms could be restored by 2050 at a cost of less than a thousandth of global GDP per year. The foundation is seeking investment for the development of an initial set of technologies, some of which may eventually pay for themselves. But government support is also needed: for changing agricultural practice to put more carbon in the soil; for promoting algae in our oceans to sequester carbon while restoring fisheries; and for deploying cloud cooling technology and other techniques to refreeze the Arctic.John NissenChair of the Arctic Methane Emergency Group, a partner of the Foundation for Climate Restoration • Most human activities are dependent on the use of energy, whether from fossil fuels or renewable sources. Cutting carbon emissions provides a dangerously false impression of progress towards any target – for 2030, 2040 or 2050 - aimed at reducing climate change. As the figures published daily on the Guardian weather page show, the concentration of emissions in the atmosphere is rising inexorably. That is the cause of rising temperatures. It is only when zero global emissions have been achieved that the world can begin to benefit from their reduction. In the years that it will take to arrive at that level, the situation will be graver as, meanwhile, emissions are being added to the existing concentration. It will require stopping using any fossil fuels, whether for heating and hot water, petrol, diesel and most electricity-powered car use, train travel, second homes abroad, air travel, carnivorous diets, long distance freight – and large families. Only governments can make this mandatory. They have no other option.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs the hysteria reaches new levels and the anti-atomic power groups are ever more adamant about a nuclear-free Germany, Angela Merkel has been pressured to announce that some of Germany’s nuclear power plants will be closed. That’s probably good news for the gas industry, and for Germany’s neighbours.
But right now, Germany does not have the gas capacity to step in and take up the slack, and so expect the country to put its gas development on the fast-track, and to import.
The construction of coal power plants faces massive resistance here, and so that too is also out of the picture. So where will Germany get its power when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow?
By abandoning coal and nuclear, Germany may succeed in isolating itself when it comes to energy. Either it will have to become dependent on its neighbors, or its population will be expected to behave like energy misers and to fret over every milliwatt that gets used.
Some of Germany’s electric power will be generated by natural gas. And the rest? Not to worry. Germany has got plenty of neighbors around who are less prone to atomic hysteria and who will be willing to sell power – for a price. Plenty of new atomic power capacity is being planned just to the east (see World Nuclear Association). And everywhere else around the world, atomic power plants are being constructed, planned or proposed.
Reactors now under construction
According to the World Nuclear Association, 62 reactors are currently under construction.

China: 27 reactors
Russia: 10
India: 5
Germany: 0
Many more reactors are being planned – 158 in total. When one looks at the chart, Germany columns are filled with goose eggs.
China: 50 reactors
India: 18
Japan: 12
Russia 14
USA: 9
Germany: 0
And many more are being proposed: 324 reactors in all.
China: 110 reactors
India: 40
Italy 10
Russia 30
Ukraine: 20
Japan: 12
Russia 14
USA: 23
UAE: 10
Vietnam: 12
Turkey: 4
Poland: 6
Germany: 0
Plenty of Germany’s neighbors are positioning to take over the job of producing electricity. If Germany should find it’s too expensive to produce electricity with sun and wind, or it’s too difficult to get a steady supply, then it will have to call Italy, Ukraine, Poland or Russia for help.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe more that time runs out for the world to stop “dangerous climate change”, the more the world seems to drag its feet and postpone limiting so-called greenhouse gases. The disconnect between the supposedly imminent threat and the world’s reaction could not be more profound.
If anything, the world’s reaction confirms that global warming is nothing really but hot air.
According to Der Spiegel, a realistic new deadline looks to be 2014 or 2015. A new treaty would regulate CO2 emissions for 40 industrial countries. But Russia, Japan, Canada and the USA have already said they would not join in.
China, the world’s greatest CO2 emitter, and India are not bound to CO2 reductions in any treaty. Currently represenatives from 180 countries are meeting in Bonn in a half-hearted attempt to lay the groundwork for Durban.
Der Spiegel reports here again that the world will likely postpone in Durban signing a climate treaty to succeed Kyoto I. Speigel writes:
here also will likely be no new international treaty at the next climate conference in Durban South Africa at the end of the year. The United Nations no longer anticipates a successor treaty for the Kyoto Climate Protocol to be finished on time. The end of December deadline will be missed, said Christiana Figueres, UN Climate Chief said at a UN conference in Bonn.

Prospects look dim. Even WWF “climate expert” Tasneem Esso sees the writing on the wall, and says:
The current political framework is not favourable for a treaty. We cannot be optimistic.”
Speigel reports that the USA says it is in favour of a Kyoto 2, but only if nations like China are included. China, which is rapidly modernizing its economy, refuses to restict its CO2 emissions.
Officials and scientists are claiming the situation is urgent. Der Spiegel writes that the number of annual “reported natural catastrophes” has doubled over the last 2 decades from 200 to 400, and that:
The number of catastrophe refusgees jumped 2 and half times from 2009 to 2010. In total more than 90% of the catastrophes in the past year could be traced back to weather events.”
Der Spiegel does not provide any source for these statistics other than quoting “some scientists”.

"The first drafts of Dyson’s closely guarded electric car designs have emerged, showing a vehicle with unusual proportions that could be used off-road. The patent filings are the first clue to what the “radically different” car pledged by the British inventor Sir James Dyson might look like.  Dyson said the patents were “deliberately light on specifics”, but revealed some of the ways in which the company was trying to improve on current electric vehicles in its £2.5bn development project. The car’s very large and narrow wheels could allow for increased range and efficiency, according to Dyson, essential for battery-powered vehicles. The wheels would be kept as close to the front and back of the vehicle as possible to make the car “highly manoeuvrable … and improving handling on rough terrain.” Despite the high ground clearance, the vehicle’s overall height would be lower than most SUVs, and a larger, thinner battery pack than rivals would help give more space inside. The driver would sit lower in the cabin, with a shallow-angled windscreen improving aerodynamics. The patents were filed 18 months ago but only published this week. The cars are expected to launch in 2021, a year behind the original date. Dyson, whose fortune was built on revolutionising the traditional vacuum cleaner design, has so far indicated the car would be a premium vehicle, implying a price tag in the range of a Tesla, which costs £38,000 for a Model 3 or about £70,000 for a Model S. The designs underscore that the new car will also need bespoke parts such as tyres. Dyson has said the vehicle will go on sale in a limited number of countries at first, with China likely to be a frontrunner, and would be “entirely designed by Dyson, manufactured by Dyson and sold by Dyson”. The car would build on Dyson technology used in its other products, such as its own motor and battery types. The billionaire, who was an outspoken supporter of Brexit, provoked anger by announcing last year that the car would be manufactured in Singapore rather than Britain. The company is about to start construction work on its new plant in Singapore, because Dyson believes there is a bigger market for electric vehicles in Asia. However, he maintains the car is a British project, with the design, engineering and testing of prototypes being carried out at Hullavington airfield, where hangars have been converted to house the project. In an email sent to more than 500 staff working on the vehicle, Dyson stressed the need to keep the details of his new product secret. However, he said patents were needed as the car would “include fundamentally new technologies and make some inventive leaps”. But he also cautioned that “we do not always use patents or make products based on patents that we have filed”. He said competitors had missed opportunities by adapting electric vehicles from existing formats, but Dyson’s was “a vehicle which has been developed from the bottom up”. The British government has pledged to ban fossil fuel vehicles by 2040, in response to climate change targets and air pollution concerns. Dyson has urged the prime minister, Theresa May, to bring forward the date of the ban by a decade to 2030, describing the existing target as “madness”. He told the Financial Times he believed the electric car market had been underestimated, adding: “I believe it’s driven not so much by subsidies as by genuine desire of the public to have silent and non-polluting vehicles.”"
"Entire communities might need to be moved away from coasts and rivers as the UK takes urgent action to prepare for an average global temperature rise of 4C, the Environment Agency warned. The agency said on Thursday that difficult decisions would have to be taken in the coming years to make sure the UK was resilient amid flooding that would not be held back by higher land defences.  Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the agency, set out the regulator’s long-term strategy for tackling flooding and coastal change, which, she said, was a preparation for a 4C rise in global temperatures. The rise is far in excess of the target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels set in the legally binding Paris Agreement of 2015. “The coastline has never stayed in the same place and there have always been floods, but climate change is increasing and accelerating these threats,” said Howard Boyd. “We can’t win a war against water by building away climate change with infinitely high flood defences. We need to develop consistent standards for flood and coastal resilience in England that help communities better understand their risk and give them more control about how to adapt and respond.” The strategy text says the approach to flood protection and assessing risk had to change. “We need to act now without delay … we need to apply a different philosophy.” Instead of acting once a flood had happened the country needed to build “climate resilient” communities, homes and businesses, and simply building bigger and bigger walls as defences was not the solution, the document says. The policy calls for natural barriers and flood relief systems, but also for an increase in the resilience of homes and businesses against the inevitable flooding with such structures as flood doors and stone floors. The strategy also makes clear that some areas of the UK and some homes and businesses cannot be protected. “Despite our collective best efforts, we will not always be able to prevent flooding and coastal change happening.” The priority in these areas will be to keep people safe, minimise damage and aid quick recovery. Ultimately it may also mean supporting individuals and communities in a move from an affected area. “Resilience includes accepting that in some places we can’t eliminate all flooding and coastal change, and so we need to be better at adapting to living with the consequences – for example, by designing homes that can be restored quickly after they’ve been inundated with water, or potentially moving communities out of harm’s way.” It is already thought unbeneficial to protect or adapt about 114 miles of coastline because of flooding, and more than 1,000 miles of coast are at risk of erosion. A recent report from the government’s advisory panel the Committee on Climate Change said that by the 2080s up to 1.5m properties in England could be in areas of significant levels of flood risk. In the Humber estuary rising sea levels and river flooding are putting 55,000 homes at risk. In 2013 a tidal surge hit the east coast, forcing thousands of people to abandon homes as areas of the North Sea rose to higher levels than had happened in the floods of 1953. In Devon, in 2014, people were forced from their homes and a key stretch of the railway link to the rest of the UK was destroyed in storms and flooding. More homes would be at risk in the future as the number of properties built on floodplains was likely to double over the next 50 years, the agency warns. The agency set out a target, for up to 2050, for the UK to become resilient to flood and coastal risks, and for a policy of “resilience for places”, referring to the ability of communities to cope with, and recover from, all sources of flooding or coastal change. The agency says an average outlay of £1bn a year will be needed to build traditional flood and coastal defences and allow for natural flood management. “Flooding of any kind is horrendous,” the report says. “Erosion destroys. [Floods] are dirty, invasive, damaging, and can kill. They can force people to leave their homes and their businesses, cause prolonged mental ill health, and destroy livelihoods, natural habitats and other valued places. At best flooding and coastal change can be inconvenient and disruptive.” Lord Deben, chair of the  Committee on Climate Change, last week called for the British government to immediately set a legally binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. He said the UK urgently needed to stay ahead of worsening impacts by adapting. “The Environment Agency is doing just that by setting out their flood strategy, but we won’t be able to keep up with the pace of change if we don’t reduce emissions to zero,” he said. Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said smarter adaptation and building resilience to flooding was undeniably important but that the focus should be first and foremost on slashing emissions to avoid the worst consequences of climate chaos. “With its relentless pursuit of fracking, airport expansion and road building, and barely tepid support for renewable energy, our government is failing with this regard,” Childs said. The environment minister, Thérèse Coffey, said the government was already providing £2.6bn over six years, delivering more than 1,500 projects to better protect 300,000 homes. “But the threat of climate change will mean an increasing risk, and preparing the country is a priority for the government, and the nation as a whole,” she said, adding that the government would be launching a call for evidence to inform action on flood and coastal erosion risks."
"We humans pride ourselves on our ability to look beyond immediate concerns and think on a grander scale. While other creatures preen for mates, hunt prey or build homes, only humans ponder the nature of time, explore our place in the universe or are troubled by the question of what wiped out the dinosaurs. Yet we are often poor at focusing on and understanding the things which really matter. A new mass extinction is under way, and this time we are mostly responsible. The new UN Global Assessment Report warns that a million plant and animal species are at risk of being wiped out. Most of us find it impossible to visualise such a large number. Focusing on individual cases is only partially helpful. Plenty of tears are shed for charismatic megafauna such as rhinos when they are driven to the brink. Fewer know or care that two in five amphibian species are under threat. Phytoplankton drifting in the ocean are barely noticed at all, but absorb carbon dioxide as well as being eaten by zooplankton, which in turn are eaten by larger creatures, in turn eaten by ourselves.  It took only a century for humans to discover the dodo and drive it to extinction. But annihilation is now too speedy and commonplace for us to even recognise each species: we are sending creatures to their deaths before we know what they are. In many more cases species will survive, but in far tinier numbers. The biomass of wild animals has fallen by 82%; hedgehog populations in the British countryside halved in the last half-century. In contrast, our own population soars, and so does its consumption. Climate change is one of the major causes of this catastrophe, bleaching corals and damaging habitats. Any sensible strategy must consider them together, as an environmental emergency. But there are also specific challenges to wildlife, including the replacement of forests by fields of cows; overfishing; the impact of pesticides and fertilisers; the pollution of air and water and soil; and the spread of plastics through our oceans and food chains. Government leaders must press this issue by raising it personally instead of leaving it to ministers; Emmanuel Macron has pledged to do so when he hosts the G7 summit this year. They should start now: next autumn, countries will meet in China for a UN conference on biodiversity, setting new targets. There has been shamefully slow progress towards the existing ones, drawn up in Japan in 2010, though there have been some successes. The US never even ratified the convention on biological diversity, hindering its chances of gaining traction. The best hope of progress there is perhaps through a version of a Green New Deal incorporating biodiversity. There are already signs of a shift in thinking. A new OECD report makes a bold call for taxes on wildlife-degrading companies, and the diversion of finance to biodiversity-boosting projects rather than damaging ones; fossil fuel companies and agribusiness continue to receive vast subsidies. Many believe a more radical rethinking of our economic model is needed. Real change will require a depth of imagination, ambition and sheer determination which humans have historically struggled to muster. Yet if we cannot summon the required concern for a million species, we could at least focus on one: our own. We may not be charmed by Earth’s 5.5 million insect species, but we need them to pollinate crops, disperse seeds and break down waste to enrich the soil. Through ignorance, greed, laziness and simple lack of attention we are wiping out the very creatures upon whom we ourselves depend."
"A new UN report is set to reveal that up to 1m species face extinction because of human actions. The loss of pollinating insects and other ecological disasters – from the destruction of flood-saving mangroves to air pollution – poses no less of a threat than climate change, according to the report by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).  We are triggering a mass extinction event, and critically we cannot separate one environmental crisis from another. Biodiversity loss cannot be partitioned from climate change, or from human population growth or pollution or plastics in our oceans. These challenges are all interconnected. We face an ecology of environmental concerns, and if we continue to consider these problems in partitioned isolation, solutions will continue to emerge far too slowly. The IPBES report reveals that 3.2 billion people are suffering from degraded soils. We cannot feed our planet’s growing population by destroying its soil. And soil erosion is also fuelling climate change because that earth contains three times more carbon than is in the atmosphere. Soil-destroying chemical farming means there are no insects or skylarks above our fields – and so we’re experiencing this tragic loss of biodiversity. The connections between these crises make solutions seem all too dauntingly difficult. But in fact, a solution to one problem will inevitably make a positive impact on many others too. More than 28,000 people are dying because of polluted air each year in Britain and air pollution is linked to psychotic experiences and a reduction in educational achievement. It’s not rocket science: improving air quality in our cities by cutting polluting vehicles will bring a vast range of benefits to human health, and help tackle climate change too. That’s a simple binary example of the ecology of crisis. George Monbiot advocates taking land out of meat production and rewilding it. This will boost biodiversity enormously but will also tackle global warming because those rewilded, rewetted lands will capture significantly more carbon. If these lands are also opened up for us to enjoy, our physical and mental health will flourish. Thus we repair the ecology of destruction. It can be difficult to know what we can do as individuals – but at least we all possess an increasingly sophisticated understanding of how farming, consumption and energy-use impacts upon the planet, hence the growth of the vegan movement. Lifestyle changes are always worth doing, but seldom as simple as they seem. As I found during Veganuary, it wasn’t too difficult to go vegan but that didn’t automatically mean I was eating ethically or in an environmentally friendly way: some of my vegan food was over-packaged and filled with palm oil. If I make a change, it’s me. If both of us do, it’s we. That’s how things grow. The youth climate strikes have been an incredible act of self-empowerment for that generation. I hope their confidence will grow and grow. At the moment they are campaigning about the climate; I hope that next they’ll be campaigning about how they can’t hear any birds singing. And we’ve seen the success of Extinction Rebellion in recent weeks. These protests definitely made a difference to environmental debates in the House of Commons last week. As long as we keep it peaceful and democratic, activism is going to become increasingly important to not only instigate change, but to speed it up. The human species is remarkably inventive and adaptable but it is simply no good at change. When we are presented with good evidence to change our minds, we resist it. For many farmers, change is coming, whether they accept it or not. Intensive livestock farming has been found out on many accounts. If I was a livestock farmer today and I wasn’t producing high-welfare, low-intensity, high-quality meat like Rosewood farm in Yorkshire or Henry Edmunds’ organic farm at Cholderton, Wiltshire, to name but two, I would be thinking, “OK, this vegan thing is growing quickly, I’d better diversify my business”. But many farmers are fighting these big social trends. Why fight these challenges, when they present a huge opportunity? I’m not saying every farmer can follow Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree at Knepp, who have turned a failing farm into a rewilded, ecological haven with loads of biodiversity, but new ideas and models are out there. Like all of us, farmers need help to embrace change – and we need to change what farm subsidies do. We need government-supported low-interest loans to help farmers make these changes, to diversify and generate better opportunities for them, their families and their futures. Either big, intensive, chemically-fuelled farmers revise their businesses or the world is going to poison itself. But we can’t just put the pressure on farmers, we need to act ourselves. So those of us who live in cities and suburbs should pressurise the government to introduce mandatory changes immediately to vastly improve urban biodiversity and air quality. My People’s Manifesto for Wildlife contains loads of practical ideas for positive regulations: why not have ponds on every industrial estate, and boxes for swifts and sparrows on every new housing development? We’re not struggling to find ideas to solve problems either globally or locally. It’s action we’re lacking, in government and beyond, as individuals and together as a species. If we act now we may be surprised at how these seemingly vast problems diminish quicker than we imagine. • Chris Packham is a naturalist, nature photographer and author, and one of the presenters of BBC2’s Springwatch"
"Cars and motorbikes running on petrol or diesel will be banned from driving in Amsterdam from 2030. The city’s council plans to phase in the change as part of a drive to clean up air pollution, which the authorities blame for shortening the life expectancy of Amsterdammers by a year.  “Pollution often is a silent killer and is one of the greatest health hazards in Amsterdam,” said the councillor responsible for the city’s traffic, Sharon Dijksma, announcing the municipality’s decision. From next year, diesel cars that are 15 years or older will be banned from going within the A10 ring road around the Dutch capital. Public buses and coaches that emit exhaust fumes will no longer enter the city centre from 2022. By 2025, the ban will be extended to pleasure crafts on its waters, mopeds and light mopeds. All traffic within the built-up area must be emission-free by 2030 under the Clean Air Action plan. The city plans to encourage its residents to switch to electric and hydrogen cars by offering charging stations to every buyer of such a vehicle. It is hoped that the second-hand electric car market will blossom in the coming years. There will need to be 16,000 to 23,000 charging stations by 2025 to make the project viable – up from the current 3,000 in the city. In large part due to heavy traffic in the cities of Amsterdam, Maastricht and Rotterdam, air pollution in the Netherlands is worse than European rules permit. There are concerns that the levels of nitrogen dioxide and particle matter emissions are causing respiratory illnesses. But the Rai Association, the automotive industry’s lobby group, condemned the plan as bizarre and regressive. A spokesman said: “Many tens of thousands of families who have no money for an electric car will soon be left out in the cold. That makes Amsterdam a city of the rich. “In 2030, about one third of the cars will be electric, we expect. But there will also be a lot of people who won’t be able to afford that by then.” In January 2018, the Dutch health council called on the government to devise an ambitious strategy to improve air quality in the Netherlands, warning that the “blanket of pollution” would cause major health problems in the country. City authorities and governments around the world are moving towards pushing cars that produce greenhouse gas emissions off their streets. Last year, Madrid began restricting access to petrol vehicles made prior to 2000 and diesel vehicles made prior to 2006. Rome has pledged to ban diesel vehicles from the city centre by 2024. The Danish government has said it wants to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 and hybrid vehicles from 2035. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterLots of lip service, but governments worldwide are getting cold feet about really reducing CO2 emissions. Commitment is clearly fading.German news magazine Stern has a short interview here with climatologist Mojib Latif, who provides us with a very encouraging confession with respect to the climate science swindle, i.e. it has reached “an absolute low point”!
Latif claims to be a warmist and insists that man is able to regulate the global climate simply by regulating the amount of greenhouse gases that gets emitted into the complex, extraterrestially-driven climate system.
Latif first tells Stern that Germany’s accelerated phase-out of nuclear power will mean more CO2 emissions because of more power generation from fossil fuel plants, e.g. read here, 2 German coal power plants approved.
This of course all undermines the idea of getting the planet to reduce its CO2 emissions, for which countries and global organisations earlier concocted and attempted to implement emissions trading schemes. Latif here is not convinced by these efforts, and comments:
So far it all has been quite a toothless tiger. If it were today what it had been originally designed to do, then it would be a very different story. But there have been exceptions after exceptions, especially in Germany with the energy-intensive industries. That’s not how it’s supposed to work.”
Of course governments have given industries so many exceptions because the perceived problem is not really serious enough to be taken seriously. And no country is actually going to commit suicide for the sake of solving a phony problem (except maybe Germany, which has moved onto the ledge and is now threatening to actually jump).
Stern then asks the question on every body’s mind:

Just how intensely is the community of countries fighting climate change?”
In other words: Just how committed are they? Latif answers (emphasis added):
We’ve reached an absolute low point. Actually at the UN-level we were further Along in the early 1990s. Today we see only word acrobatics. Heiligendamm, Copenhagen or Cancun all have not brought us further.”
Commitment has cooled to the lowest point in 20 years, i.e. since it got started. On CO2 trends, Latif warns:
The trend is alarming: Since 1990 CO2 emissions worldwide have risen 40 percent.”
40%? That corresponds roughly to the rise in the level of worldwide democracy.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading German scientists are now spreading fear among children at schools. Is this the indoctrination part of the “Masterplan”?
German science used to be, and is in many areas, still highly regarded worldwide. But in the area of climate science, it has been reduced to politics and masterplanning.
Sadly, Germany’s “leading climate scientists” are far more preoccupied with transforming society and spreading panic among the population then doing science. Spreading panic is a favourite practice of Stefan Rahmstorf who, like his director Hans Schellnhuber, is a “scientist” at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research (PIK).
Rahmstorf is featured in astory at the online Märkische Zeitung, written by Alexandra Amling, who writes how Rahmstorf recently gave a presentation to school students. The Märkische Zeitung writes:
Only when mankind switches over only to renewable energies will we be able to avert the consequences of climate change, Stefan Rahmstorf made clear on Thursday evening in a presentation to school students and interested individuals at the Goethe School.”
Maybe the Märkische newspaper (Ms Amling) confused it, but here it is claimed that using renewables will stop the consequences of climate change, but not climate change itself. I’m having trouble making sense of this. If we use only renewable energy, the climate will change anyway, but the consequences of that change will be averted? Abracadabra.
The Märkische Zeitung then added, quoting Rahmstorf:
‘If extraterrestial life existed and little green men observed us, then they would see a dramatic disappearance of ice in the Arctic and would wonder, shaking their heads, if the earth is so little worth to us,’ said the oceanographer with admonishing tones.”

More contempt for humans – all consistent with the Schellnhuber’s “masterplan” mentality, which views humans as too stupid to run the planet democratically, and so authoritarian means are warranted.
According to Märkische Zeitung, Rahmstorf drives no car and has equipped his house with solar technology, and so we should all do the same. Beacuse if we don’t, we might drown – at least that’s what Rahmstorf’s last slide of his presentation, a doctored photo, implies:
At the end he showed a photo that will certainly remain in our minds: A wall of a house with the writing: ‘I don’t believe in global warning’. However the second line is hardly legible because it is drowning in floodwater.”
Here Rahmstorf is saying that anyone who doesn’t believe his horror scenarios is a fool. Yet ironically, when one looks at the data, Rahmstorf is exposed.
In the event that Ms Amling is interested in facts, then she should consider the following:
FACT: Sea level rise is decelerating.
FACT: Global temperature has not risen at all in the last 10 years.
FACT: Tropical storm activity has been falling since the 1980s.
FACT: A huge number of scientists completely disagree with Rahmstorf.
FACT: Rahmstorf’s sea level projection is an extreme outlier, way out of the mainstream.
We’d be more than happy to point Ms Amling to the data behind these facts, and other facts. I would even appear in front of these children with my own presentation in order to undo the educational damage that has been inflicted by Rahmstorf.
After looking at the data, Ms Ameling might consider Rahmstorf as simply not a serious person who is irresponsibly inserting fear into vulnerable young minds and doing a disservice to his country.

"The world’s leading scientists will warn the planet’s life-support systems are approaching a danger zone for humanity when they release the results of the most comprehensive study of life on Earth ever undertaken. Up to 1m species are at risk of annihilation, many within decades, according to a leaked draft of the global assessment report, which has been compiled over three years by the UN’s leading research body on nature. The 1,800-page study will show people living today, as well as wildlife and future generations, are at risk unless urgent action is taken to reverse the loss of plants, insects and other creatures on which humanity depends for food, pollination, clean water and a stable climate. The final wording of the summary for policymakers is being finalised in Paris by a gathering of experts and government representatives before the launch on Monday, but the overall message is already clear, according to Robert Watson, the chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). “There is no question we are losing biodiversity at a truly unsustainable rate that will affect human wellbeing both for current and future generations,” he said. “We are in trouble if we don’t act, but there are a range of actions that can be taken to protect nature and meet human goals for health and development.” The authors hope the first global assessment of biodiversity in almost 15 years will push the nature crisis into the global spotlight in the same way climate breakdown has surged up the political agenda since the 1.5C report last year by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Like its predecessor, the report is a compilation of reams of academic studies, in this case on subjects ranging from ocean plankton and subterranean bacteria to honey bees and Amazonian botany. Following previous findings on the decimation of wildlife, the overview of the state of the world’s nature is expected to provide evidence that the world is facing a sixth wave of extinction. Unlike the past five, this one is human-driven. Mike Barrett, WWF’s executive director of conservation and science, said: “All of our ecosystems are in trouble. This is the most comprehensive report on the state of the environment. It irrefutably confirms that nature is in steep decline.” Barrett said this posed an environmental emergency for humanity, which is threatened by a triple challenge of climate, nature and food production. “There is no time to despair,” he said. “We should be hopeful that we have a window of opportunity to do something about it over these two years.” The report will sketch out possible future scenarios that will vary depending on the decisions taken by governments, businesses and individuals. The next year and a half is likely to be crucial because world leaders will agree rescue plans for nature and the climate at two big conferences at the end of 2020. That is when China will host the UN framework convention on biodiversity gathering in Kunming, which will establish new 20-year targets to replace those agreed in Aichi, Japan, in 2010. Soon after, the UN framework convention on climate change will revise Paris agreement commitments at a meeting in either the UK, Italy, Belgium or Turkey. Watson, a British professor who has headed both of the UN’s leading scientific panels, said the forthcoming report will delve more deeply than anything before into the causes of nature collapse, chief among which is the conversion of forests, wetlands and other wild landscapes into ploughed fields, dam reservoirs and concrete cities. Three-quarters of the world’s land surface has been severely altered, according to the leaked draft. Humanity is also decimating the living systems on which we depend by emitting carbon dioxide and spreading invasive species. Watson said the authors have learned from attribution science, which has transformed the debate on the climate crisis by showing how much more likely hurricanes, droughts and floods have become as a result of global heating. The goal is to persuade an audience beyond the usual green NGOs and government departments. “We need to appeal not just to environment ministers, but to those in charge of agriculture, transport and energy because they are the ones responsible for the drivers of biodiversity loss,” he said. A focus will be to move away from protection of individual species and areas, and to look at systemic drivers of change, including consumption and trade. The political environment is changing in some countries due to overwhelming scientific evidence and increasing public concern about the twin crises of nature and climate, which have prompted more than 1 million students to strike from school and led to street protests by Extinction Rebellion activists in more than a dozen countries. The UK parliament declared a climate emergency this week and the government’s chief climate advisory body recommended an accelerated plan to cut carbon emissions to zero by 2050. Until now, however, the nature crisis has been treated as far less of a priority. “Where are the headlines? Where are the emergency meetings?” asked the school strike founder, Greta Thunberg, in a recent tweet on the subject. Extinction Rebellion activists said protests that blocked several London streets last month were as much aimed at the defence of nature as stabilising the climate. “They are two sides of the same destructive coin,” said Farhana Yamin, a coordinator of the movement who is also an environmental lawyer and formerly a lead author of the IPCC report. “The work of IPBES is as crucial as the work done by the IPCC on the 1.5-degree report. That is why Extinction Rebellion is demanding an end [to] biodiversity loss and a net-zero phaseout by 2025. We can’t save humanity by only tackling climate change or only caring about biodiversity.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman publicist Dr. Cora Stephan has a very worthwhile perspective on Hans Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Chancellor Merkel’s no. 1 climate advisor.Ms Stephan is concerned about Schellnhuber’s extreme views and has good reason for that. She begins by quoting Schellnhuber on freedom of science and democracy:
Core questions such as these, and questions on human rights, deserve a place in the Constitution. That would mean there would be judges who would vote against the majority when it is right to do so in regards to our constitutional consensus. This would require a very few ethical elites.”
Stephan puts Schellnhuber’s dictator-speak in plain language:
On the subject of climate change, democracy has to be switched off in favor of control by ethical elitists because most people are too removed from the long-term future (and its possibly dying children with whom Schellnhuber likes to threaten us.”
Schellnhuber claims that a few select elites (like his mates at the PIK) can see 100+ years into the future and to assess the impacts that our actions today will have. Either we do as he tells us, or millions of future children will die. (Ironically, much of what Schellnhuber proposes means millions of children would be denied birth, so I’m not sure how unborn lives could be saved).
Ms Stephan calls Schellnhuber’s type of climate activism an attempt at creating an “above the law state of emergency”, and involves a new climate religion operated by “high priests”:
The new religion promises the Last Judgement already today – that is we endeavour one last huge and dramatic effort to save humanity from a well-deserved downfall. As is the case with other religions, the best is repentance, humility and self-restriction – preferably through emission payments without end.”

Stephan writes that the new climate religion fills a void left behind by other religions, and tells us to feel guilty about prosperity.
Eventually, we fear, we’ll have to pay the price for our prosperity – be it to God or Nature, – with Biblical plagues such as storms, huge tidal waves, floods, fire-spewing volcanoes, in short: death and demons”.
Stephan warns us not to doubt the elite prophets who have the powers, tools and instruments to see deep into the future:
The new priests who proclaim these scenarios have attracted billions of followers with their announcements of world downfall. And, like all other prophets, they do not tolerate any doubts about their predictions. Those who dare express doubt are nothing more than egotistical wretches, appeasers and trivializers, block-headed deniers or worse, or to the least paid agents of evil.”
As the climate zealotry and hysteria spread though society, it’s only logical that the obstacles that prevent necessary action, like democracy, be removed and replaced globally by an “authoritarian regime of experts”. The “projected global downfall is the state-of-emergency that justifies every measure and it distracts us from every other unfinished business. There is no alternative.”
But all is not bleak in Germany. Cora Stephan writes that “the dire projections of global gloom and doom by the climate gurus have begun to crumble”. Clever citizens know where to check up on the facts.  Trust in those in high places is melting away along with their once assumed moral authority. Indeed they’ve squandered their authority – as is always the case with individuals who over-reach.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEnjoy it while you can. I have no way of knowing if it will stay that way.Yesterday I was sure the German media were gearing up for yet another assault on science, getting ready to turn the US tornadoes into a Katrina-type event.
For example on Friday NDR public radio linked the tornadoes to man-made climate change. And there were some other similar reports from the fringes. Expecting to see more stories on tornadoes due to climate change today, I’m a bit astonished that I can’t find much in the mainstream media – amazing.
Some reports – from the fringes
Some kooky websites, like the one I mentioned yesterday, or klimaretter (“climate saviour”), who rarely bother checking scientific data and history, have chimed in. Klimaretter here for example wrote:
More than 130 tornadoes swept across the USA South and triggered the worst tornado catastrophe in decades.”
Here the author tries to make it sound like an event of Biblical proportions. Then he continues on the cause of the tornadoes:
Climatologists warn that global warming will lead to significantly more frequent and extreme weather events like heavy rains, powerful storms or droughts. This is physically based on the fact that warmer air has considerably more energy and water than cooler air.”
Another example of kooky science comes from geographer Jürgen Schönstein here at scienceblogs, who partly blames the death toll on the South’s faith in God (and Roy Spencer?), writing:
And I wouldn’t be surprised if a certain, uncontemplated and fatalistic religiousness played a role, which I observed the most often in the American South: It’s God’s will – if HE wants, then he’ll protect his sheep, and if not, then it is no use resisting His will. And whoever nurtured doubt in (climate) science from the highest positions in the USA certainly did not help to overcome this situation…”
And, though saying no one can be certain about the cause, he writes:

Still I’ll wager that we will be seeing more and more such killer storms in the USA in the coming years.”
Keep up the faith Jürgen (and keep ignoring the data).
Unlike these few nutty reports by outlets desperate for anything and everything, the mainstream media on the other hand has been remarkably SILENT. Maybe we ought not hold our breaths – that may change. The “climate masterminds” at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) are likely concocting new tales for the media. Maybe the hysteria will break out in earnest tomorrow.
But it could also be that the media and charlatan scientists have grown much more cautious with their dubious claims, which in the past have been increasingly and deservedly attacked and ridiculed by a growing number of science and social blogs and sites, e.g. here, here, here, here, here, or here. Maybe they are finding out that all their fear-mongering has been backfiring in their faces lately.
All is quiet in the mainstream media this morning
Germany’s flagship ARD television reported on the tornado in an amazingly balanced way. In its news video here the report attributes the cause of the tornadoes as follows:
Meteorologists are searching for the reason behind the scale and strength of the tornado series. On thing is clear: the weather phenomena La Nina, cold stable winds over moist cold air provided the ideal conditions for creating tornadoes.”
So tornadoes are fuelled by La Ninas (cold) and not global warming. We’ve all seen the charts- tornadoes and accumulated cyclone energy have been trending downwards for decades, and appear to be linked more to oceanic cycles.
Der Spiegel reported on the tornadoes, but did not mention anything about climate change. I found nothing much at the FAZ, Focus, Süddeutsche, and others. A Google search also produced very little.
Is this the calm before the hysteria?

Share this...FacebookTwitterPrivate meteorologist Dr. Carsten Brandt of donnerwetter.de here predicts a hot and dry barbecue summer for Central Europe.
Donnerwetter.de's summer forecast looks great for barbeques.
Graphic from: www.donnerwetter.de news, click here
But don’t worry, his forecast does not come from the Met Office, and so there is a good chance it’ll be more or less right. Indeed many of Brandt’s seasonal forecasts have been spot on – on par with Joe Bastardi’s track record. For example back in October, 2010, he predicted a cold winter – and it happened. In February, 2011, donnerwetter.de announced a nice and warm spring dominated by high pressure systems  – and that happened too.
Donnerwetter.de predicts the warm and dry conditions will persist through July with a probability of 80%. According to donnerwetter.de, this is all due to a pattern of stubborn high pressure systems taking hold over Germany over the last months, writing:
For about one year now we have been observing a change in patterns in the atmosphere over Europe. Normally the weather over Germany is characterised by powerful low pressure systems which bring lots of rain and temperature fluctuations with them. The high pressure systems are hanging out more and more often over the Mediterranean or over Eastern Europe. Over the last months there have been extremely many high pressure systems settling over Germany and Central Europe.”
Though Germans may enjoy the beautiful weather in the weeks ahead, the low amounts of precipitation are going to wreak havoc on agriculture and pose serious threats of forest fires.
What is behind the spell of dry, warm and sunny weather?
Brandt doesn’t say. From donnerwetter.de, we don’t get the “it’s yet another sign of climate change” crap that we often hear from the AGW hucksters. We can be thankful for that.

But do expect the climate alarmism hatchery that is the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK) to chime in soon, claiming that a new model had predicted it all along. Producing an after-the-fact model is the tactic they used to explain the past cold winter. So expect crap from them in the weeks ahead.
Is low solar cycle activity inducing a cooling trend?
Since solar activity has wound down over the last years, there really does seem to be some new patterns forming. Is it just a coincidence? Maybe it’s a harbinger for a climate change that most of us have not been expecting – cooling. The PDO has also gone negative and the AMO is headed in that direction. Sounds to me like cooling increasingly can’t be ruled out. Let’s watch how long the La Nina conditions persist.
Accuweather, without Joe Bastardi, botched its Europe spring forecast
Interestingly, Accuweather’s spring forecast for Germany/Central Europe, made on March 18, looks like a real Met Office act, i.e. COMPLETELY  WRONG! In March Accuweather predicted:
U.K., Ireland and Germany to be Stormy, Unsettled
The overall position of the jet stream with a ridge over Spain and North Africa this spring should tend to steer storm systems into the U.K., Ireland and Germany.”
Actually, pretty much just the opposite has and is occurring. Makes you wonder if they’ll be begging Joe Bastardi to come back. According to the latest World Meteorological Organisation report:
The United Kingdom had extremely dry conditions in March and April especially in its southeastern parts and experienced its driest March since 1953. The other parts of western and central Europe all had a dry February, March and April. 2011 was up to now one of the driest 10 years in nearly whole Switzerland since 1864.”

"The Scottish government has dropped controversial plans to cut its taxes on aviation after Nicola Sturgeon declared last week the world faces a climate emergency. Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, said cutting air passenger duty would be incompatible with its new pledge to cut Scotland’s carbon emissions to net zero by 2045.  The Scottish government faced intense cross-party pressure to keep the levy in place after Sturgeon accepted recommendations from the UK committee on climate change (CCC) last week that Scotland should adopt a 2045 target date. Chris Stark, chief executive of the CCC, told the Guardian cutting the levy would undermine efforts to combat climate change by making it harder for Scotland to reduce its overall emissions.  Keeping the tax in place “would help immensely with the emissions challenge there is in Scotland” he said. The CCC recommended the UK government should aim for a UK-wide net zero target of 2050, five years later than Scotland. The CCC believes Scotland has far greater scope to sequestrate its CO2 emissions by planting forests and to capture and store CO2 in disused North Sea oil fields. Critics of the proposed aviation tax cut, which the Scottish National party had pledged to introduce in successive elections, said reducing the levy by 50% would increase CO2 emissions from aviation in Scotland by at least 60,000 tonnes and cut tax income by about £150m. That figure did not account for the sharp increase in flying which Scotland’s airports hoped that would lead to; Scotland’s enterprise agencies also provide subsidies to airlines such as Ryanair, and the government owns Prestwick airport, which is heavily indebted, and small airports in the Highlands and islands. The Scottish government has faced a long delay implementing the policy after running into unforeseen problems with EU rules on state aid but Ryanair and BA, and Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, had pressed the Scottish government to cut the levy. Cunningham announced the switch before a Scottish Labour party-sponsored debate on retaining air passenger duty in Holyrood tomorrow. She said the Scottish government’s change of stance highlighted the need for all parties to support radical measures to reduce CO2 emissions, including a tax on parking spaces at workplaces which Labour opposes. Colin Smyth, Scottish Labour’s transport spokesman, said this policy should have been reversed years ago. Patrick Harvie, the co-convenor of the Scottish Green party, said: “Greens have led the case against this ill thought out tax giveaway from the moment it was first proposed, so we very much welcome the Scottish government’s huge U-turn.” The Greens will be pressing for an even tougher net zero target date of 2040, tabling amendments to the new climate bill going through Holyrood. Gordon Dewar, the chief executive of Edinburgh airport, was furious about the decision, accusing Scottish ministers of hypocrisy for continuing to support Prestwick airport, which owes the taxpayer more than £40m. He said airlines were already cutting their emissions by supporting carbon offsetting. “We’ve gone from personal commitments to all-out cancellation in the space of just two weeks, which shows just how reactionary this decision is. It does not show leadership and means airports and airlines have been led down a path of failed promises for three years by this Scottish government,” Dewar said."

German daily Bild, which has more readers than the WSJ, USA Today and NYT combined,  reports that cats leave huge carbon paw-prints and so make a significant contribution to climate change. Each househiold cat is repsonsible for the emissions of 2.2 tons of CO2 annually.
The information is based on a story appearing in health magazine Healthy Living and on a study from climate company ClimatePartner.
According to Bild, internet portal utopia.de tested the impacts of five different pets on climate. Bild writes:
Catfood, cat litter, waste… every cat leads to 2.2 tons of CO2 emissions annually. No other house pet leaves such a terrible ecological paw-print.
Just the manufacture of cat food and its packing leads to about one ton of CO2 per cat. The waste disposal of food cans and cat litter burdens the climate with an additional 1250 kg of carbon dioxide. Then you have to include the water consumption for cleaning the cat potty.”
The house cat is an even bigger climate sinner than a dog, says Bild.
What pet ought one keep if concerned about impacting the climate? The study says the canary bird is the ideal pet to keep, emitting only 0.028 tons of CO2 annually.
According to Wikipedia: “Cats are a common companion animal in Europe and North America, and their worldwide population exceeds 500 million.” That comes out to a billion tons of CO2 just on the account of cats. That’s the same as 100 million Europeans. Time to call the exterminator. Hey – it’s either them, or us.
Of course Bild reminds us that cats themselves are not really the problem, but people who keep them. Bild writes: “Humans by far are worse for the climate”.

"Tony Abbott has bet me $100 that in 10 years’ time the climate will not have changed. When I found myself in a Manly coffee shop last week being offered the bet, I was incredulous. Abbott was smiling, charmingly dismissive. This person with the power to help steer the world away from anthropogenic disaster wasn’t having a bar of my concerns about climate change. He wasn’t going to help; he was going to wield his status and wealth to show how confident he was in his position of not doing anything.  He was going to prove he disagreed with climate science, with the majority of Australian voters and with the mother of a six-year-old who had just literally begged him to take the climate emergency seriously, with a jocular bet. No doubt he expected me to laugh and back down. And maybe I should have, amazed and insulted beyond belief. Maybe I should have said instead (as my husband suggested when I got home) “I’m not going to bet $100. Bet me something substantial, like your electorate, or all your power, so that you’ll actually be motivated to work to save the climate.” But all I could think of at the time was that Abbott was eager to go on record as a) completely ignorant of climate science and b) completely dismissive of a parent and her concerns for her child’s future. I agreed to the bet. The bet had come about when I went to meet my Sydney cousin at a coffee shop where I discovered that Abbott had chosen the same place to have lunch. Children striking for climate action, inspired by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, were wrapping up a protest outside his office round the corner. Meanwhile, my cousin texted to say she was running late. Very late. I realised I was now faced with the prospect of waiting alone for her in a very small space, metres away from Abbott, whose views on the need for urgent climate action are diametrically opposed to my own. The tension (on my part) was excruciating. Abbott and the friend he was with, on the other hand, appeared relaxed, and I was even able to discover that the famous “ha-ha-ha!” laugh is not an affectation for the media. I considered leaving, but then realised I had the opportunity to speak personally to Abbott as an Australian voter. But what to say? I didn’t want to lecture him and then go back and sit down. I didn’t think I could say anything that would cut through his loyalty to the coal industry and his reluctance to take the threat of climate change seriously, so I decided just to speak to him and put myself on the record as having registered a protest against his inaction. I went over to his table and said, “Hi, excuse me for interrupting your lunch.” Abbott and his associate were gracious, until I began, “I have a six-year-old daughter.” Abbott’s smile stiffened a little and his face closed slightly. I said, “The IPCC report tells us that we have 12 years to deal with climate change. In 12 years’ time she’ll be 18. I had to speak to you on her behalf and beg you to take climate change and her future seriously.” Abbott launched into a well-rehearsed rebuff about how my daughter and I wouldn’t be very well off in the future if I lost my job and our industries closed down. While I responded internally about a just transition from coal to renewables, he was adding something about trying for a balance – which seemed a new, somewhat less hardline approach than his previous utter denial of the need for change, and indeed, of climate change itself. Could the massive worldwide push for climate action and the approaching election be persuading him at least to pay lip service to the concept of tackling climate change? But I continued, making a gesture showing a severely unbalanced scale pointing straight down. “It seems to me things are already very unbalanced, with the scales weighing towards a complete emergency,” I said. Abbott said “I disagree” and went on to say a bit more about how other countries weren’t doing their bit. I interrupted him and said, “I know you disagree. I just wanted to go on record as having asked you to take climate change seriously. I want to be able to tell my daughter in the future that I took a shot when I had the chance.” At this point, the encounter took a turn for the bizarre. He offered to bet me $100 the climate would not change in 10 years and I accepted. There was some debate about the wording. I said “the climate won’t change” was extremely broad. Abbott suggested “we won’t all be frying” (I’m from South Australia and having survived multiple heatwaves this summer, including a record-breaking 46.7C day, I beg to differ). Showing an outrageous ignorance of climate science for someone in his position, Abbott mused, “Maybe it will have gone up by about half a degree ... ” “Half a degree is huge!” I countered, horrified. In the end the broad wording of “the climate won’t change in 10 years” was agreed on. We shook hands. Abbott’s associate wrote it down and witnessed it and we both signed.  Afterwards I donated $100 to the Australian Youth Climate Coalition. I gave away my winnings 10 years in advance because I knew I’d won this ridiculous, offensive bet as soon as it was made. Even if Abbott and the Liberal party do a 180-degree turn away from supporting coal, even if they embrace renewables tomorrow, the debt from fossil fuels previously released into the atmosphere will be paid in increased warming for decades to come, let alone 10 years. And if they do as Abbott’s bet predicts, which is exactly nothing, because they don’t understand or they don’t care that the climate is in freefall, and they tell everyone that they plan to do nothing, while smiling and joking, then surely, surely, the Australian public will do something on 18 May. Of course, I’ll be back to collect my winnings in 2029. My daughter will be 16 then, the same age as Greta Thunberg is today. I hope she’ll join me.

"I grew up in a remote mining town. I know the hardship. I saw the tragedy. One of my earliest memories is a whole town stopped for a miner’s funeral, family after family lining the main street, one people joined in grief. And when politicians talk of caring about miners I don’t believe a word they say.  If they cared wouldn’t they be advocating to end black lung disease, a 19th century industrial disease now returned, because of unsafe working conditions, to kill Australian coalminers in the 21st century? If they cared wouldn’t they be speaking out about the increasing casualisation and pay stripping of coalminers, supported by the Morrison government?And if they cared wouldn’t they question whether Adani is an appropriate business to employ Australian miners? Adani, such a friend of the working man that, when building its giant Shantigram luxury estate in India, it housed workers in conditions so appalling that there were 15 recorded outbreaks of cholera.Put a hi-vis jacket on that corpse and say you’re still for the working miners of Queensland, Scott.But then Adani’s long-term aim isn’t to employ miners under whatever pitiful conditions and awards its paid-up political mates might legislate. As Adani Mining’s CEO said in 2016, “When we ramp up the mine, everything will be autonomous from mine to port. In our eyes, this is the mine of the future.” That’s right: Adani’s ambition is ultimately that its mine is all robots. Not a miner, not a driller, not a driver in sight. So the promised 10,000 jobs that turned out to be 1,462 jobs will in turn vanish like the mist as Adani buys in ever more robots. But that’s not all. Modelling by Wood Mackenzie shows that if coalmining in the Galilee Basin, led by Adani, goes ahead, coal production in older, less efficient Australian coalmines will drop significantly and many coalmining jobs will vanish. Adani’s new mine will simply steal the jobs off the old mines. Jabbering jobs, jobs, jobs, in a hard hat doesn’t change these truths. It doesn’t make a politician fair dinkum. It makes him or her a lying clown who sells every coalminer down the drain for another backhander from the bosses of the fossil fuel industry. The coalmining communities of Australia deserve better. They deserve the truth. They need a responsible transition plan, not lies and deceit. Because Adani’s mine is not happening to help miners. It’s not happening to help Clermont or Mackay or far-north Queensland. It’s certainly not happening to help the poor of India. It’s happening because of one thing: greed. And that greed controls our politics. How can Scott Morrison claim to care about climate change when his political survival now hinges on a deal with Clive Palmer, a man whose own massive Galilee Basin coalmine is dependent on Adani getting up? What exactly did Scott Morrison promise Palmer? The Liberals’ platform is nothing more than a smoking coal heap. Forty-one years ago, I had just kayaked through a beautiful gorge on the Franklin River called Irenabyss. The Franklin was to be dammed and though there was opposition to the damming, no one I knew believed it was possible to defeat the all-powerful state and federal governments that were at the time hell-bent on building it. The gorge opened out into small basin. At its rainforested edge there was a beach. I kayaked over to it and a lanky man appeared out of the rainforest. And there, on the banks of that beautiful, doomed river, I met Bob Brown. I asked Bob did he really think the river could be saved. His answer was revealing. I think, he said, that there is hope. And this is what I learned from Bob Brown. The battle for that river raged for another four years. Governments came and went. At every step it looked like we had lost, and yet, what we could not see was that at every stop we were growing stronger. Thousands of people went to prison in the biggest act of civil disobedience in Australian history. In the end the government was spending countless millions to get heavy machinery into that remote rainforest to destroy as much a possible to make that dam inevitable. And at the very last moment, the high court ruled the dam could not go ahead. I am here today to say that there is hope. That the Franklin flows free and Adani will be stopped. These things happen because at a certain point enough people say there are things that matter more than politics or money. There is no power on this earth that can resist an idea whose time has come. I am not going to waste your time today repeating the many facts with which you are already familiar, suffice to say one thing: the IPCC last October said we had 12 years to contain climate change – that is, decarbonise our economy so that the temperature rises no more than another half a degree on what it is today. If large-scale action is not taken now the IPCC warned that we will face a global warming catastrophe. More than half a year of that 12 years has already passed without any meaningful national or international action. Our emissions are still rising. And that is why this is a crisis unlike any we have ever faced. On present trends much of Australia will become, quite simply, uninhabitable. And what remains liveable will be small bands of our country. We will not have the means to generate the food we need, the wealth we are accustomed to. The most recent science suggests that around the world up to one million species on which we depend for food and clean water face annihilation, that the planet’s very life support systems are entering a danger zone. This is not science fiction. This is not a Netflix series. It is what the world’s leading scientists tell us. The moment for believing this is a matter that can be solved by flying less or not eating meat has long passed. The solution will not be about personal choices. It will be about – and can only be about – political change. And that change will not come about because of a messianic leader. It will not come about because of this party or that party. It will only happen if we wish it to happen and if we make it happen. We have only ourselves to blame and we have only ourselves to turn to save ourselves. It matters very much who you vote for this election. And after May 18 it matters even more to press whoever wins to recognise this crisis is not an issue. It is the issue. The drying out of Australia is the issue. The collapse of our fisheries is the issue. The likelihood of not having enough water to sustain our population is the issue. The threat greater and greater mega-fires pose is the issue. The decline of our agriculture is the issue. The inability of our infrastructure to cope with ever-larger floods and more frequent cyclones is the issue. Sea rises are the issue. The death of our rivers, the death of the Great Barrier Reef, the death of the Tasmanian rainforests is the issue. The drying wheatbelt is the issue. If our very fate as a species is not the issue, then what is? And that is why Adani has become the symbol of why our country is broken. That is why the fight against Adani is a fight for the soul of our country. I know many of you may feel that you have no power, or lack the skills or abilities needed. Faced with the crisis that is climate change it is too easy to feel powerless, to feel the problem is beyond your powers or perhaps anyone’s to influence. Perhaps the greatest problem we face is not climate change, but the myth of our own powerlessness. We believe only the most powerful – the politicians, the corporations – can change our world. Accordingly, we feel a great despair about our future because we can see no hope in any politician or any corporation. But it is not so. Because the only thing that will save us is us. Half of the carbon in the atmosphere was put there by us in the last 30 years. And now we have 11 and a half years to reverse that disastrous act. It is a time to act and it is for us to act. Because there is no one else and there is no other time. And if our politicians continue to deceive themselves and deceive us, if after May 18 we end up with a government that will not act, and if we are only left with only our bodies to oppose this mine, if it takes putting our flesh between the past and the future, between the bulldozers and the earth, if it means a blockade of the Adani site, then I, for one, will be there. And if that means being arrested and going to jail then I will go to jail. And my question to you today is this: will you? Will you stand with me, will you go to jail with me, to stop this mine and save our future? Because if you will, I ask you to raise your hand. I tell you this: we will win. The Franklin was more than a river. Adani is more than a mine. This rally, you people, are part of the river of hope that flows through this country, our beloved country, and it is a river that cannot be bought, that cannot be dammed, that cannot be poisoned, that cannot be bought and sold. And every day that river grows larger and stronger. And I am hopeful. Why? Because 41 years ago I met a man who refused to abandon hope and led a movement with such moral clarity that the river still flows. And 41 years later I stand here before you, with that same man, to say that hope is never lost. Never. Never. Never.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe global warming movement is all about energy starvation – with the aim of denying humanity access to the cheapest and most readily available forms of energy.The restriction of energy eventually makes whatever energy that is left on the market so expensive that it risks becoming unaffordable to the large majority of the world’s poor people. The result: Many of the poor will simply die because of the consequences of energy deprivation.
After all, it was Hans Schellnhuber who called determining that the “carrying capacity of the planet to be less than a billion people” one of the triumphs of science, read here.
One way to help deny energy to humanity is to deny populations the use of the huge reserves of the now easily extractable tar sands in Canada. Activists are now gearing up to pressure Obama stop this supply of fuel.
This is what German alarmist site klimaretter.de (which means “climate saviour.de” in German) here encourages, namely blocking the Keystone XL continental pipeline extension that is in the works to transport the valuable tar sand petroleum product from Canada to US markets. Klimaretter labels the pipeline: “Pipeline for climate killer oil”.
Solid bitumen in the sands
Tar sands are heavy bitumen found in the soils of northern Canada. Anywhere else, bitumen oozing openly in the environment would be considered an environmental hazard and any efforts to clean it up would be welcome. But not if the clean-up means supplying the USA with cheap and reliable energy. Klimaretter claims tar sand “is considered extremely environmentally and climate-damaging” and that “studies presume that its oil causes 5 times more greenhouse gases than conventional oil”.

Activists demand that it all be stopped. One way to stop, at least hinder, tar sand extraction would be to shut down the planned pipeline extension from Canada to Texas. Klimaretter says that the USA is greedily wringing its hands as it eyes these riches, claiming that the “fatal impacts on climate change are being gladly ignored”.
James Hansen, says klimaretter, warns of these “fatal” consequences. Klimaretter quotes the eccentric NASA scientist:
The known climate scientist James Hansen emphasizes that the extraction of tar sands would increase the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by 50%. ‘When the development of the tar sands continues, then it means “game over for the climate,’ says Hansen.”
Bill McKibben chimes in saying that Obama could stop the pipeline expansion. Klimaretter quotes:
‘In this matter the President has full control in that he can issue permission or refuse it,’ says Bill McKibben, founder of  350.org.”
With the US economy still in shambles and Obama looking out for the poor folks, it’ll be interesting to see what Obama decides. Poor people desperately need cheap and reliable energy –  so does prosperity. And looking at the climate, the scientific data clearly shows that CO2 has only a minor impact, if any, on the climate.

First, don’t let anyone tell you that renewable energy is not a hot growth sector – at least that’s what Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine Westphalia, would like you to believe. What follows is yet another example of tricks used by climate scientists, media, governments and green proponents. We’ve seen this kind of slithery behaviour time and again before.
Hat-tip: Science Skeptical blog.
The government of North Rhine Westphalia has a graphic to show you. In the chart that follows, the horizontal curve shows the consumption of primary energy in the state. The hockey stick shape curve shows the consumption of renewable energy in the supposedly fast-becoming green state of North Rhine Westphalia.

Holy moly you might think at first glance – renewable energy is the business to get in on! Look – it has actually surpassed the consumption of old, dirty primary energy.
But take a closer look at the vertical scales. The left hand vertical axis is the scale for the consumption of primary energy, while the right hand axis is the scale for renewable energy consumption. It just happens that the left scale is about 25 times bigger than the right one.

While the graphic is not telling a lie, it certainly is misleading and manipulative. The author used a clever “trick” to hide the disproportion. What happens if both variables use the same scale? Here’s what the real story looks like.

Yawn. Suddenly one sees that reality is much less dramatic. Of course the first graphic is intentionally presented in a misleading way in order to manipulate general audiences.
Next item: Green Party leader begs Germans to fly to Tunisia.
Dirk Maxeiner here brings our attention to German Green Party Chief Claudia Roth’s plead that Germans fly to Tunisia for their summer holidays. Maxeiner’s question is: “Well, is flying now good or bad? The answer of course is that it is good only when Claudia tells you it is.
As Tunisia tries to regain political stability, German tourists have been wary to book holidays in the sunny north African country. During a visit in Tunis, Ms Roth tried to reassure the German public all is now okay in Tunisia:
Those who wish to make holidays ought to come to Tunisia – this is a way of support.”
She is de facto advocating that people produce lots of CO2 to boost the Tunisian economy. I thought using less CO2 was supposed to lead to new economic growth and green jobs. Depends which scale one uses, I guess.

"A colleague recently described how fish would swim into her clothing when she was a child bathing in the ocean off the coast of Vietnam, but today the fish are gone and her children find the story far-fetched. Another recalled his experiences just last year in Cape Town – one of the world’s most attractive tourism and leisure destinations – when more than 2 million people faced the nightmare prospect of all taps, in every home and business, running dry. These instances, on opposite sides of the world, are two faces of the same problem; the relentless pressure we are putting on biodiversity and the contributions that nature makes to our wellbeing, and the way we humans are changing the Earth’s climate. The rich variety of nature provides us with the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe, and countless moments of personal inspiration spent in forests and mountains, exploring beaches and rivers, or even listening to a simple birdsong in a quiet moment. We have all assumed that nature would always be here for us and our children. However, our boundless consumption, shortsighted reliance on fossil fuels and our unsustainable use of nature now seriously threaten our future. Environmentalists, scientists and indigenous peoples have been sounding the alarm for decades. Our understanding of the overexploitation of the planet has advanced with grim, sharp clarity over that time. We have entered an era of rapidly accelerating species extinction, and are facing the irreversible loss of plant and animal species, habitats and vital crops, while coming face to face with the horrific impacts of global climate change. In 2018 alone, there were deadly heatwaves across Europe and south-east Asia, while the US experienced floods and wildfires. Insurance companies went under, unable to bear the costs of rebuilding after extreme weather events. There is a rising wave of collective anger and anxiety. The spectre of such environmental damage has caused grave concern, especially among global youth, about our inability to sustain our health, productivity, security and wellbeing. New realities have pulled back the curtain and exposed initiatives such as the banning of plastic straws as the drop in the ocean they truly are when it comes to protecting the future for ourselves, our children and all the species with which we share our planet. We must now consider the animals, insects, plants and all the places in which they live. Despite the profound threat of biodiversity loss, it is climate change that has long been considered the most pressing environmental concern. That changed this week in Paris, when representatives from 130 nations approved the most comprehensive assessment of global biodiversity ever undertaken. The report, spearheaded by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), found that nature is being eroded at rates unprecedented in human history. One million species are currently threatened with extinction and we are undermining the entire natural infrastructure on which our modern world depends. Nature powers human endeavours – underpinning productivity, culture and even our beliefs and identities. But our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide are under threat. We are exploiting nature faster than it can replenish itself. The IPBES assessment has shown the strong interrelationship between climate change, the loss of biodiversity and human wellbeing. Climate change has been identified as a primary driver of biodiversity loss, already altering every part of nature. Likewise, the loss of biodiversity contributes to climate change, for example when we destroy forests we emit carbon dioxide, the major “human-produced” greenhouse gas. We cannot solve the threats of human-induced climate change and loss of biodiversity in isolation. We either solve both or we solve neither. The IPBES report shows that governments and businesses are nowhere close to doing enough. The world is on track to miss the targets of the Paris agreement, the Aichi biodiversity targets and 80% of the UN sustainable development goals (food, water and energy security), because of our poor stewardship of the natural world. However, the good news is that there are many policies and technologies that will limit global temperature rise and address the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. These will also offer our last, best chance to limit human-induced climate change and preserve the greatest amount of biodiversity possible. The way we produce and use energy, and farm, use our soils, protect coastal ecosystems and treat our forests will make or break our future, but it can also help us have a better quality of life. We still have time – though very limited – to turn things around. It won’t be easy. It requires massive changes, from removing subsidies that lead to the destruction of nature and future warming of the Earth, to enacting laws that encourage the protection of nature; from reducing our growing addiction to fossil-fuel energy and natural resource consumption, to rethinking the definition of a rewarding life. Our current agricultural system is broken. If we keep producing food using current unsustainable agricultural practices, we will undermine future food production. But we already have more than enough food to go around. Today 815 million people go to bed hungry, 38 million more than in 2015. Yet, if food waste were a country, its emissions would rank third in the world, after China and the US, producing 8% of manmade emissions. We need to redirect government subsidies towards more sustainable and regenerative farming. This will not only contribute towards absorbing carbon and reducing the emissions of other greenhouse gases, it can also halt a frightening trajectory where farmland is so overloaded that eventually it just stops growing crops. We simply cannot afford the cost of inaction. Change of the magnitude required will mean a different life for everyone, but the costs of doing nothing will be much higher. The G7 environment ministers, currently meeting in France, have the opportunity to return to their capitals with the freshly approved IPBES report. The world needs them to reflect our current level of crisis at the heads of state meeting later this year. The UK parliament has endorsed a motion to declare a formal climate and environment emergency, which is a start, but action and budgets from governments and business will need to follow. As policymakers around the world grapple with the twin threats of climate change and biodiversity loss, it is essential that they understand the linkages between the two so that their decisions and actions address both. The world needs to recognise that loss of biodiversity and human-induced climate change are not only environmental issues, but development, economic, social, security, equity and moral issues as well. The future of humanity depends on action now. If we do not act, our children and all future generations will never forgive us. • Sir Robert Watson is chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), and former chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)"

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve had a number of things that have kept me from blogging over the last couple of days, and so I’m happy to have something quick today. Although it’s on the light side, it is profoundly true and insightful. This ought not be a surprise, though, as it comes from a profoundly insightful and critical mind.
Science cabaret artist and physicist Vince Ebert is featured in an interview at the online Schweizer Monat (Swiss Month) and gives his impressions on science, hypocrisy, and depressed polar bears. Hat tip: www.achgut.com/.
In a nutshell, Ebert claims Einstein, Planck and Schrödinger have got to be rolling in their graves as a reaction to how climate science is run today. The following are some excerpts of the interview from the part on climate science.
On the role freedom plays in science
Science is open to results. Experiments are made to refute theories and to improve. Someone can come along tomorrow and prove the theory of relativity is false. Suppose a biologist claps his hands near a fly, and it flies away. Then he takes a second fly, rips off its wings, claps his hands and discovers: Flies go deaf when you rip out their wings. Every new experiment can produce new knowledge. So a scientist can never say: “The problem is solved”.

There are complex interactions that you simply cannot broadly explain. That’s why it annoys me when someone just comes along and believes he can explain such highly complex systems as climate change through the media, and trumpet it as irrevocable truth.”
On the “arrogance of science”
One should accept one’s own lack of knowledge and consider it as part of the process. Certainly many scientists are torpedoing this mindset. With climate change, many specialists and experts appear not as scientists, but rather as politicians. They come over, having studied physics, and actually claim: “The discussion is over.” And that when it is impossible to falsify their models! Einstein, Planck and Schrödinger have got to be rolling in their graves.”
On climate scientists and the public
Climate research is really a mine field here. Climate scientists get no funding when they say: “Actually, everything is not really that bad, and our models really are not able to predict the future”. On the other hand, a lot of money flows to those who claim: “Let us explain what your climate will look like in 20 years”. Many scientists are jumping on this bandwagon. Who can blame them!”

"Human society is in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems, the world’s leading scientists have warned, as they announced the results of the most thorough planetary health check ever undertaken. From coral reefs flickering out beneath the oceans to rainforests desiccating into savannahs, nature is being destroyed at a rate tens to hundreds of times higher than the average over the past 10m years, according to the UN global assessment report. The biomass of wild mammals has fallen by 82%, natural ecosystems have lost about half their area and a million species are at risk of extinction – all largely as a result of human actions, said the study, compiled over three years by more than 450 scientists and diplomats. Two in five amphibian species are at risk of extinction, as are one-third of reef-forming corals, and close to one-third of other marine species. The picture for insects – which are crucial to plant pollination – is less clear, but conservative estimates suggest at least one in 10 are threatened with extinction and, in some regions, populations have crashed. In economic terms, the losses are jaw-dropping. Pollinator loss has put up to $577bn (£440bn) of crop output at risk, while land degradation has reduced the productivity of 23% of global land. The knock-on impacts on humankind, including freshwater shortages and climate instability, are already “ominous” and will worsen without drastic remedial action, the authors said. “The health of the ecosystems on which we and other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We are eroding the very foundations of economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide,” said Robert Watson, the chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (Ibpes). “We have lost time. We must act now.” The warning was unusually stark for a UN report that has to be agreed by consensus across all nations. Hundreds of scientists have compiled 15,000 academic studies and reports from indigenous communities living on the frontline of change. They build on the millennium ecosystem assessment of 2005, but go much further by looking not just at an inventory of species, but the web of interactions between biodiversity, climate and human wellbeing. Over the past week, representatives from the world’s governments have fine-tuned the summary for policymakers, which includes remedial scenarios, such as “transformative change” across all areas of government, revised trade rules, massive investments in forests and other green infrastructure, and changes in individual behaviour such as lower consumption of meat and material goods. Following school strikes, Extinction Rebellion protests, the UK parliament’s declaration of a climate emergency and Green New Deal debates in the US and Spain, the authors hope the 1,800-page assessment of biodiversity will push the nature crisis into the global spotlight in the same way climate breakdown has surged up the political agenda since the 1.5C report last year by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. David Obura, one of the main authors on the report and a global authority on corals, said: “We tried to document how far in trouble we are to focus people’s minds, but also to say it is not too late if we put a huge amount into transformational behavioural change. This is fundamental to humanity. We are not just talking about nice species out there; this is our life-support system.” The report shows a planet in which the human footprint is so large it leaves little space for anything else. Three-quarters of all land has been turned into farm fields, covered by concrete, swallowed up by dam reservoirs or otherwise significantly altered. Two-thirds of the marine environment has also been changed by fish farms, shipping routes, subsea mines and other projects. Three-quarters of rivers and lakes are used for crop or livestock cultivation. As a result, more than 500,000 species have insufficient habitats for long-term survival. Many are on course to disappear within decades. In May 2019, the most comprehensive study of life on Earth ever undertaken was released by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). The report was compiled from more than 1,500 academic papers and reports from indigenous groups. The overall message is that the world’s life support systems, on which humans depend, are in trouble. Remedies are possible, but they require urgent, transformative action because policies until now have failed to halt the tide of human-made extinctions. The authors hope the mega-report will guide policymakers and generate public discussion on biodiversity (including wildlife, food crops, livestock and ecosystems) in the same way that the climate debate is shaped by reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The report also examines five main drivers of unprecedented biodiversity and ecosystem change over the past 50 years, identifying them as: changes in land and sea use; direct exploitation of organisms; climate change; pollution; and invasion of alien species. Eduardo Brondizio, an Ibpes co-chair from Indiana University Bloomington, said: “We have been displacing our impact around the planet from frontier to frontier. But we are running out of frontiers … If we see business as usual going forward then we’ll see a very fast decline in the ability of nature to provide what we need and to buffer climate change.” Agriculture and fishing are the primary causes of the deterioration. Food production has increased dramatically since the 1970s, which has helped feed a growing global population and generated jobs and economic growth. But this has come at a high cost. The meat industry has a particularly heavy impact. Grazing areas for cattle account for about 25% of the world’s ice-free land and more than 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Crop production uses 12% of land and creates less than 7% of emissions. The study paints a picture of a suffocating human-caused sameness spreading across the planet, as a small range of cash crops and high-value livestock are replacing forests and other nature-rich ecosystems. As well as eroding the soil, which causes a loss of fertility, these monocultures are more vulnerable to disease, drought and other impacts of climate breakdown. In terms of habitats, the deepest loss is of wetlands, which have drained by 83% since 1700, with a knock-on impact on water quality and birdlife. Forests are diminishing, particularly in the tropics. In the first 13 years of this century, the area of intact forest fell by 7%, bigger than France and the UK combined. Although the overall rate of deforestation has slowed, this is partly an accounting trick, as monoculture plantations replace biodiverse jungle and woodland. Oceans are no longer a sanctuary. Only 3% of marine areas are free from human pressure. Industrial fishing takes place in more than half the world’s oceans, leaving one-third of fish populations overexploited. Climate change, pollution and invasive species have had a relatively low impact, but these factors are accelerating. Emissions continue to rise. Last week, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere passed the 415 parts per million mark for the first time. Even if global heating can be kept within the Paris agreement target of 1.5C to 2C, the ranges of most species will shrink profoundly, the paper warns. Population growth is noted as a factor, along with inequality. Individuals in the developed world have four times as much of an economic footprint as those in the poorest countries, and the gap is growing. Our species now extracts 60bn tons of resources each year, almost double the amount in 1980, though the world population has grown by only 66% in that time. The report notes how the discharges are overwhelming the Earth’s capacity to absorb them. More than 80% of wastewater is pumped into streams, lakes and oceans without treatment, along with 300m-400m tons of heavy metals, toxic slurry and other industrial discharges. Plastic waste has risen tenfold since 1980, affecting 86% of marine turtles, 44% of seabirds and 43% of marine mammals. Fertiliser run-off has created 400 “dead zones”, affecting an area the size of the UK. Andy Purvis, a professor at the Natural History Museum in London and one of the main authors of the report, said he was encouraged nations had agreed on the need for bitter medicine. “This is the most thorough, most detailed and most extensive planetary health check. The take-home message is that we should have gone to the doctor sooner. We are in a bad way. The society we would like our children and grandchildren to live in is in real jeopardy. I cannot overstate it,” he said. “If we leave it to later generations to clear up the mess, I don’t think they will forgive us.” The next 18 months will be crucial. For the first time, the issue of biodiversity loss is on the G8 agenda. The UK has commissioned Partha Dasgupta, a professor at Cambridge University, to write a study on the economic case for nature, which is expected to serve a similar function as the Stern review on the economics of climate change. Next year, China will host a landmark UN conference to draw up new global goals for biodiversity. Cristiana Pașca Palmer, the head of the UN’s chief biodiversity organisation, said she was both concerned and hopeful. “The report today paints quite a worrying picture. The danger is that we put the planet in a position where it is hard to recover,” she said. “But there are a lot of positive things happening. Until now, we haven’t had the political will to act. But public pressure is high. People are worried and want action.” The report acknowledges current conservation strategies, such as the creation of protected areas, are well-intended but inadequate. Future forecasts indicate negative trends will continue in all scenarios except those that embrace radical change across society, politics, economics and technology. It says values and goals need to change across governments so local, national and international policymakers are aligned to tackle the underlying causes of planetary deterioration. This includes a shift in incentives, investments in green infrastructure, accounting for nature deterioration in international trade, addressing population growth and unequal levels of consumption, greater cooperation across sectors, new environmental laws and stronger enforcement. Greater support for indigenous communities and other forest dwellers and smallholders is also essential. Many of the last holdouts for nature are in areas managed by such groups, but even here, the pressures are beginning to take a toll, as wildlife declines along with knowledge of how to manage it. Josef Settele, an Ipbes co-chair and entomologist at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Germany, said: “The situation is tricky and difficult but I would never give up. The report shows there is a way out. I believe we can still bend the curve. “People shouldn’t panic, but they should begin drastic change. Business as usual with small adjustments won’t be enough.” • This article was amended on 12 June 2019 because Eduardo Brondizio is from Indiana University Bloomington, not Indiana State University as an earlier version said.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you wish to bail out someone in dire financial straits, then you’ll want to make sure that the party receiving the bailout funds will break its old spending habits and not continue its wasteful ways.
This is the case with insolvent Portugal, as the IMF, European Commission and the European Central Bank prepare a bailout package for the country. These bailout institutions are demanding that Portugal, among other measures, take a hard look at all its renewable expensive energy subsidies.
The author of the climate website Ecotretas informs us that the offical Portugal-bailout Memorandum Of Understanging (MOU) has been released by the above-named institutes. You can read it HERE.
Here we have the de facto financial branch of the European Union certifying that renewable energies are financially non-sustainable – a waste of money. Yes, so-called sustainability helps lead to fiscal non-sustainability.
The relevant parts on energy are on pages 24 and 25. Under Additional costs associated with electricity production under the ordinary regime; the conditions call for (emphasis added):
5.6. Take measures in order to limit the additional cost associated with the production of electricityunder the ordinary regime, in particular through renegotiation or downward revision of the guaranteed compensation mechanism (CMEC) paid to producers under the ordinary regime and the remaining long-term power-purchase agreements (PPAs). [Q4-2011]
And written under Support schemes for production of energy under the special regime (cogeneration and renewables):
5.7. Review the efficiency of support schemes for co-generation and propose possible options for adjusting downward the feed-in tariff used in co-generation (reduce the implicit subsidy) [Q4-2011]
5.8. Review in a report the efficiency of support schemes for renewables, covering their rationale, their levels, and other relevant design elements.[Q4-2011]
5.9. For existing contracts in renewables, assess in a report the possibility of agreeing a renegotiation of the contracts in view of a lower feed-in tariff. [Q4-2011]
5.10. For new contracts in renewables, revise downward the feed-in tariffs and ensure that the tariffs do not over-compensate producers for their costs and they continue to provide an incentive to reduce costs further, through digressive tariffs. For more mature technologies develop alternative mechanisms (such as feed-in premiums). Reports on action taken will be provided annually in Q3-2011, Q3-2012 and Q3-2013.
5.11. Decisions on future investments in renewables, in particular in less mature technologies,will be based on a rigorous analysis in terms of its costs and consequences for energy prices. International benchmarks should be used for the analysis and an independent evaluation should be carried out. Reports on action taken will be provided annually in Q3-2011, Q3-2012 and Q3-2013.
In a nutshell, for Portugal to stop wasting money on renewables, as the IMF, EC and ECB request, the country really ought to stop renewables altogether. Obviously renewable energy are for rich countries who have money to burn. But when you’re broke – then you ought to stop using it.
After all in the end, what good is “energy sustainability” if it leads the world to real financial ruin?

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week I wrote about Hans Schellnhuber, Climate Advisor to Angela Merkel, and his yet-to-be unveiled  “Masterplan” written by him and his all knowing master elitists on the German Advisory Council on Global Change.
Looking a little deeper we find a strategy paper written last April, in the wake of the Copenhagen collapse, by Schellnhuber and his elitist members titled: Climate Policy Post-Copenhagen: A Three-Level Strategy for Success. The paper is a strategy Schellnhuber’s “Great Transformation” of society back on track. But before a society can be radically changed, it first has to be taken over. That’s what the strategy paper focuses on.
The paper clearly shows what these characters want – the strategy is summed up in the paper’s conclusion on page 12:
With the international alliances outlined here, European create the political capital and scope for action that it needs to take on a leading role in global climate policy.”
When reading such text, you have to know that it is filled with euphemisms. For example the term climate policy really means “reign”, e.g. global climate policy really means “global reign”. Schellnhuber’s strategy is to look for allies to isolate the USA and other free countries to assert Green reign. The conclusion discloses this aim:
The aim of the new European climate diplomacy would be to generate a critical mass of climate oriented partners so that a course can be set towards a climate-friendly world economy.
Here climate friendly economy is a euphemism for an economy that is so radically dictated that it can no longer emit CO2. It is a planned economy by elitists. It has nothing to do with democracy – it’s all about authoritarianism.
Clearly these master planners are on the Green path to domination. And they are not content with running just their own continent.  Like real control-freaks, they want the whole planet. How much clearer does this have to get? They are not talking about the European economy – they are talking about the “world economy”.

The alliances mentioned above are needed to help…
…to bridge the gap between the basic normative consensus on the need for compliance with the 2°C guard rail and the inadequacy of those structures and procedures in international cooperation that should be playing a key role in achieving such compliance.”
The 2°C guradrail sounds like a noble objective. But it is not.  That too is just a euphemism for draconian authoritarian transformation measures. To stay within the phoney 2°C warming limit, Schellnhuber claims that it is necessary to cut CO2 emissions by 80% or more by 2050 – That means a brutal and experimental – away from free market economy to a centrally regulated economy.
“Masterplan” to be released on Thursday
As far as the “Masterplan” goes we will know more about that on Thursday. It will be officially presented to the eager government at 10 am.
============================================
Whenever you read text from these master Green elitists, use the following short glossary of euphemisms to know what they really mean:
2°C guardrail = authoritarian / draconian restrictions (90% carbon reduction by 2050)
climate policy = reign
climate-friendly = submissive-to-authority
compliance = submission
Great Transformation = destruction of free market capitalism
sustainability = oppression
sustainable – oppressed

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman public radio Deutsche Welle has a recent online report about climate skepticism here titled: Scientists Request Honest Dialogue, which quotes two experts from the fields of climate and meteorology: Professor Hans von Storch and Sven Plöger. This post here focuses on the views of Professor Hans von Storch.
Exaggeration damages credibility
The Deutsche Welle writes about the growing loss of credibility in climate science and quotes: Professor Hans von Storch, Director of the Helmholtz Centre in Geesthacht and the Climate Campus of the University. Deutsche Welle writes:
On the loss of credibility, climate science itself is to blame. The science has stirred up scientifically unfounded expectations, says von Storch. The demand that the public has to rapidly accept instructions on how to act in order to save the planet has blurred the boundaries between policy and science. As a result, science has not become something that has to do with “curiosity”, but rather gives the impression that it’s all about pushing a pre-conceived value-based agenda: “As scientists we have become political tools who are to deliver sought arguments to get citizens to do the right thing.”
If anything confirms this claim, it is the WBGU’s master plan unveiled by PIK Director Hans Schellnhuber to radically transform society in what he calls “The Great Transformation”. Indeed von Storch is right. Some elitist scientists are all about changing the current socio-political system, and so distort science in order to get the needed arguments.
Skeptics not taken seriously enough

What does von Storch think about the attitude of his colleagues with regards to skepticism? Here, von Storch, who is a warmist, expresses dissatisfaction with his climate colleagues and expresses his displeasure that they do not take the questions and arguments from skeptics seriously (emphasis added):
The problem is not ‘that the public is is too stupid, or uneducated’, but that science has failed to deliver answers to legitimate public questions. Instead they have said, “believe us – we are scientists’. There are many questions among individuals and they have only gotten a ‘stroppy reply,’ Storch finds.”
One example is a recent presentation round between bitter adversaries: skeptic scientists at the European Institute For Climate and Energy (EIKE) vs warmist scientists of the alarmist Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK), and the Max Planck Institute on April 20, 2011. The presentation was organised tooth-and-nail. According to the German online Bild der Wissenschaft here, the warmists made a presentation with EIKE scientists in attendance, who in turn challenged many of the warmist assertions. Bild Der Wissenschaft writes:
Both presenting scientists quickly left after the presentation. Obviously they had little interest to go beyond there presentation obligations and to speak with the climate skeptics.”
Unfortunately, Bild der Wissenschaft did not give the names of the two warmist scientists in the article it posted. I imagine EIKE will post something about it at their website in the near future. One has to say that the act of fleeing from tough skeptic questions does give the impression of warmist cowardice and insecurity. And no publicity had been made by the PIK  (where the presentation took place) to promote that particular event beforehand.

"While Extinction Revolution was gearing up for another impressive protest, Barry Lopez was considering a pair of sparrows mating atop a cantilevered sign on New York’s Upper East Side. It wasn’t the most momentous of couplings, hardly the millions-strong gathering of geese he witnessed in his award-winning book Arctic Dreams or as moving as his account of buffalo sheltering from a late-season blizzard and singing the song of death in Winter Count, but Lopez is, as ever, on the lookout. Widely considered to be greatest of naturalist writers, Lopez calls the coupling “a refreshment for the eye”.  “I notice those things even in urban environments because they’re a pleasant contradiction to the hammering urban intensity and headlong progress that defines so much of the city.” Few writers have chronicled more exquisitely how natural landscapes shape and are shaped by human desires and imagination. At 74, his latest book, Horizon, is an attempt to describe his own life through his experience of six regions: Oregon’s Cape Foulweather, where Captain Cook first set foot in North America; the Galapagos, where he observes sea lions caught in a net calm themselves as he works to free them; the high Arctic, again, locale of his greatest work; Australia’s Botany Bay; equatorial Africa; and the ice shelves of Antarctica, where he notes that there is no longitude at the south pole because every direction is north. But today, Lopez is not here to discuss the broad sweep of his career, though he’s not averse to it. Several years ago he was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer. His message is pressing, and it’s not about the particularities of an urban environment: it concerns the planet’s intensifying biodiversity crisis. Lopez’s alert comes as the United Nations issued a report blaming human activity for the accelerating decline of Earth’s natural life-support systems that places one million species of plants and animals at risk of extinction. “Something very big is going on the like of which we have never seen,” Lopez tells me. “I’m trying to see the bigger thing that operates independently from the idea of nation state, what’s going on that’s transcultural, and who are the people worth listening to in a culture like ours where we have pretty much destroyed the elders.” “My supposition,” he continues, “is that we’re living in emergency times. In the west, we believe we are the most progressive and socially just, but a lot of that is just a hopeful illusion.” ﻿Like many of his generation, his conscience was triggered by the Vietnam war. He came to believe that he couldn’t be considered an educated person if he was informed only by white Christian men – “a solipsistic universe of people like myself”. He decided to seek the knowledge of traditional and Native peoples. “I wanted to apprentice myself to another world, in part because without it I would simply be thinking and enforcing a set of ideas that are held by relatively few people.” The knowledge he began to glean related to storytelling in those societies. The goal was to inform the reader of a world that exists on both empirical and metaphorical levels. “So you can be writing about stranded whales and underneath you can be writing about the tension between the real and the non-real. What you’re trying to do is to reach people metaphorically.” In those traditional societies, the willingness to experience life on a metaphorical level protects individuals from being ostracized. The more time Lopez spent in them, he says, the more he wanted to be around people “who are interested in taking care of each other, not just themselves”. The connection he found rests on a deeper level, that is through the environment and the animals that inhabit it. A story about an encounter with a polar bear is just that but to another listener, it’s about the deeper understanding of the other and why there is other. “To an outsider listener it sounds simplistic, but to an adept it’s the consolidation of complex ideas in a few words.” This is why listening to elders is key. In traditional societies, where stability trumps progress, elders’ function is to maintain stability. But in the west, we’re fixated on progress, whether that’s new cars or new gadgets. “This is seen as a progressive thing but it’s actually a waste of time and resources.” Indeed, he learned that endless growth was not the answer from traditional people. He recalls asking caribou hunters in Canada’s Brooks Range why they didn’t raise reindeer instead. The hunters told him it would change their lifestyle, which wouldn’t suit them. Lopez doesn’t understand why we “won’t listen to people who are not like ourselves when we are getting the message every day that climate change doesn’t care if you’re male or female, black or gay. We should be having our elders have that conversation and then we defer to their decision.” He adds: “I trust that they know what they’re doing, and the more time I spend in the middle of this the more do I see the profound difference between a headlong culture like ours, that is attracted to drugs, attracted to possessions and attracted to progress, that sets up artificial hierarchies – that culture is moving so fast there can be no deliberation. In traditional culture, there is no interest in progress – what you have is pretty good. The idea is to assess anything that threatens stability.” Horizon is full of such observations, even questioning the idea of environmental restoration – a kind of fascism, he suggests, that attempts “to erase the horror of what you see before you. It’s like pacifying a child – just a way to make you feel OK.” Throughout, Lopez is seeking ways to slow change. His point, he says, is that “every stabilizing force in society is undone by fundamentalist thinking, whether that’s religion or science or government. ﻿“In traditional society, the elders reject no one and consistently make the right decisions because they want the best for the group. Traditional people are focused on addressing situations that create instability and you have to face the fact they have been right for tens of thousands of years.” The results are plain to see. Lopez mentions the militia uprising in Sudan, the regimes in power in Brazil, the Philippines, Hungary – “all these Trumpsters coming into positions of power all over the world”. Depressing, certainly, and Lopez says he feels “as abused and intimidated as the next fellow”. Lopez knows also that there are going to be hard decisions to make. “We’re already applying triage,” he says. The job at hand is to make clear to people “how completely unprecedented and dangerous this situation is, and how we’ve created a suicidal society in order that some can buy a 70ft yacht”. As he tours the nation’s universities, the argument he advances hinges on what comes next if the idea of nation state is over. He asks students what comes after capitalism and democracy. It’s a question that inevitably produces consternation and hostility. Witness the reaction to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young congresswoman pilloried for raising uncomfortable topics, including profound changes in lifestyle that are required to even start to stabilize the destruction. “If you are incensed by moderately progressive ideas, you’re never going to get anywhere,” Lopez says. “If you have to demonize her or embarrass her, all you are demonstrating is the fear that drives your decisions, which is mostly no change. “AOC is not the problem and she’s barely speaking about the deeper things that have to be considered. This is an emergency, and the changes she is advocating are part of a furious effort to get things moving. God bless AOC. Thank God she’s out there shouting.” ﻿Lopez maintains he’s enthusiastic about humanity’s ability to cope with anything. But for someone who has made a career of bringing the beauty of the natural world to writing, surely it must be distressing to be discussing its collapse. “I had the privilege to do these things, and I would like the reader to feel a deepened sense of self-worth, a stronger sense of possibility and capability.” But yes, he says, the radical rearrangement of society that is required is beyond the reach of most people already struggling to survive. “You have to be selective about what you say. It has to be loving, not castigating, and do not destroy anybody’s sense of hope.” He mentions a poet, WS Merwin, whose poem Thanks he sometimes turns to for solace. “We must learn to love the mutilated world,” he says, paraphrasing its meaning. “We’re trying to swim in gasoline. It’s impossible, but we swim on.” Horizon by Barry Lopez is published by The Bodley Head (£25). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to klimaretter.de, a warmist site operated by socialists and green Utopians, Dave Roberts was invited by the Heinrich Böll Foundation as a speaker for climate blogs at the network conference re:publica in Berlin last month. Roberts, you will recall, is the activist at Grist who in 2006 called for Nuremberg-type trials for bastards who deny global warming.
Klimaretter.de interviewed Roberts here and asked him about the US failure to pass a climate bill and the power of American conservatives. He had some interesting responses. Here are some excerpts of questions and answers in paraphrased form (I’ve eliminated all the rambling).
klimaretter: After the wonderful election of Barack Obama, hopes to pass a climate were high. What happened?
Roberts: The idea that it would be enough to replace “bad people” with “good people” turned out to be utterly naive. Barack Obama seemed to be the Messiah we had been waiting for. But his charisma was not enough to solve the USA’s deep problems. The Republicans routinely used delay and disrupt tactics.
klimaretter: Why didn’t the law get passed?
Roberts: Obama thought he could quickly pass health care reform, and then use the momentum to pass a climate bill. But passing health care reform got bogged down and became a very difficult issue. The momentum got lost. So the climate bill died and the only thing left to do is to set our hopes on EPA and its authority to regulate CO2. The Republicans want to defund the EPA. The fight is tough, but it’s not over yet.
klimaretter: What makes the conservative climate skeptics so powerful in the USA? 
Roberts: The conservatives really know how to create an atmosphere of controversy in order to block climate protection measures. The Republicans are focused on spreading doubt and portraying scientific consensus as being in dispute. There are great parallels with the tactics used by the tobacco industry.
klimaretter: Will it be possible to expect progress in US climate protection over the next 2 Obama years?

Roberts (see English below): Das Klimagesetz ist jedenfalls erstmal tot – wahrscheinlich sogar auf etliche Jahre. Und auch wenn Obama wiedergewählt wird und die Demokraten im Repräsentantenhaus die Mehrheit zurückgewinnen muss man sich fragen, ob das reichen wird. Denn an dem Punkt waren wir schon einmal – und das Klimagesetz ist trotzdem grandios gescheitert.
In English: “The climate bill is now dead in any case – probably even for a number of years. And even if Obama gets re-elected and the Democrats regain the majority in the House of Representatives, one has to ask whether that will be enough. We were at that point once already, and the climate bill failed spectacularly.”
klimaretter: Will the Fukushima nuclear catastrophe in Japan have an impact on nuclear plans in the USA?
Roberts: The Fukushima issue here is being played down. The catastrophe will not change the course of nuclear power in the USA much. Obama’s energy secretary Steven Chu is a big proponent of nuclear power.
——————————————————————-
And so what is the reaction of green-eyed Germans to Robert’s dire message from the USA? Answer: “OH NEIN!”
For example, here’s how yet another socialist/green Utopian site, Klima Der Gerechtigkeit (in English: Climate Of Justice) reacts to the message and US analysis delivered by Roberts:
In a healthy world and in every other democracy, the climate bill would have been passed with huge majorities. Not so in the USA and its political system. No wonder David Roberts felt at times that he was on another planet when he visited Berlin.”
That comment was written by Arne Jungjohann, who is living in Washington. When he talks about “every other democracy”, he is referring to places like the defunct German “Democratic” Republic – former East Germany – the country that imprisoned its people behind a wall of concrete, barb wire and sharp shooters, and where everybody was spying on each other.
Spare us your lectures on “democracy”, Arne. In the USA the topic is being discussed openly, and not being rammed down the throats of citizens by obsessed dogmatists with masterplans. Go back and review history. Your twisted idea of democracy is sickening to any honest and moral person.

"As the midday sun beats down on Tuvalu, a slim slice of golden sand in remote Oceania, locals seek shelter under palm trees by the lagoon’s edge or retreat to the dark interiors of their homes. There is little else they can do to escape the sun’s powerful rays because there is no suncream in the entire country, despite strident efforts by locals to obtain some. Tuvalu is the fourth smallest country in the world and located halfway between Australia and Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. Classified as a developing country by the United Nations, Tuvalu is on the frontline of climate change, and is already seeing devastating effects, including sea-level rise, coastal erosion, droughts and hotter annual temperatures. A department of the Princess Margaret hospital in the capital of Funafuti has been devoted to climate change-related illnesses, which have risen in the last decade, according to hospital figures. Locals complain that the increasing temperatures are becoming “unbearable”, and acting chief of public health Suria Eusala Paufolau says incidents of heat rash, heat stroke and dehydration are intensifying. As locals do their best to cope by avoiding the sun when they can and wearing long, protective clothing, one of the western world’s most basic defences against sun exposure is completely unavailable – sunscreen. Sunscreen was absent from every shop and supermarket in the capital of Funafuti when the Guardian visited in March. Meanwhile, products such as feminine hygiene wash, hair dye and baby cologne were widely available. “We don’t have sunscreen,” says one shop owner. “We’ve never had sunscreen.” Tuvaluans – especially women – say their only option for acquiring sunscreen is to purchase it from neighbouring Fiji – an expensive, two-and-a-half-hour flight away. Half a dozen local women questioned in the town square of Funafuti said if sunscreen was available they would buy it, citing ageing skin as their primary concern. “I am only 32 but I look older, we can’t get sunscreen here, we can’t get anything to protect our skin,” says one local woman, a housewife and mother of five. “Do you have any, can I please have some?” According to the World Health Organization, shortages of many essential medicines are common in Tuvalu, and the country is one of the top importers of health supplies anywhere in the world, according to the BMJ. Associate Professor Tony Reeder from the Otago University School of Medicine in New Zealand is an expert in skin cancer prevention and says it is alarming that sunscreen is not available to Tuvaluans. “Not having access to sunscreen is quite critical, especially for people who are exposed to the sun for long periods of time,” says Reeder. “There are quite a few barriers to the use of sunscreen because it is often seen as a western product, and it can be prohibitively expensive.” Reeder says subsidising the cost of sunscreen is one option. “There are moves by some countries to reclassify sunscreen as a pharmaceutical protective product. Polynesians need sun protection as well, sun damage has been recorded among Africans with black skin. So all types of skin can be damaged from exposure to the sun.” More pressing health concerns are the most likely reason sunscreen has been overlooked in Tuvalu, Reeder says. A 2015 study of skin disorders in Tuvalu conducted by Taiwanese dermatologists – the first ever undertaken – concluded “there is a distinct lack of knowledge on the prevalence of skin disorders in Tuvalu”. Elsewhere in the Pacific where sunscreen is widely available, some countries such as Palau and Hawaii have introduced a ban on the product, because some chemicals in sunscreens have been linked to deterioration of coral reefs."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith great sadness Der Spiegel reports here reports that a 17-year old Briton was killed by a polar bear attack on the island of Spitzbergen in the Arctic. Also another 16 year old and a 17 year old were injured, and 2 group leaders age 27 and 29 years respectively. The victims were part of an expedition organised by the British Schools Exploring Society (BSES).
According to a BSES press release, the tragic death earlier this morning involved one of the members of its expeditions in Svalbard. In addition to his death, four other members of the expedition sustained injuries, two of them severe. They were evacuated to Tromsø hospital. No other members of the expedition were injured.
Der Spiegel writes:
The office of the island’s Governor explained that the polar bear’s attack occurred near the Von-Post glacier. The group had 13 participants and had set up a camp of tents located 40 km from Longyearbyen when the polar bear attacked in the morning. ‘The bear attacked the people inside their tents,’ said police chief Erik Nygaard, according to NTB-information.”
According to Der Spiegel, the island is inhabited by about 2500 people and 3000 polar bears.
The BSES is a non-profit UK-based youth development charity. Founded in 1932 by the late Surgeon Commander G Murray Levick, a member of Scott’s final Antarctic Expedition of 1910-13. BSES is one of the longest running organisations of its type.
Polar bear kills are treated like potential murders
Expeditions are normally provided with firearms for protection. But as Der Spiegel reports, shooting a polar bear is legally risky – no joke:

If a polar bear is killed on the archipelago, then it automatically leads to a trial. In this case the authorities assume the role of defence attorney for the dead bear.”
So who is going to want to shoot?
Who knows, maybe all the tenderheartedness and sympathy that had developed for polar bears over the years in their bogus climate-caused plight may have contributed to the death of the young man. Let’s all be nice to Mr. Polar Bear. The combination of getting too close and not taking the threat from the seemingly cuddly animals could have led to the group putting it guard down. This is pure speculation on my part, of course. Surely the authorities will conduct an intense investigation.
The BSES website explains its primary purpose:
Based at the Royal Geographical Society, BSES provides opportunities for young people of all abilities between the ages of 16 and 23 to take part in adventurous exploration that involves scientific research in wilderness areas. The expeditions can last for several months and the location tends to be different each year but could be anywhere from the Arctic to the Himalayas. The aim of BSES is to help the personal development of young people, through the challenge of living and working in remote and demanding areas of the world.”
The online UK Telegraph shows that close encounters with polar bears are not unusual and have occurred in the past. A disaster has probably been long in the works. Click here to see an incident that involved a BSES Expedition and a polar bear in 2006.
Finally, again speculation, the relatively youthful age of the expedition leaders also indicates to me that the group may not have had the experience needed to properly judge the risks and dangers involved. There are going to be lots of really tough questions in the days and weeks ahead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel here gives us a good idea of the scale and magnitude of Japan’s massive Sendai earthquake, which weighed in at 9.0 on the Richter scale. It ought to remind some of us of nature’s fury and that we are powerless to steer it.
The earthquake occurred in the western Pacific Ocean, 130 km (81 mi) east of Sendai, Honshu, Japan. Its epicenter was 373 km (232 mi) from Tokyo, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
Massive energy
The earthquake opened up a 400 km long gash in the ocean floor, releasing a surface energy of 1.9×1017  joules (according to the USGS). The total energy released underground was about 205,000 times that on the surface.
This energy is equivalent to about 9.32 teratons of TNT, or approximately 600 million Hiroshima bombs, or about 80 years of global energy usage, estimated to be 4.74×1020 joules for the year of 2008 [Wikipedia]. That’s arguably more energy than what all of mankind has ever used so far.
Earth gets a facelift
All that energy gave the surface of the globe a facelift, literally. Wikipedia writes:

According to Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, the earthquake’s enormous strength shifted the Earth’s axis by 25 centimeters (9.8 in). This deviation led a number of small changes, including those to the length of a day and the tilt of the Earth. The speed of the Earth’s rotation increased, shortening the day by 1.6 microseconds due to the redistribution of Earth’s mass.
A report by the U.S. Geological Survey said that Honshu, the main island of Japan, was shifted 2.4 m (7.9 ft) toward the east. Researcher Lucy Jones said of the precise data, “The Japanese have the best seismic information in the world… This is overwhelmingly the best-recorded great earthquake ever.”
Der Spiegel lists the top 11 earthquakes measured since 1900; location, year and strength:
1. Valdivia, Chile – 1960 – 9.5
2. Prince William Sound, Alaska – 1964 – 9.2
3. West Sumatra – 2004 – 9.1
4. Japan -2011 – 9.0
5. Kamtschatka – 1952 – 9.0
6. Chile – 2010 – 8.8
7. Ecuador – 1906 – 8.8
8. Rat Islands, Alaska – 1965 – 8.7
9. North Sumatra – 2005 – 8.6
10. Assam – 1950 – 8.6
11. South Sumatra – 1957 – 8.6
Strangely these events are bunched in the 1950s – 60s and the 2000s.
The Sendai earthquake has also unleashed of tsunami of hysteria here in Germany, where many media outlets are busy quoting organizations like Greenpeace on the risks of atomic power. The earthquake obviously has driven another nail into nuclear energy’s coffin in Germany, having galvanised opposition even more. So forget nuclear energy in Germany in the future. The results of the upcoming state elections will show this.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Sendai mega-earthquake not only sent a tsunami of water over parts of coastal Japan, but also one of hysteria over the German media and green establishment. As Japan struggles to get a grip on its damaged reactors, German environmentalists are seizing the opportunity in a bid to fan panic across the country, and are now demanding that the country’s older reactors be shut down immediately. The voices of calm reason have been swept away.
Source: http://electricalandelectronics.org/2008/10/02/schematic-arrangement-of-nuclear-power-station/
The blog Denken für die Freiheit (Thinking for Freedom) of the Liberal Institute think tank of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom has posted a let’s-get-back-to-reason essay – Japan is not the Soviet Union – written by Dr. Klaus-Dieter Humpich. Here’s a summary:
Dr. Humpich first reminds us that Japan is subject to international regulations and so are reporting minute by minute on what is happening at the reactor sites. All planned and executed measures are reported to the public. Indeed the confusion is often media-related.
Reserve generators for cooling failed
When the earthquake struck, 3 of the 6 Fukushima Daiichi reactors were in operation, and stopped automatically – as they were designed to in the vent of an earthquake. Then diesel-powered back-up generators kicked in to supply power to the cooling water pumps. But within one hour, the diesel-powered generators failed due to yet to be determined reasons. Workers then brought in reserve generators, and it appears there were then problems in getting them in operation. During this time the cooling of the rods was not taking place and this led to overheating. This will certainly be examined later when a comprehensive investigation of the disaster begins.
Pressure cooker
In the reactor, heat and pressure build up if cooling doesn’t occur – like a pressure cooker on a hot stove. If pressure is too high, then steam has to be released into the atmosphere to keep the reactor from exploding. But then an equal amount of water has to be fed in in order to keep the balance. If the level of the water sinks too low, then things inside get hot. Once a critical value is reached, a chemical reaction between the steam and hydrogen can occur. At the Fukushima reactor on Saturday, hydrogen built up and an explosion ensued. Yet, the containement systems were left intact.
Japan’s containment systems not breached
But the situation in Japan developed completely differently from what happened in Chernobyl in 1986. In Japan, the reactors were shut down immediately as planned, thus stopping the nuclear reaction. At Chernobyl, the reactor was operating a full capacity and spiralled quickly out of control.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




With the shutdown of the Fukushima reactors in response to the quake, only about 10% of the capacity still remained in the reactor.  The cooling system powered by the diesel pumps then functioned for an hour, and so the heat generating capacity of the core was brought down to about 1% of total capacity – much less than Chernobyl. Although 1% still means one megawatt, it is not enough to blow the entire reactor and containment. In Chernobyl the chain reaction ran away and the entire reactor vessel and containment building exploded violently, releasing everything into the air. That’s not the case in Japan.
At Fukushima, the reactor vessel, the containment and external concrete housing are still in intact. This means there are still three barriers that would have to be breached before dangerous levels of radiation can escape.
Category 4 accident (TMI 5, Chernobyl 7)
As the reactors are still heating, there’s naturally the risk of high pressure build-ups, which could lead to a Chernobyl type of explosion if not relieved. To prevent a failure of the containment building in an emergency, radioactive steam would have to be released though a filter system into the atmosphere in a controlled manner. .This rersults in a radioactive cloud. A controlled release is relatively not very dangerous as it dissipates quite rapidly. That’s why the accident at Fukushima is at Category 4 (TMI 5, Chernobyl 7). Category means that the reactor is totally damaged, but there is little impact on the surrounding environment. So we are still a ways away from Chernobyl.
Risk not completely eliminated
Although the containment systems are intact, the heat problem is still not eliminated. Sea water still has to be pumped to the damaged reactors to prevent heating and overpressurization. If the reactor has no water to keep cool, the temperatures can rise and lead to a meltdown. The latest news is that three reactors are threatened with a meltdown. The cooling water around the fuel rods in Reactor 2 have dropped dramatically.
The next hours and days ahead will show if the plant will withstand the 9.0 quake.
In the meantime, a panicked Chancellor Angela Merkel, spooked by the media hysteria, has announced that the planned extension of the operating lifetime of some of Germany’s older nuclear plants has been stopped. I wonder if India, China, Brazil and Iran will follow her example and abandon their ambitious plans to build a number nuclear power plants in the future.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe scene of the accident occurring earlier today looks as grisly as a war zone.
Motorists were blinded by a sandstorm on the A19 motorway near the German coastal port city of Rostock. In all, almost 50 cars were involved in the massive pile up, with 10 dead and almost 100 injured. 17 cars and three trucks caught fire.
The online Der Spiegel has a spectacular video here that gives you a good idea of the zero-visibility conditions drivers had to contend with – with little warning – causing them a nightmare. The online Bild daily also has a photo gallery here.
This is what a sandstorm can look like. This one in Iraq, from Wikipedia (Photo credit: US Marine Corps)
Though speed limits are being imposed increasingly on Germany’s famous autobahns, there are still many sections that have no speed limit. Cars traveling 120 miles per hour and more are not uncommon.
At the scene of this accident, that particular section of autobahn also had no speed limit, and high-speed drivers were caught by off guard as the sudden sandstorm cut visibility across the motorway to almost zero with little warning, causing drivers traveling in both directions to slam on the brakes and resulting in the deadly pile-up. Bild newspaper reports:
Cars crashed into other cars with such force that some were found 50 meters off the autobahn in a field. At this location on the autobahn there is no speed limit. But you could see the sand coming, it should have been possible to brake’, said truck drive [Ralf] Schulz.“
Der Spiegel says “an unusual weather phenomena is suspected to have triggered the chain of crashes”, saying that hurricane force winds whipped up the sand and formed tornado like conditions. But when one views the film footage, one sees that the dust cloud is no more than a few meters above the ground.
Actually, as reader Ron de Haan points out, this is a dust storm from plowed agricultural fields in the area. The German press though are calling it a sandstorm.

"For Britain’s major political parties Thursday’s local elections proved that every silver lining has a cloud. Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party did not have a good night yet it was the Conservatives who faced the darkest and stormiest skies. The Liberal Democrats did well by comparison with the truly dreadful results they posted in 2015. But the biggest winners were the nation’s smallest parties. Independent councillors flourished and the political stalemate in Westminster found expression in the rise of local authorities where no party had overall control. If any one of the mainstream parties could say they won on Thursday it was the Greens, buoyed by the government’s public acceptance that their arguments about an impending climate emergency had won the day. The political arm of the environmental movement had its best night for years. Viewed through the most salient of national issues – Brexit – it would be easy to construct an analysis in which the voters had laid the blame at the feet of the two major Westminster parties either for failing to deliver on the results of referendum in 2016 or for failing to find a way to repudiate them. Both the Conservatives’ Theresa May and Labour’s Mr Corbyn recognised that this instant precis of events would be attractive and sought to defuse its allure by saying they will “sort out” Brexit. This is too roughly hewn an argument.  Local elections are often seen as a “real world” test of public opinion in the years between national elections, but their superficial similarities with national politics distort any analysis that does not pay proper attention to the more significant differences. This year’s local elections are no different. Thursday’s turnout is likely to be in step with previous local contests this decade where just a third of voters turned up. This one fact makes impossible a detailed read-through to a national election picture when two-thirds of the electorate cast their ballots. Although this week’s elections were held in 248 English councils, six mayoral districts and all 11 councils in Northern Ireland, none took place in Wales, Scotland and London. The elections on Thursday were a local affair: pavement issues make a real difference and voters tossed out administrations who just perform badly or were mired in scandal. Missing from the ballot paper were many of the new insurgents. In socially liberal pro-EU Britain, Liberal Democrats went unchallenged by the upstarts at Change UK. Meanwhile in Brexitland, a lifeless Ukip was the only option open for voters unhappy at the failure of the UK to depart from the EU. Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, which has captured the headlines and drawn large crowds, was not on the ballot – saving the Tories from an even greater embarrassment. Tory leave voters had nowhere to go. Things still look dismal for Mrs May. Her party’s projected vote share from the local elections has slipped behind the vote it achieves in national opinion polls. The Tories lost more than 1,000 seats and control of dozens of councils. Ballots were disproportionately located in what are usually regarded as the Tory shires, so the result is a genuinely bad one. The prime minister remains stoic in the face of calls for her to go. But she is more than ever the figurehead rather than the leader of a party that has lost all discipline. Mr Corbyn is unchallenged, but he ought to be worried. Given that it is defending a poor performance in 2015, Labour went backwards in terms of the number of councillors. It did win some high-profile contests. However, there must be a concern that its coalition of older, less-educated, working-class voters and younger, liberal metropolitan graduates is wilting in the heat of the Brexit argument. Winning wealthy urban seats while losing party heartlands ought to provoke a bout of soul-searching in all those who believe that Britain badly needs an effective Labour government. British politics could fragment ever further, with unpredictable results. With European elections impending, there is a lesson for both Labour and the Tories: they cannot easily profit as the Brexit process drifts on and on, but their insurgent rivals might."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI wrote about this not long ago here, on why the conservatives in Germany, under Merkel’s leadership, have been getting clobbered in the polls. In a nutshell:
It’s your constant endorsement of the opposition Greens, stupid!”
You don’t get more votes by endorsing the silly green positions of your opponents – you get votes by attacking and exposing them.
Yesterday the online Die Welt reported here (FRONT PAGE!) that the youth of the once-conservative CDU party is taking a second look at the greenshirt movement and Angela Merkel’s weird direction. Finally they are showing signs of having had it with all the green crap pasted on the party platform.
For example the leader of Germany’s Young Consevatives Philipp Mißfelderis speaking up and taking Merkel to task. Die Welt titles the story:
Mißfelder Aims Massive Criticism at CDU Leadership”

High time. Everyone should now be standing up and hollering at the top of our lungs in support. Foremost he calls the orientation with the Greens as a mistake and adds:
A CDU ‘that orients itself with the Greens’ underestimates the people’s fundamental will for liberty, says Mißfelder. Also in the big cities the CDU ought not to fix iteself on issues like climate change and integration, like the party leadership thinksn: safety, order and cleanliness are also issues that mobilize voters more than we sometimes think.“
Of course, Mißfelder has a long way to go before he can expect to capitalize politically. If he really wants to score points, then he’ll just come out and call climate science and policy what it is: just a huge scam that is defrauding the public and taxpayers of their money and liberty.
The tough comments from Mißfelder come at the heels of CDU faction chief in the state parliament of Hesse, Christean Wagner, read here, also launched a screed against Angela Merkel and the party’s overall direction, which he dubbed as being void of any profile. “The blame rests on Merkel – she has watered down the party”.
Wagner added:
She has to delineate more clearly from the Socialists, Greens, and Communist parties for self-responsibility and work for the majority of the people – for freedom and social market economy, for Christian values and the nation, for domestic and foreign security, for the homeland, family and tradition.”
Focusing on these things sure would be nice – instead of wasting money and resources on the fantasy of rescuing the climate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDogmatism is a dangerous thing – especially when dealing with economics and when it attempts to dictate markets. Some examples follow below.
1.) EU climate policy leads to more CO2 emissions
German blog Oekowatch writes about a press release from the German Association of Energy and Power Economics (VIK), which concludes that ever stricter EU climate policies cause economic damage to Europe while resulting in increased CO2 emission.
The press release states that many studies conducted do not take an honest look at the CO2 picture. Shifting CO2-intensive industries away from Europe does not lead to a rescue of the climate, but winds up resulting in even more CO2 getting produced overseas instead. Here’s an example:
And so German CO2 emissions between 2006 and 2010 actually dropped 13%; but when CO2 emissions that are involved in the imported products are taken into account, the picture changes. Then the total net CO2 output rises by 23%. The picture is similar in other EU countries.”
The press release offered some stern advice for our action-hero climate-rescuing politicians in the EU:
The politicians in the EU really have to wake up and recognise that the unilateral leading position in climate position is producing completely false results.”
The press release summarises that EU draconian climate policy harms everything – environment, economics, and the basis for future generations:
The current climate policy in the EU and also in Germany harms the the environment and the people in Germany /EU. The EU cannot rescue the world’s climate alone. ‘It is also part of generational justice to not deny our children and grandchildren a functioning economic basis.’ says Dr. Annette Loske, General Managing Director of the VIK.”
2.) Biofuel deforestation, slavery, and hunger
Another brilliant example of how master plans to hypothetically rescue the planet turn into real death and destruction is described by warmist site Klimaretter here. Ethanol production from sugar cane  in Brazil has gotten so out of hand that it is leading to massive deforestation, slavery, inhumane work conditions, less production of food crops, and widespread hunger. Reuters warned  recently:
Surging global prices of basic foodstuffs raise the risk that the food crisis of 2007-2008 in developing countries will be repeated, the head of the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization said on Monday.
And adds:
The FAO has asked developed countries to re-examine their biofuels strategies — which include large subsidies — since these have diverted 120 million tonnes of cereals away from human consumption to convert them to fuels.

Developed countries give $13 billion in annual subsidies and protection to encourage biofuels production, Diouf said. In the United States, corn stocks have dipped to near 15-year lows as more of the crop is used for making ethanol.”
3.)  200,000 deaths per year and more misery
Benny Peiser’s Global Warming Policy Foundation website here has a story on how U.S. and European policy to increase production of ethanol and other biofuels has added to global death and disease.
Research by the World Bank indicates that the increase in biofuels production over 2004 levels would push more than 35 million additional people into absolute poverty in 2010 in developing countries. Using statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Indur Goklany estimates that this would lead to at least 192,000 excess deaths per year, plus disease resulting in the loss of 6.7 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per year.”
4.)  500,000 kids going blind annually – because of green dogmatism.
Finally, we all remember how the activist banning of DDT led to the deaths of millions. Another example of how blind and dogmatic thinking leads to disaster is the ban of golden rice. EIKE features this video where Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore explains the disaster of Golden Rice (starting at the 2:05 mark):

Half a million kids go blind every year in the rice-eating countries because of vitamin A deficiency. Golden rice, which Ingo Potrykus invented 12 years ago, could cure this overnight, and yet the activists have prevented it from being planted in Asia and Africa.”
Read more here about golden rice: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice.
Clearly the people who are suffering the most from climate and green schemes are the poor in Africa, Asia and South America. These dogmatic policies are all concocted by folks in Europe and North America with the intent to preserve the planet – poor people be damned. Call it eco-colonialism.

"The current election campaign discussions on climate change fails to address the real challenges that face the nation. The super-partisan nature of the debate and the focus on mythical costs of action risks significantly harming our prosperity and resulting in another decade of squandered economic opportunity. I work for an organisation that represents institutional investors like super funds with total funds under management of over $2tn. Super funds invest to ensure superannuation holders can retire with dignity. The average superannuation holder will retire around 2050 so what we do to address climate change matters a lot to their retirement funds.  Investors and the companies they invest in and own are exposed to policies that governments put in place. What governments decide also influences if they invest, where they invest and what they invest in. Major investors and companies are run by smart people. They know that climate change is real and that governments will eventually have to implement significant policies to reduce emissions. It is not credible to think otherwise. Community concern is growing as the impacts of extreme weather events escalate, global markets are shifting, technologies like renewable energy are the cheapest investment options for new electricity generation, and Australia has ratified an international treaty – the Paris agreement – that will require the nation to achieve net zero emissions. This realisation has material impacts. Companies are acting in response to real-world realities and because the investors that own them are asking them to get their act together. This means that regardless of what governments are doing they are factoring in proxy carbon taxes into their investment decisions and business plans. Some prices are low and others are up to $140/tonne in 2040 (to put this in context, the starting price under the Gillard government carbon pricing scheme was just over $20/tonne). There is already a shadow carbon price in the Australian economy. What they are also doing is looking for low and zero-carbon investment opportunities. If you know action is coming you get ready to maximise the opportunities of the new investment boom and reduce the cost of complying with emissions-reductions obligations. Energy-intensive companies are investing in renewable energy to manage electricity costs, investors are developing zero-emissions property portfolios, and asset managers are investing in carbon forestry in Australia and across the region. This is just the tip of the iceberg. The proportion on investors implementing low-carbon strategies grew from just over 50% in 2017 to around 90% last year. The other consequence of the current policy paralysis is that if you are unclear what the future climate policy framework will look like, while you will prepare and invest in low-risk activities, you will be hesitant to make major investments required to accelerate the transition to a net zero emissions economy. One of the most significant barriers impacting long-term investment and accessing new economic opportunities is climate policy uncertainty. Institutional investors have to make long-term returns on their investments for the benefit of superannuation holders. Lack of credible, durable and predictable policy frameworks in Australia means investors will look to other countries where policy is more predictable or if they so invest in Australia they will charge higher-risk premiums on investments to hedge against policy risk. This also means it is more difficult for investors to pursue emerging zero-carbon investment opportunities. Despite the rhetoric, Australia’s current policy proposal does nothing to address the fundamental drives behind the economic costs of policy uncertainty. It fails to integrate energy and climate policy and we have no plans for how Australia will achieve net zero emissions in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement. If this continues the government would be saying to business to sit on their hands and do little for another decade. This is inconsistent with rational business decision-making and even their legal obligations to manage their business and investments in the interests of shareholders and superannuation holders. Financial regulators and central banks in Australia and around the world are recognising that climate change represents a systemic risk to economies and financial system, and there is increasing scrutiny on whether investors and companies have the governance structures and business plans in place to address growing climate change impacts and manage the transition to net zero emissions. Put simply, the absence of credible climate policy has a negative impact on the economy and investment decisions. This comes through electricity bills as investments are delayed in new electricity generation investment. It delays infrastructure as investors try to work out what the impact of climate change and climate policy will be on the value of the asset over the long term. It threatens long-term superannuation returns because the economic impacts of failing to address climate change over the long-term make the global financial crisis look like a walk in the park. All of this is lost in the conversation because some in the media and politics want to focus on hypothetical modelling of a fantasy economy by Brian Fisher. For transparency, I have been involved in economic modelling of climate policy myself. This means I understand some of its limitations and what it is useful for. I have written before on some of the problems with this kind of analysis, and economists more qualified than me have shown why Fisher’s work has limited value in policy making. What I will point out is that this work ignores the economic cost of policy uncertainty in the analysis. Fisher’s modelling ignores a key economic benefit of reducing emissions in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement. As work undertaken for the Department of Foreign Affairs concluded, “the uncertainty arising from a lack of policy commitment has a large impact on investment and real GDP in the Australian economy. Even a relatively small risk premium shock can have significant consequences for investment in energy production and also on overall economic activity which feeds through all sectors of the economy.” It also assumes that business is doing nothing to respond to global market trends and the signals their regulators are sending them. So as politicians and the media make sport with imaginary costs of reducing emissions, a deeper economic risk from the failure to implement credible climate policy is building in the economy. Investors and companies are getting ready to unleash a new wave of investment across Australia. This economic opportunity will only be realised if we move past scare campaigns and start acting seriously on climate change. • Erwin Jackson is director of policy at the Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC)"

Share this...FacebookTwitterRichard Wagner at the German site Die Achse Des Guten  (The Axis of Good) takes an excellent look at the feasibility of powering society solely with renewable energy (sun, wind, biofuel) and through energy savings. It’s a challenge many engineers are grappling with.

All images here are from: http://wattsupwiththat wind-turbines-video/.
But earlier a reader here at NTZ (DirkH I think) commented that many young German engineers naively come into the industry, as if on a religious mission to rescue the planet from the Biblical catastrophe of climate meltdown, in search of that all-elusive energy supply that is both cheap with no adverse effects, or to find ways to go without.
That engineers come into the industry with such religious mindsets is already a very troubling sign. It tells us they have not even taken the first step of checking the “problem” to see if the proposed solution itself could be much worse. Have the “green” engineers really looked at the data that supposedly underpins the “climate problem”?
The answer is “no”. If they had, they would not be proposing the expensive solutions they are now being proposed (unless it’s all about making money and the future be damned).
A good engineer checks the data behind the “problem” and does not make up problems just to give himself something to do. Good engineers have a good sense for economics. Bad ones do not.
Green engineers are among the worst and most dangerous
Overall, German engineers are second to none in many fields such as petroleum, chemicals, automotive, machine building, project management and so on. But in renewable energy, they are careless, naive, ideological and ignorant -and so have become a hazard to society – particularly economically and with respect to the risks their solutions pose down the line. It’s our children and grandchildren that will have to inherit the mess they leave behind.

This generation of “green” engineers will likely be the first to cause far more problems than they solve. When data is recklessly and maliciously neglected, it’s inevitable.
Already we have seen their solutions turn into disasters. Some examples: biofuels on the food supply and monoculture, windmills and solar panels with respect to aesthetics, supply consistency and cost. Think about the impacts of mercury-laden energy saving lights in our landfills. Nobody really thought about these impacts. It was all driven by blind government policy.
In all cases it’s: “Whether these solutions work or not, it won’t be our problem – so take the money while you can, and run”. We see it at GE, Siemens, the solar industry and a host of others. The list is too long to get into.
These opportunists and swindlers never stopped once to think that the science could be wrong, or couldn’t care less. They don’t want to know it’s wrong. “It’s to save the climate (and make tons of money guaranteed by government policy).” This is selfish opportunism – not engineering.
So will it work?
Richard Wagner at Die Achse Des Guten provides us the answer using an example.
Because I accused the Greens of being hostile to technology, one reader asked me the clever question of whether or not the green technologies of sun and wind power systems were products of engineering, and thus of technology.
The question where technology begins and where it ends is certainly an intriguing issue. One can discuss it all evening long, both in the limelight or by candle light. But it would not address the core of the issue. Also the production of bicycles is a significant part of our economy. Yet, nobody has ever seriously asked if it would be possible to replace commercial jets with flying bicycles.
But this is precisely what the Greens are attempting in the energy issue. This is, and will remain, a question of technology and resources needed for the technology at hand. The objective of every energy debate should be the creation and the assurance of the energy extent that we need in order to progress further.”
And not finding ways to force others to go without. And saving energy is a waste if the costs of doing so far exceed the savings and benefits. Green engineers need to broaden their scope of analysis and depth of thinking. They need to get away from ideology, and to get back to art of engineering.

"Roads in the centre of Edinburgh were closed to traffic for the first time on Sunday as the city joined the Open Streets movement to reduce air pollution.  Cities around the world have temporarily opened streets to people by closing them to cars, vans and other motorised vehicles on a regular basis. The City of Edinburgh council said it was the first city in the UK to join the Open Streets movement and would be closing roads to traffic on the first Sunday of every month as part of an 18-month trial. Councillor Lesley Macinnes said: “We’ve seen how successful similar schemes internationally have proved by encouraging active travel, improving air quality and creating a safer, more relaxed atmosphere so I can’t wait to see this take shape in the capital. “Climate change is a real threat to society, it’s clear that we have to act, and Open Streets is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. We are wholeheartedly committed to creating an accessible, sustainable and people-friendly city.” Open-air yoga, giant chess games, music and tai chi were among the activities on offer on Sunday."
"Bill Shorten has left open the option of boosting wages for aged care workers, saying the fact that Labor is supporting early childhood educators in this election “does not mean that we won’t work to help aged care work force in the future”. In a solo appearance on Q&A on Monday night, the Labor leader was asked why he was making a special case for subsidising the salaries of childcare workers, but not aged care workers. Labor has promised to increase the pay of early childhood educators by 20% over eight years, an average increase of $11,300 above any award rises. Shorten said Labor was confident it could deliver assistance for childcare now and would wait to see the outcome of the royal commission into aged care before determining whether to roll out assistance there too. He said the analysis of which sectors were being helped and which were not in the event Labor wins should not be a “Hunger Games” exercise or a competition for “who is the most miserable”. Shorten said early childhood educators were the first people entrusted with children outside the family home and “because it’s a feminised industry the vast bulk workforce of women have been underpaid forever”. “That’s why we are going to look after early childhood educators [but] my answer shows we’re thinking about what to do in aged care too.” After the 28 April announcement of Labor’s wage subsidy policy, which is forecast to cost $9.9bn over a decade, Shorten initially left the door open to extending the concept to other sectors, noting that childcare had been selected to “go first”. But after the policy, which also includes free childcare for families earning less than $69,000, was swiftly blasted by the Morrison government as “socialism” and a bribe to unions representing childcare workers, Labor’s workplace relations spokesman, Brendan O’Connor, shut down the idea it could be applied to other sectors. While Shorten again signalled on Monday night the concept could be used elsewhere, O’Connor said a couple of days after the policy launch there were “no plans” to extend the model to other sectors. “Childcare is a special case,” he told the ABC. “Childcare has been historically underpaid.” Scott Morrison has declined to appear solo on the Q&A program. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, went on the program just after the April budget. Over more than an hour, Shorten faced hostile questions about Labor’s revenue measures, including dividend imputation and changes to negative gearing, and launched an unapologetic defence of his policies. He was challenged to oppose the controversial Queensland Adani coalmine as a test of Labor’s commitment to climate change. Shorten said Labor would adhere to the science and the law and not create sovereign risk. “There is no doubt in my mind that we’re moving to more renewables,” he said. “There’s no doubt in my mind that coal-fired power is getting more expensive and renewables are getting cheaper. “But at the end of the day we have to have a framework of laws. We have to have a framework for investment.” Shorten was asked what he had learned from Kevin Rudd’s declaration that climate change was the great moral challenge of our time, and his subsequent retreat from emissions trading in 2009. “What I learned out of 2009, you can stand for something or fall for everything and we’re going to stand and fight on climate change,” he said. “We’re not retreating”. Shorten again said Labor would consider an increase in the Newstart payment after a review undertaken if Labor wins, but declined to put a dollar amount on it. He also signalled there would be substantial reform in Indigenous affairs, to be led by Pat Dodson. Shorten characterised Indigenous disadvantage as a “national disaster, a national emergency”. Asked about his persistent unpopularity with voters, he said he had seen off two prime ministers as leader of the opposition, and Labor had a unified and stable team who would ensure its pre-election commitments were delivered. Shorten pointed out that Malcolm Turnbull, who had been popular with the public, and feted by some journalists as the “Sun King”, was now watching the program from New York rather than from the Lodge. He said if he won the prime ministership, he would listen to the community and seek to be inclusive. “If I’m elected prime minister, we’re going to do the public meetings and go out and listen to people, so my style of leadership is to listen. “My style of leadership is to get the best out of people. This isn’t just an idle statement. Love us or hate us, the Labor party for the last five and a half years has been stable. Not for nothing did Bob Hawke say if you can’t run your own party you can’t run the country.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe English language online The Local, here, brings us an example of how overzealous and authoritarian greens masquerading as concerned environmentalists can be. Hat-tip DirkH.
Winfried Kretschmann, the newly elected green governor of the German state of Baden-Württemberg, has not only announced that he will decide the course of the southern German state, but also the course of the two luxury car makers Mercedes Benz and Porsche headquartered there.
Just forget the top managers at the world’s leading luxury car makers, whose expertise and managerial skill have made Mercedes and Porsche gold plated brand names over the last decades. Forget companies writing their own mission statements and producing their own visions for the future. And forget companies navigating through the uncertainties of the future and drawing up middle-term and long-term business plans. All this now has been taken over by the supremacist Greens, at least in Baden-Württemberg.
No longer will Porsche and Mercedes engineer and manufacture the world’s top luxury automobiles and sports cars on their own terms, but rather they will have to content themselves with ignoring the wishes of their markets and shift to building cars that suit the expectations of a few green masterminds. Kretschmann says:
I expect that premium producers create energy and resource-efficient product lines. That could be a little more expensive, as most of those who buy limousines can take it. Above all, Daimler and Porsche should see themselves as mobility companies in five years’ time – and no longer just as car factories.”
You got that? Your cars aren’t expensive enough. Personally, I drive a modest Mercedes C-Class, and if Mercedes bends to the will of these enviro-Stalinists, then it will definitely be the very last one I buy. I have no interest in buying a car from a company that hands the management reins over to a bunch of arrogant dogmatist zealots. The Local writes:
‘Petrol-greedy luxury limousines are not the future,’ he said. ‘We should no longer only export cars, but also a new idea of what a chic car is in the future. I believe that the companies think this way too’.”
Getting people off the streets and autobahns
The target of all this is to restrict people’s mobility. According to The Local, this green Burgermeister-Meisterburger has also announced an array of decrees, much to the delight of his green, spear-carrying, attack-hungry warriors. The Local writes:
The incoming Green-led state government of Baden-Württemberg has unveiled plans to introduce a speed limit on the autobahns and replace vehicle tax with road tolls. It also wants to build wind farms in the region.”

The Local adds:
The road tax should apply to all roads, he said, and should be, ‘as individualised as possible, thus related to time, place, length of road use and type of car.’ This should reduce traffic in total, he said.”
This is shorthand for: “We’re going to put the screws to poorer people and those living out in the countryside (in nature), and make mobility affordable only for the well-heeled.
Industrialising the Black Forest with windmills

The windfarms he mentions above of course will be built inland, and not offsore in the North or Baltic seas where the wind blows enough for them to reach just over 20% of their rated capacity. Inland, however, they’ll have to be content with reaching just over 15% of their rated capacity. This means they will have to put up about 7 times more wind generators to deliver 100% capacity – that is when the wind blows hard enough. And when the wind doesn’t blow, then it doesn’t matter how many you install – you’ll be forced to import nuclear power, from across the border, from France.
Where exactly will the windparks go? The Local writes:
‘Wind farms would also form a part of the state’s future,’ said Kretschmann. ‘There will be completely new windparks – large, modern facilities – above all in the Mittelgebirge, on the Schwäbisch Alb and in the Black Forest,’ he said.”
Citizens in these areas, organise, and fight this onslaught on your landscape and heritage. These pseudo-greens are going to industrialise your landscape with ugly moving white giants. They did it in my hometown in Vermont, and the beauty there is now gone. Like in Vermont, big, profiteering industrial bastards are behind it all, and they will profit handsomely from it. It has nothing to do with environmentalism.
What does Dear Leader Kretschmann say about windmills polluting the landscape?
‘A change of the industrial society changes the landscape; that is the price that we have to pay for progress. One cannot discard nuclear power, damn coal-generated electricity, want to maintain living standards and at the same time demand that the landscape should not change.’
Interesting times are ahead.
All of it, we will recall, is based on the loony proposition, floated by charlatan scientists, that man controls the climate. Germany pursues yet again another version of the 1000-year empire. Time to present this guy with a cuckoo-clock – because cuckoo is where he’s headed.

and here: Police raid organic farm
=========================================
The German Die Welt online here reports that veterinary and medical experts are now saying that biogas plants may be the source of the lethal E. coli bacteria now running rampant through Germany. Although the disaster is nowhere the scale we saw in Bhopal, India, so far we have seen 18 dead and over 500 hospitalized. And needless to say, millions of Europeans are spooked.
Die Welt writes:
Ernst-Günther Hellwig, director of the Agricultural and Veterinary Academy in Horstmar, warns that the bacteria likely comes from new sources, saying the epidemic is a house-made German problem. ‘It is possible that the EHEC contagion comes from biogas plants,’ he said.”
Die Welt also reports that Hellwig has long been critical of biogas plants. Yet biogas industry proponents claim there is no connection between the current E. coli outbreak and biogas plant operations.
Hellwig is not alone in this belief. Die Welt also writes that laboratory director Bernd Schottdorf, founder of the 1500-employee private medical laboratory Schottdorf MVZ in Augsburg, the biggest in Europe, also thinks the connection is possible. “Spores survive the biogas plants’ prescribed hygienization of 70°C without a problem“, he says. “We don’t know if the hygienization is properly carried out at all biogas plants.” When waste product from biogas plants is spread on fields, they can contaminate the vegetables.

North Germany’s unusual dry weather and drought conditions, where it did not rain for weeks during the springtime, may have played a role in the spread of the deadly bacteria. Spores can stay on plants for a long time, as they don’t get washed off by rain. The biogas plant substrate, which is a by-product and is used as a fertilizer, probably didn’t get washed off the crops by any rain. Currently there are 6800 biogas plants in Germany and their inspection is disorganised.
North German drought and dirty irrigation and “unwashed” crops
Manure slurry spreaders also used for irrigation.
Die Welt also writes that experts believe the unusually dry spring weather also may have led farmers to irrigate their crops using their liquid-manure spreaders. Farmers sometimes irrigate crops during dry spells using liquid manure spreaders, as this German manufacturer suggests here (scroll down to Liquid manure Distribution and irrigation systems).
The problem is that these liquid manure tanks are of course dirty and so contaminate the water, which in turn contaminates the crops. And then if it doesn’t rain for days or weeks, the crops stay contaminated through the time they are harvested.
Some points are clear: 1) The source of the E. coli is Northern Germany, which is home to many biogas plants and where agricultural manure fertilizer is widely used. The weather in the run-up to the start of the epidemic was very dry. Indeed, more detective work is needed to trace back the cause.
The online  FOCUS magazine here also brings up the biogas plant issue, hat-tip DirkH.
Biogas plants are also suspected of causing DEADLY BOTULISM in North German Agriculture, read here. Looks like all the well-intentioned green growing is leading to a trail of death and illness instead of natural health and cleanliness.

I recently read a news clipping from the Canadian Press headlined: Never mind that cold snap-fed stats suggest Canadian winters are getting warmer. According to the article, the figures were compiled by Environment Canada and released to the Canadian Press on January 25, 2011.
I checked the Environment Canada data and have come to a different conclusion from their climate data record. I have produced two graphs of past winters from 1998-2010 showing the annual winter temperature departure for 11 of the Canadian regions and Canada as a whole. All temperature data comes from Environment Canada.
Here are the 11 climate zones in Canada:

This is what the graph shows.
Canadian temperatures 1998 - 2011
Here is what the graph tells me in my opinion:
* For Canada as a whole, the average linear winter trend is negative (cooling), see graph above.
* The linear winter trend of 8 of the 11 regional areas was also cooling, see graph below.
* The linear trend of the Atlantic coast is flat.
* Only the linear trend for the Arctic tundra and fiords (far Arctic North) shows warming.
Next is a chart showing the plots for all 11 regions of Canada and their winter temperature departures from 1998 -2010. The Canadian average is also included together with the linear trend for all of Canada.
 
Discussion
What my objection to the Canadian Press article and its headline was that it implies to the Canadian public that Canadian winters are getting milder when they have not for the last 13 years. That is significant.You can’t ignore that if you are going to write an article about changes in Canadian winters. The article compared winter data sets between 1970’s and today. I however compared 1998 and 2010/2011 which is much more current and up to date.  
The 1970s were at the bottom of the climate cycle when both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as measured by AMO and PDO were in the cool mode. Now we are near the top of the current warm cycle and starting to come down fast. So naturally any comparison will show a warming. But it does not mean that the warming will continue. It is like comparing winter datasets to summer datasets and saying we are warming – forgetting that after the summer comes another fall and winter. The PDO and AMO are again heading for the cool phase like the 1970’s.
When costal waters around North America cool, the inland areas will cool first and to a greater degree. This is exactly what is happening in North America and Europe and Asia.
The SST anomalies for US coastal waters [20N-50N] dropped more than 0.65 deg C by January 2011. The January 2011 reading for the U.S. Coast Waters is the lowest on record for the satellite-based Reynolds Oi.v2 SST dataset [as to Bob Tisdale’s recent post on WUWT].
So I think what was missing in the article was the fact that, yes, it is interesting that our Canadian winters have warmed between 1970’s and today but what it did not say is that we should not to expect this to continue, since the climate factors that caused the cooler climate back in the 1970′ are back again and have already caused the cooling to return during the last decade. More cooling can be expected during the next 20-30 years. Even the AGW climate scientists have admitted to the media that there has been no statistical global warming since 1995.
The winter of 2009 perhaps is indicative of what might be ahead for some of the future Canadian winters. It already had winter temperatures close to those of the 1970’s for many regions . Most regions (7 in total) had below normal winter temperature departures except (4) Atlantic coast, Mackenzie District and Arctic Tundra, Mountains and Fjords. The 2009 winter had both the AMO and PDO negative or cool, like what we may get again in the decades ahead.  The 2011 winter also mimiced similar conditions as the coastal waters around North America had cooled to record low levels [similar to a negative AMO and already a negative PDO]

The second wrong message in the article was that the warming between 1970 and 2010 was due to global warming when it has clearly been shown by climate scientists, including the Met Office, that natural planetary cycles ENSO (stronger El Nino’s) were behind the recent warm phase.
Not just Canada is cooling – but the United States too 
http://climvis.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/cag3/hr-display3.pl
– Winter temperatures have been dropping for 10 years since 2000.
– Annual temperatures have been dropping for 4 years.
– US winter temperatures have dropped 6°F between 2000 and 2010.
 Global snow extent
– 2011 winter had the 3rd highest snow extent in the Northern Hemisphere and North America since 1967.
– 2010 winter had the 2nd most snow extent for Northern Hemisphere since the1978/1979 winter [2008 had the 3rd highest since 1967].
– 2010 winter had the highest winter snow extent since 1967 and the extent has been climbing since 2006.
– 5 of the11 highest snow extents for Eurasia have happened since 2003[2003 was the2nd highest since 1967]. 
Let’s do some fact checking about our current GLOBAL MEAN TEMPERATURE ANOMALY
http://climate.rutgers.edu/snowcover/table_area.php?ui_set=1
Other regions of the globe
– The cold weather in US has reached the Mexican/US border with significant lost crops this year.
– Record snow or new cold temperatures set in December 2010 across various parts of the Northern Hemisphere.
– Sweden had coldest December in 110 years and 2010 was the coldest in two decades. Norway had its coldest year since 1941 and 10th coldest since 1941.
– UK had its coldest December since in 120 years. Germany had its coldest December in 41 years, Ireland had its coldest December since 1881 or in129 years
– Similar cold records were set in the Middle East, the Korean peninsula, Mexico, China, and India.
– Following another extended stretch of sub-zero temperatures, ice coverage on the Baltic Sea is greater than it’s been in nearly a quarter century, Sweden’s meteorological agency reports.
– The Russian are having one of hardest winter in the last 100 years during the 2011 winter. The average temperature for February in Moscow was 11°C below normal!
Conclusion
So how can we say that Canadian winter temperatures are getting milder when the data shows that Canadian winter temperatures as a whole are getting cooler for 8 of the 11 regions since 1998? Only the high Arctic shows warming.  The more logical conclusion would be the winter temperatures were fluctuating but the trend is cooling. For some regions like the Prairies and Northwestern forest areas, there was 6.6 to 7.1 C  of cooling between 2006 and 2009. Once the 2011 winter gets added to the data, the cooling aspect will be even more evident.
Here are the winter temperature departures for all 11 regions of Canada. As you will note, the linear trend line for all are negative or cooling with the exception of the Atlantic coast which is flat or no real change and Arctic Mountains , Fiords  and Tundra  which show warming or rising trend line.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI wanted to hit the sack but a video clip in English of some excerpts from an interview of John Holdren by German intellectual paper DIE ZEIT. Click here::
http://www.zeit.de/wissen/2011-03/holdren-chefberater-obama
At about the 3:40 mark, Holdren is asked what will be the sciences of the future and the challenges. This takes him to climate change:
We are fortunately getting better, and we need to get better at understanding some very big systems, science systems issues including for example the science of ecosystems, the formation and fertilisation of soil, the pollination of crops, the regulation of climate. All of these things I think sometimes get lost in the discussion of the importance of infotech and nanotech and biotech. We need to understand how the parts fit togther, how they work because we are not yet remotely ready technologically to make planet earth into a speceship where all systems are designed by engineers. We still need nature, We need to understand how it works.”
I thought the science was settled. But  Holden now admits that we still need to understand how it all fits together – how it works. So how CO2 controls linearly controls the temperature, we we keep seeing in their charts, is a bit puzzling to me.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German-based European Institute For Climate and Energy (EIKE) reports here on a paper just published by German scientists Horst-Joachim Lüdecke and Rainer Link appearing in the IJMPC Journal (International Journal of Modern Physics C), see here.
The full paper is available as a pdf file here in English.
The authors claim that CO2 does have a modest warming effect on the global temperature, but:
The effect is harmless (to the contrary, CO2-increases and slight global warming are beneficial for man and thus desirable) and show that the overly alarmist prognoses for future climate developments as fully inappropriate.”
The two authors applied a simplified model to determine a climate sensitivity for mean global warming for a hypothetical doubling of CO2 concentration to be 1.1 °C based on radiative flux without feedback effects.
The conclusion states (emphasis added):
This paper demonstrates that a basic 1-dimensional 1-layer model with different atmospheric and top of atmosphere long wave radiation fluxes and temperatures, and including the reflections of the long wave radiation at the surface of the Earth and atmosphere can reproduce with excellent agreement the observed global average surface temperatures and radiation fluxes. This requires that all emission and absorption processes are correctly introduced into the model. In particular the direct emission of long wave radiation from Earth to space and the temperature dependence of latent and sensible heat have to be taken into account. Our model yields a change in the surface temperature of the Earth of roughly 1.1°C for an additional radiative forcing of 3.7 W/m2 – caused for instance by a hypothetical doubling of the present CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, which is in good agreement with the appropriate IPCC value, if no feedback ampli cation (or attenuation) is considered.”
Debate papers welcome
Readers are encouraged to join the discussion at the EIKE website linked above. Comments in English are welcome as well. Anyone who believes to have good physical critical points to introduce against the publication and is prepared to join the IJMPC peer-review process is warmly welcome to present a debate paper to the IJMPC.

"Of the nearly two dozen Democrats running for president, only two campaigns have so far laid out deadlines for transforming American life to slash the pollution that is warming the planet’s climate. The world’s scientists warn that governments have about 11 years to put in place strategies to cut emissions from power plants, cars, buildings, factories and land use. Once the next US president takes office, they will have nine years.  Passing large-scale climate legislation or writing new regulations for industry could take years, even if it is the next president’s primary priority. Any new administration will need to enter office with a detailed proposal and timeline to make a dent in the country’s share of climate pollution, experts agree. “The more that we delay, the harder it will be,” said Sonia Aggarwal, vice-president of the climate policy group Energy Innovation. “The sooner we get started, the more we’ll see deployment of new and increasingly very low-cost technologies that can reduce emissions.” Aggarwal said the changes required are “nothing short of remaking our economy” at a “fundamental level”. Energy Innovation advocates for tackling the biggest and least complicated emissions cuts first. That includes switching to clean sources of electricity and scaling back super-polluting gases, including methane emissions from the oil and gas industry and fluorinated gases used in refrigeration and air conditioning. But as Democrats cast Donald Trump and other Republicans as resistant to even acknowledging the crisis, most Democratic candidates have yet to reach that level of detail in their policy proposals.  The Washington governor Jay Inslee and Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke want the US to be carbon-neutral within the next three decades. Both have unveiled detailed climate policy plans. Inslee would set milestones for three sectors that could drive major reductions: power, transportation and buildings. He has earned praise for his specificity. O’Rourke would also spend $5 tn on green infrastructure. Senator Elizabeth Warren has proposed banning new coalmining and oil drilling on public lands, which could cut US emissions but fall short of what scientists say is needed. A House climate committee will consider the idea. Some advocates say it is too soon to judge Democratic candidates on climate, with the 2020 election season starting earlier than ever. “At this early stage in the campaign, the most important thing is that the candidates get the policy right and commit to making climate change a top priority,” said Varshini Prakash, the leader of the youth-run Sunrise Movement. She said the group is looking for candidates who will “put the full weight of the government behind a transformation of our economy and society”. Lynn Scarlett, a vice-president for policy at the Nature Conservancy, said, “Regardless of the details, it is encouraging to see how elevated this issue has become. “We recognize that successfully getting policy across any finish line often means going in with some broad principles and some broad paradigm but using the legislative process in a give-and-take to work out the devilish details,” Scarlett continued. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders speaks frequently about the urgency of the climate change problem and supports a Green New Deal to fight global warming while making life more equitable for the poor and people of color. In 2015, Sanders unveiled a plan to cut US carbon emissions 80% by 2050, but so far this campaign season he has not laid out a timeline for the broad strategies he supports. Sanders has signed a pledge to refuse donations from fossil fuel interests, but other prominent Democrats have not, including the New Jersey senator Cory Booker, California senator Kamala Harris and former vice-president Joe Biden. Booker has an environmental justice plan to crack down on pollution in vulnerable communities, but he has not set a timeline for cutting carbon emissions. Harris is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal but has otherwise said little about what she would do. Biden entered the race last month, marketing himself as the only candidate who can beat Donald Trump. Biden was the first senator to propose climate legislation, but he has not endorsed a Green New Deal or any other specific policies recently. RL Miller, chair of the California Democratic party environmental caucus and political director of Climate Hawks Vote, said the campaigns are progressing on climate but running out of time. “We have two plans and a lot of buy-in on some concepts that have not been fleshed out into plans,” Miller said. One poll of Democrats recently showed climate change is their top issue. A United Nations report warned this week that as the Earth absorbs rising temperatures, human society is in jeopardy. Miller said with the first debate in less than two months, candidates should be expanding on their ideas more. “The sooner you lay out a plan early on, the sooner you stand out,” Miller said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMedia jubilation in the wake of the killing of Osama Bin Laden. And there should be.
But back in 2006, under a different President, the media reacted much differently when the US forces whacked another equally brutal and cold-blooded killer – Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He’s the butcher who taped the decapitation of Nicolas Berg (a video so chilling that I have refused to watch it). Abu Musab al-Zarqawi carried out numerous viscious acts of terrorism, beheadings and murder throughout Iraq.
You’d think the media would have rejoiced in the same way back then when al-Zarqawi was terminated?
Not a bit. Instead they sniffed and, openly accused our equally heroic US forces of brutality, cover-up and inhumane treatment – even depriving the poor butcher of his Miranda rights. Take for example the pathetic Democratic Underground website, which wrote:
U.S. troops arriving on the scene wrapped the man’s head in an Arab robe and began beating him, said the local man, who refused to give his name or show his face to the camera. His account could not be independently verified. The U.S. military made no mention of any physical contact between U.S. troops and al-Zarqawi other than an attempt to provide him with medical attention.
Here’s my theory: The US found Zarqawi still alive and he died/killed in custody. Then they called in the fighter jets to bomb his house after he was dead to cover up their deeds. In the process they killed 6(?) civilians including at least 1 child. If this is true then all 7 deaths should be considered murder.”
Or look at the equally pathetic CBS, who had no qualms about floating the allegations of excessive use of force by US forces – quoting some dubious witness named Mohammed:
‘When the Americans arrived they took him out of the ambulance, they beat him on his stomach and wrapped his head with his dishdasha, then they stomped on his stomach and his chest until he died and blood came out of his nose,’ Mohammed said, without saying how he knew the man was dead.”

Oh my God – such brutality. Even if it were true, I’d say good for them.
Brian Jenkins, a terrorism expert with RAND Corp.,  couldn’t find anything positive in the killing of al Zarqawi, and is quoted in USA Today as saying:
Americans ‘take a kind of ‘Wanted’ poster approach” to the fight against terrorism and ‘therefore believe that if another desperado bites the dust, the war is over and we can ride off into the sunset’. In fact, Jenkins said, the long-term effect of Zarqawi’s death is likely to be slight, because the main players in Iraq’s violence — Baathist hard-liners, Shiite militias and Iraqi organized crime elements — remain.”
The AP and MSNBC here  gave Al Qaeda a voice to spread encouragement among their followers, quoting an Al Qaeda website:
We want to give you the joyous news of the martyrdom of the mujahed sheik Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The death of our leaders is life for us. It will only increase our persistence in continuing holy war so that the word of God will be supreme.”

So can we trust the media? You be the judge.

"Scott Morrison’s office has declined to say what legislation he was referring to when he said he had “been taking action” on a landmark UN report about the extinction of a million different species. On Monday, the UN released a comprehensive, multi-year report that revealed human society was under threat from the unprecedented extinction of the Earth’s animals and plants. The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, said the report “scared him”, during a debate on Wednesday. On Tuesday Morrison responded to the report saying: “We already introduced and passed legislation through the Senate actually dealing with that very issue in the last week of the parliament. We’ve been taking action on that.” But no legislation regarding animal conservation or the environment passed in the final week of parliament. When asked what the legislation was, the prime minister’s office did not reply. The office of the environment minister, Melissa Price, also did not respond when asked what legislation Morrison was referring to. The only legislation regarding animals that passed within the last few months is the industrial chemicals bill 2017, which set new regulations on testing cosmetics on animals. It was passed by both houses on 18 February – not in the last week of parliament, which was in April. Neither the prime minister nor the environment minister responded to clarify if this was the bill Morrison was referring to or whether he made an error. Tim Beshara, the federal policy director of the Wilderness Society, said Morrison appeared to have “alluded to a bill that doesn’t exist”. “The last bill to pass the Senate from the environment portfolio was about changing the board structure of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in 2018,” he said. “It looks like the prime minister of Australia is so desperate to move the debate off the environment as an issue that he has alluded to a bill that doesn’t exist so that journalists would stop asking questions about it.” Beshara said the cosmetics testing bill was “not about species extinction or the environment” and only helped “the rabbits in laboratories run by the cosmetics industry”. On Wednesday Morrison also railed against the expansion of environmental regulations, calling them “green tape”. He told the Sydney Morning Herald the expansion of “green tape” – including native vegetation laws – was delaying projects like mining and “costs jobs”. “[Labor] want to hypercharge an environment protection authority which will basically interfere and seek to slow down and prevent projects all around the country,” he said. Beshara said the timing of this with the mass extinction report showed “excellent comedic timing”. “What he is calling ‘green tape’, most Australians would call basic environmental protections,” he said. “I don’t expect the prime minister to know their numbats from their bandicoots, but I do expect them to know what bills their government has passed, and to respond to a globally significant UN report like this with the seriousness it deserves.” Also on Wednesday, Littleproud said the report showed Australia needed to invest in science and technology to give farmers the tools to adapt. He also highlighted the government’s commitment to spend $30m on an agricultural stewardship fund to help deal with biodiversity. Labor’s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, said Littleproud deserved an award “as the first Morrison government minister flushed out and forced to respond to the UN report”. “Everyone else is in witness protection,” he said. He affirmed that Labor would deliver on its promise to introduce a federal environment protection agency. Earlier in January, Morrison’s media office also erroneously identified a different bill as helping the environment. The prime minister had told ABC News Breakfast in January that “environmental legislation … [that] is important for native species” was a priority for his government. When asked, Morrison’s staff said he was referring to “the agricultural and veterinary chemicals legislation amendment”. The prime minister’s office later said it had made an error, and Morrison was in fact referring to the industrial chemicals bill and its ban on animal testing."
