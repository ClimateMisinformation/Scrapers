"An influential Conservative member of the House of Lords has been accused of lobbying the government for the benefit of the coal industry, despite previously saying he does not argue for the industry’s interests. Viscount Matt Ridley, a journalist and businessman, benefits financially from coalmines on his estate and has used his column in the Times newspaper to downplay the seriousness of climate change.  The former chairman of Northern Rock wrote to energy minister Lord Bourne in April to tell him about a Texas-based company with “fascinating new technology, which may well interest the Department of Energy and Climate Change”.  The email, released after a freedom of information request, tells Bourne the company’s technology: “represents a PROFITABLE [sic] use for CO2 emissions from power stations, by turning them into cheap chemical feedstocks with a new process.” The company, said Ridley, is “interested in talking to the British government”. “I have no vested interest in this, except perhaps a faint hope that it might give Northumbrian coalmining jobs a new lease of life,” he told Bourne. Ridley receives payments from opencast coalmines operating on his ancestral estate in Northumberland, though he declines to say how much. In 2014, he said: “I deliberately do not argue directly for the interests of the modern coal industry and I consistently champion the development of gas reserves. So I consistently argue against my own financial interest.” Friends of the Earth (FoE) campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: “We think it’s worrying that climate sceptic Viscount Ridley should be using his privileged position in the Lords to argue against renewable energy, whilst lobbying to benefit a coal industry he has a significant financial interest in. “Ridley has always maintained his own coal interests are immaterial to his climate sceptic views and political activities,” Shrubshole said. “This disclosure paints a different picture – of a peer who attacks clean energy whilst seeking to extend the lifetime of the coal industry in this country.” Ridley is on the academic advisory council of Lord Nigel Lawson’s climate sceptic thinktank, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, and in his email to Bourne, he said: “I look forward to manning the barricades against windfarms once again on Tuesday”, an apparent reference to a debate in parliament during which Ridley spoke against wind power. Ridley told the Guardian: “The company offers potential for emissions reduction (which I thought FoE favoured) as a byproduct of manufacturing something useful. I have no interest in it now or in the future, because my coal interests will expire long before anything happens. The distant possibility of interest I mentioned was on behalf of Northumbrian workers who might want to keep their jobs. I have not contradicted myself in any way.” Ridley’s correspondence with Bourne included an email that the company had sent to Ridley, thanking him for a meeting at the House of Lords and for his “navigational advice”. The company told Ridley that its technology “enables coal-based economies to now maintain their status quo” and that “while there are certainly environmental virtues of this technology set, the offering is about job saving, job creation and production of the world’s lowest cost base chemical in the most environmentally friendly manner”. The company claimed their installations required “no government subsidy to be profitable”, a message Ridley passed on to Bourne: “They just need political – not financial help in setting up a demonstration project.” But he told Bourne: “It won’t use up all emissions, of course, because there is not enough demand for these chemicals.” The company name is redacted but it tells Ridley that it: “received the largest grant of the six beneficial reuse carbon capture projects that the DOE [US Department of Energy] is supporting with funds made available through the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act”, the same phrase used by US company Skyonics in an earlier press release. Skyonics’s technology turns CO2 emissions from power, cement and industrial plants into chemicals including baking soda and hydrochloric acid and has received a $25m US government grant. Shrubshole said: “Coal CCS [carbon capture and storage] is a dead duck. Industrial CCS may have a future – but not if the carbon dioxide gas is simply used for ‘enhanced oil recovery’ and the extraction of yet more fossil fuels, as many companies propose.” He said: “It’s time for the UK government to deliver on its promise of phasing out coal, end the scandal of opencast coal mining and leave coal in the ground.”  Banks Group, which operates the mines on Ridley’s land, recently won planning permission for a new opencast mine at Druridge Bay, elsewhere in Northumberland. The government has pledged to phase out coal power in the UK by 2025. • Note added 2 August 2016: On 28 July 2016 Viscount Ridley forwarded to the Guardian readers’ editor a letter Ridley had received from the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Lucy Scott-Moncrieff. In it she advised Ridley that she had dismissed at the preliminary stage a complaint about Ridley from a Thomas O’Neill relating to the Code of Conduct. The commissioner’s letter said the complaint had been based on this article. "
"The world’s first international treaty that bans or phases out fossil fuels is being considered by leaders of developing Pacific islands nations after a summit in the Solomon Islands this week. The leaders of 14 countries agreed to consider a proposed Pacific climate treaty, which would bind signatories to targets for renewable energy and ban new or the expansion of coalmines, at the annual leaders’ summit of the Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF).  Mahendra Kumar, climate change advisor to PIDF, told the Guardian the treaty proposal was received very positively by the national leaders. “They seemed convinced that this is an avenue where the Pacific could again show or build on the moral and political leadership that they’ve shown earlier in their efforts to tackle climate change,” he said. The PIDF was formed in 2013, spearheaded by Fiji, and excludes Australia and New Zealand, which are members of the older Pacific Islands Forum. There were claims at the time that Australia and New Zealand attempted to sabotage the group’s first meeting. Then in 2015 Australia and New Zealand foiled an attempt by the developing countries in the older forum to take a 1.5C target to last year’s Paris climate change conference. But the treaty being considered by the newer group embraces the aspirational 1.5C target set at Paris, setting mitigation targets that are in line with it, as well as establishing adaptation mechanisms to cope with the effects of that warming. Written by a coalition of non-governmental organisations called the Pacific Island Climate Action Network (PICAN), the model treaty will be the subject of consultations, which will result in a report to the summit next year. Kumar said it is unlikely to be adopted within one year, but it was possible it could be adopted the following year, in 2018. Joeteshna Gurdayal Zenos, acting head of Pacfic Net, which is Greenpeace Australia Pacific’s climate justice project, said: “Pacific island leaders are among the most proactive in the world on global warming because their countries are bearing the brunt of climate changes. “Their willingness to consider a Pacific climate treaty shows much-needed leadership on the world’s most pressing environmental challenge,” she said. In a report that presents the model treaty, PICAN said: “The rationale is that potential Parties to the Treaty already possess the political courage and commitment needed to adopt a flagship legal instrument that is sufficiently ambitious to prevent catastrophic changes in the global climate system. “Such a treaty, when implemented in collaboration with PIDF and civil society, would send a powerful signal to markets, governments and civil society around the world that the end of fossil fuels is near, with Pacific Islanders acting not as victims of climate change but as agents of change. “As there is currently no treaty that bans or phases out fossil fuels, the Treaty would set a pioneering example to the rest of the world.” The treaty itself would bind parties to not approve any new coal or fossil fuel mines and not provide any subsidy for fossil fuel mining or consumption.  It says parties will ensure “universal access” to clean energy by 2030, and would establish a “Pacific framework for renewable energy” to achieve that goal. The treaty would establish a fund, which would provide compensation for communities that have suffered climate change-related losses.  The proposed treaty also has sections on climate-related migration and adaptation."

"The cast has changed following Theresa May’s reshuffle, but the play remains the same. It’s a struggle pitching free-market red tape slashers against those backing a clean, green economy as the UK’s best long term bet. The big question is whether this performance will have a different ending. The performance directed by David Cameron was full of good lines - “the greenest government ever” – but the reviews, even by him, were poor: “cut the green crap”.   So what about the new actors, starting at the top. Theresa May has said virtually nothing about the environment and climate change, but the new chancellor, Philip Hammond already has some stirring words up his sleeve. In November last year, as foreign secretary, he said climate change was both a grave threat and a fantastic opportunity: “There may now be more risk in being left behind than there is in taking the lead.” Yet the antediluvian atmosphere of the Treasury could turn him from friend of the environment to foe, as it did George Osborne. Hammond’s immediate backing for the white elephant that is the new Hinkley nuclear power station suggests he doesn’t understand the rapid global shift already underway from old, centralised energy to distributed renewables and smart grids. In the last performance, Oliver Letwin was on hand to break down Treasury resistance, but he’s exited, stage centre-right. Next of the new actors to take a bow is Hammond’s replacement, Boris Johnson, a climate change sceptic who is now in charge of the UK’s climate change diplomacy that did a great deal behind the scenes to ramp up ambition around the world. He’s not even diplomatic. All the world may be a stage, especially for showman Boris, but the dramatic tension at the heart of the play is most taut at home. It is the ideological battle over regulation, seen as business-slaying red tape by one side and protections that can open new markets by the other. Most of the key departments are now being run by machete-wielding red tape slashers. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs now has Andrea Leadsom in charge – she is as passionate a free-marketeer as she was a Brexiter. It’s hard to imagine that someone who thinks the minimum wage should be abolished for small businesses is going to look kindly on the regulations needed to protect air, water, land and wildlife in post-Brexit Britain, despite the enormous economic benefits of a clean, thriving environment, nor the large sums of taxpayers’ cash needed to defend people from flooding. One seasoned commentator dubbed her the Sarah Palin of the UK. Over at Transport now is Brexiter Chris Grayling, a man who thinks red tape is “mad”. He is now in charge of cutting the huge emissions from transport, much of which was going to be tackled via EU rules. Sajid Javid, at the Department of Communities and Local Government, was a remainer, but is a described a “true Thatcherite” and revels in “getting the government off your back”. In charge of big planning decisions, he now has a key role in the roll-out of fracking and continuing the government’s relentless blocking of wind and solar farms.  Climate change around the world will impact the UK and the nation provides billions in support to imperilled countries, via the Department for International Development. Its new boss, Brexiter and red tape hater Priti Patel, doesn’t even think her department should exist. With this cast, the role of the new Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is vital. Its boss, Greg Clark, has had rave reviews for his previous work on energy and climate change and he could provide the plot twist not seen in earlier performances: putting the fast growing low carbon economy of the future at the heart of industrial strategy. But he’ll need the help of the new international trade secretary: enter stage far-right Liam Fox, who detests “binding” red tape. As before, the pivotal character determining the course of this drama is likely to be the chancellor. We will have to wait and see if he retains or rewrites these lines from November: “It is increasingly clear that the economy of the future will be a low carbon economy [and] by stimulating greater innovation and efficiency, climate policies will increase our economic competitiveness.”"
"So we’re in that post-election twilight zone where analysts, psephologists and columnists try and pull something cogent out of all the mess of uncertainty. Who’ll be the next prime minister? Which party will lead and how will they do it? What does it all mean, and did Donald Trump have anything to do with it? What do psephologists do when there’s no election on?  And then, of course, there’s the questions over the key issue of climate change and energy policy. Where might all this leave Australia? Right now, we don’t have much of an idea and it seems pointless to try until the results become clearer (OK, well, I’ll try a bit. If Labor gets in, then the news is better for the climate but still not good. A Coalition government will still deliver weak targets, policy uncertainty and a whiff of climate science denial on the fringes). So with all these unanswered questions, there’s something vaguely comforting about the uncompromising position of Pauline Hanson’s One Nation.  Because, along with all the halal-hating anti-Muslim rhetoric and potential for racial hatred, comes rejection of human-caused climate change and a genuine antipathy towards climate scientists (the party wants a royal commission or something similar to look into climate science). Soon-to-be senator Hanson thinks her One Nation party could grab four Senate spots – possibly even six. Other analysts think she’ll be lucky to get three.  Things will get clearer in a few days as the electoral commission has today started counting more of the votes. As I wrote before the 2013 election, One Nation’s climate science denial appears largely driven by former coalminer Malcolm Roberts – the project leader of the Galileo Movement.  The Galileo Movement, with its patron Alan Jones, was launched in 2011 to spread doubt about the science linking global warming to fossil fuel burning while fighting with every breath attempts at putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions. Roberts, like One Nation, claims there’s no evidence that humans are causing climate change and that the IPCC, the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO have been engaged in a “fraud” over climate science.  “Nature alone determines levels of CO2 in air,” Roberts has written, forgetting the 30bn tonnes or so that humans pump into the atmosphere each year.  Last year, in the lead up to the Paris climate change conference, I was invited to give a speech to the Queensland branch of the Australian Institute of International Affairs. Roberts turned up, occasionally shouting stuff like “that’s a lie” and “no, no” from the back of the room.  Roberts has been consistently spamming politicians, journalists and scientists with his reports and demands on “climate fraud” over recent years, sending scores of letters and reports, often by recorded mail.  One recipient, Fairfax journalist Ben Cubby, now the Sydney Morning Herald’s weekday print editor, described one of Roberts’ reports as “a pile of horseshit”. Roberts himself is the second Senate candidate for One Nation in Queensland, behind Hanson, and has an outside chance of being elected (I emailed One Nation last night to ask how they were planning to handle climate policy in the Senate but I haven’t heard back). Andrew Bartlett is placed second by the Greens on the party’s Queensland Senate ticket and so is watching the numbers closely. He thinks there is “still a chance” that Roberts could win a seat.  But he warned the final Queensland seats were hard to predict. A large number of candidates had a small percentage of the quota after the first preference counts. This means the “strength and rate of preference flows” were “very much an unknown”.  He said the LNP was on track for its lowest ever Qld Senate vote.  Of those from the right wing still in the mix, as things stand the second Hanson candidate is still in with an outside chance along with at least a couple of others. Regardless of the outcome, the Greens will use our numbers to do all we can to tackle global warming through a clean energy jobs boom and by ending approvals of new coal and gas. One Nation will not be a lone climate denialist voice in the Senate – there are a handful of Coalition senators that also share similar views.  Still hopeful of Senate seats too are the Liberal Democrats and Family First – neither of which accepts that humans are causing dangerous climate change. So what does seem likely is that some new senators will be in a position to use parliamentary privilege to further attack climate science."
"It’s not just the UK that is sweltering – last month was the hottest June ever recorded worldwide. That is according to two US agencies – Nasa and Noaa – who reported that it broke the previous record, set in 2015, by 0.02C (it has been recording temperatures since 1880). This follows a 14-month streak of record-breaking temperatures – something most scientists attributes to greenhouse gas emissions.  Nasa’s Gavin Schmidt said that while the El Niño event in the tropical Pacific this winter boosted global temperatures from October onwards, the effects of global warming is producing these record numbers. But what’s the impact of this on people’s lives? We want to see photographs and hear stories of the impact of rising global temperatures where you live. Perhaps you’re a farmer whose crop yields have been affected, or your area may have experienced droughts due to soaring temperatures.

"Ban Ki-moon’s climate change envoy has accused the UK and Germany of backtracking on the spirit of the Paris climate deal by financing the fossil fuel industry through subsidies. Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and UN special envoy on climate change and El Niño, said she had to speak out after Germany promised compensation for coal power and the UK provided tax breaks for oil and gas. Governments in Paris last year not only pledged to phase out fossil fuels in the long term but to make flows of finance consistent with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. “They’ve [the British government] introduced new tax breaks for oil and gas in 2015 that will cost the UK taxpayer billions between 2015 and 2020, and at the same time they’ve cut support for renewables and for energy efficiency,” she told the Guardian. “It’s regrettable. That’s not in the spirit [of Paris]. In many ways, the UK was a real leader [on climate change] and hopefully the UK will become again a real leader. But it’s not at the moment.” The criticism comes as Theresa May’s government has come under fire at home and abroad for its leadership on climate change after it abolished the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Senior figures such as the outgoing UN climate change chief have urged the UK not to abandon its climate commitments as it leaves the EU. “Let us remember that the Brexit vote was not about climate change,” said Christiana Figueres. Natalie Bennett, the leader of the Green party, said: “This damning indictment of the UK’s energy policy comes just days after our new prime minister scrapped the Department of Energy and Climate Change and appointed an environment secretary who has consistently voted against measures to tackle climate change. “I urge Theresa May to listen carefully to Robinson’s remarks and start reversing the damaging policies put in place by her predecessor – like giving tax breaks to fossil fuel companies while cutting subsidies for renewables.” Robinson said that while Germany had made some positive steps such as aiding developing countries on climate change, it was sending mixed messages. “Germany says its on track to end coal subsidies by 2018 but the German government is also introducing new mechanisms that provide payment to power companies for their ability to provide a constant supply of electricity, even if they are polluting forms, such as diesel and coal,” she said. She called on Germany to make a real commitment to get out of coal. But she said her criticism was far from limited to the two countries. “We want all countries to end [fossil fuel] subsidies,” she said. Robinson’s intervention comes as a group of international statesmen and women including her, Kofi Annan and Desmond Tutu, known as the Elders, released a statement saying they had “major concerns” about action by leaders since the Paris agreement last December. Presidents and prime ministers across the world are making investment decisions that run contrary the Paris deal, they warned. “Some countries are even increasing subsidies to fossil fuel production. This is simply not good enough. While all countries need to act, the industrialised and wealthy countries must lead by example.” A G7 pledge in May to phase out “inefficient” fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 was “too vague” a commitment and the summit in Japan failed to take action to end subsidies, the group said. They also said that governments needed to adopt carbon pricing. Ernesto Zedillo, one of the group and a former president of Mexico, said: “Governments and businesses may pay lip service to the transition to carbon neutrality but they need an economic imperative to ditch old models and move to environmentally sustainable investments: pricing carbon provides such an incentive.” Furthermore, the Elders said they were concerned that the world’s top 10 biggest greenhouse gas emitters had not yet ratified the Paris deal. The US and China have both pledged to ratify the deal this year, which only comes into force once at least 55 countries representing at least 55% of global emissions have ratified. The likely US Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has said he would try to unpick the deal, but Robinson said if it was ratified by the US this year “unwinding it would be very prolonged and difficult. I sincerely hope we won’t be facing that problem.” However Hillary Clinton would be good on climate because she had been pushed by Bernie Sanders to adopt an ambitious climate change platform, she said. Robinson said she been to Ethiopia recently and seen firsthand the way manmade climate change was exacerbating natural climate phenomenons such as El Niño, which brings drought to some parts of the world, and flooding to others. “I saw so many malnourished children, and it’s not tolerable.” A government spokesperson said: “We will need oil and gas for some decades to come, as part of a broader energy mix which also includes nuclear and renewables. We are phasing out the dirtiest form of electricity generation, coal, and encouraging investment in low carbon supply instead, so we can deliver secure and affordable energy across the country.”"
"The world’s largest oil, coal, cement and mining companies have been given 45 days to respond to a complaint that their greenhouse gas emissions have violated the human rights of millions of people living in the Phillippines. In a potential landmark legal case, the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines (CHR), a constitutional body with the power to investigate human rights violations, has sent 47 “carbon majors” including Shell, BP, Chevron, BHP Billiton and Anglo American, a 60-page document accusing them of breaching people’s fundamental rights to “life, food, water, sanitation, adequate housing, and to self determination”.  The move is the first step in what is expected to be an official investigation of the companies by the CHR, and the first of its kind in the world to be launched by a government body.  The complaint argues that the 47 companies should be held accountable for the effects of their greenhouse gas emissions in the Philippines and demands that they explain how human rights violations resulting from climate change will be “eliminated, remedied and prevented”.  It calls for an official investigation into the human rights implications of climate change and ocean acidification and whether the investor-owned “carbon majors” are in breach of their responsibilities. The Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,000 islands, is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change. Four of its most devastating super-cyclones have occurred in the last decade, and the country has recorded increasingly severe floods and heatwaves that have been linked to man-made global warming.  Typhoon Haiyan, known locally as Yolanda, was one of the most powerful storms ever recorded, killing more than 6,000 people and displacing 650,000 others in 2013. The legal complaint has been brought by typhoon survivors and non-governmental organisations and is supported by more than 31,000 Filipinos. “We demand justice. Climate change has taken our homes and our loved ones. These powerful corporations must be called to account for the impact of their business activities,” said Elma Reyes from Alabat Island in Quezon, who survived super typhoon Rammasun in 2008 and is part of the group submitting the complaint to the CHR. The full legal investigation is now expected to start in October after the 47 companies have responded. Although all 47 will be ordered to attend public hearings, the CHR can only force those 10 with offices in the Philippines to appear.   These include Chevron, ExxonMobil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, BHP Billiton, Anglo American, Lafarge, Holcim, and Taiheiyo Cement Corporation. The CHR has the power to seek the assistance of the UN to encourage any which do not attend to co-operate. “The commission’s actions are unprecedented. For the first time, a national human rights body is officially taking steps to address the impacts of climate change on human rights and the responsibility of private actors,” said Zelda Soriano, legal and political adviser for Greenpeace Southeast Asia, one of the groups which has brought the complaint to the CHR.  “This is an important building block in establishing the moral and legal ‘precedent’ that big polluters can be held responsible for current and threatened human rights infringements resulting from fossil fuel products. From the Netherlands to the US, people are using legal systems to hold their governments to account and demand climate action,” she said. The list of the 47 “carbon majors” being asked to respond to the CHR is based on research by Richard Heede, director of the Climate Accountability Institute in Colorado. In 2013 he calculated that just 90 global companies had produced nearly two-thirds of the greenhouse gas emissions generated since the start of the industrial revolution. Together these companies emitted around 315 gigatons of CO2 equivalent into the atmosphere, or nearly 22% of estimated global industry greenhouse gas emissions from 2010 to 2013, said Heede. “We pray that the CHR heed the demand to recommend to policymakers and legislators to develop and adopt effective accountability mechanisms that victims of climate change can easily access,” said Father Edwin Gariguez, executive secretary of Caritas Philippines and a recipient of the Goldman environmental prize.  The CHR is not a court and would have no power to force companies to reduce emissions or fine them. However, it can make recommendations to government and would add to the worldwide pressure to persuade shareholders to divest from heavy carbon emitters. The investigation is the latest in a growing tide of climate liability cases being brought against governments and corporations. In June, the Netherlands’ high court ruled on the world’s first climate liability suit, ordering the Dutch government to take stronger action against climate change to better protect its citizens.  However, several court cases launched in the US urging the US government to take more action against climate change have been dismissed. "
"Though it does not actually say so, the report of the Committee on Climate Change (Report, 12 July) is a salutary reminder that a capitalist economy based on infinite economic growth, as expressed in terms of consumption-led GDP, is unsustainable and, if allowed to continue in its present form, will ultimately devastate the entire planet. Moreover, unless we cease using fossil fuels for energy and replace them with renewables at the earliest possible opportunity, the voluntary agreement reached at last year’s COP 21 climate summit to limit increases in global temperatures to less than 2C will be little more than hot air. For an energy union like the GMB with thousands of members in the gas industry, the priority must be to establish a viable, UK-based, publicly owned renewable energy industry, thus enabling a just transition for those whose jobs will cease to exist in the coming decades. For this to happen, the vested interests of the privately owned energy monopolies have to be challenged, a point eloquently made by climate activist Naomi Klein at a packed meeting during COP 21 in Paris, organised by the Trade Unions for Energy Democracy network, which GMB supports.  Sharing the platform was Jeremy Corbyn, the only senior British politician who understood that the issue of climate change and global warming demanded his presence at the event. Whatever his detractors in the parliamentary Labour party may say about him, he realises that this global emergency transcends party politics and ideological divisions. They would do well to follow his example and stop playing the busted fiddle of capitalism while home burns.Bert SchouwenburgInternational officer, GMB • The Committee on Climate Change gives the government a warning that global warming could reduce the UK agricultural industry’s ability to maintain its present levels of food production. One of the reasons why the common agricultural policy was created after the last war, was because far-sighted European politicians were desperately worried about European starvation at that time. Their aim of European food self-sufficiency has been achieved. Meanwhile, despite the UK’s high levels of agricultural production, we still have to import 40% of our food. But there has been no need to worry as we are part of an organisation that can easily feed itself. If we had been told about these worries of declining UK food production, caused by climate change, during the Brexit referendum, who in their right mind would have voted to leave?David LucasBath • Observations of accelerated decline in Arctic sea ice suggest that within a few years the Arctic Ocean could be virtually free of sea ice at the end of each summer (Arctic sea ice crashes to record low for June, 7 July). This “blue ocean” condition signifies a huge loss in sunlight reflection and cooling capability which has hitherto kept both the Greenland ice sheet and permafrost areas frozen and stabilised climate in the northern hemisphere. Melting of the ice sheet threatens metres of sea level rise; melting of permafrost threatens vast emissions of greenhouse gases. Climate chaos threatens multiple crop failures in the breadbasket areas where the bulk of crops are grown to feed the world. Famine would exacerbate conflict, already apparent in the Middle East and North Africa, with millions of victims attempting migration to avoid starvation or being killed. The government claims that blue ocean conditions in the Arctic could occur, at earliest, by 2050. But the climate models which they persist in using have an abysmal track record, consistently predicting a retreat of sea ice many times slower than actually observed. Thus the government has engendered a false sense of security. The danger from blue ocean conditions is not appreciated. No precautions have been taken. And the possibility of preventing the ocean getting into such a state has been summarily dismissed with the comment “intervention would be premature”. Yet if governments collaborated and intervened quickly to cool the Arctic, a huge threat to humanity could be avoided.John NissenChair of the Arctic Methane Emergency Group  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"
"For those of us who are concerned about global warming, two of the most critical questions we ask are, “how fast is the Earth warming?” and “how much will it warm in the future?”.  The first question can be answered in a number of ways. For instance, we can actually measure the rate of energy increase in the Earth’s system (primarily through measuring changing ocean temperatures). Alternatively, we can measure changes in the net inflow of heat at the top of the atmosphere using satellites. We can also measure the rate of sea-level rise to get an estimate of the warming rate.   Since much of sea-level rise is caused by thermal expansion of water, knowledge of the water-level rise allows us to deduce the warming rate. We can also use climate models (which are sophisticated computer calculations of the Earth’s climate) or our knowledge from Earth’s past (paleoclimatology).  Many studies use combinations of these study methods to attain estimates and typically the estimates are that the planet is warming at a rate of perhaps 0.5 to 1 Watt per square meter of Earth’s surface area. However, there is some discrepancy among the actual numbers.  So assuming we know how much heat is being accumulated by the Earth, how can we predict what the future climate will be? The main tool for this is climate models (although there are other independent ways we can study the future). With climate models, we can play “what-if scenarios” and input either current conditions or hypothetical conditions and watch the Earth’s climate evolve within the simulation. Two incorrect but nevertheless consistent denial arguments are that the Earth isn’t warming and that climate models are inaccurate. A new study, published by Kevin Trenberth, Lijing Cheng, and others (I was also an author) answers these questions.  The study was just published in the journal Ocean Sciences; a draft of it is available here. In this study, we did a few new things. First, we presented a new estimate of ocean heating throughout its full depth (most studies only consider the top portion of the ocean). Second, we used a new technique to learn about ocean temperature changes in areas where there are very few measurements. Finally, we used a large group of computer models to predict warming rates, and we found excellent agreement between the predictions and the measurements. According to the measurements, the Earth has gained 0.46 Watts per square meter between 1970 and 2005. Since, 1992 the rate is higher (0.75 Watts per square meter) and therefore shows an acceleration of the warming. To put this in perspective, this is the equivalent of 5,400,000,000,000 (or 5,400 billion) 60-watt light bulbs running continuously day and night. In my view, these numbers are the most accurate measurements of the rate at which the Earth is warming. What about the next question – how did the models do? Amazingly well. From 1970 through 2005, the models on average showed a warming of 0.41 Watts per square meter and from 1992-2005 the models gave 0.77 Watts per meter squared. This means that since 1992, the models have been within 3 % of the measurements. In my mind, this agreement is the strongest vindication of the models ever found, and in fact, in our study we suggest that matches between climate models and ocean warming should be a major test of the models. Despite these excellent results, scientists want to do better. During a conversation with Dr. Trenberth, he told me: Progress is being made on understanding the energy flows through the climate system as datasets are improved and methods of analyzing the data are being revised and rigorously tested. We can never go back and make observations that were missed, but we can still improve knowledge of how the climate has evolved, even in recent (post-2005) data-rich (Argo) times. My other colleague, Dr. Lijing Cheng says: Ocean heat content is a vital climate indicator and is a key metric for global warming. How well ocean heating can be assessed by observations and can be simulated by climate models are a cornerstone of climate studies. By collecting the state-of-the-art observational ocean warming estimates and climate model results, this study gives the current status of our warming world and its future heating. We will continue to work hard to improve both measurements and models to better understand the climate change. Readers should also know that our study isn’t the only one of its kind to make these findings. A paper published before ours by a world-class group of scientists came to similar conclusions. So too does another study found here. When multiple and independent studies come to similar conclusions, it suggests that the conclusions are robust. Our current warming and future predictions are so very important to understanding this very important topic. Fortunately, this new study advances our knowledge in these areas."

"Earlier this year media outlets around the world announced that February had broken global temperature records by a shocking amount. March broke all the records too. In June, our screens were covered with surreal images of flooding in Paris, the Seine bursting its banks and flowing into the streets. In London, floods sent water pouring into the tube system right in the heart of Covent Garden. Roads in south-east London became rivers two metres deep. With such extreme events becoming more commonplace, few deny climate change any longer. Finally, a consensus is crystallising around one all-important fact: fossil fuels are killing us. We need to switch to clean energy, and fast.  This growing awareness about the dangers of fossil fuels represents a crucial shift in our consciousness. But I can’t help but fear we’ve missed the point. As important as clean energy might be, the science is clear: it won’t save us from climate change. Let’s imagine, just for argument’s sake, that we are able to get off fossil fuels and switch to 100% clean energy. There is no question this would be a vital step in the right direction, but even this best-case scenario wouldn’t be enough to avert climate catastrophe. Why? Because the burning of fossil fuels only accounts for about 70% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The remaining 30% comes from a number of causes. Deforestation is a big one. So is industrial agriculture, which degrades the soils to the point where they leach CO2. Then there’s industrial livestock farming which produces 90m tonnes of methane per year and most of the world’s anthropogenic nitrous oxide. Both of these gases are vastly more potent than CO2 when it comes to global warming. Livestock farming alone contributes more to global warming than all the cars, trains, planes and ships in the world. Industrial production of cement, steel, and plastic forms another major source of greenhouse gases, and then there are our landfills, which pump out huge amounts of methane – 16% of the world’s total.  When it comes to climate change, the problem is not just the type of energy we are using, it’s what we’re doing with it. What would we do with 100% clean energy? Exactly what we are doing with fossil fuels: raze more forests, build more meat farms, expand industrial agriculture, produce more cement, and fill more landfill sites, all of which will pump deadly amounts of greenhouse gas into the air. We will do these things because our economic system demands endless compound growth, and for some reason we have not thought to question this. Think of it this way. That 30% chunk of greenhouse gases that comes from non-fossil fuel sources isn’t static. It is adding more to the atmosphere each year. Scientists project that our tropical forests will be completely destroyed by 2050, releasing a 200bn tonne carbon bomb into the air. The world’s topsoils could be depleted within just 60 years, releasing more still. Emissions from the cement industry are growing at more than 9% per year. And our landfills are multiplying at an eye-watering pace: by 2100 we will be producing 11m tonnes of solid waste per day, three times more than we do now. Switching to clean energy will do nothing to slow this down. The climate movement made an enormous mistake. We focused all our attention on fossil fuels, when we should have been pointing to something much deeper: the basic logic of our economic operating system. After all, we’re only using fossil fuels in the first place to fuel the broader imperative of GDP growth. The root problem is the fact that our economic system demands ever-increasing levels of extraction, production and consumption. Our politicians tell us that we need to keep the global economy growing at more than 3% each year – the minimum necessary for large firms to make aggregate profits. That means every 20 years we need to double the size of the global economy – double the cars, double the fishing, double the mining, double the McFlurries and double the iPads. And then double them again over the next 20 years from their already doubled state.  Our more optimistic pundits claim that technological innovations will help us to de-couple economic growth from material throughput. But sadly there is no evidence that this is happening. Global material extraction and consumption has grown by 94% since 1980, and is still going up. Current projections show that by 2040 we will more than double the world’s shipping miles, air miles, and trucking miles – along with all the material stuff that those vehicles transport – almost exactly in keeping with the rate of GDP growth. Clean energy, important as it is, won’t save us from this nightmare. But rethinking our economic system might. GDP growth has been sold to us as the only way to create a better world. But we now have robust evidence that it doesn’t make us any happier, it doesn’t reduce poverty, and its “externalities” produce all sorts of social ills: debt, overwork, inequality, and climate change. We need to abandon GDP growth as our primary measure of progress, and we need to do this immediately – as part and parcel of the climate agreement that will be ratified in Morocco later this year.  It’s time to pour our creative power into imagining a new global economy – one that maximises human wellbeing while actively shrinking our ecological footprint. This is not an impossible task. A number of countries have already managed to achieve high levels of human development with very low levels of consumption. In fact Daniel O’Neill, an economist at the University of Leeds, has demonstrated that even material de-growth is not incompatible with high levels of human well-being. Our focus on fossil fuels has lulled us into thinking we can continue with the status quo so long as we switch to clean energy, but this is a dangerously simplistic assumption. If we want to stave off the coming crisis, we need to confront its underlying cause.  Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians. Follow @GuardianGDP on Twitter."
"The abolition of the Department of Energy and Climate Change has been condemned by former ministers as a major setback to British efforts to combat global warming. Decc was closed in a series of sweeping changes to the government unveiled by the new prime minister, Theresa May, on Thursday. Its functions, which include representing the UK at international climate talks, responsibility for meeting carbon targets and levying subsidies for green energy, have been transferred to a beefed-up business department led by Greg Clark. But Ed Davey, who served as Liberal Democrat secretary of state at Decc between 2012 and 2015, criticised the decision. “This is a major setback for the UK’s climate change efforts. Greg Clark may be nice and he may even be green, but by downgrading the Whitehall status of climate change, Theresa May has hit low carbon investor confidence yet again,” he told the Guardian. His view was echoed by Ed Miliband, the department’s first secretary of state when it was created in 2008 by Labour, who tweeted that the move was: “Plain stupid. Climate not even mentioned in new dept title. Matters because depts shape priorities, shape outcomes.” Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat head of Decc between 2010 and 2012, said: “It is a big problem to have only one department charged with any environmental objectives – Defra. At a stroke, the number of cabinet voices with a departmental remit for the environment and climate change has been halved.  “It is a serious downgrading of British capability in the area, and it sadly fits with a shift to the right in government where Euroscepticism often goes hand in hand with climate scepticism.” A group of international statesmen and women including Kofi Annan, Mary Robinson and Desmond Tutu issued a statement saying they regretted the decision and it failed to encourage leadership on climate change. Many environmental groups strongly criticised the decision as downgrading action on climate only months after more than 170 countries signed the Paris climate deal in New York. The UK is under pressure to ratify the agreement, both as part of the EU and domestically. “This is shocking news. Less than a day into the job and it appears that the new prime minister has already downgraded action to tackle climate change, one of the biggest threats we face,” said Craig Bennett, the CEO of Friends of the Earth. ClientEarth, a group of environment lawyers who won a court battle against the government last year on air pollution, said the closure sent the wrong signals to the world. “At a time when the challenge of climate change becomes ever more pressing, the government has scrapped the department devoted to tackling it. This is a statement of disregard for one of the most challenging economic, social and environmental issues humans have ever faced,” said its chief executive, James Thornton. “It sends a terrible signal at the worst possible time, undermining efforts to secure a clean, safe energy future.” Angus MacNeil, the SNP MP and chair of the energy and climate change committee, said he was astonished by the abolition of Decc, as it came after government policy changes had already created uncertainty for investors. Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP, said: “Scrapping Decc sends a terrible signal to the world. [It is] yet another concession to Tory Brexiteers and a blow to moderate, outward-looking Britain.” The Green party said the axing of Decc was deeply worrying and long-time energy policy observers said it was a sign that energy and climate were slipping down the agenda, and that merging them with other departments before had failed to produce clear policy.  The New Economics Foundation thinktank said: “This reshuffle risks dropping climate change from the policy agenda altogether.” John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace, said: “Although, some might say ‘what’s in a name’, there is a very real worry that the progress made on tackling climate change could be relegated to the bottom of the intray.” Staff said they expected to be moved out of the current Decc building as they are folded into the expanded Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Clark shadowed Miliband at Decc during 2008-10 and is seen as a green-minded Tory, although he has his environmental critics because he pushed through controversial planning reforms during the coalition. In a statement, he appeared to move to allay concerns that climate action would be downgraded.  “I am thrilled to have been appointed to lead this new department delivering a comprehensive industrial strategy, leading government’s relationship with business, furthering our world-class science base, delivering affordable, clean energy and tackling climate change,” he said. Some green groups and experts were sanguine or positive about the folding of Decc into the business department. Lord Stern, a leading climate economist, said he was content with the change, and WWF said the department could be a “real powerhouse for change” if climate change “was hardwired” into it.  “Rather than bemoaning the demise of Decc, we should embrace the creation of BEIS,” argued the Policy Exchange thinktank. “Decc has always been regarded as something of a minnow in departmental terms. By merging with BIS, energy and climate change issues can be elevated to a much higher level politically.” Lord Deben, the chair of the government’s climate advisers, said: “what is done matters, not titles.... I’ll judge by actions.” Greg Barker, former climate minister and climate advisor to David Cameron, said the move made “huge sense”."
"Climate-related disasters increase the risk of armed conflicts, according to research that shows a quarter of the violent struggles in ethnically divided countries were preceded by extreme weather. The role of severe heatwaves, floods and storms in increasing the risk of wars has been controversial, particularly in relation to the long drought in Syria. But the new work reveals a strong link in places where the population is already fractured along ethnic lines.  Previous work has shown a correlation between climate disasters and fighting but the new analysis shows the disasters precede the conflict, suggesting a causal link. Experts have warned that an increase in natural disasters due to global warming is a “threat multiplier” for armed violence. The scientists behind the new research say it could be used to predict where future violence might flare, allowing preventative measures to be taken. “Armed conflicts are among the biggest threats to people, killing some and forcing others to leave their home and maybe flee to faraway countries,” said Prof John Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and one of the research team. The combination of climate disasters and ethnic tensions make an “explosive mixture,” he said. “People have speculated about climate links with conflict: some people say yes, some say no. But we find a really robust link,” Schellnhuber said.  “Economic and social disruption caused by climate disasters are in general not significantly linked to the outbreak of armed conflict, except in one class of countries or regions: where you have pre-fracturing by ethnic difference. The analysis also shows clearly the shock precedes the conflict era and so this is the first step to unravel the causal tangle involved in this environment-conflict relationship.” The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that 23% of the armed conflicts in ethnically divided places were linked to climate disasters, compared to just 9% of all armed conflicts. Schellnhuber speculated that ethnic divisions might mean that the impact of a climate disaster would disproportionately impact one group more than another, due to their location or poverty level. “People immediately start scapegoating then,” he said. The research team concluded: “This has important implications for future security policies as several of the world’s most conflict-prone regions, including north and central Africa as well as central Asia, are both exceptionally vulnerable to [manmade] climate change and characterised by deep ethnic divides.  “Recent analyses of the societal consequences of droughts in Syria and Somalia indicate that such climatological events may have already contributed to armed conflict outbreaks or sustained the conflicts in both countries.” Schellnhuber said the climate-conflict link will be even more important in the future: “In 50 years from now, under a business-as-usual scenario, 80-90% of disasters will be driven by climate change. Then the whole thing really explodes.” He said cross-referencing predictions of where extreme weather is likely to increase with places that are ethnically divided could provide a way to see trouble ahead. “You could construct a conflict ‘radar’ system to anticipate hotspots where the probability of armed conflict is high. Then you could try to diffuse certain things, or say, given the current migration debate, see where the potential sources of emigration are.”  Prof Solomon Hsiang, at the University of California Berkeley and not part of the new research, showed in 2011 that changes to the climate were linked to 20% of civil wars since 1950. He said: “The linkage between large-scale climatic changes and violence is a remarkable finding of the last several years and has major implications for societies around the world, both today and in the future.” “Recent studies have demonstrated that these patterns hold around the world, throughout human history, and at all scales of social organisation: from violence within families all the way up to full scale civil war,” Hsiang said. “This new study corroborates these earlier results, demonstrating that they can be recovered using an alternative statistical approach. It is important that these types of findings are replicated and demonstrated to be robust by numerous research teams since the consequences for society are so critical.” Previous work has focused on linking conflicts with meteorological data, such as temperature and rainfall. The new analysis, however, used the economic impact of climate disasters, which takes into account the vulnerability of the nation affected. “Both Syria and California have now experienced the biggest drought on record, but there is no civil war in California,” said Schellnhuber. He said the new work showed another, very significant, benefit of action to halt global warming: “Our study adds evidence of a very special co-benefit of climate stabilisation: peace.”"

"A controversial rightwing American lobbying group that denies climate change science and promotes gun ownership paid for the Tory prime ministerial hopeful Andrea Leadsom to fly to the United States to attend its conferences. The American Legislative Exchange Council – Alec – is a neoconservative organisation with close links to members of the Tea Party movement. Championed by supporters of the free market, it has been attacked by critics for exerting a “powerful and undemocratic” influence on US politics.  It is part funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, David and Charles, whose empire spans mining, chemicals and finance. Leadsom’s links to the council will be scrutinised closely by those trying to gauge her political leanings. In the US the council produces hundreds of putative bills that it seeks to have made into law by US legislators who attend its conferences, where they are treated to generous corporate hospitality at lavish cigar parties. Alec has built a web of relationships with politicians around the world. In the UK these include the Ukip MEP Roger Helmer and the Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan, who played a large part in the Vote Leave campaign.  The council, which promotes privatisation and seeks to curtail union power, is fiercely opposed to the European Union and regularly meets European politicians who seek to check the power of the union, fearing its ideas could spread across the Atlantic. Alec’s national chairman, Earl Ehrhart, warned in 2005 that “the threats posed by the European constitution can easily be transported over here – the threats to free trade, free markets and individual liberty”. Such measures, Alec claims, would hurt American business and stifle job creation. But its critics disagree. “Alec has clearly set its sights on promoting its agenda in Europe and in particular it has targeted politicians from the UK,” said Nick Surgey, director of research at the Center for Media and Democracy in the US. “Austerity under the Alec vision for the world is far more extreme than anything that the UK has seen under Cameron.” Filings with the Electoral Commission show that in 2008, two years before she became an MP, Leadsom attended “exchange meetings” with Alec in Washington and Chicago. Alec picked up the £1,800 bill. Mark Pocan, a US legislator who attended the 2008 conference, recounted how guests were told that global warming was “a huge, huge myth”. “At least two workshops addressed this issue,” he wrote in an account of his experiences, “one titled Taking the Politics Out of Science, and the other about New Energy Technologies in a Carbon Constrained World.” The first workshop tried to point out inaccuracies about global warming and other “junk” science. The second was designed to talk up “clean coal” options and to make the point that CO2 emissions are “not all bad”. Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth US, said: “Alec has been behind some of the most anti-environmental climate regulation attacks in the US for quite some time.  “They’ve tried to pass anti-science legislation at the state level which would ban officials from talking and addressing climate change, they’ve attacked renewable energy standards to promote wind and solar energy efficiency, and they have worked to increase and prevent any kind of regulatory action against the oil and gas industry.” In the year that Leadsom attended the council’s conference it was promoting a notorious bill across US states. The “Stand Your Ground” law, backed by the National Rifle Association, which gave gun owners new rights to protect and defend themselves, was heavily criticised following the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager in Florida. Alec’s support for the law ultimately led to the departure from the council of high-profile corporate members such as Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Bank of America and General Motors. Of its former relationship with Alec, the Google chairman, Eric Schmidt, has declared: “I think the consensus within the company was that that was some sort of mistake.” Transparency campaigners called on Leadsom to distance herself from the council. “It’s a powerful and profoundly undemocratic force in US politics,” said Tamasin Cave, of Spinwatch. “Why did Leadsom get involved with this lot? Who invited her, and why?” A spokesman for Leadsom declined to comment."
"Once again, it is fire season in the western United States.  This month, the extreme fire that seems to test the bounds of our recent, place-based memory of how fires behave is the Sand Fire burning north of Los Angeles.   Last year, there was the Butte fire in northern California and the Okanogan complex in Washington. In 2014 and 2013, the King and Rim fires in Sierra Nevada forests. The Black Forest fire in 2013 in Colorado. In 2012, the High Park and Waldo Canyon fires among others in Colorado, the Long Draw and Miller Homestead fires in Oregon and the Whitewater-Baldy complex in New Mexico. In 2011, the Wallow and Horseshoe fires in Arizona and the Los Conchas in New Mexico. The list goes on. The question naturally arises: are these fires affected by climate change? And the answer is simple: yes. Of course. A warming climate affects fire. Sure, there are other factors at play: invasive, fire-prone grasses are flourishing. Fire suppression led to more acres ready to ignite. But these factors compound or respond to the effect of climate on fire – they don’t explain it away. The statistics are dire. In western US federally managed forests (which is most of them), the number of large forest fires has increased over 500%, the burned area over 1,000%, since the 1970s and early 1980s. In some areas, the increase is much larger: area burned in northern US Rockies forests has increased 3,000%. In Pacific north-west forests, 5,000%. Grass and shrub-land fires across the region show lesser but still significant increases in burned area as well.  It’s not as though climate change is creating conditions where all nature does is burn. We will continue to have droughts and wet periods, as we have had in the past.  But increasing temperatures will have measurable impacts. With warmer temperatures, evaporation increases. The atmosphere draws more moisture from soils, and from the live and dead vegetation that, drier than it used to be, helps fuel fires.  For decades now, through wet years and dry, more moisture has been evaporating from our forests, grasslands and shrub-lands than would have been the case without a warming climate. Less water is retained in wet years, and our droughts, like the current one, are made more extreme. The result is a drier, more flammable landscape, with larger and more extreme fires as the legacy fuels from a cooler, wetter era are consumed alongside the newer sources.  This process will continue with the accelerating changes we have already committed to by failing to address climate change as an emergency requiring immediate, sustained action. While fire – at its pre-climate change pace and tempo – is itself a natural process that our ecosystems adapted to, the changes in scale, timing, frequency and intensity we are seeing in the western US are not natural.  A changing climate is transforming our landscape, and fire is one of the tools it uses. Expect to see more of it, in more places, as temperatures rise."

"When I give a presentation and mention the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming, I’m often asked, “what’s the deal with the other 3%?”. These are the publishing climate scientists who argue that something other than humans is responsible for the majority of global warming, although their explanations are often contradictory and don’t withstand scientific scrutiny. A few months ago, the world’s largest private sector coal company went to court, made its best scientific case against the 97% expert consensus, and lost. One of coal’s expert witnesses was University of Alabama at Huntsville climate scientist Roy Spencer - a controversial figure who once compared those with whom he disagreed to Nazis, and has expressed his love for Fox News.  Last week, Spencer wrote a white paper for the Texas Public Policy Institute (TPPI) outlining the contrarian case against climate concerns. TPPI is part of the web of denial, having received substantial funding from both the tobacco and fossil fuel industries, including $65,000 from ExxonMobil and at least $911,499 from Koch-related foundations since 1998, and over $3 million from “dark money” anonymizers Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund. Spencer’s arguments should of course be evaluated on their own merits, regardless of who commissioned them. However, it turns out that they have little merit on which to stand. The white paper is a classic example of a Gish Gallop – producing such a large volume of nonsense arguments that refuting all of them is too time-consuming. NASA Goddard director Gavin Schmidt rightly described Spencer’s paper as: A great example of how making nonsense arguments undermines his whole point. Sad! https://t.co/kqY1czsH3S Most of Spencer’s white paper consists of repeating a variety of long-debunked myths. It’s laid out in the form of 13 basic climate questions that Spencer tries to answer. Fortunately, SkepticalScience.com has a database of over 200 climate myths, and summaries of what the peer-reviewed scientific research says about each. This makes it possible to handle Spencer’s 13-point Gish Gallop by simply referring to the relevant myth rebuttals. So here we go: 1) ‘Carbon dioxide is a trace gas’ is rebutted as Myth #127. 2) ‘Climate has changed before’ is addressed in Myth #2, and climate scientist Michael Mann recently rebutted the myth that climate researchers ignore natural factors. Spencer’s misleading claims about temperatures of the past 2,000 years based on a paper by Henrik Ljungqvist are refuted in Myth #168. Claims of hotter periods during that time than today are tackled in Myth #56, and implications that the planet is magically warming because it used to be colder during the Little Ice Age in Myth #32. Finally, the rebuttal to Myth #136 explains why we can’t just blame global warming on natural cycles. 3) The reliability of global temperature measurements is explained in Myth #6. 4) Models used by the IPCC have accurately predicted global warming, as explained in the rebuttals to and Myth #229, as well as an important paper published last year. 5) The net negative consequences of rapid global warming are outlined in the rebuttal to Myth #12. 6) The warming over the past 18 years is discussed in the rebuttal to Myth #7, and is clear from the record hot temperatures of the past 3 years. 7) The accuracy of climate models is covered under Myth #5 and in my book. 8) The sensitivity of the climate to the increasing greenhouse effect is addressed in Myth #30, and the role of clouds in Myth #143. 9) False claims about the 97% expert climate consensus are in Myth #3 and Myth #226. 10) Claims of ‘slow’ ocean warming are refuted by the fact that it’s accumulating heat at a rate equivalent to 4 atomic bomb detonations per second, consistent with climate model predictions. 11) Spencer downplays the importance of our repeated breaking of temperature records, but we wouldn’t be breaking them without global warming. 12) On climate change causing extreme weather (Myth #41), Spencer suggests that we shouldn’t worry about stronger hurricanes (Myth #16), denies the record intensity of California’s current drought, and cherry picks sea ice (Myth #157) and snow cover data (Myth #159). 13) Spencer ends his paper with the claim that the 97% of climate research that’s consistent with the expert consensus is all politically biased. This is ironic given that Spencer has previously said: I view my job a little like a legislator, supported by the taxpayer, to protect the interests of the taxpayer and to minimize the role of government. All in all, Spencer managed to cram about 24 climate myths into a 13-point white paper. Most importantly, as Schmidt noted, the bulk of those myths served no purpose.  Just consider Spencer’s very first argument. No scientist should ever claim that carbon pollution is benign because it’s only present in the atmosphere in trace amounts. For example, arsenic can be deadly if present in trace amounts in water; Spencer probably wouldn’t drink from a water source with 400 ppm of arsenic. This is an easily-refuted, scientifically-useless argument whose sole purpose seems to be fooling non-experts. It’s the climate version of the Chewbacca defense. In the Peabody Energy case, the judge ruled that the preponderance of evidence did not support Spencer or his fellow coal expert witnesses. Without strong evidence supporting their arguments, climate contrarians often resort to Gish Gallops to win arguments. In fact, the RationalWiki page on Gish Gallops lists another climate contrarian, Christoper Monckton among the well-known “abusers of this technique,” alongside Donald Trump. In short, if there were a valid case against the urgent need for climate action, contrarians’ best experts wouldn’t have to scrape 24 long-debunked myths from the bottom of the oil barrel."

"Google says it has cut its vast data centres’ energy use by 15% by applying artificial intelligence to manage them more efficiently than humans. The servers that power billions of web searches, streamed films and social media accounts are estimated to account for approximately 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Google is believed to have one of the biggest fleets of them in the world.   On Wednesday, Google said it had proved it could cut total energy use at its data centres by 15% by deploying machine learning from DeepMind, the British AI company it bought in 2014 for about £400m. Such centres require significant energy for cooling, as well as constant adjustments to air temperature, pressure and humidity, to run as efficiently as possible. Mustafa Suleyman, DeepMind’s co-founder, said that the level of complexity and number of variables meant the job of managing data centres was one where an algorithm could outperform a human. He said: “It’s one of those perfect examples of a setting where humans have a really good intuition they’ve developed over time but the machine-learning algorithm has so much more data that describes real-world conditions [five years in this case]. “It’s much more than any human has ever been able to experience, and it’s able to learn from all sorts of niche little edge cases seen in the data that a human wouldn’t be able to identify. So it’s able to tune the settings much more subtly and much more accurately.” Suleyman said the reduction in energy use was achieved through a combination of DeepMind more accurately predicting the incoming computational load – ie when people were mostly likely to request data-hungry YouTube videos – and match that prediction very quickly to the cooling load required. “It’s about tweaking all of the knobs simultaneously,” he said. The environmental impact of the online world has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, as data centres’ share of global emissions has risen to be on a par with those from aviation. Google first disclosed its carbon footprint in 2011 – it was roughly equivalent to Laos’s annual emissions – and says that since then its data centres have improved so that they get 3.5 times the computing power for the same amount of energy. The trial using machine learning to further cut those data centres’ energy – and carbon emissions – began two years ago, and was tested on “more than 1%” of its servers, Suleyman said. It is now being used across a “double-digit percentage” of all Google’s data centres globally and will be applied across all of them by the end of the year. Google does not disclose exactly how much energy its data centres use, but says as a company it’s responsible for 0.01% of global electricity use, and much of that is data centres. DeepMind has cut Google’s energy use for cooling by 40%, and total energy use by 15%. “I really think this is just the beginning. There are lots more opportunities to find efficiencies in data centre infrastructure,” said Suleyman. “One of the most exciting things is the kind of algorithms we develop are inherently general … that means the same machine-learning system should be able to perform well in a wide variety of environments [such as power generation facilities and energy networks].” Google has data centres in North and South America, Europe and Asia. Sophia Flucker, a director of Operational Intelligence, a UK-based consultancy that helps data centres cut their energy use, said it was feasible that Google had achieved such a big reduction. “I’ve worked with some award-winning data centres, which still had plenty of room for improvement,” she said. "
"Antony Gormley says his first White Cube exhibition in four years, which opens in September, is driven by “more of a sense of urgency” than any other show he has done. From the warming of our climate and the acidification of our seas to cities dominated by skyscrapers – “nothing more than expressions of virile corporate power,” says Gormley – the artist’s despair at society’s failure to take action has filtered unavoidably into his latest work.  “We are living in a really strange time,” Gormley said. “Yet we are all sleepwalking through it. And it is urgent we wake up. We are sort of aware the centre cannot hold, that 250 years of industrial activity has undermined and fundamentally disturbed our world – yet we feel somehow not responsible.” Gormley, known best for his Angel of the North sculpture that stands outside Gateshead, will transform the White Cube in London into a labyrinth of 15 chambers containing a series of human figures, all of different materials, sizes and postures. At the heart of the show will be Sleeping Field, an installation of about 600 small, block-work cast-iron figures, all lying down. Collectively they will resemble a modern cityscape seen from the air. The exhibition is his first at White Cube Bermondsey since his 2012 staging of Model, which was formed of a single giant steel body people could walk or climb through. He describes his new show as “very much a sequel” to that exhibition. Sleeping Field is inspired by the corporate expansion Gormley has witnessed in London, the city he has lived and worked in for most of his life. More than half the world is living in serviced urban environments “of cappuccinos and smartphones”, said the artist, who is concerned about the impact this has on our collective imaginations. “It is absolutely extraordinary to see the transition happening to London,” Gormley said. “Up to this point the towers have been the exception, not the rule. But it is fascinating to see how London is being transformed overnight from a terraced housing-based city to Dallas or something closer to Abu Dhabi.” Gormley laments the unchanging priority of corporate values over social values as the skyline rises higher and higher. “I don’t see those towers expressing much more than the testosterone of a late capitalist society,” he added. The work’s title speaks to Gormley’s belief that we have all become “blind, sleeping servants” of a system that creates everything for us with ease and yet perpetuates social injustice and an unequal distribution of resources.  His hope is that Sleeping Field will force us all to take a necessary step back and realise “we are making the equivalent of a vast termites’ nest” and that “we are all participants in this process”.  The rest of the works in the show are as much about making the viewer aware of their own bodies as corporate greed. Visitors will encounter these figures as they move through the gallery’s labyrinth of fake walls or, in the case of Cave – a dark, 12-metre long, human shaped tunnel – physically enter the sculpture itself. “I want every room to be a catalyst for you to become very aware of your scale, your heart beating, your breathing pattern,” said Gormley. “I want to make it deeply unnerving, releasing us from our prejudices and our expectation about what a sculpture is and how it might act on us.” Many works are so large – one 13-tonne figure made from 22 blocks of concrete resembles “a rather relaxed Buddha” – they will have to be put in the gallery and the fake walls built up around them. “It’s just exploding in all different ways,” Gormley said from his studio. “Things are manic but incredibly good fun.”"
"Amid all the other news happening right now, you might have missed a vital story: the government has accepted the Climate Change Committee’s recommendation for the ‘fifth carbon budget’. This is the total amount of greenhouse gases which the UK economy will be allowed to emit in the 2028-30 period, which will now be cut by 57% on 1990 levels.  This would be important for the UK’s contribution to tackling climate change at any time. In the aftermath of the EU referendum campaign it takes on special significance, for it nails the myth that Brexit will tear up all of the UK’s environmental policies and commitments.  The environmental movement has been in visible despair since last week’s leave vote. That’s not surprising: most of the UK’s environmental laws and regulations spring from the EU, and environmentalists know that they would not have been nearly so strong if the UK parliament had acted on its own. Indeed, British governments have often tried to resist the EU’s push for stronger environmental protection. Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the Green Alliance were rightly vocal remain campaigners.  But now that the decision has been made, mimicking Fraser from Dad’s Army and crying that we’re all doomed is not what’s needed. On the contrary, it will merely encourage those who oppose environmental and climate policy to believe that they now have a new mandate to get rid of it.  It has not gone unnoticed that in the Venn diagram of the right there’s a lot of overlap between Brexiters, climate sceptics and anti-greens. Indeed, Nigel Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation has already claimed that following the referendum the UK should abandon its climate policies.  But the Brexit result provides absolutely no grounds for doing so, and the public and media should not be encouraged to believe that it does.  The UK’s climate change targets and policy derive, not from the EU, but from the 2008 Climate Change Act, passed by the sovereign UK Parliament with cross-party support. It is the act which requires the government to set legally-binding carbon budgets: indeed, the one just proposed is more ambitious than the targets set by the EU. Though the UK signed the Paris climate agreement as part of the EU, it has to be ratified in the UK parliament, so Brexit will not change our long-term decarbonisation goals.  It is true that on leaving the EU we will no longer be required to meet its renewable energy and energy efficiency targets. But we will still have to implement them, because they are part of our national climate and energy policies, aimed at meeting the three goals (decarbonisation, affordability and security of supply) set by the UK government, not the EU.  Investment in energy infrastructure will inevitably be subject to some general economic uncertainty, but the energy market is almost entirely domestic and not for export, so concerns over whether the UK will be in the EU single market do not apply. Many of these investments are now on hold – but that is nothing to do with Brexit and all to do with the lack of a long-term UK policy framework. Once the government announces a proper post-2020 support package, investment should begin flowing again. Outside the climate and energy field, leaving the EU does not guarantee the loss of EU environmental regulation. If Brexit takes the form of the ‘Norway option’, in which we remain part of the European Economic Area (EEA) in order to gain access to the single market, almost all EU environmental regulation will continue to apply. EU law is designed to prevent lax environmental standards undercutting competition in the single market, so it’s all part of the package. But even if we come out of the single market, key elements of EU environmental law will remain. Product regulations such as energy efficiency standards for white goods and emission limits for vehicles will not disappear, because most products sold in the UK will continue to be the same ones sold in the rest of Europe.  And other EU regulations will remain in place because they have been transposed into British statute. Air pollution limits fall into this category: outside the EU we will lose the vital enforcement regime provided by European law, but the regulations themselves will remain. Yes, a future government could weaken these limits. But politically it would surely be impossible to do so. With air pollution now estimated to lead to around 40,000 premature deaths in Britain every year, which politician is going to call for weakening the law?  And this, surely, is the point. Leaving the EU will unquestionably be bad for the environment, and is deeply to be regretted. In some fields, such as nature conservation (where the key directives do not apply to EEA members such as Norway), we should be particularly alarmed at the prospect of Brexit leading to the collapse of regulation. But the proper response to this is not to cry woe; it is to mobilise the public in support of environmental protection. This must now be the green movement’s overwhelming priority. In the climate and energy field, where policy is domestically driven, the task is particularly urgent. It is to get the government to diminish investment uncertainty through a series of key announcements. Energy secretary Amber Rudd made a good start yesterday, but there is more to do.  First, post-2020 support for low-carbon energy must be included in the autumn statement. Second, the government should announce that the UK, and UK firms, will continue to belong to the European emissions trading scheme under any Brexit scenario. Third, the government should confirm that a new comprehensive climate action plan will be published by the end of the year showing how the government intends to meet the fifth carbon budget, including core policies for renewable energy and energy efficiency. Fourth, it should announce its intention to pass a new Air Quality Act to replace the EU-based provisions of current air pollution regulations.  There are many rightful reasons for despair at the referendum result. But the imminent destruction of the UK’s environmental policy need not be one of them. The country is experiencing a political earthquake. But we can still ensure that it does not pull down every house."
"In a paper published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, scientists from the University of Michigan and the University of Florida show that there were big jumps in climate warming when the dinosaurs went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous. This brings the end-Cretaceous mass extinction in line with the other mass extinction events, which occurred at times of abrupt and sometimes extreme climate change (including the end-Permian, the end-Triassic, the Toarcian, and others). By employing a relatively new ancient-temperature-measuring technique called “carbonate clumped isotope paleothermometry,” scientists have uncovered an 8ºC jump in seawater temperatures that unfolded rapidly, at the same time as massive CO2 emissions from the Indian Deccan Traps eruptions (“rapidly” here means anything less than about 30,000 years, possibly centuries; such are the limits of time resolution). They also found a second, smaller spike in warming about 150,000 years later, at around the same time as the asteroid impact at Chicxulub in Mexico.  Each climate warming spike correlates with an episode of extinction identified in an earlier study led by Professor Tom Tobin of the University of Alabama. “Our findings support the ‘press-pulse’ extinction mechanism,” said Doctor Sierra Petersen, referring to the theory that long-term environmental stress made life on Earth vulnerable to the shock of the asteroid impact. “The volcanism caused significant climate change, and the environmental stress from this climate change likely led to enhanced overall extinction.” Petersen’s paper appears to contradict one published just a couple of weeks ago by James Witts of the University of Leeds and colleagues, who found there was one single, “sudden” (meaning within 30,000 to 70,000 years) extinction correlated with the asteroid impact, using fossils from the same place as Petersen gathered her specimens from – Seymour Island on the Antarctic Peninsula.  Petersen points out that Witts’ paper does show a small extinction episode correlating to the first temperature spike, whereas earlier studies found that the two extinction pulses were of roughly equal severity. Unfortunately, the Witts paper only came out after our paper was already in production, so we could not add this discussion into our paper. It’s curious that Petersen and her colleagues found a warming spike associated with the asteroid impact, when you might expect an asteroid impact to generate a cooling spike from the “impact winter” triggered by all the sulfur and dust kicked up into Earth’s atmosphere. Indeed, Doctor Johan Vellekoop of the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, and colleagues have just published a paper claiming to have found “evidence of impact-provoked, severe climatic cooling immediately following the K-Pg impact” in sediments offshore New Jersey. [Our] study does not have the resolution to observe the impact winter, which would only have lasted a few years at the most.  Such a transient cold snap would be hard-pressed to be recorded in ocean sediments at all, because of the huge thermal inertia of the world’s oceans, unless climate feedbacks amplified and sustained cooling for centuries. Very close to the [end-Cretaceous] boundary we have some samples that are quite warm, nearly reaching the peak temperatures from the first warming spike. Other samples are colder, but all are taken from within 1 meter of the boundary and we cannot resolve their relative timing. Clearly climate was highly variable around this time. Recent rock-dating work has suggested that the vast majority of the Indian lava (and by implication CO2 emissions) erupted as a consequence of the asteroid impact shaking up the magma plumbing beneath India. Petersen’s paper ties the first warming spike and extinction to the beginning of the Indian Deccan eruptions, with massive CO2 emissions concentrated in a timeframe of less than 200,000 years, before the asteroid impact.  The second warming spike, occurring around the time of the asteroid impact, was less pronounced because CO2 levels were already high (temperature rises scale with doubling of CO2 concentrations), and because the emissions were probably spread out over a longer timeframe. Around the time of the impact, volcanism was still ongoing and CO2 was continuing to be emitted, so that could have caused the warming we observe. As scientists tease apart the fine threads of the events in the final few millennia of the Cretaceous, they are working at the blurry limits of time resolution, even if their temperature measuring resolution has become sharper. But even if the detailed sequence still needs disentangling, it is clear that large and rapid swings in climate played an important role in this major mass extinction, as it did in the others. Howard Lee is a geologist and science writer who focuses on past climate changes."
"Every second, an amount of food equal to the weight of a sedan car is thrown away in the US – about 60m tons a year. It starts at the farm. The potato that grew to the size of a brick. The watermelon with the brown slasher marks on the rind. The cauliflower stained yellow in the sun. The peach that lost its blush before harvest. Any of those minor imperfections - none of which affect taste or quality or shelf life - can doom a crop right there. If the grower decides the supermarkets - or ultimately the consumer - will reject it, those fruits and vegetables never make it off the farm. Then there are the packing warehouses, where a specific count must be maintained for each plastic clamshell or box - and any strawberry or plum that does not make it is junked, if it can’t immediately be sold for juice or jam. Most of our food travels a long journey before it gets to our plate. From farm and pack house to wholesale distributor, cardboard cartons can take a tumble and dent, rendering the contents unsaleable. One traffic jam too many and pre-washed lettuce can wilt in the plastic bag. Last - and maybe the most wasteful of all - are the supermarkets, restaurants and all of us, the ordinary consumers who faced with expanding portion sizes inevitably leave behind meals when we eat out and somehow always manage to forget those pots of flavored yoghurt in the back of the fridge.  We trace the lifecycle of six popular foodstuffs from farm to fork to get to the root of why so much is wasted. The freshly washed and delicate golden ovoids jiggling along the conveyor belt were ejected from the potato field down the road that very morning, prime candidates to be roasted, boiled, mashed or julienned and tossed in a fryer. Then a worker reached out a gloved hand and rolled over a slightly knobby specimen, tossing it into the gutter running beside the belt: a potato that didn’t make the grade. And then another, about the size of a guinea pig, was rejected for being too big. Another was scarred, and still another was rejected for a slightly greenish cast. This is the top of the food chain for the US’s most popular vegetable. American farmers produce about 22m tons of potatoes a year. It is still the country’s leading vegetable crop, raised from Maine to Michigan to Idaho and California. Only a quarter are served in their natural form. A staggering one-third are turned into frozen french fries. But many never make it to consumers at all – appearances do matter, even when it comes to the humblest and most enduring of comfort foods. The UN estimates about 17% of food grown in North America is lost or wasted on the farm. But Wayde Kirschenman, whose family has been farming since the 1930s, puts the tally much higher. He estimates about a quarter of the potato crop, and sometimes as much as half, never makes it into the human food chain. Most of it is perfectly good food, he says. “Sometimes it can be worse,” Kirschenman says. “We throw away half of them, which is really sad. But I would say an average would be maybe 75% get packed, and 25% they just have defects, flaws.” The 5,000-acre farm and packing plant lie near Bakersfield, at the southern end of California’s San Joaquin valley.  It was started by Kirschenman’s grandfather. The family also grows grapes, watermelons, peaches and bell peppers. There is no logic to the waste, he says.  The cosmetic demands trouble him most. Potatoes may be rejected because they are bigger or smaller than expected once they are unearthed. Or because the potatoes – sold under the Sno-Wite brand name – have darkened slightly in the sun, which could affect shelf life. The potatoes are shipped as far as Boston and Montreal, and have a three-week shelf life.  It is hugely frustrating, Kirschenman says. It costs on average $10 (£7.70) to produce a 50lb box. Nearly $1 of that is water. After several years of drought, he does not like to think of water going to waste. Kirschenman would like to see slightly misshapen potatoes find a place on supermarket shelves but he cannot take a chance. If his potatoes are rejected by buyers, he gets stuck with the bill for shipping them across the country. “Someone may complain about that one because it has a bit of a funny shape,” he says, pointing at the conveyor. “Or too heavy scarring. You are allowed some defect, but they are not going to all look absolutely perfect and white.” He would like to donate the potatoes to a food bank, but that would involve paying for labour and packing on top of the lost sales. Instead, rejected potatoes are sold for cattle feed at about $25 a ton.. “It really is incredible,” Kirschenman says. “I don’t know if Americans are just too used to having everything look so perfect on the outside. If an orange has a defect on the outside of the skin, you are going to peel off the skin anyway.” On the first real scorcher of the California summer, Olivier Griss looked at about $3,000 worth of strawberries, stacked 5ft high in their plastic clamshell boxes, and steeled himself to tell the growers waiting for his verdict: “No.” The strawberries, delivered to Coke Farm minutes earlier by one of the farmers that produces under its label, were picked that morning but were already on the verge of decay. The top layer looked invitingly red and plump. But Griss cracked open a box towards the centre to find one or two berries were maroon and squishy to the touch. The growers badly mistimed the harvest. The berries should have been brought in a day earlier, or during the cool hours of morning.  “It occurs like clockwork on the first hot day of the season,” Griss said. The growers had bet against the full strength of the California sun. When it comes to strawberries, that is a risky proposition, even under optimum conditions. The UN estimates about 6% of food loss in North America occurs because of handling, post-harvest. But when it comes to perishable produce, strawberries are in a class by themselves. The fruit was chosen as the mascot for a new public education campaign against food waste aimed at consumers. But the potential for loss begins at the point of harvest, with the mechanics of getting strawberries to market. Even under ideal conditions, strawberries rarely last more than seven days after harvest – which does not allow much time to travel vast distances to market. While California is by far the biggest producer of strawberries, the major market is on the east coast. “Berries are a highly competitive commodity group and they just have to be great,” Griss said. Coke Farms, a mid-sized operation near San Juan Bautista, pioneered organic strawberry farming in the early 1980s, expanding to other crops such as salad vegetables, and marketing for other strawberry growing operations. At high season, the company typically shifts 30 pallets a week or about 60,000lb (27,000kg) of strawberries, according to the sales manager, Angela Griggs. The plants are raised in long rows sheathed in white plastic to minimise weeds – and are notoriously finicky. They like sun, but not heat. They are vulnerable to the weather, pests and disease.  Unlike other crops, strawberries must be picked by hand – but do not like to be touched. Too much handling leads to bumps and bruises, which leads to decay. Sloppy handling damages stem caps, which also hurts shelf life. So they must be picked quickly and carefully – and packed directly in the field to minimise handling, with farms relying on experienced pickers to reject irregular-looking fruit. Once harvested, strawberries must be cooled within two hours to 0C (32F), with equipment pulling cool, dry air towards the boxes in the centre of the pallet. If the air is too dry, the strawberries may shrivel. Too humid, they may rot. “These aren’t widgets in a factory that we can duplicate in everything,” said Griggs. Once the strawberries get to market they typically claim pride of place in the supermarket aisle. Even so, the US retail association estimates about 12% of fresh strawberries are eventually discarded without being sold. The chicken wings were a disaster, a typical rookie mistake – Walter Lewis can see that now. On one of his first runs as an independent truck operator, Lewis, who runs four trucks from a base in New Jersey, was contracted to transport fresh wings to half a dozen Chinese restaurants.  He picked up the fresh wings and duly went on his route: making stops in Virginia and Maryland before ending up in Brooklyn. But when he reached his last stop Lewis discovered that his co-worker had made a mistake setting the temperature controls. The internal temperature, which was supposed to be -6C (20F), had soared to 10C (50F). The cartons of wings were a soggy mess. “By the time we got there the ice had melted off of it,” Lewis recalled. “The water was running out of the trailer.” There was no option but to discard the wings. The average US omnivore consumed about 90lbs (40kg) of chicken last year, compared with about 54lbs (25kg) of beef. That put chicken on the menu for at least three home-cooked and two restaurant meals in a two-week period, according to the National Chicken Council. But transportation is a tricky part of the process. A typical food item in the US travels nearly 1,500 miles (2,400km) from field to processing plant to retail outlet to restaurant. The US has a strong record of transporting food safely, compared with developing countries where up to half of all food spoils on the way to market. Transport trucks are fitted with devices that report in real time on the location of food shipments on the roads, and the state of refrigeration, which helps to minimise the risk of a chicken wing disaster like Lewis’s. But accidents still happen. Lewis is cautious of taking on any runs with multiple stops because opening and closing doors of a temperature-controlled vehicle, or backing into a loading bay that is not refrigerated, can cause havoc. On another run from Massachusetts to Florida, Lewis had to dump a truckload of frozen dinners – 43,000lbs of chicken alfredo, lasagna, and other ready-made meals – because a few pallets of ice cream had softened. “Heat is a big issue,” he said. Chicken is exposed to those risks more than other food commodities. It is more mobile than other items because its production is so heavily concentrated in large-scale industrial facilities, and because of American eating habits. And the consequences of food waste are oversized too, because of the environmental impact of large-scale industrial chicken processing plants.  Almost all of the chicken raised in the US now comes from facilities concentrated in 15 states – a dramatic shift from the 1950s when there were more than 1m small flocks.  A typical facility raises more than 600,000 broiler chickens a year, and the individual birds are also getting bigger, nudging on 9lbs (4kg). The scale of operations has driven prices down. Chicken is up to $2.64 a lb cheaper than beef, according to the US department of agriculture. And it is more convenient. Supermarkets package chicken as boneless, skinless breasts or chicken nuggets, and sell pre-cooked items such as entire rotisserie chickens. In terms of climate pollution, the switch to chicken is a plus as it has a far lighter carbon footprint than beef or dairy farming. Americans may regularly throw out more fresh fruit and vegetables than chicken, but the environmental impact is magnified by intensive factory farming. “If we waste certain foods, we actually have a greater environmental and economic impact,” says Emily Broad Leib, the director of the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic. “A lot of resources and energy go into producing animal products.” The truck was still backing into the loading dock when Pastor Ben Slye began taking stock of that morning’s bounty. Slye fixed his eyes on about 20 pallets of bagged kale, lettuce and other premium salad greens. After five years of Mondays collecting donated food from cold storage warehouses, Slye, the indefatigable pastor of a church in a poorer suburb of Washington DC, has a keen sense of how far he can stretch bulk deliveries of pre-washed, bagged salad and other items – and a deeply felt indignation that such high-quality food could go to waste. “That is the problem in the world today,” Slye said. “It’s not a food production problem or a food storage problem. It is a food distribution problem.” Had Slye not turned up with two volunteers and a truck, the food – rejected by supermarkets and fast-food chains before delivery – would have ended up in a dumpster or landfill site. Instead, it was donated to a network run by community groups and college students that aims to solve two problems: how to feed the rising number of Americans who go hungry or do not have access to nutritious food, and reduce the environmental toll of food waste. His first stop that morning was the Taylor Farms warehouse at Annapolis Junction, Maryland.  The company is one of North America’s leading salad makers, producing bagged baby spinach, rocket and spring mix for supermarkets, orange wedges, apple slices and chopped onions for fast-food restaurants. Slye and his network of two dozen volunteers have not missed a Monday morning at the cold storage warehouses in five years.  He estimated his efforts saved at least 340 tons of food a year – much of it pricey salad greens at peak freshness. “People are not only getting the food that people were going to throw away but they are getting the quality food,” he said. “Most of these boxes have eight, 10, 12 days of freshness, and you only get five to six days in the stores. So these people are getting good food, and getting it even before it gets to the store.” Slye peeked inside a carton of chopped romaine lettuce, pronouncing it a “beautiful salad”. It was not immediately clear why the produce was rejected. Over-ordering? Dented packing crates? Shifting customer preferences? “With the store chains they have the right to receive or reject it,” Slye said. “If it’s not perfect produce they are not receiving it. It could be something so small.” But within a few hours, Slye and his companions had rescued the leafy greens and were distributing the food to churches, including his Christian Life Center in Riverdale Park, Maryland. About 16% of food in North America is lost during processing and distribution, according to UN estimates. Much occurs when supermarkets and fast-food restaurants reject delivery. Distributors scramble to find a new destination for the food, and recoup costs, but often run out of time. Supermarkets generally demand a long lead time before accepting delivery. That is when groups such as Slye’s step in, taking delivery and distributing to a network of food banks and shelters. “It is just an amazing thing to recognise the opportunity we have here,” Slye said. “There is so much more food. We have tapped into just a little bit of it, there is so much more food that’s available.”  We’ve all seen the adverts: a darkened kitchen with a woman gazing longingly through the open fridge door at an array of single-serving, low-calorie yoghurt, in flavours that sound a lot like high-calorie desserts. Those small pots are Saumya Premchander’s nemesis. A development consultant, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, Premchander spends a lot of her time thinking and writing about food and prides herself on using up whatever is in the fridge. She repurposes plain yoghurt for cooking, no matter how sour. But she is defeated by the fancier versions. “Flavoured yoghurt always goes to waste,” she said, via email. “I’m always hopeful that the newest iteration of strawberry and white chocolate mousse yoghurt (80 calories) will be amazing, but I can never make myself eat anything with aspartame, or accept this low-calorie substitution for dessert. I would rather do without.  “I do periodically buy these though, and fill up my fridge, imagining that I might have healthy, or low-calorie snacks.” And that is where Premchander’s aspirations of healthy eating meet the cold reality of American shopping and eating habits and the fog of date labels. In this, Premchander is not alone. Americans collectively throw away more than 8m tons of milk, yoghurt and other dairy products, about a fifth of total produce. Many people are doing so in the often mistaken belief that it has gone off. Consumers throw away food because of the confusing array of date labels. Some are provided more for retailers’ convenience, to help rotate stock. US supermarkets have yet to agree on a single standard for advising customers about the shelf life of foods. Sell by, best by, best before, use by – the different terms make it hard to gauge which deadlines are absolute, and which can be safely ignored for several days. The variety of terms means nearly all US households end up throwing out perfectly edible food, with days of shelf life ahead of it, campaigners say. The lack of label standardisation causes about 20% of household food waste, worth about $29bn (£22bn), according to ReFED. The coalition of business and environmental groups is campaigning for a single standard, or a switch to terms that would avoid waste – such as “freeze by” labels. The reliance on date labels is especially wasteful when it comes to milk and yoghurt. The shelf life of yoghurt depends on a number of factors, including its preparation method and storage.  Bacterial cultures in live yoghurt act as a preservative that prevents mould. Yoghurt stored inside the fridge, and not on the door, generally will last longer. Some yoghurts remain good to eat one to three weeks after the best-by date. Unopened yoghurt containers can be frozen for a month or two. Food has become much cheaper relative to average incomes over the past one or two generations, which encourages waste.  The majority of people do not take their shopping lists along when they go to buy food, so buy more than they need, or they are enticed by items that are harder to use. A lack of cooking skills prevents people from throwing together a meal from whatever is in the fridge, or repurposing items that were not fully used up in a particular recipe, which is the trick of restaurant chefs. And then there are children, whose eating preferences remain a perennial shifting mystery to their parents. “We often buy some flavoured yoghurt for kids, such as strawberry, which they lose interest in, it gets pushed to the back of the fridge and forgotten, etc,” wrote John Levinson, a professional based in Washington DC. Disposing of food waste, without having it end up in landfill, is as great a challenge as avoiding it in the first place, it turns out. This is perhaps most evident when it comes to staples such as bread and other grain products. On a June morning, the waste trucks at Alpha Ridge disposal facility in Howard County, Maryland, return from their collection routes and empty their contents. Mixed in with the pizza crusts, hamburger buns, breakfast cereals, rotting celery and grass clippings are beer and soft drink bottles – and a skateboard. “It’s definitely a slow learning curve. We have to be very, very careful and we have to be good neighbours,” said Gemma Evans, the county’s recycling coordinator. “You cannot mess this up.” Less than 3% of wasted food in the US is sent for composting, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The rest ends up as landfill, where rotting food is a major driver of climate change. Landfill sites are the third largest source of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe.  But keeping food out of landfill is a challenge. Howard County had hoped its pilot scheme would divert about a quarter of food scraps from the dump to composting. But as the managers of the Alpha Ridge composting plan discovered, there were enormous challenges persuading people both to buy less and to sort out their waste. Grains and bread make up a major share of food waste in terms of volume – though not by cost – with Americans throwing out nearly one-third of all grain-based products. Bread baskets are typically one of the most wasted food items at restaurants. At home, families often buy more than they can use. There is now so much bread discarded in the US, food banks are turning away baked goods. The Capital Area food bank, which serves about 450,000 people in Washington DC and surrounding areas, was so overwhelmed with bread, sheet cakes, crackers and candy it could no longer find room in its warehouses. The charity has since banned starchy and sugary donations. For Tineke Thio, a former research physicist turned stay-at-home mum in Princeton, New Jersey, bread is the food that most often goes to waste. “My husband and I are from the Netherlands where the climate is just nicer to bread. It’s drier, so the bread stays for a long time in a bread box,” she said. With the New Jersey humidity in the summer months, it is harder to keep bread unless it is put in the fridge, she said, but “then it goes hard and terrible”.  But getting people to shift their attitudes is a struggle. Jeffrey Dannis, who oversees the Alpha Ridge site, estimates that between supermarkets and restaurants, food warehouses and households, the county generates between 100,000 to 125,000 tons of food scraps a year. “We are anticipating that the county can capture 7,000 tons a year,” he said. “That’s just the tip of the iceberg.” • This article was amended on 25 July 2016 to correct details about the amount of dairy produce thrown away. An earlier version also gave measurements in metric tonnes; they are all now in US tons."
"“Complete ecosystem collapse” is being seen on parts of the Great Barrier Reef, as fish numbers tumble and surviving corals continue to bleach into winter, according to a scientist returning from one of the worst-hit areas. “The lack of fish was the most shocking thing,” said Justin Marshall, of the University of Queensland and the chief investigator of citizen science program Coral Watch. “In broad terms, I was seeing a lot less than 50% of what was there [before the bleaching]. Some species I wasn’t seeing at all.”  Marshall spent a week this month conducting surveys on the reefs around Lizard Island. Marshall said many of the fish species that were commonly seen around branching coral had completely disappeared from the area, including the black-and-white striped humbug damselfish. He said in his time there he saw only one school of green chromis, which were previously seen all over the area. Marshall said the lack of fish was an indication that there was “complete ecosystem collapse”. Without enough surviving corals, the fish didn’t have the shelter and food sources they needed and had died or moved elsewhere. Without many of those fish, Marshall said the coral would face a harder time recovering, since the entire ecosystem had been degraded. He said he was also surprised to see that some of the surviving corals continued to bleach, despite the southern hemisphere winter bringing cooler waters to the Great Barrier Reef. “There are still corals bleaching,” Marshall said. “Especially noticeable on Lizard Island were the soft corals. Some of them have remained bleached. And some of the hard corals are still white.” He said many of them were probably not bleaching for the first time now but rather have remained bleached since it began. “They’re just holding on by the fingernails,” he said. Marshall said he also saw some corals that had recovered, as well as some anemones that had bleached but not died. But, overall, Marshall estimate that more than 90% of the branching corals had died around Lizard Island. He said many of the huge porites corals, which could be a thousand years old, had died. Coral and other organisms like anemones and giant clams bleach when water temperatures are too high for too long. When they become stressed, they expel their colourful symbiotic algae that provide them with energy, becoming pale or white. Unless the water temperatures quickly return to normal, many of those organisms die. Lizard Island was particularly badly hit by the global bleaching event that hit every major reef region in the world and killed almost a quarter of the coral on the Great Barrier Reef. But, in the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef, between Lizard Island and the Torres Strait, a majority of the coral is thought to have died. The mass bleaching this year was driven by climate change, which raised water temperatures close to the maximum threshold coral could stand, and a strong El Niño that bumped the temperatures above that threshold."
"Hillary Clinton could campaign much more aggressively against climate change than any US presidential candidate before her, under a draft platform adopted by Democratic party leaders. The leaders committed the presumptive Democratic nominee to a carbon tax, a climate test for future pipelines and tighter rules on fracking – all stronger positions than those held by Clinton herself at the start of the race.  The Clinton camp said, after the platform was adopted, that she does not support a carbon tax and the draft still needs to be ratified at the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia this month. But the draft platform reflects the influence of Bernie Sanders and other liberals on the 2016 race, and the recognition by Clinton of the need to win over those supporters in swing states such as Colorado, Florida and Virginia where there is strong concern about climate change.  The bold stance could also help Clinton define Donald Trump as a climate denier who is out of touch with reality.  The draft platform calls for putting a price on carbon, making approval of pipelines contingent on a climate test, stronger regulation of fracking – especially concerning water – and giving priority to renewable energy over natural gas power plants. Campaign groups claimed the platform as a win for the environmental movement – despite a much publicized failure to gather support for a ban on fracking, which had been a key goal.  Josh Fox, the maker of the 2010 documentary Gasland who was on the platform committee, said campaigners had won a “monumental victory” in putting pipelines to a climate test, and giving priority to wind and solar power. A similar consideration was used by Barack Obama to reject the controversial Keystone XL pipeline.  “This is a ginormous shift in Democratic policy because the Democrats were on a bullet train to frack gas hell and we just turned that 180 degrees around,” he said. In several senses, the draft platform codifies the sweeping changes already undertaken by Obama in his second term and makes it harder for Clinton to backtrack. Since 2014, Obama has decisively jettisoned his “all of the above” energy policy, moving to restrict oil drilling off the Atlantic coast and mining for coal on public lands. Earlier this year, he proposed a carbon fee in the form of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil. “We’ve gone in four years from all of the above, and natural gas as a bridge to the future, to a platform that explicitly recognizes that wind and sun should take priority over gas. It also says that all federal action should be weighed to see if it ‘significantly exacerbates’ global warming – the so-called Keystone test,” said Bill McKibben, an author and climate activist. “The entire landscape of America’s energy policy will be changed if (Hillary Clinton) follows her word here.” Clinton from the start of her campaign had committed to fighting for Obama’s climate agenda. But she had notably lagged behind Sanders – and even Obama at times – on key issues such as the Keystone pipeline and Arctic drilling.  Paul Bledsoe, an advisor on climate change in the Bill Clinton White House, said a carbon tax would be a “sucker bet” for the Democrats heading into the 2016 election.  Clinton has had to shift consistently throughout the campaign – and will continue to do so on climate to appeal to Sanders voters, he said. But he said the politics of swing states such as Pennsylvania – which Trump is targeting – made her cautious of seeming anti-oil. “I think Clinton is reluctant to give Trump an opening that is anti-energy production,” he said."
"Scorching wildfires that are raging throughout the American south-west are being fueled by climate change and require new strategies from states to prevent ever-greater destruction of people’s lives and property, a group of experts have warned. High temperatures, drought and wind have combined to create a number of fires that have caused at least two deaths in California. The first large wildfire of the summer has this week broken out in northern California, burning through more than 1,200 acres and threatening thousands of homes in an area around 50 miles north-east of Sacramento.  Wildfire experts said there are numerous indicators that warming temperatures have contributed to the fires by drying out vegetation and soils and causing an earlier spring melt of snow. Trees are also less resilient to fire due to infestations of beetles, which thrive in warmer weather. Over the past 30 years there has been a fourfold increase in the number of large forest fires in the American west, while the fire season has grown by 84 days to 220 days in this time. The amount of area burned has ballooned by 1,200%, with areas such as the northern Rockies and the north-west particularly badly hit. “Wildfire in forested areas is increasing dramatically, there are more opportunities for large fires,” said Dr LeRoy Westerling, associate professor at the University of California-Merced. “In a lot of places the climate restricted fires, but now it’s all about fuel availability and we are seeing very large burned patches in areas that aren’t used to it. Each decade since the 1980s has seen a big increase in fire activity, and we don’t expect that trend to stop any time soon.” The fire now raging in northern California follows several outbreaks in the south of the state, including blazes on the outskirts of Los Angeles, which were battled by more than 600 firefighters and causing smoke to billow across the city. A state of emergency has been declared in both California and New Mexico to deal with blazes that have consumed tens of thousands of acres and hundreds of homes. A fire near Santa Barbara jumped Route 101 so quickly that fire department helicopters had to dump water directly onto cars on the road. Similarly dramatic scenes have unfolded in Arizona, where a fire that has burned more than 12,000 acres has rained ash upon residents in the Show Low area. Huge plumes of smoke from the various fires are clearly visible from space. Westerling and several other experts have called for a change in strategy to deal with the increasing wildfire risk. States, they argue, should be using controlled burns and chemical treatments to make forests less like a tinderbox and more predictable during wildfire season. “We need to be better prepared and restore the landscape to a more resilient condition,” said Susan Jane Brown, an attorney and director of the Western Environmental Law Center. “We would like our forests to withstand wildfire and come back as ponderosa pine forests, not grand fir forests. We need to reduce the fuel load. “There is still a lot of concern among communities about fire and states such as Oregon are worried about the health impacts of smoke, which is certainly something to be aware of.  “But the thing is we will get the smoke one way or the other. We either get it through controlled burns, where we know where and when it will happen, or big doses of smoke through uncontrolled wildfires that occur at the height of summer.” Dr Keith Gilless, chair of the California board of forestry and fire protection, said that public attention on fire has “never been higher” than it is now but that more attention needed to be paid by policymakers upon the social cost paid by disadvantaged people. “One of the tragedies is the lack of social resilience when the flames come,” he said. “Often, fires burn through low-income areas and the loss of an uninsured home is an overwhelming one for people there. Communities like that need to be very engaged with fire services to plan evacuation routes. “I don’t ever envision the fire season ever shutting down again. In areas like southern California, the deployment of staff and resources to deal with wildfire is going to become a permanent feature rather than a seasonal one.”"
"Australia’s big four banks’ lending for Australian renewable energy projects has tumbled in the first half of 2016, despite all of them spruiking their continuing support for the sector. Based on public announcements from the banks and their customers, the activist group Market Forces has found only two financing deals were closed this year in the Australian renewables sector. The National Australia Bank lent money to a windfarm in South Australia and both NAB and Westpac helped finance one in New South Wales. Although more financing could be revealed in the second half of the year, the figures seem to show the banks have slowed their flow of money to the renewables sector in Australia. “This is what you see when you have years of stagnation and cutting into renewable energy policy,” said Julien Vincent from Market Forces. The group has been collecting the data on financing for Australian renewable energy projects for the past eight years. The first six months of 2016 have seen the big four banks lend only $162m to renewable projects. That is less than half the average amount loaned in all previous six-month periods since 2008 and the fifth-worst half-yearly figure in the dataset. So far this year, according to public announcements, both the Commonwealth Bank and ANZ have not closed any deals for renewable energy projects in Australia. Market Forces data previously showed the big four banks lent $5.5bn to the Australian fossil-fuel sector in 2015 and that the amount lent to the fossil-fuel sector was six times more than lent to the renewables sector since 2008. One bank had a ratio of 13 to one, favouring lending to fossil fuels over renewables. When approached in February and then again in May to comment on their continuing lending to fossil-fuel projects in Australia, all four banks responded to the Guardian’s questions by emphasising their lending to the renewables sector. But Vincent said the lack of local investment wasn’t entirely the banks’ fault.  “This is what you get when you have years of debate about whether the renewable energy target should be cut and you have a carbon price that is cut and then you have a billion dollars taken out of the [Clean Energy Finance Corporation] to paper over cracks, trying to protect the reef,” he said. “There is so little going on and so little to invest in now.” That analysis was confirmed by a spokesman for the Commonwealth Bank, who told the Guardian: “The limited number of renewable energy developments, and therefore financing opportunities in Australia, has resulted in the majority of CBA renewable financings being offshore in the last year and we have been active in both Europe and North America.” However, Vincent said the banks all had commitments to invest in renewable energy and, if government policy wasn’t allowing them to do that, they should be publicly calling for change. “They’re getting credit and applause for carbon reduction and renewable energy – so where are they in the public debate?” Vincent said. “Why aren’t they saying ‘hey we’re doing our best but there aren’t enough opportunities being created’? “They’re four of the biggest and most powerful companies in Australia and if they want policies that would let them unlock this finance – which is in the tens of billions of dollars ready to deploy – then they could get them.” Vincent said it was bad news for the Australia economy, because this money was flowing overseas, with the big four banks lending to overseas renewable projects more than they were to local ones. “We’re missing a trick, where there is a huge amount of funds sitting there that the banks would certainly be able to get a lot of benefit from, in terms of reputation, if they were able to deploy that in Australia,” he said. In 2015, global investment in renewable energy grew to more than twice that in coal and gas-fired power generation, according to UN environment program figures. In the 2014-2015 financial year, an all-time record of about US$320bn was invested in renewable energy worldwide but in Australia investment fell by 31%, with government plans to cut the renewable energy target blamed. The Market Forces database was built from public statements and could be missing deals. But Vincent said the group had spoken with key players in the renewables sector and nobody had found financing deals that had been missed. The banks all said they were unable to comment on specific deals that could be in the works, due to client confidentiality.  Westpac emphasised their lending to a broader category called the “CleanTech and environmental services sector”, to which it lent $6.3bn in the six months to March 2016. They also pointed to their work on climate bonds and discounted loans offered to business seeking to improve their energy efficiency. NAB told Guardian Australia they would continue to work towards their commitment “to invest $18bn over the next seven years to support the transition to a low-carbon economy”. ANZ declined to comment."

"The total lifetime cost of the planned Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant could be as high as £37bn, according to an assessment published by the UK government. The figure was described as shocking by critics of the scheme, who said it showed just how volatile and uncertain the project had become, given that the same energy department’s estimate 12 months earlier had been £14bn. The latest prediction comes amid increasing speculation about the future of the controversial project in Somerset, whose existence has been put in further doubt by post-Brexit financial jitters.  Hinkley has been a flagship energy project for the British government and in particular for the chancellor, George Osborne, who lobbied hard and successfully for China to take a stake in the scheme. Officials at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) on Thursday confirmed the £37bn figure, but said it was provisional, set in September 2015, when wholesale power prices were low, and would not affect bill payers. “Hinkley will generate enough low-carbon electricity to power six million homes and around £10 [a year] from [each] consumer’s bill will pay for it once it is up and running. We have set the strike price to protect bill payers if energy costs go up or down, so the cost of the project to consumers will not change,” a DECC spokesperson said. “Today’s report from the IPA (Infrastructure and Projects Authority) does not suggest that the lifetime costs of Hinkley have increased. It is a sna shot of the position at the end of September 2015.” EDF said the £37bn figure should be disregarded. “Hinkley Point C will generate reliable low-carbon electricity in the future, so a cost estimate based on last year’s depressed wholesale price is not relevant. HPC’s electricity will be competitive with other low-carbon energy options and consumers won’t pay a penny until the plant begins operating.” But experts said the extra money, if the cost did remain at £37bn, would have to come from somewhere – probably the taxpayer – or be shaved off other DECC budgets available for different energy projects, such as windfarms and solar arrays. “This whole-life cost of £37bn is a truly shocking figure. It is an extraordinary ramp-up from last year’s figure, and just underlines how hard it is to get a real handle on the long-term cost of Hinkley,” said Paul Dorfman, senior research fellow at the Energy Institute, University College London. The latest increase is a new blow to a scheme with an already precarious outlook due to the debt problems besetting its lead developer, EDF, which has been hit by rising costs and delays to another new-build nuclear power station scheme, at Flamanville, in Normandy. EDF, a French group part-owned by the state, has high debt levels and has had difficulty convincing some of its own board members to support Hinkley despite the French government’s efforts to help it financially.  The Brexit vote has made the British commercial environment much more uncertain, and French trade unions, who want the final investment decision postponed, have been pressing independent directors to convince EDF’s chief executive, Jean-Bernard Levy, to ditch Hinkley.  Critics of the scheme have claimed that the fall in the value of the pound since the referendum vote will increase the costs of the scheme to EDF’s French contractors, who work in euros. But the management of the company said this week that the British referendum vote would not affect the project; it had completed its promise to consult further with the unions and was free to take a final investment decision.  “Backed by the studies already provided to the representatives of the workforce, EDF considers that this [Brexit] vote in no way changes the fundamentals of the project, nor does it alter the desire of those involved to take part in it,” the management said in a statement. EDF directors , DECC and the French government have consistently repeated their determination to proceed with the already delayed Hinkley, which is expected to supply 7% of Britain’s total electricity when up and running. But the EDF staff council last month began legal action to try to force the company to release documents relating the project, including all the contracts it had signed with the British government and its co-investor, the Chinese utility CGN. The fall in power prices in the UK and continental Europe that has influenced the latest lifetime cost assessment for Hinkley is also responsible for some of the financial difficulties at EDF. There have also been suggestions that Chinese investors are becoming more nervous about Hinkley and are demanding more concessions from EDF, so that more Chinese project managers and suppliers are involved. EDF has denied this."
"The end of the jet age could be in sight. Innovative new electric aircraft are starting to find their way off the drawing board and onto runways, funded by startups, government agencies and the world’s biggest jet makers. They promise flights that are cleaner, quieter and safer than today’s jets, and with a fraction of their carbon footprint. Earlier this month, Nasa announced that it would be building a high-speed research aircraft called Maxwell that would use electric motors to drive 14 propellers. The four-seater aircraft should be able to fly at speeds of up to 175mph (about as fast as many small aircraft), using a fifth of the energy of a normal private plane.   “Eventually, Nasa would love to replace airplanes like the Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 that represent a large fraction of civil aviation,” says Jack Langelaan, a professor of aerospace engineering at Penn State University. “A huge proportion of today’s emissions and fuel burn comes from these kind of planes.” Commercial aviation already accounts for 2% of all man-made CO2 emissions, a figure that could rise to 22% (pdf) by 2050. Electric aircraft could slow this trend, or even roll it back. For a start, electric motors are about twice as efficient as internal combustion or jet engines. “All you’re doing is running wires to motors,” says Carl Schaefer of Aurora Flight Sciences, an aerospace company developing an electric drone called Lightning Strike for the US military. “So instead of one large propeller, you have the freedom to place small motors anywhere on the aircraft.”  Maxwell will have 12 propellers on the wing, and two more mounted on its wingtips - each with its own motor. This configuration enables it to boost fuel efficiency even further – and adds safety. “Having one engine fail during takeoff when you’re using 14 is much less severe than having one fail when you only have three,” says Sean Clarke, one of Maxwell’s designers.  Aviation startups have also been quick to realise that electric motors can enable new vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft to replace cars rather than planes. “Vertical takeoff is popular because if we’re going to use these vehicles for commuting, no one wants to land at an airport five miles away from work,” says Langelaan.  German startup Lilium’s two-seater needs a landing zone no larger than 15 metres square, while Joby’s S2, under development in California, tilts 12 rotors to take off vertically, then converts into a conventional plane. Joby claims the 200mph plane will use five times less energy, door to door, than a petrol-driven car. The Volocopter, another German prototype, has 18 helicopter-style rotors, while Chinese firm EHang’s 184 aircraft resembles an oversized single-person drone. The ultimate aim of such aircraft is on-demand aviation, an Uber for aircraft that provides automated pilot-less aerial transport around, and between, congested cites.  EHang has already got permission to start testing its autonomous 184 aircraft in Nevada, although not with passengers on board.  “There are a lot of things we need to get sorted out to make this work,” says Langelaan. “Collision avoidance and traffic management are important. It’s a big sky but once a lot of these little airplanes start flying around, the sky will start looking an awful lot smaller.” There are other technical challenges for electric aircraft to overcome too, not least the state of battery technology. Range anxiety takes on a whole new meaning when you’re worried about reaching the next runway. “Lithium ion batteries are not at the point where you have the power density to build an aircraft with long range,” says Schaefer. “You’re limited to about an hour’s flight.” Aurora gets around this problem by using a hybrid system, where three one-megawatt generators, powered by jet fuel, drive the Lightning Strike’s electric motors.  A greener solution is to generate power as you need it, using photovoltaic cells. Solar Impulse 2 recently became the first aircraft powered solely by renewable energy to cross the Atlantic, as part of a round-the-world tour. But the Solar Impulse can carry only one person, has a top speed lower than most cars and costs millions of dollars to develop.  “Solar right now only works well for light airplanes with large wings,” says Langelaan. “As solar cell efficiencies get better, you’re going to see solar-powered airplanes with more traditional dimensions.” The good news is that all the technologies behind electric planes, from batteries to solar cells to the motors themselves, are getting better, lighter and cheaper all the time. The large jet makers are paying attention. Boeing and Airbus have experimented with electric aircraft, and even Tesla boss Elon Musk has hinted that he is considering building an all-electric plane. Just like today’s Tesla, Prius and Leaf cars, hybrid and electric planes will have much lower running costs than traditional propeller or jet aircraft. The maker of the solar-powered Sun Flyer electric plane says it uses just $1 of electricity for each hour of flying time, compared to $40/hour for a fossil-fuel powered light aircraft. Clarke and Schaefer both say that battery technology is about a decade away from where it needs to be for commercial aviation on the scale of passenger jets to make sense.  “We’re all waiting for battery technology,” says Clarke. “But demonstrating the complex systems now, like we are doing on the Maxwell, will allow the market to pick up those technologies when they are fully mature.”"

"It is written like a school report – “could try harder” – although the phrase that recurs through the UK Climate Change Assessment released last week is “more action needed”. Subjects like flooding and soil loss need “new stronger or different government policies” to deal with them.  But that is not all. There are a significant number of new problems being caused by the already-changing weather patterns and warming climate that are “research priorities” because no one yet knows enough about them to form a response. Among these are risks to food supply and some forest trees dying from drought and heat. A major problem for an island with large stretches of populated coastline is ever-faster sea level rise. The general belief is that the problems of the south-east are potentially worse because the land is sinking but it seems the north is not in the clear, either. Waves do the most damage to coastal defences, so during a high tide on an exposed coast their size matters. Mathematicians from Strathclyde University have just calculated the effect on Scottish North Sea coasts, on communities like Aberdeen, of a combination of spring tides, strong winds and high waves. Examining just three storms in 2010 they took into account locally produced waves, swell from distant storms, and tidal currents. The research showed that as these three interacted they could either reduce wave height or increase it by two metres. So depending on the circumstances, with locally-generated waves already 3.5m high and storm swell waves from the Norwegian Sea up to 5m, local communities could in the future face a severe battering.

"Today’s climate scientists have a lot more to worry about than peer review. Organizations with perverse financial incentives harass scientists with lawsuit after lawsuit, obstructing research and seeking to embarrass them with disclosures of private information. On June 14th, an Arizona court ruled that thousands of emails from two prominent climate scientists must be turned over to the Energy & Environment Legal Institute (E&E), a group that disputes the 97% expert consensus on human-caused climate change and argues against action to confront it. E&E and its attorneys are funded by Peabody Coal, Arch Coal, and Alpha Natural Resources, coal corporations with billions of dollars in revenue.   Formerly named the American Tradition Institute, E&E has been described as “filing nuisance suits to disrupt important academic research.”  E&E originally attacked Dr. Michael Mann, whose research shows a dramatic increase in recent temperatures in a graph popularly known as the “hockey stick.” In 2011, the group sued under Virginia open records laws to obtain six years of Dr. Mann’s emails from the University of Virginia—over 10,000 messages in total. The Virginia Supreme Court denied E&E’s claims and ruled that academic research correspondence should be protected because release would cause “harm to university-wide research efforts, damage to faculty recruitment and retention, undermining of faculty expectations of privacy and confidentiality, and impairment of free thought and expression.”  E&E did not relent. Despite losing in Virginia, the group brought another open records case in Arizona to demand the same six years of emails—this time from Dr. Mann’s coauthor, University of Arizona professor Dr. Malcolm Hughes. Additionally, E&E sued for thirteen years of emails from UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) lead author Dr. Jonathan Overpeck, also at the University of Arizona. In court filings, E&E acknowledges it seeks emails that, in its words, “embarrass both Professors Hughes and Overpeck and the University.” These smear tactics serve no role in scientific discourse, but are an attempt to distract, disrupt, and intimidate legitimate researchers.  E&E’s attorney also claimed that female scientists may, according to him, go on “mommy sabbatical” and then ignore their publicly-funded research in lieu of “sitting around folding clothes.” Given this risk, E&E argued that when scientists “abandon” their duties, emails regarding unpublished research should be released so that others can take over their work. E&E did not explain how to determine what has been “abandoned.” Just filing the lawsuit caused damage: Dr. Hughes testified it took him ten weeks to go through all the emails, and he lost an entire research summer to reviewing old emails as well as losing a grant that expired. Dr. Overpeck testified it took him six weeks to go through everything and he was unable to use his sabbatical. These sorts of lawsuits, regardless of outcome, subtract months of labor from the scientific endeavor and cost public universities hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees.  The trial court ruled in March 2015 that the University of Arizona had provided an “abundance of supporting evidence” that releasing the emails would cause harm, and the court ruled in favor of the University. However, E&E appealed, securing a rehearing in the case.  Last month, the court reversed its earlier decision and determined instead that disclosure was warranted. The court concluded that: [a]lternative methods of communications have been and remain available to Professors Hughes and Overpeck and any other similarly situated persons should they desire to correspond in confidence regarding research projects and like endevours [sic]. The implication seems to be that scientists’ research discussions should be limited to the telephone.  In a modern workplace, email is critical to professional communication. This decision will force scientists to work in a fishbowl, with every email exchange—from offhand notes to highly technical analyses—picked apart by agenda-driven opponents. It will stifle candid scientific debate, discourage open collaboration, and chill free academic thought. The Union of Concerned Scientists has found that: open records requests are increasingly being used to harass and intimidate scientists and other academic researchers, or to disrupt and delay their work. In an ongoing federal case, the conservative group Judicial Watch—which claims climate science is a “fraud science”—has sued the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for thousands of climate scientists’ emails related to a 2015 climate change study published in Science. Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX), who accused NOAA of having an “extreme climate change agenda,” unsuccessfully sought the same emails last year.  In addition to the Arizona case, E&E attorney Christopher Horner paired with another fossil fuel industry funded-group, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, to sue for the emails of climate communications professor Dr. Edward Maibach. While Dr. Maibach sought to intervene in the litigation, the judge ruled that he lacked jurisdiction. Thousands of pages of Dr. Maibach’s emails were released, and plaintiffs posted them to the internet with quotes pulled out of context and commentary calling him and other climate researchers “frauds,” “snake oil salesman,” and worse.  To evaluate scientific merits, a critic needs final data, methodologies, and research results—not thousands of emails. The peer review process vets research results, followed by examination and replication by the scientific community. These safeguards remain the foundation of scientific review.  In our ongoing quest for scientific progress, every frivolous lawsuit against a scientist represents a step in the wrong direction. We must not allow groups with perverse financial incentives to jeopardize science.  Lauren Kurtz is the Executive Director of the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund (CSLDF), a non-profit that defends scientists against legal attack. CSLDF was founded to fund Dr. Mann’s defense, represented Dr. Maibach, and filed amicus briefs in support of the University of Arizona. Help protect the scientific endeavor by donating to CSLDF, where a trustee is currently matching all donations up to $50,000. "
"When a massive wildfire destroyed more than a thousand homes last year in the bone-dry hills of drought-stricken Lake County, California, about two hours north of San Francisco, Magdalena Valderrama Hurwitz and her husband, Eliot Hurwitz, were among those made homeless. Eager to transform their tragedy into an opportunity, they got together with a group of neighbors who had also lost their homes and began imagining a different kind of community.  Valderrama Hurwitz, a former non-profit administrator, and her husband, a retired strategic planner with the Napa County Transportation and Planning Agency, didn’t want to replace their house with an oversized energy guzzler, isolated from their neighbors. Instead, they began exploring ways to create a so-called intentional community: a neighborhood that could better protect them from climate change-related risks and be a model for how to live with less impact on the planet. “We want to try to mitigate and prepare for future disasters, and for us that resiliency should include a new way to develop rather than the kind of suburban, single-family home with people isolated from each other living in their own castles,” Valderrama Hurwitz says. More than 5,000 miles away, in Amsterdam, a California-based development company called ReGen Villages is about to break ground on a very similar project. When it’s completed next year, an off-grid development of 100 homes will aim to be almost completely self-sufficient. Each 25-home cluster will encircle several food production facilities for growing organic produce and raising chicken and fish using advanced agricultural technologies that require less land, like aquaponics and vertical farms. The settlement will generate its own wind, solar and biogas power and manage its wastewater in a closed-loop system that also captures waste to be recycled as energy and fertilizers. James Ehrlich, CEO and founder of ReGen Villages, says the company decided to launch in northern Europe because the region has a solid track record designing housing that reduces ecological impact. ReGen – an abbreviation of regenerative – has plans to replicate its pilot project at sites in Sweden, Norway, Germany and Denmark in the next couple of years to further study the model before expanding globally. “The EU has taken the lead in many ways on rethinking residential development in ways that support lowering carbon footprints,” Ehrlich says. Valderrama and Hurwitz wondered if the ReGen Villages project in the leafy, eco-conscious Netherlands could be adapted to their drought-prone, rural California county. They are among a growing number of US-based landowners, developers and local governments interested in bringing variations of the template to their own communities who have contacted Ehrlich since ReGen Villages was unveiled at the Venice Biennale in May. But the US is not northern Europe. Replicating the European ReGen Villages model in a country with one of the largest ecological footprints for housing requires changing a political culture that’s more conservative and more skeptical about investing in sustainability. It also means rethinking zoning and financing systems that favor conventional single-family developments. Nonetheless, Ehrlich sees opportunities to have several US-based projects in the pipeline during the next five years. ReGen Villages will choose its first American development sites strategically, he says. The company will prioritize communities where local government is already open to bold approaches to residential sustainability and where they might partner with local universities and other research institutions to further study the model. ReGen Villages itself grew out of research at Stanford University, where Ehrlich is a senior technology analyst. The majority of interest so far, Ehrlich says, is coming from the northeastern US, where a similar climate would make it fairly simple to replicate the northern European prototype: biomass that powers heating and cooling systems depending on the season, and huge glass envelopes encasing houses to conserve heat in the winter and create large, protected greenhouse spaces for year-round gardens next to homes. ReGen will focus on suburban and rural areas with space to incorporate farming and where there is potential for revitalization through the integration of sustainable infrastructure, such as water conservation systems, greener wastewater treatment, energy-efficient landscaping, renewable energy systems and expanded public transportation networks. One of the parties hoping to work with ReGen is Cortina Valley, a family-owned development in the Catskill Mountains of New York. After a decade-long permitting process, Cortina Valley recently got the green light for a 95-unit residential development adjacent to a ski resort. Creative director Taylor Baker foresees a mix of year-round residents and New York City urbanites seeking second homes in an area that’s gaining popularity – and where interest in sustainability is increasing. The vision for Cortina Valley is considerably less resource-intensive than predominant 1980s residential developments built around the ski industry. Renewable energy and efficiency measures were already part of Cortina Valley’s plan, as were organic food production and increasing access to alternative transportation such as cycling and electric car sharing. When Baker read about ReGen Villages, it seemed like a way to meet all the development’s goals. “We want to work with the environment and have as little impact as possible,” says Baker. “Our overall vision is very much in line with ReGen Villages, raising organic produce, having organic farms, having a positive impact on the land.” ReGen has intentionally entered the market with a higher-end project – homes in the first Dutch development will start at €200,000 ($219,260) – to build demand. Ehrlich frequently characterizes the ReGen Villages prototype as the “Tesla of eco-villages,” a reference to Elon Musk’s upmarket electric car that is driving unprecedented demand for electric vehicles. But the company’s longer term aspiration is to establish variations of its eco-village throughout the developing world to help ease the resource demands of a skyrocketing global population. With billions of people projected to enter the middle class in the coming decades, the company wants to shift the definition of a middle class lifestyle to one that places greater value on sustainability. Projects in developing regions such as the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa and India would be adapted to local climate and built at a significantly reduced cost. The goal is not simply to multiply ReGen Villages around the globe, however, but to increase the political will to make these kinds of developments just as mainstream as a typical suburban subdivision. “It’s not just about ReGen Villages building these communities quickly,” Ehrlich says. “We are also motivating municipal governments to think differently – fast-tracking permitting, and looking at wherever we build as prototypes for residential housing rather than a traditional developer.” Emerging high-tech, high-end experiments like ReGen Villages serve an important purpose, according to Harrison Fraker, a professor of architecture and urban design at the University of California Berkeley and chair of the university’s Energy and Resources Group. One of the biggest challenges in the move toward sustainability in residential housing, he says, has been the dearth of high quality demonstration projects to be studied and improved.  Fraker believes a ReGen-style residential housing model could work in the US, but adds that the construction of a few successful demonstration projects shouldn’t be the only objective. “The big question is how to make it scalable and replicable at an affordable price,” he says. Fraker furthermore cautions that advanced new developments like ReGen Villages, however efficient, will never be the sole solution to transforming residential housing – it’s also necessary to retrofit current homes. “We can have lots and lots of these experiments, I’m all in favor of people doing this and learning from it,” he says. “But if we have a hundred, two hundred or a thousand of these, we’re still not close to being there. We also have to find a way for these ideas to have an impact on existing housing stock.” For now, Hurwitz and Valderrama remain in limbo as they and like-minded neighbors work to develop plans for a community that marries sustainability and climate resiliency. Whether or not they realize their plans in partnership with ReGen Villages, they hope to eventually be part of a network of communities that can learn from one another as they work toward similar goals."

"In their book Climate Change, Capitalism and Corporations, published prior to the Paris climate change meeting last December, Chris Wright and Daniel Nyberg highlighted how the dominance of neoliberalism in recent decades has locked the global economy on to a path of “creative self-destruction”, built around the oxymoron of “green capitalism”. Events since Paris have confirmed their thesis. Just before Paris, the New York state attorney general, via the US Securities and Exchange Commission, secured undertakings from the world’s largest coal company, Peabody Energy, for violating state laws prohibiting false and misleading conduct in regard to Peabody’s public statements on risks posed by climate change. In part by misrepresenting the projections of the International Energy Agency (IEA).  For the past two decades, major companies, industry bodies, media and governments have been guilty of similar disinformation in Australia, a practice which is again evident in this election campaign. Long ago, the IEA recognised the risks posed by human-induced climate change. It accepted that climate and energy were inextricably linked and dangerous climate change could only be avoided with fundamental change to the global energy system. Specifically by rapidly weaning ourselves off fossil fuels and transitioning to low-carbon energy supply. The IEA has become a leading authority exploring this transition, regularly quoted by governments and business alike. It is subjected to great pressure by them to lean in suitably accommodating directions. It handles this pressure by publishing, in its annual World Energy Outlooks (WEOs), its perspectives on the energy sector over the next 25 years. These explore the implications of taking alternative climate and energy pathways. Key scenarios are: current policies (CP) which assumes business-as-usual, new policies (NP) which extends CP with policy governments have committed to but not yet implemented, and the 450 scenario which is the pathway to keep global average temperature increase below 2C. These scenarios are highly influential in justifying investment decisions. For Australia, global coal demand is one of the factors of greatest interest. In the WEO 2015 released last November, under CP assumptions demand would increase by 43% by 2040 compared to current levels, under NP by 12%, but under 450 scenario it declines by 36%. The IEA takes NP as their central scenario as this is where we are headed if governments implement their commitments. However the IEA make it clear that NP is not a sustainable future. In its report, executive director Fatih Birol says: “We look to the negotiators in Paris to destroy our projections in our central scenario, which we show to be unsustainable, in order to create a new world in which energy needs are met without dangerously overheating the planet.” The Paris meeting agreed to keep global average temperature below 2C and pursue efforts to limit to 1.5C. Warming would see global population and economic growth in steep decline or stalled. Poverty would massively increase as poorer countries are disproportionately hit by climate extremes. This is already happening.  As with Peabody, Australian organisations, through the Minerals Council, regularly misrepresent the IEA’s position. Typically they publicise the CP or NP outcomes and ignore the 450 scenario despite the fact that they publicly support the 2C limit. These inflated coal demand figures are then claimed to be IEA “forecasts”, justifying further coal investment and government support. These organisations participate in IEA advisory committees and should be aware that scenarios are not forecasts. Scenarios demonstrate the outcome of certain choices and the IEA make it clear that CP and NP are choices we must not make. To suggest otherwise is blatant disinformation of the worst kind given the potentially catastrophic implications of distorting the IEA’s advice. The Minerals Council of Australia has been one of the worst offenders, even in the current election campaign inconsistently using NP outcomes while claiming to support the 2C limit. The Minerals Council represents companies like BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, who vehemently proclaim leadership on climate change and the urgent need to follow a 2C path, yet this disinformation is allowed to continue from the Minerals Council. This propaganda is parroted by ill-informed politicians, such as energy minister Josh Frydenberg, claiming that,“The IEA tells us that 40% of today’s electricity demand is met by coal and by 2040 it will still be 30%”, and trade minister Steve Ciobo: “Global demand for coal is still going through the roof”. NP figures again, which imply an absolute increase in coal use of 23%. However the 450 scenario, to which the government supposedly committed to in Paris, shows coal’s share of electricity demand falling from 40% to 12% by 2040, an absolute reduction in coal use of 57%, which certainly requires no new coal mines. Parts of media also to be blamed. The Australian has been an offenderbut even the more balanced Fairfax press falls into the same trap. Not surprisingly, it still features prominently on coal company websites. The government and opposition, who accept donations from fossil fuel interests which Wright and Nyberg refer to, both sing the praises of the Adani Carmichael mine in the Galilee Basin, Shenhua’s Watermark Mine on the Liverpool Plains, Kepco’s Bylong Valley adventure and Hume Coal in the Southern Highlands. All based on ill-informed premises and substantially contributing to increasing global temperatures well above 2C. The cost to Australia, if this irresponsible misallocation of resources proceeds, would be enormous. Among other things, stranded assets as these mines are forced to shut down as climate impact intensifies; the lost opportunity of not investing in low-carbon future; the loss of agricultural productivity as mining disrupts prime farming land and water supply; and the social disruption caused to regional communities from abandoned operations. Plus, the full impact of potentially catastrophic climate change in a country more at risk than any other. In the national interest, Australian regulators, including federal and state attorney generals, ASIC, the ASX and the Press Council urgently need to stamp out this misinformation as their overseas counterparts are doing. Particularly if we are serious about promoting “innovation, jobs and growth”."
"The race for the White House is failing to grapple with the key issues of the day, especially the urgent need to combat climate change before atmospheric changes become irreversible, a slice of the American electorate believes. As the primary election season turns toward a head-to-head between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, there is increasing anger and frustration over the nature of the contest. A Guardian call-out to online readers in the US asking them to reflect on the race so far was met by a barrage of criticism on the tone and substance of the world’s most important election – with the two main parties, individual candidates and the media all coming under heavy fire. The Guardian asked readers to identify the “one issue that affects your life you wish the presidential candidates were discussing more”. Resoundingly, the largest group of participants pointed to climate change. Of the 1,385 who responded to the call-out – from all 50 states – one in five expressed discontent at the relative silence from candidates around a subject that they believed to be of supreme and epochal importance. They noted that much of the Republican debate has either focused on blatant denial that climate change even exists or on how to unpick Barack Obama’s attempts to fight global warming, while on the Democratic side both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have raised the issue but have rarely pushed it to the top of the political agenda. Many of the respondents vented despair at a political system that in their view allowed a matter of such overwhelming significance to be so overlooked. “The fact that no one is really talking about climate change, to me, is indicative of just how lost we are,” said Linda Hayden, 51, from Oregon. “Our house is on fire and we are arguing about who is more angry!” Vivid words and phrases were used to articulate the scale of the pending disaster that readers accused the presidential hopefuls of ignoring, such as “cataclysmic”, “running out of time”, “threat to human life”, “path towards destruction”, or in one particularly memorable remark: “slow-motion apocalypse”. A reader from Alaska, a state acutely feeling the impact of climate change, used the word “Doomed!”, while an 18-year-old woman from Tennessee who asked to remain anonymous simply said: “Freaking global climate change.” Jennie Ratcliffe, 66, from North Carolina quibbled with the Guardian’s wording of the question, saying “this is far more than an ‘issue’ – it’s a crisis”. “I’m a climate scientist, and almost no one in the general public knows just how serious and urgent this really is,” said Peter Kalmus, 41, from Altadena, California. “Not only is it real – it’s terrifying.” The concerns of voters came to light as part of the Guardian’s Voices of America series which aims to highlight the way key issues have been ignored or under-played during a primary season when trivial personal attacks seemed to take precedence over substantial debate of issues that matter. The Guardian call-out was not a poll, and as such was not a controlled survey of opinion. But it does illuminate a largely hidden depth of concern, particularly among liberal Americans, about a gathering global disaster that has tended to be discussed, if at all, at the fringes of the presidential debate. Most of the respondents were liberal-leaning. About 80% said they planned to support a Democratic candidate – by comparison, around 31% of Americans overall describe themselves as Democrat (a higher 49% if you include those who say they are “Democrat-leaning”). That disparity is likely to have influenced the fact that climate change was top of the pile of priorities for those who participated – only 19 of the 284 respondents who mentioned climate change said they were unaffiliated to a party and just two described themselves as Republican. This ideological gap also plays out in public opinion research which uses a nationally representative sample of respondents. Last year, Pew Research Center found that 76% of liberal Democrats said that “global warming is a very serious problem” compared to 14% of conservative Republicans. That is perhaps a reflection of a fundamental disagreement among Americans about the reasons for, and even existence of, climate change. Pew found that 64% of Democrats believed global warming was caused by human activity while only 22% of Republicans agreed. Participants in the Guardian project reserved their greatest ire for those Republican candidates who have expressed skepticism on the campaign trail that human-induced climate change exists at all. Among prominent GOP contenders, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio all cast doubt while they were running on climate change science while Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich and Rand Paul argued against the need for urgent action to tackle the problem. The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has said he is “not a great believer” in man-made climate change, suggesting it is a hoax put about by the Chinese. When he set out his energy plan, he promised to cancel the Paris climate agreement that commits countries to reduce levels of polluting emissions. Anthony Friedline, 31, of Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, was one of many respondents who expressed frustration at how the subject had been treated during the presidential TV debates: “One party thinks it is a hoax, and on the other side no one wants to discuss it except Bernie Sanders who the media doesn’t want to give the time of day because he isn’t part of the ‘establishment’. Who cares about ‘establishment politics’ when the fate of the whole damn planet is in our hands and we, apparently, are going to do nothing to fix it?” Forest Menke-Thielman, 32, from Oregon, wrote that “the Republicans still haven’t admitted climate change exists, but even Democrats are not making it a priority like they should. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have mentioned it, but are not prioritizing it enough. All the candidates act as if this isn’t happening, and everyone knows that it is. Let’s get real folks!” The strikingly bleak view of so many American voters towards the presidential election process chimes with the dismay of prominent environmental groups and campaigners who had hoped that the race for the most powerful job on earth would become a channel for serious discussion about how to tackle climate change.  Michael Brune, executive director of the 2.4 million-strong Sierra Club, America’s largest environmental movement, said: “Our members are in shock right now about Donald Trump – they are asking how we got to this point and what must be done to stop him becoming president.” Brune added: “We feel it’s unconscionable that the overwhelming coverage has focused on the size of Trump’s hands or how he belittles his opponents, as opposed to how our civilization will be powered and climate change averted.” The climatologist Michael Mann, who is director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, said he did believe that Clinton and Sanders had engaged in meaningful dialogue about climate change, and pointed the finger of blame at the media for failing fully to reflect that. He added that as the general election gets underway he hoped there would be more focus on “substantive and critical differences in the views of the candidates, and less focus on frivolous and prurient matters that serve as little more than distraction and misdirection”.  Mann said: “The American people could not have a starker choice before them between a presumptive candidate of one of the two parties who recognizes the risk posted by human-caused climate change and articulates solutions, and the presumptive candidate of the other party, who denies that climate change is even real.”  The co-founder of the climate campaign 350.org, Bill McKibben, who Sanders has appointed to the platform committee at the upcoming Democratic national convention, struck a positive note by pointing out that in the 2012 presidential race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, climate change was not raised at all until just days before the election as a result of Hurricane Sandy. “This time around, whoever the Democrat is will be hammering Trump and the rest of the GOP for their blindness to climate science – it’s now a losing proposition for them. So, scientists and movements have done their job in that way.”  But he went on to warn that “merely believing in climate change at this point is way too low a bar. We need leaders who understand it’s the issue of our century, and will work with the focus it requires.” Climate change was the most prominent among a host of different political concerns that respondents to the call-out complained were being insufficiently aired during the election. Accounting for one in 10 responses, the next most common group of worries related to tax reform, income inequality and poverty . Similarly high were mentions of campaign finance and corruption in politics, those too made up around one in ten responses. Insecurity was a theme in many of the responses – 8% of respondents said they wanted leaders to focus on foreign policy while 7% said job security. Most of our respondents skewed towards the Democratic party. Amongst those who were explicit, 577 said they were Bernie Sanders supporters while just 53 said they were voting for Hillary Clinton. A further 81 respondents saying they would vote for Trump. Note: quotes have been lightly edited for grammar and brevity."
"The UK has no policies in place to meet more than half of the carbon emission cuts required by law by 2030, the government’s official advisers warned on Thursday, the same day ministers committed to the target.  The advisers also warned that the UK’s Brexit vote had thrown some EU-linked climate policies into doubt.  The Committee on Climate Change’s (CCC) annual progress report said emissions from electricity generation were falling fast, but that pollution from transport was rising and that action on cutting carbon emissions from homes had gone backwards. The alert comes the day after energy secretary Amber Rudd said the UK’s vote to leave the EU could make it harder to tackle climate change, which she said is a “serious long-term risk to our economic and national security”.  The energy industry, including the National Grid, has also warned that Brexit is likely to lead to higher bills for customers and lower energy security for the nation. The CCC said that uncertainty over climate policy had delayed projects and increased costs even before the Brexit vote, which spooked some investors further. The government went some way to reassuring investors by announcing on Thursday that it had accepted the advice of the CCC to cut emissions by 57% by 2030, compared to 1990. But Matthew Bell, CCC chief executive, said progress to date had been mixed.  National carbon emissions have fallen by over 4.5% a year since 2012, but almost entirely due to increases in green electricity from renewables and lower coal use, with virtually no reductions in the rest of the economy. “In those other areas, policy has either changed or gone backwards,” Bell said. “Buildings are probably the biggest gap right now, where we called very clearly in 2015 for a new strategy for low-carbon heating and efficiency efficiency. The best way to keep consumers’ bills low and to tackle climate change is to make sure houses are properly insulated.” However, the CCC found the rate of installing insulation in homes has fallen up to 90% and the government scrapped plans for new homes to be zero carbon.  “The last thing we need is to be building homes we know we are going to have to retrofit in 10-15 years time, because that will inevitably be more expensive,” Bell said. On Wednesday, the government said it was cutting support for energy efficiency from £870m to £640m after 2017. Before the EU referendum, ministers had committed to produce an emissions reduction plan by the end of 2016 to plug the gaps identified by the CCC and acknowledged by Rudd in November. But the political turmoil following the Brexit vote is set to make this more difficult to deliver. Barry Gardiner, Labour’s shadow energy and climate change secretary, said: “Today’s report sends a red alert that the Tories’ energy policies are dangerously inadequate and are sending the UK woefully off track to meet our climate targets. The Conservatives’ repeated attacks on clean energy over the past year have opened up a 50% shortfall to meet our carbon budgets beyond 2030.” He said an emissions reduction plan in 2011 had failed to plug gaps identified at that time. A spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “We have already made great strides towards our target of an 80% reduction by 2050 but there remains work to do. We are investing in innovation to secure cheap and clean energy that our families and businesses can rely on in the long term.” Sue Armstrong Brown, at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “Yesterday, Amber Rudd was unequivocal that a tough stance on climate change will be an essential quality in the next Conservative leader. The CCC’s report today makes clear that a robust emissions reduction plan will be the first test of that leadership.”  Bell said the nation’s carbon targets were set in UK law by the climate change act and are not at all linked to EU legislation.  But he added: “What is undoubtedly the case is that a lot of the mechanisms we were using to tackle climate change were linked to the EU, like the EU emissions trading scheme that governs the power sector and heavy industry and emissions standards for vehicles. That is now thrown into doubt, and those were relatively efficient ways of trying to achieve emissions reductions.” “So the question is, post-Brexit, how do we ensure that we continue to be able to pursue climate change policies as efficiently as possible,” Bell said. “That is certainly an added complexity we did not have before.” The CCC will now examine the impacts of Brexit in detail but Bell said: “In general, reductions in your ability to trade is likely to increase costs.” Brexit might also present some opportunities for better climate policies, he said, for example in how the farming subsidies are used: “Arguably, after the vote, the government has even more control over low carbon policy.” Some of the strongest criticism in the CCC report was of the government’s abandonment of a £1bn competition to spur the development of carbon capture and storage technology (CCS), which will be needed to trap and bury emissions. The CCC and others have warned that tackling climate change will cost twice as much without CCS. “We know CCS is a crucial component of meeting our ultimate 2050 objective” of an 80% cut in emissions, Bell said, adding the cancellation was a big setback and that a new plan was urgently needed. He said CCS was also an opportunity for the UK, which has expertise and storage potential in its North Sea oil and gas industry: “The UK may even in future be earning money from CCS.”"
"Across the country, the Guardian has been asking American voters about what really matters to them in this presidential year – in questions online, in person as they went to the polls, and in discussion groups on campuses, in restaurants and in their homes. Resoundingly, the largest group of participants pointed to climate change. More than 1,500 American voters gave us insight into the issues they care about most as part of the Guardian’s new Voices of America series – starting today – which aims to highlight the way key issues have been ignored or under-played during a primary season when trivial personal attacks seemed to take precedence over substantial debate of issues that matter.

The $1.1bn craft braved intense radiation and fields of space rocks in what was described as an extremely complex manoeuvre, with the craft first having to slow and then turn off its engines to enter the orbit of the largest planet in the solar system at exactly the right moment. Juno’s success prompted joy at Nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory in Pasadena, California. “We just did the hardest thing Nasa has ever done,” said Scott Bolton, principle investigator of the Juno mission. ‘Welcome to Jupiter’: Nasa mission puts Juno in orbit after five-year journey Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton remain locked in a war of words over a tweet featuring the Democratic candidate which her Republican rival subsequently deleted. The dispute centers on an image of Clinton over a six-pointed star resembling the Star of David, and a carpet of $100 bills. Clinton campaign spokesperson Sarah Bard called the image “blatantly” antisemitic. Trump accused the media of dishonesty and said that linking the star with antisemitism was “ridiculous”. The Trump campaign’s social media director Dan Scavino posted a statement on Trump’s Facebook page on Monday evening saying that he had lifted it from an anti-Clinton Twitter feed and had never intended to offend anyone, according to the Associated Press. Donald Trump blames ‘dishonest media’ in furor over ‘antisemitic’ Clinton tweet Two weeks after Democrats staged a 26-hour congressional sit-in to demand action on gun control, Republican speaker of the House Paul Ryan has agreed to hold a vote on a single gun-related bill that would allow the attorney general to delay the sale of a gun to a person on the terror watchlist for three days. The measure has already been slammed by Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi as “toothless”. Meanwhile in Patchogue, Long Island, the group Gays Against Guns, formed after the Pulse nighclub massacre in Orlando last month, held its first Fourth of July march. Gun control fight returns to Congress as Speaker Ryan allows vote on one bill In one of a series of attacks across Saudi Arabia on Monday, suicide bombers killed four members of security forces outside the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina, one of the holiest sites in Islam. The attack, coming as the holy month of Ramadan ends, appeared to be coordinated with a series of other strikes, including an attempted bombing near the US consulate in Jeddah, that are consistent with the modus operandi of the Islamic State. In Baghdad, the death toll from a bomb attack claimed by Isis in a marketplace on Saturday climbed toward 200.

Current favourite Theresa May has refused to promise that EU nationals will be able to remain in UK ahead of a reciprocal agreement from the EU. Andrea Leadsom, Michael Gove, Stephen Crabb and Liam Fox are also running. Yesterday, Leadsom won the backing of Brexit leader Boris Johnson, who had been favorite to take over from David Cameron as prime minister before his shock exit from the race last week. Meanwhile, Alain Juppé, the favourite to win the French presidential election next year, has said Britain needs to leave the European Union as quickly as possible. “When you get divorced, you do not get to stay at home,” he said.

"African American religious leaders have added their weight to calls for action on climate change, with one of the largest and oldest black churches in the US warning that black people are disproportionally harmed by global warming and fossil fuel pollution. The African Methodist Episcopal church has passed its first resolution in its 200-year history devoted to climate change, calling for a swift transition to renewable energy.  “We can move away from the dirty fuels that make us sick and shift toward safe, clean energy like wind and solar that help make every breath our neighbors and families take a healthy one,” states the resolution, which also points to research showing that black children are four times as likely as white children to die from asthma.  The resolution was passed at the church’s general conference in Philadelphia, where more than 30,000 members gathered. The AME church, the oldest independent Protestant denomination founded by black people in the world, has about 7,000 congregations and 2.5m members. “Damage to our climate puts the health of children, elderly, and those with chronic illnesses at greater risk and disproportionately impacts African Americans. We believe it is our duty to commit to taking action and promoting solutions that will help make our families and communities healthier and stronger,” stated Bishop John White, president of the council of bishops of the AME church. The resolution follows an open letter sent by African American clergy last year that called for political leaders to take “bold action to address climate change”. The letter states: “The voices of communities whose inhabitants look like us often are dismissed or disregarded. But the world cannot afford to silence us, and we cannot afford to be – and will not be – silent. Climate change most directly impacts the poor and marginalized, but ultimately, everyone is in jeopardy.” Jacquelyn Dupont-Walker, director of AME church’s social action commission, said that will “hold elected officials accountable” over climate change. “In communities of color, the church has been the voice on these kind of issues and we need to continue to be that voice,” she told the Guardian. “Many people may have heard that climate change is some sort of political trick – but when we speak, people will listen to us. We have an obligation to make this a focal point.” Dupont-Walker said that the church’s voter mobilization campaign will work throughout the 2016 election cycle to question candidates on climate change. Local officials and landlords will also be put under pressure over inadequate housing and infrastructure that helps spread pollution to black communities. According to the NAACP, African Americans emit far less carbon dioxide per person compared with white people and yet will bear the brunt of heat-related deaths, due to the concentration of black people in cities. Faith leaders across the world have expressed alarm over climate change, with Pope Francis warning last year that “we may well be leaving to coming generations debris, desolation and filth”. Some churches have backed the campaign to divest from fossil fuels.  June was the warmest on record in both the US and globally, marking the 14th consecutive month of record-breaking heat worldwide."
"Shale gas production will break the UK’s climate change targets unless there is stricter regulation now, according to the government’s official advisers.  More action to cut carbon emissions in other areas would also be needed to cope with full-scale fracking, despite the government already struggling to meet existing commitments.  But the government says it will take no regulatory action in response to the report from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), arguing that the current regime is “adaptive” and will change if fracking companies go into full scale production. It says it is important to take advantage of the “fantastic opportunity” of fracking and that it is determined to meet its carbon targets. David Cameron has said the government is “going all out” for fracking, which ministers argue can boost UK business and reduce the nation’s reliance on imported energy. But plans to frack in Lancashire and Yorkshire have attracted large protests from campaigners concerned about potential pollution, disruption and health impacts.  On Thursday, campaigners applied to the high court for a judicial review of North Yorkshire county council’s recent decision to allow fracking exploration. Ministers will decide the fate of the application in Lancashire, which the county council rejected, by October.  The CCC report, published on Thursday, concluded that shale gas production on a significant scale would breach the nation’s targets for emissions cuts unless three tests are passed.  First, strict regulation is needed to ensure leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, are kept to a minimum. Second, shale gas must replace imported gas, not be burned in addition. Third, emissions from the production of shale gas itself must be offset by more carbon cuts elsewhere, such as increasing the number of electric vehicles. The report found that fracking regulation today is below the “minimum necessary” to meet the first test: “It certainly requires that a strong regulatory framework is put in place now.”  Prof Jim Skea, at Imperial College London and one of the authors of the CCC report, said: “We need stronger and clearer regulation. UK environmental policy allows quite a lot of discretion to the regulator and, depending on how things develop, it would be necessary to be more precise if you are to regulate emissions effectively. “Existing uncertainties over the nature of the exploitable shale gas resource and the potential size of a UK industry make it impossible to know how difficult it will be to meet the tests.” An official from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) said: “We believe our strong regulatory regime and the government’s determination to meet our carbon budgets mean those tests can be and will be met.  “We have a very well developed but adaptive regulatory system which allows regulation to grow with the challenges it faces.” Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister and Tory leadership candidate, said: “Shale gas is a fantastic opportunity, which could create thousands of jobs and a secure homegrown energy source that we can rely on for decades to come. We’ve already put measures in place to limit and monitor emissions that meet the conditions set out in this report.” Fracking is largely regulated by the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive. An official from the EA said: “It is a flexible approach, so as techniques get better, we require the best available techniques to minimise and monitor emissions and we are confident we can regulate the industry effectively.”  The CCC said a single regulator might be needed to oversee fracking, as did a 2012 report from the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering. But the Decc official said this would not happen “for the foreseeable future” and “is not in general an approach the government usually favours”. Meeting the UK’s legally binding climate targets will be more challenging and potentially more expensive with a significant fracking industry, the CCC found, especially without carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to trap and bury emissions. The government cancelled a £1bn CCS programme in November, and without CCS, the nation’s gas use will have to fall 80% by 2050, compared with 50% with CCS. Fracking results in emissions not only when the gas is burned, but also from the operations needed to extract and transport it. These could be 11m tonnes a year in 2030 of CO2 equivalent, 3% of the nation’s entire emissions.  “You would need to do other things to offset these emissions,” said Skea. But the CCC warned in June that the government had no policies in place to meet more than half the emission cuts required by law by that date. Ministers have promised a plan to plug this gap by the end of 2016.  Labour’s Barry Gardiner, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, said: “The CCC report lays out three fundamental tests [but] the government has decided to do precisely nothing to increase protection for the public or to deliver security for our climate targets. On this basis, it is currently neither safe nor reasonable to approve any fracking in Britain.” But Prof Averil Macdonald, chair of the fracking trade body UK Onshore Oil and Gas, disagreed: “Today’s report confirms what we have long maintained – that shale gas production is compatible with the country’s need to reduce emissions. As an industry, we look forward to continuing to work proactively with regulators to minimise fugitive emissions from our operations.” She said that with North Sea production declining, there was considerable room for shale gas to replace imported gas. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, said: “The idea that fracking can be squared with the UK’s climate targets is based on a tower of assumptions, caveats and conditions on which there is zero certainty of delivery. The government now faces a clear choice between promoting this climate-wrecking industry or backing clean, homegrown, reliable renewable energy and smart technologies instead.”"
"Investing in a large-scale wind farm is a better guarantee of profits than multiple, small, off-grid renewables projects but without the latter, argues a recent report, the sustainable development goal of low-carbon energy access for all will never be met. It is estimated (pdf) close to $50bn a year is needed to achieve universal access to electricity and clean cooking facilities by 2030. Yet traditional forms of climate finance are not working.  The result, according to the report (pdf) from the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), is major bottlenecks in funding for many small-scale renewable energy services such as solar home systems, mini-grids and clean cooking facilities. For the multilateral lenders and UN agencies which control the bulk of climate finance, decentralised projects are “just not as bankable”, says Neha Rai, a senior researcher at IIED and co-author of the report. But the idea that off-grid projects are not economically viable is misplaced, argues Edward Hanrahan, CEO of climate development finance firm ClimateCare. The delivery of a domestic solar project, for example, also provides an opportunity to sell other low-carbon consumer products to people that now have energy access. Take Pamoja Life, one of ClimateCare’s investment projects in east Africa. It’s difficult to make the sale of low-energy, efficient cookstoves economically attractive to very poor people, so Pamoja Life provides a distribution line for affordable, off-grid solar lighting and other low-carbon consumer products, alongside affordable cookstoves. This approach helps spread the cost over a number of goods, says Hanrahan: “It also wraps in non-climate benefits too. We need to think about climate finance as being not just about climate. Something like Pamoja Life is delivering improved development and health impacts too.” ClimateCare has used this multiple impact argument with investors to give single projects several outcomes. A government agency might be interested in funding a household solar initiative for its impact on emissions reduction, for example, while a private corporation might put in money because of the extra study hours that children gain. “As a result you’ve got a couple of uncorrelated revenue streams, which improves the resilience of the project and makes it less risky for commercial investors,” says Hanrahan. “You can also have income streams in multiple currencies, thus reducing currency risk.” Currency volatility is one of the biggest risks for decentralised energy projects, says Hanrahan. Small scale clean-energy companies often take foreign-currency loans to finance the bulk purchase of renewable equipment. They, in turn, sell on locally and the mismatch between the two currencies imposes a potential stress on small businesses and makes planning more difficult. Major funders can help make sure more off-grid projects are successful, argues Rai, through a greater willingness to make grants rather than just loans.  At present, climate financiers overwhelmingly opt for concessional loans (loans granted to low-income countries at below market interest rates) for utility-scale projects: a low-risk way of assuring short-term returns on their investments. Yet grants can kick-start decentralised projects, Rai says, helping create an initial local market for clean energy products and services. After that, the logic runs, private investment should begin to flow. Even if carbon finance can’t be made to work, all is not lost for off-grid renewable energy and the SDG target. Indian solar firm Frontier Markets, for example, is working with a number of philanthropic groups to create a low-interest loan which gives them the capital to access finance from local banks and in turn make loans to the people and businesses selling their solar products. “We have also partnered with non-profits in Rajasthan that have been accessing local government grants and development grants to facilitate rotational loans [which are paid back into a fund to be loaned out again], which enable low-income women to buy our solar products,” says Ajaita Shah, chief executive of Frontier Markets. Crowdfunding is another increasingly popular financing strategy for grassroots clean energy, although not a particularly certain one. The WindAid Institute, a US-registered charity working for the past decade to bring decentralised wind-generated electricity to remote communities in Peru, relies primarily on income from fees paid by foreign volunteers, plus ad hoc donations and grants. The charity recently ran a $35,000 Kickstarter campaign to complete the construction of a local training facility. Only about two-thirds of the requested amount was raised. “With Kickstarter, the all or nothing rule meant we got nothing,” says WindAid’s spokesperson Beth Brown. “But many backers have offered to convert to a donation so we already have enough funds to do the next stage of the build later this month.”            "
"On the day that London drowned, 16-year-old Shirley Orchard was serving customers bars of chocolate and packets of cigarettes at her father’s shop on Canvey Island. The town, which sits on the underbelly of Essex, where the North Sea becomes the River Thames, had been teased by bursts of showers and sunshine throughout the day. By dusk the clouds had squeezed themselves dry. Orchard served her last customer of the day: a woman who, after seven years of trying for a baby, had recently given birth. After Orchard had closed up the shop, she began to walk home, her stride stretched by a chasing breeze. The wind had been whipped to life two days earlier by a depression off the south-west coast of Iceland. From there, it began its journey towards Scotland. Soon after first light, on 31 January 1953, the captain of the ferry Princess Victoria ignored a storm warning and set sail from the Scottish port of Stranraer. As the ship – heavy with cargo, crew and passengers – cleared the mouth of the sheltered Loch Ryan, huge waves butted and then breached its stern doors. At 2pm, the order came to abandon ship. One-hundred-and-thirty-two people died, including the deputy prime minister of Northern Ireland and every woman and child aboard.  At first, the storm appeared to be heading on towards Denmark. Then, unexpectedly, the North Sea winds aligned with a rising spring tide and, instead, shooed the squall down England’s east coast. When surge water breached the Wash, the square-mouthed bay in East Anglia, authorities in Lincolnshire attempted to issue a flood warning to caution cities likely to be affected. The message never left the county where now, in patchwork fields and under scribbles of wire, telephone poles lay toppled. The storm battered unwitting coastal towns in Suffolk, Essex and Kent. Fifteen people drowned in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, when a six-foot wave burst through the town centre. In the nearby seaside town of Hunstanton, a train was forced to stop because of bungalows on the line. Further south, in Canvey Island, Shirley Orchard awoke to screams from the houseboats moored in the creek at the end of her road. Canvey Island had long been considered flood-ready. But after centuries of reinforcement, its protective walls failed – 141 million gallons of water, backed by shrieking winds, mounted the blockade. Residents who attempted to flee were struck by shoulder high seawater, timber, dustbins and other debris. Orchard and her family sheltered upstairs. Those staying in nearby bungalows were trapped. Some punched holes through the ceilings of their buildings and climbed on to the roofs, pulling their children after them to escape the torrent. Fists bloodied, they then huddled for warmth, and waited to be rescued. At an event held to mark the 60th anniversary of the flood, Orchard recalled how she fled Canvey Island in the middle of the night on the back of an army truck during an evacuation of 13,000 residents. Elsie Foster, the mother that Orchard had served just a few hours earlier in the shop, and Foster’s husband, Ernie had died in each other’s arms. Their eight-week-old baby, Linda, was found alive in her bobbing pram. The storm tide hastened towards the capital. At midnight, the BBC broadcast a message from the police, warning of an “exceptionally high tide” in the Thames. Cars equipped with loudspeakers were dispatched from New Scotland Yard to issue flood warnings in the streets, followed by reserve motorcyclists who blew whistles to alert people to the danger. At London Bridge, in the early hours of the morning, the water reached its highest level ever recorded, six feet higher than anyone had predicted. Higher than the surge that flooded the Tate gallery and drowned 14 in 1928. Higher than the 1809 flood, when the central arches of Wallingford Bridge collapsed. Higher than the December flood of 1663, in which, according to Samuel Pepys, “all Whitehall … drowned”. Higher than the flood of 1236, when people were seen rowing in boats through the palace of Westminster. The water reached the top of the parapet that runs along the Victoria embankment, where tourists now photograph one another beneath the spokes of the London Eye. Then, unexpectedly, the wind turned and the surge began to retreat. At 4.36am, New Scotland Yard issued a new instruction: “Danger of flooding now past, notify public accordingly; withdraw watchers and loudspeaker cars.” By morning, across Britain more than 40,000 people were left homeless and 160,000 acres of agricultural land had been ruined by saltwater; 9,000 sheep had been killed, along with 34,000 poultry, 2,600 pigs, 1,100 cattle, and 70 horses; 531 people were dead. In the aftermath of the storm, which came to be known as “The Great Tide”, lavish measures, such as the £534m Thames Barrier, were implemented to protect London and its surrounding counties. We slept easier. The storm faded from the nation’s collective memory. Few Londoners today know that the capital was the site of a natural disaster of such magnitude. Seven decades on, however, government commissions, scientists, futurologists and people once considered wild-eyed scaremongers are converging on the view that floods of 1953 levels of severity are likely to become commonplace. The global temperature has risen by 1C in the past century. Fourteen of the hottest years on record occurred in the past 15 years. And 2015 was the hottest since records began in 1880. Individual countries will feel the effects of the change in individual ways. Saudi Arabia will have to contend with stronger and more frequent heatwaves. Bangladesh risks being wiped off the map by rising sea levels. The sea that surrounds Britain is expected to rise by up to 50cm in the next century, a change that poses obvious risks for an island. But perhaps the biggest worry is that it will get a lot wetter. This seems counterintuitive. Why, as the world grows warmer, would Britain grow wetter? As temperatures rise, ice caps melt and the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere increases, so too does the risk of “intense precipitation events”, the scientific jargon for heavy rain. The latest government figures state that the likelihood of floods in the UK has almost doubled in the last century. We do not need to take their word for it. In 2007, flooding in Britain affected 55,000 homes and killed 13 people. In December 2015, floods caused by the amiably named storms Desmond and Eva caused £175m worth of damage to homes and businesses in Cumbria. The public bill for fixing the infrastructural wreckage – the broken bridges and ruptured roads – is currently estimated at £250m. Dredging rivers, deforestation and unchecked housing development in floodplains may have exacerbated the human cost of Britain’s floods, but climate change is responsible for the rise in extreme flooding events. Worse is to come. Lord Krebs is a chairman within the Climate Change Committee (CCC), a group commissioned by the government to, in part, evaluate the environmental risks we now face. Krebs is so assured of the UK’s unpreparedness for disaster, that, in an interview on Radio 4 in December, he issued an urgent warning. “The biggest single risk from climate change for this country is the increased likelihood of flooding,” he said. “The government needs to rethink its whole strategy of managing flood risk. Our money should be going into flood protections and doing everything to protect the vulnerable land beneath sea level. There is so much of it.” On 12 July, Krebs’s team will publish a crucial report – one that will surely struggle for attention thanks to the prospect of more immediate disasters – which outlines the most urgent risks that Britain faces from climate change. The risk assessment report draws upon three years of research and analysis, involving hundreds of academics and scientists. Some of the research seen by the Guardian puts the current cost of UK residential flood damage at £340m per year, a figure that will rise to £428m as the average global temperature rises by 2C, the limit that numerous world leaders agreed upon in December at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, held in Paris. The experts consulted by Krebs’s team claim that 180,000 more British homes will be at risk of flooding by 2050. According to this research, around 20% of the total length of coastal defences in England, which protect around 2m homes at risk from sea flooding, could be vulnerable to failure if sea levels rise by just half a metre. A one-metre sea level rise around the British coast will place 2,000 square kilometres of the UK – an area roughly the size of Herefordshire – at risk of flooding during a storm surge. Even if “all worthwhile flood-defence schemes were to be built,” a spokeswoman for the CCC told me, “more people and properties [will be] exposed to high levels of flood risk by mid-century”. Individuals and businesses are, increasingly, having to bear the cost. In some areas of Cumbria, after three major floods in a decade, insurance excesses now reach £25,000. The Association of British Insurers predicts that a major flooding event in London could have economic consequences comparable to the recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis. For years the UK government has debated whether or not to replace the Trident nuclear programme. Its renewal will cost a minimum of £205bn. The most likely threat to the defence of the realm may not be a nuclear strike, however, but the waves that our deterrent lurks beneath. Following storms Desmond and Eva, the UK government pledged to spend a further £700m on flood defences, bringing the total to £3bn – 1/68th of the cost of Trident. Will it be enough? Scientists – many of whom worked on the CCC report – have devised models to predict what is likely to happen when a storm of the magnitude of The Great Tide of 1953 hits us. Unlike the fault lines that menace Tokyo and the Californian coast, Britain’s pending catastrophe will not be caused by a single set of forces. Rather the threat comes from a complex set of conditions and possibilities: surge tides, fat seas, rivers swollen with rainwater, and debilitated infrastructure. The groundwork of these researchers and modellers, as well as the known weaknesses of our current infrastructure, produce a snapshot of a possible future. We cannot know for certain what will happen, but using this research, we can imagine the Great Tide of 2026. Scotland will be first hit. A gale pushes the rising tide into the mouth of the Firth of Forth. Unhampered by any storm barrier – plans for which were rejected by the Scottish government in 2007, due to the impact it would have on shipping – the five-metre tide will batter the oil and gas facilities, food distribution depots and power station that line the estuary. The nearby petrochemical complex at Grangemouth, which handles 40% of UK oil supplies, will be flooded. Swaths of Scotland will be left without power, while broken bridges and choked roads leave much of the country without fuel. Food shortages will continue for months. In Yorkshire, as the storm moves south, homes as far as 10 miles inland will be flooded. Many people, unable to afford their insurance excesses, will be left homeless. As the tide continues its rampage south, in the Norfolk village of Happisburgh, those houses not already claimed by the sea over the previous decade will be demolished by waves. In the following months, residents of coastal towns, villages and cities up and down the country will probably head towards higher land. The housing market in coastal areas will collapse, while house prices further inland will continue to rise steeply. As the Great Tide rounds on Essex and begins its rush toward the capital, Canvey Island’s fortified defences will this time hold strong. London, however, may prove less resolute. If the storm strikes after a period of heavy rain, which will have swollen tributaries in west London, the Thames Barrier will not be able to cope. The fatal conjunction of coastal, river and surface water flooding will break the Thames’ banks for the first time in 70 years. If that happens, water will stream into hundreds of new houses built in Thurrock – which lies on London’s flood plains – to ease the housing crisis of the early 21st century. In keeping with a stark warning issued by the Environment Agency in 2012, many of the city’s best known monuments and institutions, including the Houses of Parliament, Whitehall, Canary Wharf, Westminster Abbey and the Tower of London, along with 500,000 Greater London homes, will be flooded. More than 50 tube stations, including Waterloo, King’s Cross and London Bridge, will be filled with water. Major electricity grid sites around the capital will be taken offline, as the already strained healthcare system struggles to cope with the influx of the sick and injured. The following week, the London FTSE will collapse to new lows. Russian oligarchs will watch news footage of the water lapping at their property investments in dismay. The threat to property will not solely come from the elements. As in 2015, when local police forces hired the services of private security guards to patrol the houses of those in Cumbria who had been displaced by floods, looting will become a major problem as the water finally retreats. The 1953 flood inspired drastic action to avoid just such a scenario. A report led by Sir Hermann Bondi, professor of mathematics at King’s College, London claimed that another surge tide could fill the underground system with seawater, ruin telephone exchanges, disrupt gas and electric services and paralyse London for as long as six months. The cost of such damage stretched into billions – a bill that, as one government official said at the time, “would not count human misery and loss of life”. Today, the estimate has risen to an incomprehensible £200bn. It was 17 years before a solution was settled upon by the Greater London Council. The idea was proposed by Charles Draper, an engineer from Rendel, Palmer & Tritton, one of scores of companies that, following the 1953 flood, hoped to find a solution to the question of how to keep London safe from a repeat attack. Every December, Draper would convert his garage in Horsham into an impromptu bar, and invite friends around for a celebration. One year, Draper was fiddling with a gas tap prior to one of these parties, when inspiration struck. He saw in the simple design of the tap, which swivels in its casing to open and close the air flow, a principle that could be scaled up, even to a size that could tame a river. Draper’s design – six gas-tap style gates under stainless steel shells that span the river in a phalanx – was chosen from many. On 8 May 1984, not long after Draper’s death from cancer, the Queen officially opened the Thames Barrier. At the time of the barrier’s construction, it was estimated that it would provide London with protection from surge tide floods from the sea until 2030, but a study by the Environment Agency, published in 2009 claimed the barrier, if properly maintained, could in fact provide sufficient protection till 2070. The estimates may have been correct – although there is some disagreement among experts – but unforeseen demands are being made on the Thames Barrier today. In 2013-14, it was closed no fewer than 50 times, the maximum recommended number of annual operations to avoid the risk of mechanical failure. Previously, the barrier had closed only 124 times in total since it began operating in 1982. The steep rise in closures is because the barrier is now being used to manage flooding in ways for which it was not designed. Fewer than 10 of last year’s closures were a result of surge tides, such as the 1953 flood. The remainder were to deal with fluvial flooding, when an excess of rainwater causes a river to swell over its banks. To deal with this problem, the barrier closes at low tide. This creates a reservoir upstream into which rain-heavy tributaries pour and, finally, offload into the English Channel. “The barrier is there to protect London from a surge from the sea,” says Dick Tappin, an engineer who worked alongside Draper on the construction of the Thames Barrier. “It is not there to protect London from heavy rainwater.” As the events of 1953 demonstrate, the consequences of a flood from the sea are far greater than the consequences of river flooding. Nevertheless, a combination of the two would test the system in unprecedented ways. “If London would receive the comparable amount of rainfall that caused floods in England in 2007, the consequences are expected to be much more significant,” says Dr Ana Mijic from the department of civil and environmental engineering at Imperial College London. Mijic believes there could be “in the tens of billions of pounds in property and infrastructure damage, and high probability of severe impact on human health and lives”. Lord Krebs, a gaunt man with a brush of thick grey hair, is accustomed to bucking expectations. His father, Hans Krebs, who won the Nobel prize in physiology a few months after the 1953 flood, expected his son to follow his example by going into the medical profession. Midway through Krebs’s interview to study medicine at Trinity College, Oxford, where his father was a fellow, he revealed that he wanted to study zoology instead. In 2001, after a distinguished career as a lecturer in zoology at Oxford and abroad, Krebs, chairman of the newly formed Food Standards Agency, clashed with the government. He claimed that the authorities had not adequately understood the risks posed by the foot-and-mouth outbreak. Krebs was proven appallingly right – the epidemic would result in the slaughter of 10 million sheep and cattle. In 2003, Krebs caused further controversy when he stated that so-called organic food has no benefits compared with food grown on conventional farms. In 2007, Krebs became an independent crossbench peer in the House of Lords. Now, as a chairman of the CCC, Krebs, who is also president of the British Science Association, is proving unpopular with government ministers across the political spectrum. “The government and the public don’t understand what exactly is meant by risk of flooding,” he told me when we met earlier this year. “We talk about a one-in-a-hundred-year risk of catastrophic flooding. But if a hundred places in the country carry that risk, the likelihood is that one of them will flood every year. It may not be you this year, but it will be someone, somewhere.” Last winter’s floods have resulted in some action, Krebs concedes. The government has instigated two reviews, one looking at short-term measures to protect major cities from floods, and another taking a longer-term perspective, asking how we can manage water catchment, ensuring it disperses into rivers, dams and groundwater systems. It is crucial work. “Current defences are being overtopped with devastating effects,” he said. Despite these efforts, Krebs believes that we are missing crucial opportunities to better prepare the country for the effects of climate change. For example, he believes that developers should retain some liability for flood damage when they build new homes in flood plains (where so many of the UK’s towns and cities are located). “Right now, a developer can build 20 houses and walk away, while the hapless person who buys the house must carry all of the cost when it’s flooded,” said Krebs. Krebs also worries that because last winter’s floods occurred in the north, there may be less momentum to act than if they had hit the south-east. “There may be a south-centric view that, if these things happen in the north it’s less significant,” he said. “It’s often the case that it takes a crisis to create a change of mindset.” Until London ceases to be safe and dry, in other words, action may remain sluggish. While Mori polls show that 70% of UK residents who live in areas of flooding are aware of the risk to their homes, an increasing number of people are unwilling to wait for disaster before they take action. Lincoln Miles, 22, runs the UK’s only survivalist store, Preppers Shop UK, in Bedford, which opened its doors in July 2014. “I think we are a few years away from a major social breakdown and not too far away from a major climate breakdown,” Miles told me recently. “We’re teetering on a social knife edge and at some point soon something is going to snap.” Preppers stocks a wide range of supplies, many of which are intended to help a person survive in the event of extreme flooding. In some corners of the shop, it looks a bit like a DIY store, complete with shovels, saws, high-visibility jackets and inflatable dinghies. Elsewhere, it is closer to a post-apocalyptic bunker, with gas masks, crossbows, hunting knives and industrial-sized tins of beans. According to Miles, his customers, most of whom wish to remain anonymous, range from ex-military servicemen and bushcraft enthusiasts to lawyers, teachers and pilots. “Everyone can be a prepper, and preppers come from all walks of life,” he said. “We are currently growing at an exponential rate.” Miles, whose style could be described as lumberjack chic – sumptuous beard, plaid shirt with the top three buttons undone, black bandana – became interested in the survivalist community in 2013, after reading an article about prepping in America. “I became obsessed with prepping,” he said. “I was constantly reading Facebook pages and forums.” As Miles began to assemble his own bug-out bag – a rucksack filled with basic items for survival such as water-purification tablets and first-aid kits – he grew frustrated that there was no one-stop shop for the items he needed. Later that month he launched Preppers UK online. Prepping, an idea imported from America, has been viewed by many in the UK as the hobby of cranks and weirdos. But Miles, who claims to be “fully prepared” for a variety of disaster scenarios, is unmoved by the sceptics. “These days people are realising that the world is vulnerable,” he said. “The emergency services aren’t always there to protect us. People are increasingly taking the future into their own hands.” In that respect at least, Lord Krebs shares Miles’s view. He believes that preparedness for disaster is not the sole responsibility of the state. “There are measures that can be taken to reduce vulnerability,” Krebs told me. Even if you’re not quite ready to order a bug-out bag, everyone, Krebs believes, should consider the water resistance of flooring materials. “Everyone,” he added, “could raise their electrics off the skirting board.” While it is relatively easy for individuals to prepare for a week or two without electricity, buttressing national infrastructure against the threat of floods takes much longer and requires not only money, but political will. As the authors of a 2004 government report into flooding state: “If we want to alter land use in flood plains and alongside rivers within cities, it could take decades for changes in planning policies to take effect.” Knowing exactly when, where and how to spend money in order to prepare a country for drastic change requires input from scientists with a certain talent for predicting the future. Professor Richard Betts, a Met Office Fellow and chair in climate impacts at the University of Exeter, is one such scientist. His predictions are relatively conservative. “Wheat yields may tend to increase in the north of the UK, possibly by up to 30%,” he says, of the effects upon the UK of a 2C rise in average global temperature, “while yields in the south may decline by the same amount”. Betts agrees that, in the long term, the “most significant and observable” effect of climate change on Britain will probably be coastal flooding. The value of housing under threat of inundation will drop, he says, while insurance premiums will rise. The sweltering summer of 2003, when roads melted, train lines buckled, the London Eye closed and a record temperature of 38.5C was recorded in Brogdale in Kent, will become “a regular occurrence under a two-degree world,” he says. (The Met Office estimates that “summers as hot as 2003 could happen every other year by 2050, as a result of climate change due to human activities”.) Health services will need to adapt accordingly. Krebs is less conservative in his estimations. He is, in fact, concerned that the disaster models do not go far enough. Even if fully implemented, he believes that the international agreements made in Paris last year to halt the global rise in temperature, will, in reality, only take us somewhere closer to a 3C rise by 2050. The higher the temperature rises, the greater the effect on the sea level. “We need to ask some difficult questions,” Krebs told me. “Most of the assumptions are based on a 2C rise in average global temperature. I think we should be looking at four.” Even as ice melts, seas surge, coastlines retreat, insurance premiums rise and the rain falls and falls and falls, we have grown numb to the dread statistics: 2C or 4C – who cares? It’s all catastrophic. Today, the baby-boomer’s vision of future skies busy with flying cars seems appallingly naive. Not because technology has fallen short of those optimistic expectations, but because many people do not envision a future of progress. Instead, the future we imagine is one of decline, or, at the least, perilous change. There may, however, be hope. At 96 years old, James Lovelock is perhaps the best known of all apocalyptic scientists. His 2006 book, The Revenge of Gaia, states that we are in the midst of “a global decline into a chaotic world ruled by brutal warlords on a devastated earth”. Nevertheless, Lovelock remains sceptical about our ability to predict the future accurately. “I just don’t think that mathematical models are able to predict the future that well,” he said. “All sorts of things could happen. There could be a big volcano, something totally unexpected, that cools the whole darned lot off. It can happen.” Then again, we may not be so lucky. “We live 70 yards from the sea,” Lovelock told me from his home on England’s south coast. “It’s rising but you wouldn’t notice it yet. And even if it rose by two or three metres, all it would do is take the road at the end of our garden away.” He paused. “Oh, and London and New York too, of course.” Main photograph: Seaham harbour, County Durham in 2013.

"During last December and January, floods in the northern half of the UK cost insurance companies £1.3bn. Bridges and roads were destroyed, hundreds of homes and businesses were inundated, and many of these are still recovering. The government reacted by reversing earlier decisions to cut spending on flood defences and then hoped the problem would go away; but this is wishful thinking. The House of Commons environment audit committee that looked into the problem says the government is failing those in flood-prone areas in a number of ways. Apart from lack of any strategic thinking, ministers are failing to provide funds to maintain even existing flood barriers, leaving communities that think they are protected with an unacceptable risk.  The committee points out that with climate change there will be more extreme weather in the UK, with more frequent and deeper floods, yet ministers are making no preparation for this. The government is secretive about its plans and fails to support even those local authorities which attempt to prevent flooding. Companies that provide vital services such as electricity and water have no requirement to have a flood resilience plan, yet MPs believe these should be compulsory. But perhaps the most damning part of the report concerns the £700m of new funding for flood defences announced in this year’s budget. This was allocated not according to strict economic criteria but on the basis of “political calculation”. According to the committee, this could lead to “inefficiencies in flood investment, poor decision making and regionally unfair outcomes”. Translated, this means areas that vote Conservative, particularly in marginal seats, get new flood defences and the rest probably won’t.  "
"As we hit high-heat season in the Northern Hemisphere, it is useful to clarify tactics that can be used to help maintain healthy body temperatures. These tips are not commonly known and can be adopted by anyone, anywhere. While I am a climate scientist, my funded work is in the area of heat transfer, particularly in the human body. I work with medical companies to maintain healthy body temperatures during surgeries or other situations. I also deal with scald burns and I often serve in burn injury litigation. Here are some key tips. First, avoid hyperthermia in the first place – drink plenty of fluids, avoiding direct sunlight, trying to get a respite from heat each day, avoiding physical exertion during the hottest parts of the day are all great suggestions. But, if you need to lower a body temperature, Dr. Robert Huggins, VP of Research and Athlete Performance at the Korey Stringer Institute suggests:  The general rule is to cool as much of the body’s surface as possible …. the larger the area you cool and the colder the device you use to cool it the faster the cooling rate. An appropriate goal is to use a method that cools at a rate of 0.15°C per minute. This can typically be achieved by immersion techniques using a tub or other basin filled with ice cold water or via rotating cold ice towels over the body. During exercise if there is limited access to the entire body (e.g. football or fire-fighters), cooling the hands, face and feet will help, and if possible, use a fan to increase evaporation from these surfaces. However, when heat stroke is suspected, these strategies are not nearly as effective as whole body methods; opt for immersion cooling. So how do you know if someone is suffering from hyperthermia or heat stroke? A great resource is the Korey Stringer Institute, which lists many symptoms for heat stress such as fatigue, weakness, pale appearance, headache, nausea, vomiting, fainting, dizziness, and others. The heat stroke treatment they recommend, while geared toward athletes, is still useful for the rest of us.  The list removal of clothing and equipment, cooling of the athlete using 30 minutes of whole body immersion in cold water (or a cold shower), call for medical treatment, and other tips found here. A journal publication was published in 2010 that also recommended cold-water immersion for treatment of exertional heat stroke. That publication does warn that over cooling can lead to hypothermia, so care must be taken. In many actual situations, full body immersion isn’t possible. What can people do then? Well, there is extensive evidence that supports the cooling of the hands, face and feet. The technical term for these areas is glabrous (non-haired). These areas are excellent at transferring heat and in fact, the body can increase the blood flow to these regions which, when cooled, flows back to the body providing core cooling.  One paper looked at the impact of cooling athletes’ palms on their ability to recover between exercise sets. They found that “palm cooling hastened heat removal”. Another publication, just out in 2015 in the journal Wilderness and Environmental Medicine compared cold packs applied to the neck, groin and armpit with cold packs applied to the cheeks, palms and feet. That study found that applying cold packs to the cheeks, feet, and hands almost doubled the cooling effect. They write: Application of cold packs to glabrous skin surfaces was more effective for treating exercise-induced heat stress than the traditional CCP cooling intervention. This novel cooling technique may be beneficial as an adjunctive treatment for heat-related illness in the prehospital environment. These studies should be viewed as helpful however they often deal with lower temperature heat stress; for very high body temperatures, immersion is recommended. Another recent publication, this time in one of the top biomedical engineering journals, looked at heat transfer in people that were insulated, again they found effective cooling in individuals when the hand was targeted with 10°C (50°F) water. For people who are interested in learning more, a great resource is this 2014 PhD Dissertation from the University of Connecticut. That study looked at the effects of hand cooling and found that while it shows some promise, more research is needed, particular on the interactions of hand cooling with other factors."

"As the string of record-breaking global temperatures continues unabated, June 2016 marks the 14th consecutive month of record-breaking heat. According to two US agencies – Nasa and Noaa – June 2016 was 0.9C hotter than the average for the 20th century, and the hottest June in the record which goes back to 1880. It broke the previous record, set in 2015, by 0.02C.  The 14-month streak of record-breaking temperatures was the longest in the 137-year record. And it has been 40 years since the world saw a June that was below the 20th century average. The string of record-breaking monthly temperatures began in April 2015, and was pushed along by a powerful El Niño, where a splurge of warm water spreads across the Pacific Ocean. But the effects of El Niño have receded, and the effects of global warming are clear, said Nasa’s Gavin Schmidt. “While the El Niño event in the tropical Pacific this winter gave a boost to global temperatures from October onwards, it is the underlying trend which is producing these record numbers,” he said. Nasa’s Walt Meir said the global temperatures have been exacerbated by extreme temperatures over the Arctic. Warm temperatures there are pushing up the global average, as well a causing record-low amounts of sea ice. “It has been a record year so far for global temperatures, but the record high temperatures in the Arctic over the past six months have been even more extreme,” Meier said. “This warmth as well as unusual weather patterns have led to the record-low sea ice extents so far this year.”"

"The world is on track for its hottest year on record and levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have reached new highs, further fuelling global warming, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has said.  June marked the 14th consecutive month of record heat for land and oceans, the United Nations agency said on Thursday. It called for the speedy implementation of a pact reached last December to limit climate change by shifting from fossil fuels to green energy by 2100.  The average temperature in the first six months of 2016 was 1.3C warmer than the pre-industrial era in the late 19th century, according to Nasa.  “This underlines more starkly than ever the need to approve and implement the Paris climate change agreement, and to speed up the shift to low carbon economies and renewable energy,” said the WMO secretary general, Petteri Taalas.  Under December’s Paris agreement, nearly 200 governments agreed to limit global warming to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial times, while “pursuing efforts” for a ceiling of just 1.5C. Temperatures are already nudging towards that lower limit.  “The heat has been especially pronounced in the Arctic, resulting in a very early onset of the annual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and Arctic sea ice,” the WMO said.  David Carlson, director of the WMO’s climate research programme, told a news briefing: “What we’ve seen for the first six months of 2016 is really quite alarming. We would have thought it would take several years to warm up like this. We don’t have as much time as we thought.” The northern hemisphere, including the state of Alaska in the US, Canada and Russia, has posted unusually warm temperatures, he said.  The last month in which global temperatures were below the 20th-century average was December 1984.  A strong El Niño weather event in the Pacific Ocean, a phenomenon associated with extreme droughts, storms and floods, “has now disappeared”, the WMO said in a statement.  The El Niño event developed in 2015 and contributed to the record temperatures in the first half of 2016 before disappearing in May, the WMO said. Taalas said: “Climate change, caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases, will not [disappear]. This means we face more heat waves, more extreme rainfall and potential for higher impact tropical cyclones.”"

"Scientists use a variety of approaches to estimate the Earth’s climate sensitivity – how much the planet will warm as a result of humans increasing greenhouse effect. For decades, the different methods were all in good general agreement that if we double the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, Earth’s surface temperatures will immediately warm by about 1–3°C (this is known as the ‘transient climate response’). Because it would take decades to centuries for the Earth to reach a new energy balance, climate scientists have estimated an eventual 2–4.5°C warming from doubled atmospheric carbon (this is ‘equilibrium climate sensitivity’). However, a 2013 paper led by Alexander Otto disrupted the agreement between the various different approaches. Using a combination of recent climate measurements and a relatively simple climate model, the ‘energy budget’ approach used in Otto’s study yielded a best estimate for the immediate (transient) warming of 1.3°C and equilibrium warming of 2.0°C; within the agreed range, but less than climate model best estimates of 1.8°C and 3.2°C, respectively.  This new energy budget approach, which was replicated by several subsequent studies, seemed to indicate the Earth’s climate is a bit less sensitive to carbon pollution than previously thought. As a result, the IPCC adjusted its estimated range for equilibrium climate sensitivity from 2–4.5°C in its 2007 report to 1.5–4.5°C in its 2014 report. This suggested perhaps a slightly less dire climate situation. Later in 2013, Kevin Cowtan and Robert Way published a paper finding that climate scientists had been underestimating global surface warming, largely because of a lack of measurements in the rapidly-warming Arctic. Additionally, while climate models simulate surface air temperatures (the temperature of the air a few meters above the Earth’s surface), over the oceans, climate scientists measure sea surface temperatures. It turns out that the water surface isn’t warming quite as fast as the air above it. Thus looking at modeled surface air temperatures versus measured global land-ocean surface temperatures is an apples-to-oranges comparison. A new study in Nature Climate Change led by Mark Richardson in collaboration with Kevin Cowtan, Ed Hawkins, and Martin Stolpe accounts for these differences to make an apples-to-apples comparison. They find that the use of sea surface temperatures biases the Otto result low by about 9%, and the lack of Arctic observations by another 15%. When observations are adjusted to estimate surface air temperatures (red bars in the figure below), or when models are adjusted to estimate land-ocean surface temperatures (blue bars), the estimated transient climate response from climate models and the Otto approach are in close agreement. Previous studies have identified other flaws in the energy budget model approach. Several papers, most recently led by Kate Marvel at NASA, found that Otto’s and similar studies have not accounted for the different efficiencies of various factors that cause global energy imbalances. Other papers have noted that the energy balance model approach assumes that feedbacks amplifying or dampening global warming will stay constant over time, while in reality, some feedbacks kick in later than others. This suggests that energy budget climate sensitivity estimates, based only on today’s feedbacks, will be biased low. The new Nature Climate Change paper didn’t address how much combining these various corrections would change our estimates of the Earth’s climate sensitivity. As the authors noted: A recent study, Marvel et al 2015 and prior works suggest that cooling effect of non-CO2 pollution may have been underestimated. This also suggests that climate sensitivity is underestimated (since the net direct impact of human activity would be reduced, requiring a greater sensitivity to achieve the observed temperature change). The results of Marvel et al are independent of [our] work. If both studies are correct, climate sensitivity from the historical record could be higher than climate sensitivity from the models. However we are not in a position to comment on that paper, and so draw the weaker conclusion that the historical record offers no reason to doubt the estimates of climate sensitivity from climate models. According to lead author Mark Richardson: The work that’s out there now, if anything, favours hotter models in general. Now it’s clear there’s no evidence from this energy-budget approach for a cooler-than-models future. But there are lots of things where the numbers haven’t been fully calculated yet. We don’t know precisely how Marvel’s results apply to the real world yet and other factors could matter, such as recent hints from CERN laboratory results on how clouds form. This helps explain why we have such a large range of possible transient climate response values (1.0–3.3°C is a pretty big range!), but even so, our results say that we’re more than 99.9% confident that most recent global warming is human-caused. In a recent court case, the world’s largest private sector coal company made its best case against the need to take action on climate change. Their witness testimony relied upon two primary claims – that climate models are wrong and Earth’s climate sensitivity is low, which led them to conclude that carbon pollution is lovely. This new research shows that their arguments are on even weaker footing than previously thought. When comparing apples to apples, climate models accurately simulate global surface temperature changes, and the evidence for lower climate sensitivity failed to withstand scientific scrutiny and the test of time. The coal company lost its case, and we’re now at the point where we have no excuse to continue delaying action on climate change.  We’re also left with the question, when evaluating dangerous global warming, should we consider measured land-ocean temperatures, or faster-warming air temperatures? As Ed Hawkins notes, if we decide climate targets refer to the latter, it puts us about 24% closer to dangerous thresholds. Thus the climate situation may be even more, not less urgent than previously believed."
"With the trophy of world’s best minister already on Greg Hunt’s mantle, he’s declared his work done in the environment portfolio. After almost a decade overseeing Coalition environment policy, Hunt stepped aside to make way for the Liberal party rising star Josh Frydenberg. “I feel as if my work is done,” Hunt said in his first appearance as the new minister for innovation, science and industry on Wednesday. On his self-designated list of achievements is establishing the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund – which pays farmers and business to reduce CO2 – as Australia’s climate policy centrepiece. He also claims credit for “putting in place” the renewable energy target, which was actually a Howard government policy and was reduced on Hunt’s watch. His successor moves over from the resources portfolio after the best part of a year touring the nation’s mines. Frydenberg will take on the expanded responsibility of both environment and energy. His predecessor is certain there’s no conflict there. “[Frydenberg] spoke powerfully and with knowledge about the energy transition Australia has to face,” Hunt said of their handover. Environment groups generally welcomed the merger of energy and environment, and some believe it could signal a change in policy. Others fear appointing a “coal man” to the role could spell disaster. Australia has been criticised both internationally and domestically for submitting one of the lowest emissions reduction targets in the developed world at last year’s United Nations climate conference. But Hunt believes his environmental legacy has installed the architecture for his successor and maintains the government will meet its emissions reduction targets without jacking up power prices. And, despite not wanting to spell out whether he asked the prime minister for his new gig, or if he could be removed from his old one, Hunt’s excitement suggests he may have.  “This is certainly one of the portfolios that I have always wanted to do,” he told reporters in Canberra. “This is absolutely the best and most exciting role I could have had.” Hunt brings the accolade of “best minister in the world” to his new role, after being handed the title at the World Government Summit in Dubai earlier this year. His award was met back home with a mixture of cynicism and criticism from opposition politicians and environment groups. Just what Frydenberg will do in the portfolio remains unclear but he may work closely with Malcolm Turnbull, who famously lost his Liberal leadership over plans for strong climate change action. But not all in the party or even in cabinet are convinced about climate change, with another promoted minister, Matt Canavan, declaring the impacts “overhyped”."
"A hundred kilometres of kelp forests off the western coast of Australia were wiped out by a marine heatwave between 2010 and 2013, a new study has revealed. About 90% of the forests that make up the north-western tip of the Great Southern Reef disappeared over the period, replaced by seaweed turfs, corals, and coral fish usually found in tropical and subtropical waters. The Great Southern Reef is a system of rocky reefs covered by kelp forests that runs for 2,300km along the south coast of Australia, extending past Sydney on the east coast, down to Tasmania and, previously, back up to Kalbarri on the west coast. It supports most of the nation’s fisheries, including the lucrative rock lobster and abalone fisheries, and is worth about $10bn to the Australian economy. It is also a global biodiversity hotspot, with up to 30% of species endemic. Dr Thomas Wernberg, from the University of Western Australia’s oceans institute and lead author of the study, told the Guardian that 100km of kelp forest died following a marine heatwave in 2011 which saw the ocean temperature increase by 2C. The death of the kelp caused the functional extinction of 370sq km of rocky cool-climate reefs, extending down the coast from Kalbarri, about 570km north of Perth, Western Australia. The area was then rapidly colonised by turf-forming seaweeds and bottom-grazing tropical herbivores, such as rabbitfish and parrotfish, which stopped the kelp from regrowing.  If the trend continued, Wernberg said, the kelp forests could retract to the southern tip of the state, with environmental and economic consequences as grave as the loss of the Great Barrier Reef. “I think the next big heatwave is just going to push what we see in the north ultimately further down, and then it just depends on how bad that heatwave is, whether we go all the way down to Perth or whether we just go another 10km.  “All the projections are that it will get warmer, we will get more frequent heatwaves, so unfortunately I think it’s just a matter of time,” he said. The heatwave in 2011 killed 43% of kelp in western Australia, but with the exception of the northern tip near Kalbarri most was able to regrow.  Wernberg said that northern area was now being colonised by corals and coral reef species, brought in by the Leeuwin current which runs north-to-south in a west coast replica of the East Australia Current.  He said the area would eventually become tropical, but “I don’t think that these things will turn into healthy functional coral reefs in our lifetime”. “It’s not just a matter of a temperate ecosystem being replaced by a tropical ecosystem... You sort of get locked into this intermediate stage where you have lots of small turf-forming seaweeds, so you lose the best parts of both systems. “We take these systems for granted because they’re right in your backyard, in contrast to the Great Barrier Reef. This is a cool water, seaweed-dominated system that for a lot of reasons is less attractive. The water’s not as clear, it’s cold... I can understand that, of course, but if you look at what kelp forests actually do for us I think we need to be as passionate about understanding this reef system,” Wernberg said. The El Niño phenomenon that caused mass coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef earlier this year also caused the longest and hottest heatwave on record off the east coast of Tasmania, resulting in mass oyster deaths but not, surprisingly, a huge loss of kelp. That suggested southern kelp forests were more able to withstand heatwaves than northern kelp forests, Prof Craig Johnson, from the University of Tasmania’s Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, told the Guardian. He agreed with Wernberg that it was likely kelp forests would retract to the southern-most corners of the continent as temperatures warmed, which would see the majority of species dependent on the reef pushed out. Tasmania has already lost 95% of its giant kelp forests, due to ocean warming over the past 80 years, but the remaining species appear more resilient. The species grows so fast you can measure it in the morning and come out after lunch to find it’s grown another 30cm. Johnson said the value of the Great Southern Reef was “completely under-appreciated,” and that the number of endemic species was “orders of magnitude more on the Great Southern Reef than the Great Barrier Reef”. The study, Climate-driven regime shift of a temperate marine ecosystem, was published in the journal Science on Thursday."

"Malcolm Turnbull’s failure to get his party to adopt a strong policy on climate change is something he now appears to wear as a mark of pride – like a battle scar, showing how he’s fought for the cause. “I am absolutely committed to achieving a global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to ward off unsafe global warming,” he reminded thousands of millennials and others during his Facebook-broadcast debate with Bill Shorten on 17 June.  “I have paid some heavy prices over the years, as you probably know, for my commitment to the climate change challenge.” He was speaking, of course, about his rise and fall as leader of the Liberal party while in opposition in 2009 – a battle that was fought primarily over Turnbull’s support for an emissions trading scheme. His eventual return as leader – and as prime minister – in 2015 appeared to most to be accomplished on the basis of a commitment to support the party’s current climate policies, which he once harshly derided. It is fitting then, that in his own electorate of Wentworth, activists are rubbing salt in his climate change-induced wound. Groups from around the country have piled into Sydney’s glitzy eastern suburbs electorate, raising awareness of Turnbull’s current climate change policies, or lack thereof, and simultaneously trying to make Turnbull aware of his constituents’ views on climate change. And views they have. However, Wentworth, it seems, is an electorate full of incongruent qualities. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Turnbull’s electorate is rich. It has the highest house prices of any electorate in Australia. Harbourside mansions – like Turnbull’s own in Point Piper – push the median house price up to about $2.5m. Fitting with those prices, Wentworth has remained a safe non-Labor seat, held by conservative politicians since federation. And Turnbull is not the first Liberal leader to hold the seat, with John Hewson representing Sydney’s wealthy eastern suburbs crowd back in the 1990s. More surprisingly, however, the electorate can also be very progressive – putting the small “l” back in Liberal. Take the Greens vote. In 2011 they got a healthy 17.4% of the primary vote. That dropped to a more modest but still respectable 14.6% when Turnbull, who grew up in the area and is known by many residents, ran in 2013. And when those voters are asked about what they think about environmental issues, they support positions that are much more progressive than those of the current Liberal party. In April a ReachTel survey commissioned by renewable energy campaigners Solar Citizens found 63.5% of Wentworth voters would be more likely to vote for a party that promised to take Australia to 100% renewable energy within 15 years. And perhaps even more surprisingly, according to leftwing activist group GetUp, Wentworth is where it has its highest density of members anywhere in the country. People there sign GetUp’s petitions on issues like marriage equality, renewable energy and asylum seekers in droves. And now, tugging at the loose threads left by the chafing of these incongruent qualities is a cabal of environment groups, hoping to find leverage among the small “l” liberals of Wentworth. Buoyed by the finding that a healthy majority of Wentworthians would be swayed by a policy that quickly shifted Australia to 100% renewable energy, Solar Citizens held a public meeting in Paddington Town Hall on 8 June. “We had 500 people there,” says Claire O’Rourke, national director of Solar Citizens. “That was the biggest event we’ve ever held.” Despite Wentworth’s enthusiasm for solar, they’re the second-worst electorate in the country in terms of uptake of the technology, according to Solar Citizens. Out of the 150 federal electorates, the group says Wentworth is ranked 149, with just 2,352 voters living under solar-adorned roofs. “To see 500 people in an electorate that has the second-lowest proportional uptake of solar was really encouraging,” says O’Rourke. One thing holding back the uptake of solar in the electorate is not the will of the people but the way they live. Crowded alongside the harbourside mansions and eastern beaches are stacks of apartment blocks, each trying to peer over the other to catch a glimpse of Sydney’s glistening harbour and ocean. There are so many apartments, that Wentworth is Australia’s second-most dense electorate. And current renewable energy policies don’t make it easy for renters or even apartment owners to get solar energy. Since that Solar Citizens meeting, other groups have been bombarding the Turnbull’s electorate with climate-change related messaging. GetUp produced posters to hijack Turnbull’s own messaging in the electorate. Strapped to street poles beneath the prime minister’s head and shoulders were posters with the rest of his body. They said “trust me on climate change” and have Turnbull’s fingers crossed. The group even made a video of two women running around installing the posters – labelled “Guerilla Nannas” by Getup. “We know these are people who care about climate and the environment and who wanted and thought they were getting a prime minister in Turnbull that would deliver,” says Sam Register, head of campaigns at GetUp. GetUp has also been working with Sydney artist Michael Agzarian, who produced the now-famous “fizza” posters of a dazed-looking Malcolm Turnbull, roughly in the style of the Obama “hope” posters.  Adding a twist to the original posters, Agzarian produced specific “climate change fizza” posters, complete with rising sea levels drowning Turnbull’s face and bleached coral in the background. “We wanted to make sure that he knows that his electorate cares about climate and they demand better – no matter who they vote for this is an issue they care about,” says Register. The “fizza” posters are hitting a sore point. Polling commissioned by the local Labor candidate, Evan Hughes, in May suggested a majority of Wentworth residents thought Turnbull had failed to live up to their expectations. Even among Liberal voters, 35% said they thought less of him since he took over the party in September. According to that poll, Turnbull’s two-party-preferred vote will be cut from 68% in 2013 to 58% – a healthy win, but a drop that reveals disappointment in the electorate. In the weekend before the election, environment groups went into overdrive. Last Friday, Greenpeace activists hung banners from Turnbull’s Edgecliff office on the busy New South Head Road. The posters said “Turnbull’s legacy: bleaching brought to you buy Malcolm’s mates in the coal industry”. Then on Saturday, a flotilla of kayakers – many of whom were Pacific Islanders – rowed from Blues Point to Lady Martins beach, just metres from Turnbull’s home.  Then on Sunday locals demonstrated in Double Bay’s Steyne Park against what they perceived as Turnbull’s lack of action on climate change. Speaking to a rally of an estimated 2,000 people, the former member for Wentworth, John Hewson, said Turnbull’s current policy position was a “national disgrace”. “I think climate change should be the dominant issue of this campaign – it should have been for quite some time,” he told the crowd, to resounding cheers. While the protest occurred, Greenpeace boats motored around to Turnbull’s house, where they were met by a significant police presence guarding the waterfront. And as election day approaches, green groups are gearing up for their last push in the battle for Wentworth. Every environment group in the country seems to have created election scorecards, many of which will be handed out at polling booths in Wentworth. GetUp will be there too, asking voters to put the Liberals last. “Who knows what will happen on election day,” says GetUp’s Sam Register. “But we know the electorate is frustrated and they feel let down. They wanted more and we are expecting that to be reflected on polling day. “[Turnbull has] got one of the safest seats in the country and is highly unlikely to lose his seat. But what we want to do by being there is [make] sure that him and other major-party MPs know that we can’t not act on climate anymore and get away with it. People want real action and we’re going to make that an issue of this election campaign.”"
"Every so often a book comes along that changes the way you view the world. The War on Science: Who’s Waging It, Why It Matters, What We Can Do About It by Shawn Otto is one of those rare books. If you care about attacks on climate science and the rise of authoritarianism, if you care about biased media coverage or shake-your-head political tomfoolery, this book is for you.  Otto, an organizer of the US Presidential Science Debates and a global speaker on science and democracy, started on the journey that led to this book in late 2007, when he noticed that the candidates weren’t talking about any of the big science, technology, health and environmental issues.  Furthermore, the news media weren’t asking questions about these subjects even though they were impacting voters at least as much as economics and foreign policy. In fact, the top five TV news anchors asked the candidates 2,975 questions in 171 interviews, and just six mentioned the words “global warming” or “climate change,” the single largest environmental and economic question to face the planet. To put that in perspective, three mentioned UFOs. Flash forward eight years. In the week following the Paris climate accord, both the Democrats and the Republicans held presidential primary debates. Yet just days after 195 countries reached an historic agreement to begin rebuilding the world’s economy around clean energy, no journalist in either debate asked a single question about it. This is par for the course for journalists and politicians who mostly went into the humanities after high school, says Otto. But it’s a problem when science is impacting every aspect of life on the planet, and having more and more concrete things to say about public policy.  Thomas Jefferson would be appalled. Otto traces how Jefferson appealed to scientific thinking when drafting the Declaration of Independence, narrowly circumscribing his argument around the idea that if anyone can establish the truth of something using the tools of reason and science, no pope or monarch had any greater authority to rule than we do ourselves. Science was the great equalizer. “Wherever the people are well-informed,” Jefferson later wrote, “they can be trusted with their own government.” To secure this, he championed a free press and public education.  But according to Otto, this places an ever-increasing burden on the voter, and in an age when science has grown mind-bogglingly complex, public education and the press are unduly influenced by corporations focused on financial outcomes, religious extremists intent on forcing biblical literalist policies, and postmodernist academics who’ve laid the foundation for all this by teaching that science is but one of many equally valid “ways of knowing” and that all truth is relative. In particular, Otto argues that journalists are taught there is no such thing as objectivity. This has created an over-emphasis on balance, which these days often pits scientists relaying objective knowledge on the one hand, against impassioned advocates seeking to persuade on the other. This false balance skews public dialogue toward extreme views by presenting opinions as if they had the weight of knowledge, weakening the press’s role as democracy’s tiller.  These challenges, Otto believes, are getting worse. “Over the course of the next forty years,” he writes, “science is poised to create more knowledge than humans have created in all of recorded history ... One only has to recall the political battles fought over past scientific advances to see that we are in for a rocky ride.” In fact, Otto makes a convincing case that democracy is facing an existential challenge. To this end, Otto lays out a dozen “battle plans” by which people can arm themselves and society to both battle back anti-science disinformation campaigns and create a firmer foundation for the rocky road ahead. The book is being touted by a US vice president, the incoming president of the US National Academy of Sciences, and scientist Bill Nye, who offers this observation: “Otto makes a case that can’t be refuted. Here’s hoping all voters everywhere take him seriously—soon.”  These are complex issues and Mr. Otto lays a basic framework in an easy to understand and compelling manner. A resource for people who ponder what it means to live in a free society and the important role scientists play in conveying good science to the larger public."
"Climate change and El Niño have caused the worst mangrove die-off in recorded history, stretching along 700km of Australia’s Gulf of Carpentaria, an expert says. The mass die-off coincided with the world’s worst global coral bleaching event, as well as the worst bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef, in which almost a quarter of the coral was killed – something also caused by unusually warm water.  And last week it was revealed warm ocean temperatures had wiped out 100km of important kelp forests off the coast of Western Australia. To assess the damage to the mangroves, Norm Duke, an expert in mangrove ecology from James Cook University, flew in a helicopter over 700km of coastline, where there had been reports of widespread mangrove die-offs. He was “shocked” by what he saw. He calculated dead mangroves now covered a combined area of 7,000 hectares, as was first reported by the ABC on Sunday. That was the worst mangrove mass die-off seen anywhere in the world, he said. “We have seen smaller instances of this kind of moisture stress before, but what is so unusual now is its extent, and that it occurred across the whole southern gulf in a single month.”  The devastated mangrove forests played an essential role in the region’s ecosystem, Duke said. They were nurseries for many fish species. “But we also think of them as kidneys – as water filters and purifiers,” he said. As water from rivers and floodplains runs into the ocean, mangroves filter a lot of sediment, and protect coral reefs and seagrass meadows. That service would be lost in the areas affected by die-off.  “There are already anecdotal reports of marine life dying and piles of dead seagrass washing up on the shore,” he said. “If that’s true, then turtles and dugongs will be starving in a few months.” And it would get worse over the coming years as the roots of the dead plants rotted. “The problem is the growth rate isn’t high enough to stabilise the environments,” Duke said. “In five or six years’ time, the roots will break down and those sediments will become destabilised. And that will threaten the near-shore habitats of seagrass and coral.” The mangroves also protect the shoreline and coastal ecosystems from storms and tsunamis. Absorbing waves that hit the coast helps limit the impact of storms and rising sea levels.  “We need that resilience and protection of the shoreline so we can slow down the effects of sea level rise,” he said. Mangroves die off naturally on a small scale, but Duke had never seen anything of this magnitude. Around the world there had been widespread destruction of mangroves, but usually as a result of direct local impacts such as clearing for the creation of shrimp farms, he said. But the areas in northern Australia were “relatively pristine”.  “So you can see global changes or influences more easily. Usually, local influences are far stronger.” The clear culprit in this case was climate change, which was warming waters and making rainfall more erratic, Duke said. That put the mangrove forests at their tolerance limit, and when a strong El Niño hit the world this year – warming waters in northern Australia and drawing rainfall away – they were pushed past their tolerance thresholds. Greg Browning, from Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology, confirmed the past two years had seen unusually low rainfall and very high sea surface and air temperatures across the region where the die-off occurred. “In a nutshell, there have been significantly below-average rainfall totals in the last two wet seasons ... and very warm sea surface temperatures,” he said. “When you have those departures from average conditions, it’s bound to affect the ecosystem in some way.” The 2016 wet season was affected by the El Niño phenomenon, which produced dry conditions at the heart of the die-off. Browning said normally there were two or three bursts of monsoonal rains across the region, but in 2016 there was just one. But the 2015 wet season, when there was no El Niño, was even drier. This year, it is believed those dry conditions combined with a belt of record-warm sea surface temperatures across the north of Australia, as well as very warm air temperatures, to create a perfect storm that devastated the mangroves. Browning said these conditions were a result of natural fluctuations, occurring on top of climate change. “[Global warming] exacerbates the situation,” he said. “It makes a bad situation much worse.” Duke said mangroves were good at adapting, but not to such severe changes that occurred so quickly. How they would recover over the coming years was unclear. Some areas could transition completely away from being mangrove-dominated, and become salt pans – flat, unvegetated regions covered in salt and other minerals. “Some zones have been completely removed of vegetation across the tidal profile,” he said. “The problem is that the rate of colonisation isn’t fast enough to stabilise those environments. So in five or six years’ time when the root material breaks down, the sediment becomes destabilised and no amount of seedling growth will stop the erosion.” Duke said there had been very little monitoring of these relatively pristine mangroves in areas where very few people live.  Such a program was urgently needed. “We need to be able to form a rapid assessment response for these emergent situations,” he said. “These habitats are on the retreat. They’re retreating far more rapidly than any of the endangered forests we have. “We need to equip people to have independent assessments of what the local impacts are.”  Although they were among the most pristine mangroves in the world, they could be being affected by grazing.  “The question is how much of that is going on, and we need to be monitoring those sorts of influences so we can properly understand what are these larger effects, and are we reducing the resilience of mangroves so we are making them more vulnerable to the climate?”"

"Angenie, 21, lives in a country many people think of as an ecological paradise, home to a unique diversity of plants and animals. Yet within the past three years she has witnessed droughts and floods so severe she has had to flee her home to escape them – twice. Angenie grew up in southern Madagascar where, as a child, she remembers “things being green”. But for the past few years a severe drought, blamed on the devastating effects of El Niño, has gripped the southern region. “The land got dry, really dry,” she says. “It got to the point we were not able to grow anything. People ate only dried cassava or cactus fruit.” More than 80% of Madagascar’s rural poor are, like Angenie and her family, reliant on small-scale farming or fishing. With no way to feed themselves, she and her husband moved to the coastal city of Morondava three years ago, settling in a suburb called Tanambao, little more than a collection of ramshackle wooden houses on a strip of land wedged between a river and the sea.  She says: “At first life was a bit better here because at least we could go out and catch shrimps for our food. But last year we had floods. The water rose so fast. I had to carry my baby on my shoulders to get out. When we came back, everything was destroyed.” François, 58, has lived in Tanambao all his life, in a traditional wooden house on stilts. “At high tide the water only used to come up to here,” he says, pointing to a tide mark just a few centimetres off the ground. “That was in 1998. Now it comes up to here,” he says pointing to a mark more than a metre higher. Water levels are rising each year and weather patterns are becoming more unusual and extreme. Madagascar is one of the countries most exposed to cyclones in Africa. Climate change is expected to bring stronger cyclones and further droughts, which will have a dramatic impact on food security and infrastructure in a country where about 90% of the population already lives on less than $3 a day. Morondava’s mayor, Kolo Friof, says the city is not equipped to withstand another cyclone or flood. The cyclone four years ago tore apart what was left of the old colonial sea defences, and he says he has no funds to rebuild them. “Tourism is our only industry here,” he says. “I am trying to work with the hotel owners to engage them to work with me by planting new mangroves. But what we are able to do ourselves isn’t enough.” Tanambao’s community president blames newcomers like Angenie and her family for making the situation worse. “Urbanisation and the growing population is the problem,” he says. “We are getting more and more people coming here from the south. I tell them they have gone from something already bad there to something that is getting worse here. Every new household here means more trees cut in order to burn charcoal. Everyone is destroying the mangroves.” Alan Walsch from the German aid agency GIZ says the situation is far more complex. “We know that many people are fleeing the south. Madagascar is an island, so people can rarely afford to leave the country – they move internally. But there hasn’t been a census in several years so we don’t know how many people have migrated or where to, which makes it impossible to plan programmes effectively. I often hear migrants getting the blame for cutting down trees, but in reality many communities are also doing it themselves. When you fly over Madagascar it is horrifying because you can really see the devastation and degradation caused by slash-and-burn farming techniques and deforestation. Only 10% of Madagascar’s original forest remains.”  GIZ is working in rural areas to replant and manage forests and support coastal communities. “We need to be working to tackle the effects of climate change and provide sustainable farming methods so that people don’t have to migrate and can stay in their own communities,” says Walsch. But, he adds, “chronic underfunding” is a huge problem. “Madagascar does not have time to spare when it comes to the effects of climate change. Last year there was tremendous, unprecedented heavy rain, which flooded 60% of the capital city, causing landslides. Then, in March, heavy storms destroyed harvests in the north, while in the south there was no rain at all. There are big contradictions in weather patterns.” Louise Whiting, senior policy analyst on water security and climate change at WaterAid, says changing weather patterns are making the future of water supplies more uncertain in Madagascar, where, already, 12 million people – just over half the population – don’t have access to clean water. WaterAid is working to install flood-proof water points and improved sanitation points across the most at-risk areas. Whiting believes the Paris climate deal reached last year falls far short of what is needed to help cities like Morondava: “In Paris not enough clarity was given to poor countries about the amount of money they’ll receive to deal with climate change. Much more needs to be done to help countries like Madagascar cope.” Angenie feels cornered: “I can’t go back to the south and I now have nothing here. I am frightened. I live only for today. I don’t know about tomorrow.” • This article was amended on 8 July 2016 to remove an incorrect figure for climate change funding"
"The Philippines will not honour commitments it made under the Paris climate change deal, president Rodrigo Duterte has said in a speech. “You are trying to stifle us,” Duterte said on Monday in widely reported comments. “That’s stupid, I will not honour that. You signed … That was not my signature.”  The UN pact, agreed by 195 countries including the Philippines last December, aims to limit warming to below 2C (36F) and strive to keep temperatures at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The deal comes into force when 55 countries covering 55% of global emissions formally join. The Philippines accounts for less than 1% of the world’s emissions, and has not ratified the deal. Duterte said he felt like attacking an ambassador to the Philippines at a recent meeting, after he was asked about plans to cut the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Duterte said: “I’m mad at this ambassador. I want to kick him,” adding that limits on carbon emissions for the Philippines were “nonsense”. “You who have reached your peak and along with it spewed a lot of contaminants, emissions … Good for you. We are here, we have not reached the age of industrialisation. We are on our way to it.” Lucille Sering, a former climate negotiator, said the country’s action plan had always been contingent on financial and technology support. The president’s remarks were “probably taken out of context”, she tweeted. PH climate submission is conditional on support. Meaning, no support no carbon reduction. Pres Duterte probably taken out of context It is not the first time Duterte has criticised the international climate agreement, however. He previously accused the UN of being “hypocrites” for fixing a pact that requires all countries – not just the rich – to make greenhouse gas cuts. The UN deal also encourages countries to develop better climate resilience strategies, vital for a nation as vulnerable to extreme weather as the Philippines. Storms are likely to become more severe say scientists, raising the prospect of future catastrophes like typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 6,000 dead in 2013."

"India could meet its carbon reduction goals earlier than expected, the country’s outgoing climate minister told a meeting in Delhi on Tuesday. By 2030, the world’s fourth largest greenhouse gas emitter plans to cut the carbon intensity of GDP up to 35% on 2005 levels and boost the share of clean power in the energy mix to 40%. Those ambitious goals helped deliver a new global pact to limit warming to below 2C said Prakash Javadekar, who suggested India could overachieve on its pledge. “I’m sure all sectors will also contribute to adopt the sustainable development track and achieve the INDCs [climate plans]… even much earlier than what we have promised and that’s the way forward,” he said. The comments tally with those of energy minister Piyush Goyal, who has predicted the country will easily meet a goal of 100 gigawatts of solar by 2022 amid crashing prices for solar panels. Recently appointed to the cabinet as minister for human resource development, Javadekar ran India’s negotiations at the 2015 Paris summit, where a new UN climate pact was agreed. Previously notorious for blocking efforts to impose tougher carbon cuts on developing countries at UN meetings, the minister said he instructed his team in Paris not to slow progress. “Without India it would not have been possible to arrive at a consensus,” he said. “We will not say oppose, we say propose, and with that one change the whole attitude of the negotiations changed.” Javadekar did admit coal will “still be a mainstay” of India’s energy production for some time to come, but stressed a coal tax rise was a sign the government was trying to reduce its use. According to analysts at Bloomberg, India’s planned coal investments could treble its emissions by 2040, threatening UN global warming targets."
"Brexit will force the European Union’s remaining 27 countries to spend billions of euros on cutting carbon emissions more deeply to compensate for the UK leaving, according to experts.  The UK will be included in a Brussels communique on 20 July, setting out individual targets for EU signatory states to meet a bloc goal of a 40% emissions cut by 2030, as pledged in Paris last year.  But once Britain invokes article 50 and begins its journey to the EU’s exit door, the bloc will have to draw up new CO2 plans for the other 27 countries. This is because the UK is a large economy with a relatively advanced green sector, and its departure will oblige each EU state to raise their climate ambition by between 0.2-1.7%, according to an analysis by Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe. The study found that the counties whose climate commitments would be most affected by the UK’s departure were Portugal, Slovenia, Malta, Greece, Cyprus, Spain and Italy. Wendell Trio, CAN Europe’s director, said that Brexit could be a spur to other EU countries taking on greater climate commitments. “It doesn’t necessarily have to be something bad,” he said. “It just means the other countries will need to compensate for the changes that might be brought about by the UK leaving.” The analysis did not look at the knock-on cost effects caused by extra climate mitigation measures, such as an expansion of renewable energy infrastructure or energy efficiency programmes. In the long term, spending on clean energy is usually seen as a good investment. In the short term though, costs could run to several billions of euros, according to Bill Hare, a former Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) led author and the founder of the Climate Analytics consultancy. “The costs could run to several billions in gross terms, although the net costs would probably be lower,” he told the Guardian. “If the UK completely separates from EU climate policies in every sense, there will be consequences. But if the EU and UK remain entangled in a constructive way, going forward with policies like the emissions trading system, then the differences may not be so extreme.” The first review of climate commitments made under the Paris agreement will come in 2018, and this is already being viewed as an opportunity for a redistribution of Britain’s contribution to Europe’s plans. The European commission refused to comment on the new analysis but one EU source told the Guardian that 2018: “will mostly be aimed at those countries like the US which have 2025 targets but it is also an obvious incentive to those with 2030 targets to rethink whether they can be more ambitious.” The greatest challenge to revisiting the “burden sharing” of greenhouse gas reductions may come from EU states such as Poland, which have drawn a red line around any further climate action. “The percentages [in the analysis] sound in the right ballpark and it will not be a massive increase,” Hare said. “But given that, for some countries in the EU, every megatonne of CO2 seems to be contested, I am sure that it will be fertile ground for more political trouble.” The CAN analysis was based on an EU decision in 2014 that allocated CO2 cuts to poorer states on the basis of their GDP per capita. For richer states, the calculation was done by combining GDP per capita with the potential for cost-effective emissions reductions."
"The prime minister of Samoa has defended his country’s role as an offshore tax haven, claiming it provides revenue for social programmes for young people who might otherwise be exposed to illegal drugs. During a visit to Brussels, prime minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi suggested the ravages of climate change on his Pacific island nation are making it increasingly reliant on the royalty payments from trustee companies such as Mossack Fonseca, which is at the centre of the Panama Papers. “The Samoa International Finance Authority [Sifa] – which registers companies that do not actually come to Samoa – is very important for financing our youth at sport,” said Malielegaoi, 72. “On top of the increase in the force and frequency of storms, we have a new problem of drugs coming in on boats through our customs.” The Panama Papers revealed Samoa, which is situated halfway between New Zealand and Hawaii, as a key player in offshore financing. The leaked documents showed that law firm Mossack Fonseca had created more than 5,000 companies in Samoa on behalf of its clients. Malielegaoi has denied any wrongdoing by Sifa, the products and prices of which are published online. He said Sifa’s operations are legal and regulated, and that Samoa is a signatory to “three or four” anti-money laundering protocols. The jerseys of the national rugby team are emblazoned with “sifa.ws”, the Sifa website address, and Malielegaoi said national pride was at stake. “Without Sifa, we could not finance our participation in the Rugby World Cup.” Malielegaoi, who has been prime minister since 1998, was in Brussels to receive a €20.2m EU subsidy to be spent mainly on providing sanitation and clean water for the Samoa’s population of 200,000 people. Residents survive mainly on fishing and the remittances of the 300,000-strong diaspora in New Zealand, Australia and the US. He used his speech to donors and aid organisations attending the European Development Days to call for an “upgraded responsiveness” to the needs of small island developing states in the face of climate change. “We are often told our projects are too small to be funded. Other times we are blocked by burdensome application and reporting requirements,” he said, adding that economic opportunities are narrowing for countries like Samoa. “Fisheries and tourism have provided an important development pathway for some, but climate change is rendering these sectors much more vulnerable. One of the worst coral bleaching episodes is currently damaging our reefs, destroying traditional sources of food supply.” Samoa also faces problems of time and place. It is on GMT+13, which means it is 12 hours ahead of London and 18 hours ahead of Washington. The country is 3,300km from Wellington, New Zealand, and one hour ahead of it. Before leaving for the capital, Apia, on a 30-hour flight home – via London, Los Angeles and Wellington – Malielegaoi said one of his main achievements as prime minister had been Samoa’s 2011 move west of the international dateline. “Our business and cultural transactions are with our people in Australia and New Zealand. Before the change we were terribly handicapped,” he said. “We were 21 hours behind Sydney. If we were suddenly informed, on a Friday, of an upcoming event in New Zealand or Australia, we had already lost a day, and it was the weekend. Now we have a better compromise. It also helps business.” Two years earlier, Samoans switched to driving on the left. “This was to bring us into line with Australia and New Zealand, so that our children can send us cars,” said the prime minister. But climate has always been the decider of Samoa’s fate. A brief look at @DMO_Samoa on Twitter reveals the ordinariness of washed-away roads, tsunami threats, earthquake reports, power outages and floods. “Intervention from the Lord above”, is Malielegaoi’s only explanation for why small island states have not already been wiped off the world map. He cites the 2009 cyclone that battered Samoa with 20ft waves, caused $400m (£301m) of damage and delayed the country’s “graduation to middle-income country” until 2014. “If that had happened in [low-lying] Kiribati or Tuvalu, there would not have been a single survivor. We heard of the 300mph typhoon [Haiyan] that hit the Philippines [in 2013]. If that happened to any of our small island countries, the infrastructure would be flattened and the agriculture – trees and crops – destroyed. What is worrying is that we already know that it is going to get worse: stronger winds and more often.”"
"Conservative and free-market groups have staged a rearguard effort to get the Republican party to accept the dangers of climate change, criticizing climate denialism within the GOP and Rupert Murdoch’s media empire. Climate change, and other environmental concerns, are unlikely to receive much, if any, attention during the Republican convention in Cleveland this week. This is despite a slew of temperature records being broken – June was the 14th consecutive month of record heat around the world – and extreme examples of Arctic ice decline and drought and wildfires in the US west.   But the Republican gathering has been targeted by conservative voices calling for climate science to be accepted and for national parks to be preserved, rather than opened up for drilling and other development. A group called the Partnership for Responsible Growth has launched a TV advertisement campaign aimed squarely at conservatives, reminding them of previous Republican acceptance of climate science. The ad, which will run on Fox News throughout the GOP convention in Cleveland this week, shows clips of presidents George W Bush and George HW Bush, as well as former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, outlining the dangers of climate change. A different version of the ad, which compares these words with denial of climate science by pundits on Fox News, was rejected for broadcast by the Murdoch-owned TV network. Partnership for Responsible Growth has also taken aim at the Wall Street Journal, another Murdoch organ, with a dozen full-page advertisements throughout June and July, decrying the newspapers skeptical stance on climate change. “Historically, when faced with a national security threat like climate change, Americans have set aside ideology, faced facts and taken action,” one of the ads states. “It is time for the editorial board of the WSJ to become part of the solution on climate change.” The Partnership for Responsible Growth calls itself a free-market group that supports putting a price on carbon. Its advisory council includes Ted Roosevelt IV, managing director of investment banking at Barclays Capital, former oil executive William Nitze and retired rear admiral David Titley. The official Republican platform explicitly rejects the idea of a “carbon tax” and commits the party to withdrawing the US from the Paris climate accord, which was signed by 195 nations in December. The platform also opposes the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions and rejects the idea that species including gray wolves and sage grouse should be protected under the Endangered Species Act. Nan Hayworth, a former Republican congresswoman and head of the GOP-aligned ConservAmerica group, said many Republicans still don’t accept mainstream climate science. “The default position should really be that even if you are skeptical about the climate change, let’s minimize our carbon footprint and our pollution anyway,” she said.  “Donald Trump has a particularly vivid way of making a point, he’s theatrical. I think he says things that will resonate with his audience but when there’s time to make an executive decision, he’ll take wise counsel. “I would like to hear Donald Trump say: ‘Let’s resolve to be great stewards of our planet, let’s take science seriously, let’s reduce consumptions and emissions.’” Hayworth said she will continue to battle against the “headwinds” within the party, but insisted that many Republicans care about the environment, only to be stymied by a polarized political system. “My former colleagues understand the importance of protecting the environment, but one of the problems is the political opposition from environmental groups and the left is so extreme in some cases, even when they try to move towards environmental points of view they get no credit for it politically,” she said. “You can’t be too far behind or ahead of your district.” Environmental groups have also hit out at presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has called climate change “bullshit” and a “hoax” invented by the Chinese to weaken America, and Fox News. Friends of the Earth have created an ad that shows a female mock Fox News presenter slowly being submerged by rising sea levels, with the slogan “What will it take for Fox News to admit that humans are changing the climate?” Fox News, which has an underwhelming record when it comes to presenting accurate climate science, refused to run the ad on air. Theclimatesolution.com, another campaign to impose a price on carbon, has created a series of “climate inaction figures”, which it says are “toy-inspired likenesses of prominent public figures who claim, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that there is no reason to act”. Toy figures that people can get their hands on include Sarah Palin, Ted Cruz, the Koch brothers and Trump. "
"The reaction of clouds to a warming atmosphere has been one of the major sources of uncertainty in estimating exactly how much the world will heat up from the accumulation of greenhouse gases, as some changes would enhance warming, while others would counteract it. The study, detailed Monday in the journal Nature, overcomes problems with the satellite record and shows that observations support projections from climate models. But the work is only a first step in understanding the relationship between climate change and clouds, with many uncertainties still to untangle, scientists not involved with the research said.  While clouds are a key component of the climate system, helping to regulate the planet’s temperature, their small scale makes them difficult to accurately represent in climate models. Using satellite observations to look for trends is also problematic because they come solely from weather satellites, which aren’t geared to producing consistent, long-term records. In addition, some satellites have been replaced over time, have changed orbit, or seen degradation of their sensors, introducing false trends. Joel Norris of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and his colleagues had previously figured out a way to remove those artifacts in the satellite data to reveal actual trends since the early 1980s. They focused on looking for those patterns that showed up in different climate models and that our physical understanding of the atmosphere supports. Namely, the observations showed that the main area of storm tracks in the middle latitudes of both hemispheres shifted poleward, expanding the area of dryness in the subtropics, and that the height of the highest cloud tops had increased. Such changes reinforce global warming: There is less solar radiation at the high latitudes near the poles, so as clouds shift that way, they have less radiation to reflect back to space. High cloud tops mean that more of the radiation that is absorbed and re-emitted by Earth’s surface is trapped by the clouds (akin to the greenhouse effect). To investigate whether these changes in cloud patterns could be chalked up to the natural variation of the climate system, Norris and his team compared climate models that included external influences like rising greenhouse gases and volcanic eruptions with those that did not. The former showed the same trends as the observations, while the latter didn’t. “The pattern of cloud change we see is the pattern associated with global warming,” Norris said. Kate Marvel, a climate researcher with NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, agreed but cautioned that the cloud shifts are also consistent with what would be expected during recovery from major volcano eruptions, of which there were two at the beginning of the study period. “More work is needed to tease out the relative roles of greenhouse gas emissions and volcanic eruptions,” she said in an email. Norris plans to tackle this question in future work, as well estimating exactly how much clouds have changed. The study also doesn’t deal with some of the cloud changes that are expected to be most important, namely those to low clouds in the subtropics, Bjorn Stevens, of the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology, said in an email. Stevens is the lead author of the chapter on clouds and aerosols in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. Monday’s study is a step toward better understanding how clouds will change along with the climate, and lays bare the limitations of the satellite record and the need for better long-term observations, said Stevens, who was not involved with the research. “This study reminds us how poorly prepared we are for detecting signals that might portend more extreme (both large and small) climate changes than are presently anticipated,” he said. Reporting was contributed by John Upton."

"2014 and 2015 each set the record for hottest calendar year since we began measuring surface temperatures over 150 years ago, and 2016 is almost certain to break the record once again. It will be without precedent: the first time that we’ve seen three consecutive record-breaking hot years. But it’s just happenstance that the calendar year begins in January, and so it’s also informative to compare all yearlong periods. In doing so, it becomes clear that we’re living in astonishingly hot times. June 2015 through May 2016 was the hottest 12-month period on record. That was also true of May 2015 through April 2016, and the 12 months ending in March 2016. In fact, it’s true for every 12 months going all the way back to the period ending in September 2015, according to global surface temperature data compiled by Kevin Cowtan and Robert Way. We just set the record for hottest year in each of the past 9 months. These record temperatures have been assisted by a very strong El Niño event, which brought warm water to the ocean surface, temporarily warming global surface temperatures. But today’s temperatures are only record-setting because the El Niño was superimposed on top of human-caused global warming. For comparison, 1997–1998 saw a very similar monster El Niño event. And similarly, the 12-month hottest temperature record was set in each month from October 1997 through August 1998. That was likewise a case of El Niño and global warming teaming up to shatter previous temperature records.  The difference is that while September 1997–August 1998 was the hottest 12-month period on record at the time; it’s now in 60th place. It’s been surpassed by yearlong periods in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Many of those years weren’t even aided by El Niño events; unassisted global warming made them hotter than 1998.  Global surface temperatures are now more than 0.3°C hotter than they were in 1997–1998. That’s a remarkable rise over just 18 years, in comparison to the 1°C the Earth’s average surface temperatures have risen since the Industrial Revolution began. This has all happened during a time when ‘no significant warming in 18 years’ has been one of the rallying cries of climate denial. In reality, when we compare apples to apples – El Niño years to El Niño years – we’ve seen more than 0.3°C global surface warming over the past 18 years, which is in line with climate model predictions. ‘Climate models are wrong’ has been another now-debunked climate denial rallying cry. Now that the past year’s El Niño event is over, the streak of record-breaking yearlong periods appears to have ended. Nevertheless, 2016 remains on track to break that record for the hottest calendar year, for an unprecedented third consecutive year, following record years in 2010 and 2005 as well. With Apr update, 2016 still > 99% likely to be a new record (assuming historical ytd/ann patterns valid). pic.twitter.com/GTN9sPL2D7 With the Earth warming dangerously rapidly, at a rate 20–50 times faster than the fastest rate of natural global warming, one can’t help but wonder when the influence of the small minority of disproportionately powerful climate denial groups will wane.  195 countries pledged to curb their carbon pollution in the tremendously successful Paris climate negotiations, but climate denial is still predominant in one of America’s two political parties, and may be gaining foothold in other regions of the Anglosphere like the UK and Australia. Fortunately, many other countries like China, India, and Canada seem to be moving in the right direction with their climate and energy policies. Now that climate denial’s bread and butter arguments are toast, November’s US elections will be critical in determining whether the country continues along the path of climate leadership established by President Obama, or allows the oil industry’s puppet party to continue peddling long-debunked myths in order to delay climate action and put future generations at risk.  With global warming constantly breaking temperature records, and dozens of scientific organizations warning policymakers that “To reduce the risk of the most severe impacts of climate change, greenhouse gas emissions must be substantially reduced,” we can no longer use ignorance as an excuse."
"On a hot and lazy afternoon in Palm Beach, the only sign of movement is the water gently lapping at the grounds of Mar-a-Lago, the private club that is the prize of Donald Trump’s real estate acquisitions in Florida. Trump currently dismisses climate change as a hoax invented by China, though he has quietly sought to shield real estate investments in Ireland from its effects. But at the Republican presidential contender’s Palm Beach estate and the other properties that bear his name in south Florida, the water is already creeping up bridges and advancing on access roads, lawns and beaches because of sea-level rise, according to a risk analysis prepared for the Guardian.  In 30 years, the grounds of Mar-a-Lago could be under at least a foot of water for 210 days a year because of tidal flooding along the intracoastal water way, with the water rising past some of the cottages and bungalows, the analysis by Coastal Risk Consulting found. Trump’s insouciance in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence of climate change – even lapping up on his own doorstep – makes him something of an outlier in south Florida, where mayors are actively preparing for a future under climate change. Trump, who backed climate action in 2009 but now describes climate change as “bullshit”, is also out of step with the US and other governments’ efforts to turn emissions-cutting pledges into concrete actions in the wake of the Paris climate agreement. Trump has threatened to pull the US out of the agreement. And the presidential contender’s posturing about climate denial may further alienate the Republican candidate from younger voters and minority voters in this election who see climate change as a gathering danger. When Guardian US asked its readers about their most urgent concern in these elections as part of our Voices of America series, the single issue looming on their minds was climate change. Real estate professionals, with perhaps an extra dash of self-interest, hold similar views. In a survey published in the Miami Herald last month, two-thirds of high-end Miami realtors were concerned sea-level rise and climate change could hurt local property values, up from 56% of them last year. So too for mayors in south Florida. About a third of the civic leaders in south Florida’s compact of mayors are working on strategies to protect their towns from rising seas – and lobbying Florida’s governor and fellow Republicans in Congress to acknowledge the gathering threat.  Elected officials in those same Florida towns say they are already spending heavily to rebuild disappearing beaches and pump out water-logged streets.  Republicans in coastal districts can’t afford to play politics with climate change, said Steve Abrams, a Republican and mayor of Palm Beach County. “We don’t have the luxury at the local level to engage in these lofty policy debates,” said Abrams. “I have been in knee-deep water in many parts of my district during King Tide.” King Tides, the extreme high tides of the autumn, are a growing nuisance in Miami and other areas of south Florida – and are creeping up the manicured lawns of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago from the intracoastal waterway, according to the CRC analysis. Parts of the estate are already at high risk of flooding under heavy rains and storms, the analysis found. By 2045, the storm surge from even a category two storm would bring waters crashing over the main swimming pool and up to the main building, the analysis found. The historic mansion at the heart of Mar-a-Lago is not going to be underwater, “but they are going to have more and more issues with health and safety, access, and infrastructure,” said Keren Bolter, chief scientist for the firm.  Despite Trump’s pronouncements, there is strong evidence that he – personally – could pay the price for climate change in his property interests along the south Florida oceanfront and intracoastal waterway. In south Florida, sea level is projected to rise up to 34in by the middle of the century and as high as 81in by 2100, according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. South of Mar-a-Lago, where the elevation is lower, water already pools in the road in front of the Trump Hollywood condos after the briefest of cloud bursts. The luxury development, where three-bedroom units are on sale for up to $3m apiece, offers “pristine beaches”.  “Right outside your door you’ll find the Hollywood Beach broadwalk, ranked as one of the five best boardwalks in the country,” the company website says. But Peter Bober, a Hollywood native who is now the city’s mayor, said flooding was becoming a regular occurrence, when storms coincided with high tide.  “We have had neighbourhoods where the water has been up to people’s front doors. That is not something that I remember as a kid growing up in the city of Hollywood,” he said.  Meanwhile, the city is spending heavily on pumping systems and to truck in sand to replenish beaches disappearing due to erosion. Bober said he had seen storms with water pouring over the sea walls of the intracoastal. “Water just floods the entire neighbourhood, and there is nothing we can do about it,” Bober said. “We have occasional storms where we are totally overwhelmed.” Such instances are only growing more frequent. Bolter’s modelling suggests Trump’s Hollywood condos could be turned into islands for up to 140 days a year by 2045, cut off from the low-lying A1A coastal road because of tidal flooding and storm surges. Under a category two storm, a storm surge could wash right up to the front gate. Further south, the Trump Grande in Sunny Isles also faces a soggy future, according to the projections. In 30 years, the boundaries of the property could face tidal flooding and storm surges for 97 days a year, cutting off access to the A1A road. The beaches could also be scoured away by erosion. “The big issue here is that if a big storm hits, you have 5ft, 6ft waves, and that is going to eat away even at the grass here. It could push the waves even to where we are standing, And if that is going to eat away this whole area, that could do some serious damage,” Bolter said. Other Trump-branded properties, such as the golf clubs in Doral and Jupiter, are at higher elevations, above the water line amid projected sea-level rise this century. But Bolter said the courses faced different risks from heavy rainfall and poor drainage because of Florida’s high water table.  Scientists have long expected sea level rise on the south-east Florida coast to occur faster than the global average, advancing rapidly on barrier islands and beaches. The low-lying coastal areas are exposed to an additional threat of inland flooding, from the intercoastal waterways, and contamination of fresh water supply by high tides and storm surges. But the pace of sea-level rise has accelerated over the last decade because of the collapse of ice cover in Greenland and Antarctica, and because of the weakening of ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream. Nowhere is this as evident as in south Florida.  Since 2006, the average rate of sea-level rise in south Florida has increased to 9mm a year from 3mm a year, for a total rise over the decade of about 90mm, or about 3.5in, according to Shimon Wdowinski, a research scientist at the University of Miami.  As a result, flooding in Miami Beach and other low-lying areas has doubled over the last decade, Wdowinski found, using tide gauges, rain records, insurance claims and other data to construct the flood record. “People should be aware of where they want to invest for their properties,” he said. “I think for the next 20 years it will be OK, but I don’t know if it will be in 50 or 80 years. That’s a different story.” Other sections of the low-lying south Florida coast are just as vulnerable. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy barely grazed Florida, reserving its fury for New York and New Jersey. But a subsequent storm unleashed huge waves that uprooted traffic lights and street signs, and caused the collapse of a 1.5-mile stretch of the A1A coastal artery in the center of Fort Lauderdale.   “When the road collapsed, that was basically a huge wake-up call,” said Jason Liechty, environmental projects coordinator for Broward County. “Sometimes when you talk about climate change and sea-level rise it seems very abstract, but if you see big chunks of concrete just sticking up out of the road, it becomes very real. “It took $20m and 40,000 truckloads of imported sand so far to raise the mile-long section of road by 2ft, sink in metal sheets 40ft down, and rebuild sand dunes to provide buffers from future storms – and the repairs are still under way four years later.  “So let’s do the math here: you are talking about several hundred million dollars if the whole coast line is affected, and that’s a lot of money,” Liechty said.  A number of towns in south Florida are already beginning to make the investment, calculating that it would be cheaper to put in defences against rising seas now than wait for a catastrophe. Miami Beach is spending $400m to raise roads and install pumps to drain streets that experience regularly flooding at high-tide – and to prevent salt water from contaminating fresh water storage inland.   In other sea level hotspots, such as Hollywood, newer construction – including Trump-branded buildings – are being built on top of steeply graded driveways, above the flood zone.  But for some of south Florida’s cities, there may be no alternative to retreat – even if it means abandoning some of the wealthiest real estate in the country. In his offices in the historic city hall of Coral Gables, James Cason keeps a poster-size map showing a wide swathe of land, sliced up by canals, yacht moorings and multimillion dollar homes in gated communities with elevations below 4ft. About 34 miles of Coral Gables are exposed to the ocean. The entire area – representing about $3bn in property and about 10% of homes – will be underwater in the second half of the century, according to Noaa’s projections.  Two schools, 20 bridges, 21 pumping stations will all be swamped, according to the projections. Some 302 yachts will almost certainly be trapped behind low-lying bridges. Water treatment plants and pumping stations will no longer work. Cason has no patience for those, like Trump, who deny climate change is occurring. “It’s an existential threat to a city like us,” he said. So much so that Cason has hired consultants to contemplate a future when it may no longer be able to engineer a way out of sea-level rise.  “What do you do if and when the water is up so high you can’t provide services – when do you stop charging taxes?” he asked. “If your house is underwater, can you stop paying taxes on it?”  He would like to believe that by the end of the century scientists will have figured out a solution to the rising seas that threaten his city. But there is one thing of which he is certain: Coral Gables will not survive by retreating behind a sea wall.   “There is no Dutch solution,” he said. “You can’t really build a wall around it. It will just come up from below.”"
"The global battle against climate change has passed a historic turning point with China’s huge coal burning finally having peaked, according to senior economists. They say the moment may well be a significant milestone in the course of the Anthropocene, the current era in which human activity dominates the world’s environment. China is the world’s biggest polluter and more than tripled its coal burning from 2000 to 2013, emitting billions of tonnes of climate-warming carbon dioxide. But its coal consumption peaked in 2014, much earlier than expected, and then began falling. The economists argue in a new paper on Monday that this can now be seen as permanent trend, not a blip, due to major shifts in the Chinese economy and a crackdown on pollution. “I think it is a real turning point,” said Lord Nicholas Stern, an eminent climate economist at the London School of Economics, who wrote the analysis with colleagues from Tsinghua University in Beijing. “I think historians really will see [the coal peak of] 2014 as a very important event in the history of the climate and economy of the world.”  The team’s analysis, published in the Nature Geoscience journal, concludes that China’s coal peak “may well be an important milestone in the Anthropocene and a turning point in international efforts to [cut] the emissions of climate-altering greenhouse gases”. The struggle to tame climate change and avoid the “severe, widespread, and irreversible” damage predicted by scientists is often seen as too difficult. Even the successful global climate deal signed in Paris in December is not yet enough to hold world temperatures below a 2C rise, which is seen as the danger limit, and will need to be ratcheted up.  But Stern said he thought the breakthrough in China would drive further action by other nations: “Given the international political and economic structures we now have to manage climate change, I think it will be very influential on others.” The UN’s climate chief, who oversees the global climate negotiations, welcomed the analysis. “This assessment of the possible peaking of China’s coal use is a very positive development in international efforts to address climate change,” said Patricia Espinosa, the incoming executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  She added: “It underlines how ambitious and deliberate policies to shift away from highly polluting fuels to cleaner energy sources can deliver global climate benefits and national improvements in health and indeed in people’s lives.” To enter into force, the Paris climate deal requires the majority of large emitting nations to ratify it. Espinosa said: “I hope these positive developments reported today will encourage more countries to step forward so that Paris enters into force sooner rather than later.” Stern said that China’s progress indicates its total carbon emissions will start falling before 2025, well ahead of its official target date of 2030. Prof John Schellnhuber, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and a former adviser to German premier Angela Merkel and Pope Francis, said it could even happen by 2020, which would represent stunning progress. The peaking of China’s coal use is very significant, Schellnhuber said: “It is a turning point and very good news.” But he argues that another, steeper, downturn in coal burning will be needed in future to stabilise the global climate.  “If we take the 2C target seriously, coal really has to disappear,” he said. “I think coal will have to be phased out completely in all countries of the world by about 2035.” Schellnhuber, one of the world’s most influential climate scientists, said in 2015 that an “induced implosion” of the fossil fuel industry was required to beat climate change. The latest official government statistics from China support the idea that its coal use peaked in 2014. Coal production fell 9.7% in the first half of 2016 compared to 2015, which itself saw a 5.8% decline on 2014, and coal burning fell 3.7% in 2015. China’s total emissions have been near flat in recent years. Stern said there are a series of deep and long-term transformations taking place in China, which means the nation’s falling coal use is now a permanent trend. One is the falling rate of economic growth from 9-10% to about 6% and the transformation of the Chinese economy away from heavy industry and towards more hi-tech and service sectors, which are much less dependent on energy.  There is also a serious focus on improving energy efficiency, he said, to avoid dependency on imported fuels. Another critical factor is a major policy shift from the Chinese government to tackle the pollution of air and water that blights many citizens. Stern said China’s emergence as a global power in recent decades was important too, as well as its self-interest in avoiding global warming. “It is partly the sense of responsibility that China really does feel” as a global power, he said. “But it is also climate change itself. Water has dominated Chinese thinking for millennia and its major rivers come off the Himalayas. What happens to the Himalayas and its ice caps is absolutely crucial to China, and of course climate change is mostly a water phenomenon.” As coal declines, clean electricity in China is increasing rapidly with solar power up 28% in the first half of 2016, nuclear up 25% and wind and hydropower both up 13%. But challenges remain, including connecting new windfarms to the grid. China’s Renewable Energy Industries Association says that 15% of the wind power produced in the country in 2015 was wasted."
"Every election year, candidates for office engage in a perverse form of theater. Some flatter voters or try to scare them, others offer promises of a better future. Unfortunately, few candidates feel an obligation to follow through on campaign pledges or grapple with serious problems confronting our country and planet. Take Barack Obama. He has done far less on climate than his supporters might have expected. Despite claiming COP21 as a victory, Obama’s legacy will tell the story of the US surpassing all other nations in oil and gas production. Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, has called the US “a global warming machine”, adding: “At the moment when physics tell us we should be jamming on the carbon brakes, America is revving the engine.” Today, that lack of leadership on climate change continues. Candidates running for Congress and the presidency aren’t offering real solutions, despite growing scientific alarm.  Small wonder that the Guardian’s readers, when surveyed, resoundingly proclaimed that climate change is one of the most pressing issues that are consistently neglected by our presidential candidates. The fact that many Americans feel this way speaks volumes about the fundamental rift between elected officials and their constituencies. How many casualties, destroyed communities, flooded coastlands, diminished snow packs feeding key Asian rivers, drought-ridden agricultural belts and new disease vectors, will it take to move a more organized American public to demand a transformation of US energy policy? People care about this issue, so why don’t our elected officials seem to reflect that concern? Special interest lobbying has a lot to answer for. Tiffany Germain, in an article for ThinkProgress.org, notes: “170 elected representatives in the 114th Congress have taken over $63.8m from the fossil fuel industry that’s driving the carbon emissions which cause climate change.” Many of those representatives deny climate change is man-made.  John Passacantando, former executive director of Greenpeace in the US, once reportedly told big-oil and gas executives: “You’re going to wish you were the tobacco companies once this stuff hits and people realize you were the ones who blocked [action].” His warning may eventually be proven correct if it turns out their industry lobby is to blame. But that day might be far off. That’s why, in this election year, we cannot afford to let candidates for federal, state and local office lose sight of the perils of climate change. There are many policies our presidential candidates could get behind now. We could outlaw the creation of new fossil-fueled electric power plants, provide federal loans for the construction of renewable energy power plants or enforce green requirements on new homes and buildings – just to list some ideas floated by S David Freeman, an energy expert, in a recent book. All of these are reasonable, possible and necessary steps that our elected officials could be implementing right now, were it not for the corruption that has prevailed in our politics over the last several decades.  This election, voters need to push candidates to support measures that will address the problems associated with climate change – and reporters need to cover this momentous story rigorously. It is time for citizens to organize town meetings and rallies on climate change. It is time for action."
"The Earth’s climate is changing – in fact, it always changes. But in the current context of human influence, scientists try to decipher how much of the change is natural compared to human-induced. One clear way humans influence the Earth is through the biosystem. For instance, farming changes the biosystem. By removing natural growth and planting annual crops that are harvested, we change the system in a way that could in turn affect other parts of the Earth system. In addition, the use of nitrogen based fertilizers can increase growth rate and lead to a greening of areas that are subject to fertilization.   Another more indirect potential for humans to alter plant growth is through fertilization involving carbon dioxide. We know that humans have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by approximately 40%. We also know that airborne carbon dioxide is a fertilizer for plants. So the obvious question is, “do our carbon emissions affect plant growth?”. A new study, just out in Nature Climate Change, helps answer that question. This study focused on land areas in the northern hemisphere that were outside the tropical region. They obtained information from satellites to measure the greening of these lands areas to determine whether there was any significant change. The find that yes, in fact there is. Over approximately 30-year durations, this area has indeed gotten greener.  So, the next question is, what is causing the greening? To answer this question, the authors used computer simulations and ran them with and without human influences. When we say “human influences” we can mean many things, such as increase or decrease of farming, use of fertilizers, and airborne increase of carbon dioxide, just to name a few. The authors found that the only way the simulations matched the observations is when these human influences were included. That is, solely natural variations cannot be the cause. Not only that, but the match worked best when airborne carbon dioxide had a major role. So what does this mean? Does it mean that greenhouse gas pollution is a good thing? Not really. Increased plant growth can have both positive and negative effects. The obvious effects are clear, such as potential improvements in farming or the increase in carbon sequestration by plants. However, increased growth occurs for both intended and unintended plants – including weeds. This could complicate farming, increase airborne allergens, and perhaps most importantly, change the flow of energy and water across the Earth’s surface in unintended ways.  Furthermore, it isn’t clear what will happen to nutritional value of food crops – even if their growth rate increases. What is also very important to recognize is that a changing climate has many things changing at once. For instance, temperatures and rainfall patterns are being altered and these two affect the growth rates. What is really nice about this new study is how they combined satellite images and computer calculations to tease out the separate effects of human and natural variations. I communicated with Peter Thornton, one of the authors. He told me: The study shows that humans have caused significant hemispheric-scale changes in vegetation characteristics over the past three decades, predominantly through the physiological effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration on plant growth. About one quarter of the carbon dioxide placed annually into the atmosphere by fossil fuel combustion has been hypothesized to be removed through enhanced vegetation growth and accumulation of organic carbon in land ecosystems. This study provides statistically robust evidence that vegetation growth is enhanced by higher carbon dioxide concentrations. Land ecosystems insulate society from some of the consequences of our alteration of the chemical composition of the atmosphere. We showed that increased atmospheric CO2 increases plant growth. Increased CO2 also warms the planet. Increased plant growth is the first step in a process that removes a significant fraction of the human-produced CO2 from the atmosphere, which means there is less warming than if land ecosystems were unresponsive to increased CO2. So, to the extent that planetary warming is a bad thing, the fact that plants are helping remove some of the CO2 that causes the warming is a good thing.  His point is that the Earth’s ecosystem is acting in a way to help mitigate our emissions by absorbing more of our annual release of heat-trapping gases, at least for now. That is good news."
"The alarm sounded and in a blink the base thrummed with activity. Smokejumpers grabbed helmets, donned kevlar suits, tested radios and strapped on parachutes. A speaker blasted Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries. “Final checks, OK, let’s go,” boomed a command. Within minutes eight smokejumpers were airborne in a Twin Otter, climbing into a blue Idaho sky. The plane soon returned, empty, to pick up another eight jumpers. Below them stretched wilderness with names such as Hells Canyon, Thunderbolt Mountain and River of No Return: America’s rugged, spectacularly beautiful west – the part that burns.  Here, a single spark can ignite a huge wildfire that reduces forests to charred stumps and homes to ash.  Smokejumpers are the elite firefighters; their job is to leap into the void, hike to a blaze others cannot reach, and kill it. They have been doing this since 1939.  But the rules – the fires – are changing. The jumpers that took off from the base at McCall on this particular morning saw no flames – it was a training mission – but the landscape betrayed an ominous new reality.  Snow had retreated unusually fast from the mountain peaks that ring this corner of Idaho. Instead of gleaming white slopes, there was bare grey granite. A spring heatwave triggered record snowmelt here and in parts of Oregon and Washington state.  It’s part of a trend of drier winters, warmer springs and hotter summers. Climate change has extended the west’s traditional fire season by 78 days since the 1970s, running from June to October. Fires start earlier and burn longer. The US’s lower 48 states just experienced the hottest June on record, surpassing 1933 dust bowl records, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It warned that this year could set a record for the most billion-dollar weather disasters. “2016 has been hot, wet and wild for the contiguous US,” said NOAA climate scientist Jake Crouch. The legacy of a century of fire suppression, which has left forests overgrown, has also contributed to the average fire doubling in size. Wildfires, in others words, are getting wilder. Smokejumpers have deployed in recent weeks in Alaska and Washington and are bracing for missions elsewhere. California’s season has gotten off to an explosive start with multiple blazes scorching tens of thousands of acres, destroying scores of structures and claiming at least two lives. Some 10.1m acres burned in the US last year, double the typical losses seen 30 years ago, pushing the federal government’s firefighting bill to $2bn and the US forest service’s budget to the breaking point. For smokejumpers, arguably more than anyone, the stakes have escalated. “Impressive fire growth has become the new norm. You need to be more engaged and focused when you’re out there,” said Hans Ohme, acting assistant operations foreman at the McCall base, and veteran of more than 250 jumps. “It seems like we’re breaking records more and more.” It has added a sense of urgency to the pre-summer ritual in McCall, a picturesque resort town on the edge of Payette Lake.  Along with blooming flowers, you can tell fire season looms by the sight of would-be smokejumpers hauling 120lb (54kg) packs on gruelling treks, part of rookie bootcamp training, plus the sound of grunts, whirring pulleys and clanging bars at the base, where veterans return for refresher parachute courses. A suspended harness that drops them on the dirt, mimicking a landing, is nicknamed the “mutilator”. “It’s time to get focused again,” said Damon Neeson, 49, who has done more than 400 jumps, as two colleagues whizzed towards him on a zipline. “The work stays the same but it starts earlier and ends later.” He downplayed any mystique about the job. “All we do for the most part is dig shallow trenches in the forest. Dig a line around the fire, put it out.” True, if modest. In the same vein one could say Neil Armstrong collected rocks for a living. The main idea behind smokejumping is to extinguish small, remote fires before they grow into monsters. It fills a gap for when there are no roads and aerial spraying is not available or effective.  Smokejumpers use hand tools, notably a pulaski axe, to clear vegetation around a blaze and deny it fuel. Conditions can change in an instant – embers carried on a gust of wind; a burning tree branch cracking and rolling down a hill. They test the soil’s temperature with bare hands to make sure a fire is dead. Then they pack up all their gear, which can weigh more than they do, and hike out of the wilderness. You face something new every time you go out of the plane. It’s up to you to figure it out “You face something new every time you go out of the plane,” said Zachary Freundlich, 28, who was starting his second season. “It’s up to you to figure it out.” The forest service and the bureau of land management employ about 400 smokejumpers, scattered at bases around the western US, plus Alaska.  They are a tiny group in the firefighting community but have an outsized reputation, which draws applicants from other elite branches such as hotshot and helitack crews. Some flunk out on the first day of bootcamp. “It’s very challenging. (Trainers) break them down physically and mentally,” Ohme said.  Those who make it through emerge with sculpted physiques and bone-crushing handshakes. Reality TV shows, sensing a market for hunks in peril, have lobbied for access. The smokejumpers turned them down – they don’t want to be tripping over camera crews. Those who work seasonally tend to use the colder months to study or travel, often combining skiing and surfing. There have been female smokejumpers since 1981, though they remain a small minority. Ashley Taylor, 30, was the sole female among McCall’s 60-plus jumpers. “I love it. I feel part of the group, part of the family. But it’s not for everyone.” A highlight for Taylor was helping native crews fight a fire in Alaska last year. Ashley Taylor, polevaulter-turned Smokejumper. Hauls 110lb+ pack through burning wilderness. Loves her job. pic.twitter.com/UkNXgSaemP More than 30 have died in the line of duty. The first was Malvin Brown, part of an all-black army paratrooper unit assigned to firefighting in 1945. He landed in a tree and fell into a creek. The most recent was Mark Urban, whose chute opened late in a jump in 2013. Fire claimed others. Flames can move so high and fast they catch birds mid-flight. If caught in a “burnover”, a smokejumper’s last resort is a personal shelter, a special foil that reflects heat and traps cool air. But when temperatures exceed 1,000 degrees – they can reach 2,800 degrees – superheated air can penetrate shelters and suffocate you in seconds. Smokejumpers have been featured in films such as Steven Spielberg’s Always and in novels by Nora Roberts and Nicholas Evans, which play up the danger.  Jason Ramos, a Washington-based veteran, said in a recent memoir that some fire managers consider smokejumpers a “colorful anachronism”, too expensive and dangerous to deploy. In reality, Ramos said, smokejumpers are safety-conscious and a good value. Colleagues at McCall stressed the focus on safety, saying the daredevil image masked rules and protocols to minimise risk. As a result, fire was something to respect, not fear, said Nelson, the veteran. “If you’re scared, you’re doing something wrong. I haven’t been scared in a fire since a long time ago.” If you’re scared, you’re doing something wrong. I haven’t been scared in a fire since a long time ago With much of the western US a tinderbox, smokejumpers won’t be out of work any time soon.  “We are seeing real challenges on the ground – climate change is real and it is with us,” Robert Bonnie, undersecretary for natural resources and environment at the US Department of Agriculture, told the Guardian in February. “The whole US forest service is shifting to becoming an agency dominated by wildfires. We really are at a tipping point. The current situation is not sustainable.” Western forests are battling not only drought but bark beetles that thrive in dry, warm conditions. They have killed billions of shrubs and trees in one of the biggest forest insect outbreaks ever recorded. Dead trees increase wildfire risks.  So, too, does the legacy of a century of fire suppression. Huge fires in the late 19th and early 20th centuries prompted an aggressive stamp-out-all-fires policy even though wildfires can be natural and beneficial aids to clearing undergrowth and renewing ecosystems. The result: vegetation multiplied and forests thickened, in some places sevenfold. Firefighters compare the effect to a timebomb.  The policy now is to let more wildfires burn. But often that’s not possible. Either because a human caused the fire, in which case it must be fought, or because human settlement has encroached into the forest, putting lives and property in need of saving. Enter the smokejumpers, floating from the sky.  The practice jumps at McCall went smoothly. Two Twin Otters each made two runs to drop a total of 32 jumpers onto a meadow in Bear Basin. For many it was the first jump of the season, a chance to shake off winter rust. With global temperature in March shattering a century-long record, the smokejumpers could be considered climate change’s first responders but they prefer to leave the science – and politics – to others.  They are, said Todd Franzen, 44, a base foreman, just firefighters who happen to get to jump out of planes. “It’s pretty addicting. It hasn’t become old hat for me and this is my 19th year. Day to day you can be sent to Alaska, Nevada, wherever. It’s the unknown.”"
"Trade negotiators in Brussels are proposing new loopholes on a G20 pledge to phase out fossil fuel subsidies within a decade, in the latest leaked TTIP proposals seen by the Guardian. The EU’s draft text for a trade and sustainable development chapter also appears to draw an equivalence between the need to prevent trade distortions and the fight against climate change.  The leak will provide fresh ammunition to critics of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) free trade deal, who fear that its provisions could undermine hard-won climate commitments. One of these was a pledge in May to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 – which currently run at $10m (£7.5m) a minute – by G7 ministers at a summit in Japan. The EU’s proposal will be discussed in a 14th round of TTIP negotiations currently underway in Brussels. It says that both the EU and US share the goal of phasing out such subsidies, where this “encourages wasteful consumption”. But “such a phasing out may take into account security of supply considerations and be accompanied by measures to alleviate the social consequences associated with the phasing out,” the proposal says.  Critics of the TTIP deal see “security of supply considerations” as a get-out that could be liberally invoked by fossil-fuel dependent countries, while action to ease the ending of fossil fuels largesse could be a potential new subsidy in disguise. Colin Roche, a spokesman for Friends of the Earth Europe, described the climate provisions in the text as “an ineffective fig leaf” for a destructive trade deal.  He said: “While seemingly supporting the commitment to end fossil fuel subsidies, the EU and the US are using TTIP to give themselves a get-out clause. Effectively, they are watering down their commitment. Preventing climate destruction should be priority number one. Fossil fuel subsidies should be public enemy number one.” The classified document, which is marked ‘restricted: trade sensitive’ and dated 23 June, specifically covers climate aspects of the TTIP free trade deal.  It restates existing commitments to the Paris climate deal and pledges to facilitate the trade in environmental goods and services.  However, in the document’s Article 5, it also says that: “When developing public support systems, the Parties will take proper account of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to limit distortions of trade as much as possible.” Much hinges on how the proposal is interpreted. It could be used to help families in energy poverty, and maintain baseload electricity production while renewable sources are coming online, according to Guntram Wolff, the director of the Bruegel thinktank in Brussels.  However, “both clauses are sufficiently vague that there may be significant risks of their being misused,” he said. “It’s hellishly complicated with 28 countries having 28 different concerns. In the end, it will as always boil down to making sure that it is not misused, and that is very difficult.”  Cécile Toubeau, a member of the European commission’s TTIP advisory panel, and the Transport and Environment campaign group, saw goodwill in the text, even if there were also devils in its detail.  She said: “If TTIP wants to be set the global ‘golden’ standards it should tackle production fossil fuel subsidies, a highly trade distorting instrument, in a legally binding chapter. Without a concrete timeframe to end fossil fuel subsidies, it will be impossible to stop our oil addiction and therefore uphold the Paris deal.”  A spokesman for the European commission said: “TTIP is not about increasing the amount of fossil fuels that Europeans use. It fits into the EU’s broader strategy of finding different, cleaner sources for the energy that we need. It will do this by removing barriers to the trade in energy between ourselves and our ally, the United States.”"

"An Australian company is using “cheap as dirt” iron ore to convert methane in natural gas into hydrogen. Importantly, their process generates near-zero emissions, as the carbon content of the gas is captured in the form of high-quality graphite.  As a clean-burning fuel, hydrogen could play a key role in future energy markets, but production methods are still too energy-intensive and costly.   Hazer Group is a Perth-based company, spun out of the University of Western Australia, which plans to halve the cost of hydrogen production. It is currently scaling-up its patented process, based on “methane cracking”.  “The chemistry is remarkably simple,” says Geoff Pocock, the managing director of the ASX-listed company, which raised A$5m at its initial public offering in September 2015. “You can think of it as a self-sequestering energy production system.” As natural gas passes through the heated iron ore catalyst, methane in the gas breaks down into its constituent elements: hydrogen and carbon. But instead of carbon dioxide, would-be emissions are captured in the form of solid graphite. Some of the hydrogen is used to power the system, and in the surplus “you’ve got a hydrogen source, which hasn’t got a CO2 footprint,” he says. Halving the cost of hydrogen What’s most intriguing about Hazer’s process is the ultra-cheap catalyst and the secondary commodity in graphite, which can be sold to offset production costs. Graphite is used in the production of lithium-ion batteries, and while prices vary depending on the quality, Pocock says it averages at about US$1,000 per tonne. Globally, the graphite market is worth around US$13bn annually. “The early stage indication is certainly that it has the potential to be not only the cleanest but the cheapest way of making hydrogen globally,” says Pocock.  “We’re using a catalyst that, in Western Australia in particular, is as cheap as dirt. You can throw it away when you don’t need it anymore, and it suddenly means that the catalyst cost comes out of the economics of the process. “Our goal is to be halving or more than halving the cost [of hydrogen production], so taking it from $1 to $1.50, down to $0.50 to $0.75 per kilogram.” A gateway to cleaner energy When hydrogen is combusted to generate heat, or used in fuel cells to generate electricity, the only byproduct is water. As a result, it has long been heralded as a low-carbon energy carrier, which could replace gasoline as a transport fuel, powering electric vehicles, or natural gas as fuel to heat buildings. But less than 5% of the 65m tonnes of hydrogen produced each year (comprising a market worth about US$100bn annually) is currently used for energy applications, says Pocock. Hydrogen is primarily used as an industrial chemical in the oil and gas industries, and for producing ammonia, which is used to make fertiliser and explosives. Many companies set up energy-intensive, greenhouse gas-emitting production plants on-site, to make hydrogen where it’s needed.  Hazer has long-term plans to build and operate small and medium-sized plants that will be cost-competitive with on-site industrial chemical plants. Pocock says there would also be an opportunity to sell hydrogen to buyers in energy markets, either as a bulk commodity or as electricity.  With a clean, cost-effective production process enabling more energy applications, he says the $100bn per year hydrogen market could grow significantly. Methane cracking made viable with iron ore The chemistry of methane cracking has been understood since the 1950s. But until now, catalysts – such as nickel – were typically more expensive than the resulting graphite. This created an economic dilemma: graphite forms in layers on the surface of the catalyst, and at a certain point, causes it to deactivate, or stop working. But because the catalysts were so expensive, producers needed a way to recover them for future use. This additional step in the process was costly and involved burning off the graphite.  “That’s why the use of iron ore is such a benefit,” says Pocock. “What it’s doing is reducing the economic barrier of this process being commercialised.” While there are some CO2 emissions associated with mining iron ore, Pocock says these aren’t a factor for Hazer because they use a relatively small amount of the mineral.  For each tonne of iron ore used as a catalyst, Hazer will be able to produce up to 10 tonnes of hydrogen, says Pocock. Similarly, the company doesn’t factor in the emissions associated with producing natural gas. Pocock says this is true of alternative hydrogen producers, who also rely on fossil fuels.  “As long as you’re comparing like for like, you are getting a legitimate picture of the overall CO2 reduction between each process”, he says.  Advances in iron ore catalysis of interest to science Dr Ken Chiang is a chemical engineer at CSIRO, who is not involved with Hazer Group. While Chiang couldn’t comment on Hazer’s specific process, he says iron ore has been “considered as an option for a catalyst by many research groups”.  “Iron ore is much cheaper than many commercial catalysts,” he says. “Any development in iron ore catalysis will be very interesting fundamentally.” He says graphite will provide the company with an additional income stream. Hazer Group, which formed in 2010, is currently working with scientists at the University of Sydney’s Laboratory of Sustainable Technologies to scale up their process. By the end of 2017, the company plans on having a pilot plant capable of producing tens to hundreds of kilograms of hydrogen per day, or about 30 tonnes per year. To reach an industrially relevant scale, it will need to build plants that can produce more than 10,000 tonnes per year, says Pocock.  He says the company is also interested in using methane from bio-gas, derived from plants and other organic matter.  In this way, Hazer could effectively become a carbon sink, he says.  “If you look at the whole [carbon] cycle, the carbon that was previously atmospheric CO2 could be stored in the form of sustainable, commercially viable graphite.” "
"The UK is poorly prepared for the inevitable impacts of global warming in coming decades, including deadly annual heatwaves, water shortages and difficulties in producing food, according the government’s official advisers. Action must be taken now, according to the report from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) published on Tuesday, with more widespread flooding and new diseases among the risks in most urgent need of addressing.  The CCC further warns that climate-stoked wars and migration around the world could have very significant consequences for the UK, through disrupted trade and more military intervention overseas. The 2,000-page report is a comprehensive assessment of the dangers of climate change to the UK, produced over three years by 80 experts and reviewed by many more. The main analysis is based on thetemperature rise expected if the global climate agreement signed in Paris in 2015 is fully delivered and also takes account of plans already in place to cope with impacts.  The worst case scenarios in the CCC report - if action to tackle climate change completely fails - foresees searing heatwaves reaching temperatures of 48C in London and the high-30s across the nation. “We are not sufficiently prepared and we need to do more now, even for the [Paris deal] scenario of 2.7C of warming,” said Lord John Krebs, chair of the CCC’s adaptation sub-committee. “Many impacts are affecting us now, as climate change is already happening.” “What we now think of as an extremely hot summer, where people are dying of heat stress and it is extremely uncomfortable in homes, hospitals and much of transport, that is likely to be a typical summer by the middle of the century and would be a cool summer in the 2080s,” he said. Krebs said critical facilities, such as hospitals and care homes, are particularly at risk: “Many are not designed to be resilient in terms of overheating.” Many are also in already flood prone areas, the report noted, with the risk of flooding set to rise further. While most of the key risks are fairly well understood, the dangers posed by new diseases and pests invading the UK as the climate gets warmer requires urgent research, the CCC said.  “The impacts are potentially high for otherwise healthy people, animals and plants,” the report states. “Higher temperatures will lead to an increased risk of the Asian tiger mosquito, the vector of Chikungunya virus, dengue fever and Zika virus. The current risk remains low, but may increase in the future.” There could be some benefits to the UK from climate change including exports of products and services such as flood defence expertise, the CCC said, and UK tourism may also increase. A longer growing season could boost crops, the report said, but only if the impact of climate change on water supplies and soil fertility can be overcome. “Already 85% of the rich peat topsoils of East Anglia has disappeared,” said Krebs, due to drainage and erosion. “We have lost a lot of the natural asset that allows us to grow cereals and climate change will accelerate the rate of loss. We could lose the remaining fertile soil within the next 30-60 years and that would be a huge negative impact on the food production capacity of the UK.” Food supplies will also be affected by the impact of global warming around the planet, as the UK imports 40% of its food. “But it is not an expectation that there will be supermarket shelves with nothing on,” said Matthew Bell, CCC chief executive. “It is more likely that food becomes more expensive, particularly with spikes in prices as some supply chains are affected.”  The report warns of other overseas risks to the UK, including a rising need for military intervention: “There are uncertain but potentially very significant international risks arising from climate-related human [migration], and the possibility of violent inter‑state conflict over scarce natural resources.”  “These impacts are transported to the UK through the movement of people and capital, through international supply chains and also through the demands upon the UK in terms of overseas military effort,” said Daniel Johns, the CCC’s head of adaptation. Climate change is becoming more apparent today, with temperature records being smashed amid a succession of record hot years. Amber Rudd, energy and climate change secretary, said at the end of June that global warming is “one of the most serious long-term risks to our economic and national security”.  A government spokesman said: “We are committed to making sure the UK is prepared for the challenges of climate change. That is why we are investing record amounts in flood defences and developing a long-term plan for the environment.” UK law requires the government to use the CCC report to develop its adaptation plan, although spending on the issue halved under the coalition government. “The CCC report is a tour de force,” said Prof Chris Rapley, a climate scientist at University College London. “It is a hugely valuable instrument for seeking to keep our government honest and true to its responsibilities of protecting the interests of UK citizens and businesses now and in the future.” Climate change increased the chance of last winter’s devastating floods by 40%, noted Prof Joanna Haigh, at Imperial College London: “That is why this report is so important, as it starkly sets out the challenges we face and the urgency of addressing them. Some impacts are now inevitable.” Friends of the Earth’s Guy Shrubsole said: “This is a stern warning for squabbling politicians that the biggest threat to our future is from massive climate disruption. Theresa May must make climate change a top priority.” “The CCC’s analysis shows red and yellow lights flashing all over the dashboard,” said Tom Viita, at Christian Aid. “The new Prime Minister [May] must chair a Climate Cobra Committee to handle these risks more effectively and with the urgency required.” Marylyn Haines Evans, at the National Federation of Women’s Institutes said: “This report is worrying because it shows just how close the risks of climate change really are for all of us. We cannot leave this problem as a legacy for our children and grandchildren.”  Heatwaves The deadly heatwave of 2003, which peaked at 38.5C in the UK, will be a normal summer by the 2040s, leading to related deaths more than tripling. There are currently no policies to ensure homes, schools, hospitals and offices remain tolerable in high heat. Floods and coastal erosion Flooding already causes £1bn of damage every year on average but the risks will rise yet further as climate change leads to more intense rainfall, bringing floods to places not currently in danger. The number of households at significant risk of flooding will more than double to 1.9m by 2050, if the global temperature rises by 4C. Water shortages Severe water shortages are expected as summers get drier and, by the 2050s, will extend across the UK. If temperatures are driven up significantly, many places in the UK will have a demand for water 2.5 times greater than that available. Natural environment The proportion of prime farmland is expected to fall from 38% to 9% with significant warming and crop growing in eastern England and Scotland could be ended by degraded soil and water shortages. Warming seas are pushing key species northwards, which may affect the entire marine food chain. Food Climate change is likely to drive food prices up, with extreme weather leading to lost crops and price shocks. About 40% of UK food is imported, making the UK vulnerable to droughts and floods driven by climate change around the world."
"“You lot [earth lovers] won’t be happy till there’s rose petals coming out the exhaust,” a car industry insider complained to me. I’d settle for an electric vehicle. Not emission free (you have to factor in the source of the electricity), but a technology that can make a real dent in climate-change emissions. My next car needs to be an EV – and so does yours.  Analysts at Bloomberg claim that if 35% of global new car sales (41m a year) were EVs (as predicted by 2040) that would cut global oil consumption by 14%. The Committee on Climate Change states that the UK needs 60% of new cars and vans to be electric by 2030 to meet our 2050 climate-change targets. It’s been 20 years since Toyota kicked off the green car revolution with the Prius, and recently Top Gear featured the new Tesla. But the Model X costs £72,280, so it hardly screams mass transition. Volkswagen can’t scrub the rogue particles of the diesel-emissions scandal from our lungs, but will try and scrub its reputation by launching 30 EV models by 2035 and investing in car-sharing companies. Zipcar car-sharing club has just introduced 50 Volkswagen Golf GTE plug-in hybrid vehicles around London. But what can be done about my range anxiety (the fear of running out of charge in an EV)? Ecotricity has invested in a network of charging points, and Tesla has its own network of Superchargers. Check all charging points on evhighwaystatus.co.uk or zap-map.com. Until 2017 you can get a rebate on the cost of hybrid and electric vehicles in the UK – about 35% off the price. I’d like to have my dream EV before humankind shifts to the driverless car. Significantly greener, they will soon be trialled in Greenwich, south London. That would be just my luck. Filmmaker Borja Zausen has found a remarkable way to capture his subject. He’s a pioneer in zero-emission filmmaking and his latest work records the life of another hero. Miguel is the 11-year-old star of Som Pastor (I Am a Shepherd).

"The US experienced its warmest ever June last month, with a scorching summer set to compound a string of climate-related disasters that have already claimed dozens of lives and cost billions of dollars in damage this year. Worldwide, heat records have been broken for 13 months in a row, an unprecedented streak of warmth that has stunned climate scientists and heightened concerns over the future livability of parts of the planet.  The average temperature for the contiguous US was 71.8F (22.1C) in June – a full 3.3F (1.8C) above the 20th-century average and breaking a record set in 1933. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the first six months of 2016 have been the third warmest on record in the US. Drought conditions “remain entrenched across much of California” according to Noaa, with 16% of the contiguous US in drought – up 3.5% compared to May.  The US has already suffered a number of climate- and weather-related calamities in 2016, with Noaa recording eight events that have each cost at least $1bn in damages. More than 30 lives have been lost in disasters including flooding in Texas, tornadoes across the south-east and wildfires in the west.  The figures don’t including recent flooding in West Virginia that has claimed the lives of 23 people and wrecked more than 1,200 homes. “How much more record heat and how many more unprecedented extreme weather disasters must be witnessed before we all recognize this simple fact: climate change is real, it is human-caused, and it is already posing an extreme risk to us and the planet,” Michael Mann, a leading climatologist at Penn State University, told the Guardian. “The good news is that there is still time to act to avert the most dangerous impacts. But not a whole lot of time.” Much of the US is currently sweltering in a heatwave, with New York, Connecticut and Virginia set to experience at least three consecutive days over 90F (32C). Boston, Philadelphia and Washington have already experienced temperatures above 90F, with southern states basking in temperatures significantly above average. Heat warnings have been issued in cities including New Orleans and Macon, Georgia. This year is almost certain to be the warmest on record globally, beating a mark set in 2014 and then again in 2015. The chances of three record-breaking years of heat without climate change induced through the burning of fossil fuels is about one in a million, according to Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and colleagues."

"Last week it was announced that June was the warmest June on record – making it the 14th consecutive month of a record being set. It comes at a time our government and many in the media remain wilfully resistant to efforts to combat climate change, and at a time when the data should worry everyone. One of the best things about the election result has been the cabinet reshuffle, which has seen Greg Hunt no longer the minister for the environment. I once called him the emptiest suit in the history of Australian politics, and maybe that was wrong because given how he exited the role, perhaps a better descriptor is the biggest troll in Australian politics.  On leaving the job Hunt, told reporters that “I feel as if my work is done.” No minister for the environment could look at the data of global temperatures and think their work is done – especially if the majority of their work involved pushing the con of Direct Action onto the public.  The temperature data is now at such a point that it requires absurd levels of conspiracy theory to suggest climate change is not occurring.  Last week the US agencies, Nasa and Noaa announced the June figures. We shouldn’t be too shocked about them – according to Noaa it was the 14th consecutive month in which a new record had been set. The news from Nasa is not as horrible – June was just the ninth consecutive record-setting month. About the best you can say about June is that at least it wasn’t as big a record as the previous months have been this year: If this was just a one-off you wouldn’t get too worried. Monthly temperatures bounce around a bit – especially when weather events like El Nino are in play.  In 1998, for example a record global surface temperature for June of 0.77C above the 1950-1981 average came off the back of a strong El Nino system. That record lasted for 14 years – until last year when another strong El Nino came along. And despite those conditions dissipating, last month the record was broken again: Looking at just one month – even going back to 1880 – can hide a lot of the story.  It’s when we start looking at averages of six to 12 months and longer that we really see the trends in all their blinding obviousness. The global surface temperature for the first six months of this year averaged 1.1C above the 1951-80 average:  The first half of this year was not just warmest than ever on record, it was the warmest on record by a long way. Since 1880, the record for the warmest first six months of a year has been set 14 times – half of them since 1980. The average increase in the record has been just 0.08C, and yet this year the record was broken by 0.28C: And, I know, let’s calm the horses – look at the trend, not the records which only occur because of unusual weather systems. Is a 50 year trend enough to cut through the noise? It sure as heck should be, and what it shows should be absolutely clear unless you have tripped over while reading this and your screen is now upside down:  And yet we have no strong push for a policy response. Instead we have media outlets publishing front page articles using slanted analysis to suggest renewable energy is causing electricity prices to sky rocket, and we have Greg Hunt all happy because his work was done.  And that work – fully supported by Malcolm Turnbull – was Direct Action, a policy designed not to do anything to combat the climate but only to appease climate change deniers. We know Direct Action is a con.  We know this not just because of the excellent work done by Lenore Taylor prior to the election pointing out the targets under Direct Action are only achievable with an emission trading system that is implicitly in place and yet denied by Hunt. And we know it not just because much of the money spent on Direct Action is spent on things that would have been done anyway. We really know it is a con because it is so bloody cheap. No one thinks dealing with climate change is easy – even those who deny climate change exists argue against the massive cost involved in combating it. And yet Direct Action was budgeted to cost just $2.55bn over four years. So at an average of $637.5m a year that equals just 0.039% of GDP or 0.14% of annual government expenditure. Is there anyone who thinks the whole reason governments around the world haven’t agreed to do something about climate change is because they didn’t want to spend around a tenth of one percent of their annual budget on it? Governments love to sign a cheque and solve a problem. If Direct Action was all you needed to do, no one would be worried – it’d have been done without barely a whimper of controversy. Now there is also the Renewable Energy Target – which was reduced while Hunt was environment minister – but the emissions reduction fund is the central plank of the government’s policy. And the government tried to persuade us that for $637.5m a year they could dust their hands and say our work here is done? Even Donald Trump might blanch at such brazen contempt of the voting public. And yeah I know, I love my graphs and I can get carried away by data.  But while I spend most of my time writing about economics, climate data is what hits me right in the gut. Because if the world keeps warming like it is, talking about GDP, and capital expenditure and interest rates, and our current housing affordability situation will all be rather quaint.  People will look back to this “new normal” of “low growth” and think, “Cripes, what a golden age”.  And we are not talking too far ahead either.  The agreed level we need to avoid is 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Nasa use the average of 1951-80 which is already around 0.3C higher. So that means the first six months of this year were 1.39C above pre-industrial levels.  But yeah, what about the trend? Stop trying to scare us with abnormal conditions!  When we extrapolate out the trend of the last 50 years, we get to that 2 degree mark by 2070: Just 54 years away. As close to now as was 1962.  Think of that when you look at your daughter or grandson, or yourself in the mirror should you too be hoping to still be around in 54 years time.  Now ok, maybe I’m being extremist – after all the past 50 years might have been a bad 50 years. What about since 1998 – we all know since then warming has slowed down – some would say stopped. Well if you start the trend from August 1998 – when the 12 month average was at its peak that year, we do get a bit more time till we hit 2C – a whole 10 extra years:  And remember this is assuming the trend from here on is linear – which given where we are at today is pretty conservative.  Remember as well something has to happen well before we get to 2C warmer – some suggest the tipping point might already have been reached.  But let us end on a note of accord. To be honest, I agree with Greg Hunt – his work here is done. May that mean he never has anything to do with environmental policy again. "

"Andrea Leadsom, the new environment secretary, supports foxhunting and once said she wanted to end farming subsidies. The pro-Brexit cabinet minister, who was Theresa May’s leadership rival before pulling out on Monday, was a surprise appointment to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).  Leadsom’s new role has alarmed environmentalists, who highlighted her previous confusion about whether climate change is real and her support for a repeal of the hunting ban. During her short leadership campaign, Leadsom pledged to hold a vote on bringing back foxhunting, saying it was “absolutely not proven to be in the interest of animal welfare whatsoever”. She said there was a “need to exterminate vermin, which foxes are” and called for a “proper, licensed regime”.  After becoming energy minister in 2015, Leadsom admitted having asked officials whether climate change was real. “When I first came to this job one of my two questions was: ‘Is climate change real?’ and the other was ‘Is hydraulic fracturing safe?’ And on both of those questions, I am now completely persuaded,” she told the all-party parliamentary group on unconventional gas and oil in October last year. However, since then she has repeatedly made it clear that decarbonising the energy supply is crucial and that this will not change after leaving the EU. “It is an essential responsibility that we hold towards our children and grandchildren, as the only way to effectively counter the threat of climate change,” she said this month. Despite this assurance, Andrew Cooper, a Green party energy spokesman, said: “By appointing Andrea Leadsom – a woman who supports foxhunting and has consistently voted against measures to tackle climate change – as environment secretary, and scrapping the Department for Energy and Climate Change entirely, May appears to be sending a clear message that fighting climate change is simply not on her agenda.” In her new job, Leadsom will have the task of devising a new system to allocate money for farmers that currently comes through the EU through the common agricultural policy (CAP).  During the campaign, she said cash for farmers should continue “in the short term whilst we think about what makes sense”, which may cause concern in the industry given their reliance on subsidies. Leadsom hinted there should be wider a shakeup of the system, saying: “Some of the things that would make sense would be environmental trading credits, because at the moment you have farmers who have to do a bit of environmental planning and a bit of farming just to meet the EU requirements.  “It would make so much more sense if those with the big fields do the sheep, and those with the hill farms do the butterflies. That would make a lot more sense for the UK and it’s perfectly possible but only if we leave the EU and sort it out for ourselves.” In 2007, Leadsom argued that “subsidies must be abolished” in an article on how to rejuvenate British farming.  Farmers currently get up to £3bn a year in EU subsidies through CAP, making up 55% of an average farmer’s income of around £20,000 in 2014. Whatever British agricultural policy replaces CAP, Leadsom will have the task of working out a fair new system that protects farming livelihoods."
"By 2030, the UN wants to reduce the exposure of the global poor to climate-related extreme events. Given that nearly two thirds of those earning less than $1.25 a day make a living from agriculture – an industry directly affected by climate change – rural communities must be a key focus for poverty alleviation. To date, however, small-scale farmers and seasonal workers have struggled to access the finance they need to help them build resilience and tackle climate change risks. So what’s being done to address this imbalance and work towards the goal of ending rural poverty? This seminar, supported by Oikocredit, brings together a panel of experts to debate: Chair – Lucy Siegle, broadcaster and Guardian journalist Lebi Hudson, general manager, Rungwe Smallholders Tea Association Urvi Kelkar, livelihoods and economic impact manager, SABMiller Frank Rubio, head of global agriculture, Oikocredit Paul Steele, chief economist, International Institute for Environment and Development Wednesday 21 September 2016, 6pm-8.30pm BST The Guardian offices, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London, N1 9GU If you would like to put your name forward to attend, please fill in the form below.

"The Great Barrier Reef could be considered again for an “in danger” listing by the United Nations World Heritage Committee following the devastating bleaching this year, the Guardian can reveal. The news came as a group of prominent lawyers, scientists and NGOs wrote to the committee, urging it to ask Australia to do more to protect the reef. As a condition of UNESCO not listing the Great Barrier Reef as “in danger” in 2015, the World Heritage Committee said Australia needed to report back to the committee on 1 December 2016, detailing the progress of conservation – how new 2050 water pollution targets were being implemented and funded. Scientists have said current policies and funding announcements are not even nearly adequate for meeting the 2050 targets, and between $10bn and $16bn was needed. If UNESCO and the World Heritage Committee find they have not been adequately implemented or funded, the reef could be considered again for inclusion on the “in danger” list at a meeting in 2017. But the Guardian can now reveal Australia will also need to report on how it is dealing with the current bleaching, where almost a quarter of the coral on the reef has been killed. “We would expect that that report from Australia is going to cover all the significant things that have happened since June 2015 and whether there are changes in the picture of the management or the response that is needed,” said Tim Badman, director of the IUCN’s World Heritage Programme, which advises the Committee on the state of its natural world heritage properties. “The bleaching event is a new issue to be considered.” State of Conservation reports, which are addressed to the World Heritage Committee, help it implement new conservation actions. They are produced for the most threatened natural world heritage sites, and only if there are new issues that need to be considered. The IUCN says: “In extreme cases, where a site is in ascertained or potential danger of losing the Outstanding Universal Value for which it was inscribed on the World Heritage List, the Committee may decide to inscribe it on the Danger List.” One such report was produced on the Great Barrier Reef in 2015, and that year the World Heritage Committee came close to listing the Reef on the Danger List. Badman told the Guardian the IUCN would also decide, in the first few months of 2017, whether or not a new state of conservation report was needed, given the damage to the reef. “We’re seeing new issues with the bleaching event as a new part of the issue to be considered,” Badman said. But he said whether or not the bleaching would lead to consideration of inclusion on the Danger List was speculation and not something the IUCN or UNESCO would comment on at this stage. The Australian government spent $400m lobbying for the Great Barrier Reef not to be included on the list, Fairfax media revealed last year, and the environment minister, Greg Hunt, has said the reef is the “work of his life”. Ever since the decision was made not to list the reef, Hunt has trumpeted it as evidence of the government’s good management, saying the government got the reef taken off a “watch list”. According to lawyers at Environmental Justice Australia, the reef already met the inclusion criteria for an “in danger” listing before the mass bleaching event this year. Meanwhile, most major Australian environmental NGOs, as well as a group of prominent scientists, including John Veron, Will Steffen and Terry Hughes, have expressed their dismay at Australia’s actions since the decision last year and urged the World Heritage Committee to demand more of Australia. “Since the World Heritage Committee considered the threats to the reef at its meeting in mid-2015, Australia has approved the expansion of the coal export port at Abbot Point within and adjacent to the world heritage area,” they said in a letter addressed to members of the World Heritage Committee. “This project would require dredging 1.1m cubic metres of previously undisturbed seagrass habitat within the world heritage area and dumping the dredge spoil adjacent to nearby coastal wetlands.” It continued: “To add insult to injury, the expansion of Abbot Point port is intended to facilitate the export of coal from the massive Carmichael coalmine, which the Australian and Queensland governments have also recently approved.” The letter’s authors also expressed concern at the government’s decision, revealed by the Guardian in May, to interfere and have all mention of Australia and the Great Barrier Reef removed from a UNESCO report on world heritage sites and climate change. They said that action “casts further doubt on its commitment to addressing threats to the reef”. They also said UNESCO’s “capitulation” to Australia’s pressure was inconsistent with its aim to “do its utmost” to inform the public about the effects of climate change on world heritage properties. Noni Austin, an Australian lawyer at the US-based Earthjustice, said the current bleaching event showed the world heritage site was in crisis and “requires a new and urgent response from the committee.” “If the world heritage system is to have any value in protecting our most precious and irreplaceable places, the committee must address the threat of climate change and Australia must accept its duty to protect the Great Barrier Reef for the benefit of the global community by ceasing its relentless promotion of dirty fossil fuels,” she said. Jon Day, previously one of the directors at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and now at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, said the government’s own reports showed the reef’s outstanding universal values were being threatened. “The reef needs more government assistance, more leadership from industry and, crucially, more widespread public support if future generations are to enjoy what UNESCO considers is the most bio-diverse world heritage property on the planet,” he said."
" Australia’s first large-scale hybrid wind and solar farm is set to be built near Canberra, with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) providing a $9.9m grant. The money would go towards the $26m cost of building a 10MW solar photovoltaic plant alongside the existing Gullen Range windfarm.  Goldwind, one of the Chinese companies that will build and operate the project, said the solar farm was expected to generate about 22,000 MWh of electricity in the first year of operation, enough to supply about 3,000 homes.  Building the solar farm on the same location as the windfarm meant 20% could be saved from the construction costs of the solar farm, said Ivor Frischknecht, the chief executive of Arena. Arena recently commissioned an investigation into the costs and benefits of hybrid solar and windfarms. It found that besides huge cost savings – achieved mostly because the grid connection was able to be shared by the two generators – the two energy sources were often complementary, producing peak outputs at different times of both the day and year. That meant they combined to create a more reliable energy source. “Co-location provides more continuous energy generation as windfarms tend to generate more energy overnight whilst solar only generates during the day,” Frischknecht said. “Gullen windfarm generates more power in winter and the new solar farm will generate more in summer.” Frischknecht said he hoped that, by building the first example of a combined solar and windfarm, others would follow. “This is the first project of its type in Australia, so the lessons learned will be invaluable,” he said. “It has the potential to provide a blueprint for future projects and cement industry confidence in the approach.” Since the costs of connecting the solar farm to the grid were almost eliminated, there was less need for the farms to be very large just to recoup those costs. He said that meant the co-location strategy could unlock medium-scale PV projects. The project is expected to be completed in July 2017. It will be built and owned by two Chinese companies – Goldwind and Beijing and Jingneng Clean Energy – which own and operate the existing wind farm. After the Arena grant of $10m, another $10m is being lent to the project by National Australia Bank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, leaving the existing windfarm to fund the remaining $6m."
"Andrea Leadsom, the Tory leadership candidate and campaigner to leave the EU, vowed on Tuesday to continue with the UK’s commitments to tackle climate change and decarbonise the energy supply. She said that reducing greenhouse gases was a duty to future generations, and pledged to continue with the UK’s carbon budgets to set a limit on emissions.  Her promises, ahead of the first round of the Tory leadership vote among the party’s MPs, were significant. Many in the Brexit camp have disparaged climate change commitments and made abandoning the EU’s plans on emissions a key plank of their platform. Leadsom’s chances of snatching the prime ministership from the frontrunner Theresa May were boosted when Boris Johnson declared himself a supporter on Monday. She told an audience of energy professionals in Westminster: “It’s here that I’d like to be especially clear, to correct any misperceptions people may have about the implications of the EU referendum result. Decarbonising our energy system is not some abstract regulatory requirement. It is an essential responsibility that we hold towards our children and grandchildren, as the only way to effectively counter the threat of climate change.” She added: “However we choose to leave the EU, let me be clear: we remain committed to dealing with climate change.” The UK signed up to the landmark Paris accord last December that binds countries to avoid dangerous levels of climate change, but it negotiated as part of the EU. That would have meant the UK taking on shared national targets under the agreement, part of a bloc-wide “burden-sharing” arrangement that has still to be worked out in detail. Outside the EU, it is not clear what the UK’s next step will be in ratifying the Paris accord, although the government last week passed the latest “carbon budget” committing Britain to further reductions in emissions to the 2030s. Leadsom, the energy minister, was addressing the Utility Week energy summit just yards from parliament, where Conservative MPs were preparing to vote on which of the five candidates they want to drop out of the race before party members are presented with two, one of whom will become prime minister. During the referendum campaign, environmental issues played only a small part, but some of those prominent in the Brexit camp were clear in their opposition to climate regulations. The UK Independence party pledged in its 2015 general election manifesto to seek abolition of the Climate Change Act, under which the UK’s national emissions targets are set. Lord Lawson, one of the leading lights of the Brexit campaign, is also founder of a climate-sceptic thinktank. Leadsom set out her position: “The UK’s climate change act was passed by a majority of 463 votes to three. That is really quite extraordinary. The will of parliament has rarely been expressed so strongly and unambiguously.” She praised the government’s efforts on cutting emissions, encouraging investment in renewable energy, saying it was a “fantastic success story, of which industry and government can both be proud”. New jobs were being created and would be created in the future in energy industries, she said, including in shale gas exploration. She said she “made no apology” for the cuts in incentives for low-carbon power that the current government has made, and said the market would decide the UK’s future energy supply. Green campaigners said it was important that Leadsom, both as energy minister and as one of the main Tory leadership contenders from the Brexit camp, had reaffirmed action on climate change.  Simon Bullock, of Friends of the Earth, said: “In these uncertain times, these are welcome comments that the UK remains strongly committed to tackling climate change. But bizarrely Ms Leadsom’s prescriptions do not mention energy efficiency, the cheapest action of all, nor does she mention the spiralling cost of Hinkley nuclear power station while onshore wind and solar are already cheaper [than nuclear power], and with costs still falling.” Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace, said: “Andrea Leadsom’s defence of the UK’s world-leading climate change act is welcome, all the more so since some of her own MP supporters are inveterate climate sceptics. But it’s deeds, not words, that count, and much of what Leadsom has done as energy minister has been to undermine the clean technologies we badly need to meet our climate commitments.” Leadsom’s remarks were given a qualified welcome by Labour. Mary Creagh, Labour MP and chair of parliament’s environmental audit committee, told a meeting of the all-party parliamentary environment group: “Euroscepticism and climate scepticism are often two horns of the same goat.” Responding to the energy minister’s pledges, she said: “I have no reason to doubt her speaking in good faith.” But she noted that Leadsom came from a previous position in the Treasury, long regarded as lukewarm on climate change, and warned: “She would need to oversee a fairly radical change of direction at the Treasury [to fulfil her promises]. The likelihood of that happening while all eyes are on Europe? I’m not sure what grounds for optimism there are.”"
"One of the chief architects of the global accord on climate change signed last year in Paris has been nominated for the post of secretary general of the United Nations. Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC), won plaudits from around the world at the successful conclusion of the Paris talks in December. The summit saw all of the world’s nations agree for the first time to a binding commitment to avoid dangerous levels of global warming. She served as the UN’s climate chief from 2010, after the much-derided Copenhagen conference on climate change in 2009, until 1 July this year. She will be succeeded in that post by Patricia Espinosa, currently Mexico’s ambassador to Germany. Figueres joins a long list of candidates for the post of secretary general of the UN, currently held by the South Korean diplomat Ban Ki-moon, who has also made climate change a key priority of his premiership. The list includes Helen Clark, former prime minister of New Zealand and head of the UN Development Programme; António Guterres, former prime minister of Portugal and former UN refugee chief; and a former Croatian foreign minister, Vesna Pusić. The Paris climate conference was hailed as the most constructive round of talks yet held among the world’s nations on the difficult subject of cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Talks on global warming started in 1990, after a group of scientists convened by the UN concluded in 1988 that greenhouse gas emissions were affecting the climate. But the long-running talks were notable mainly for a failure to come to a comprehensive legally binding agreement, until last year. In 1992, most of the world’s countries, including the US and China, signed the UN framework convention on climate change, which bound them to tackle climate change but did not include specific measures to do so. In 1997, the Kyoto protocol to the underlying treaty set limits on greenhouse gas emissions from all the major developed countries, but was rejected by US lawmakers. The 2009 Copenhagen accords involved all the world’s major economies pledging cuts to carbon, but was not fully legally binding. In Paris, all of the 195 countries of the UN agreed that global warming must not be allowed to exceed 2C above pre-industrial levels, and countries pledged their own limits to emissions in accordance with that goal. Figueres, who had been involved in the long-running talks since the early 1990s before taking on her role as UN climate chief, was noted for her ability to bring warring factions together, with calm, good humour and occasional flashes of anger. She was nominated on Thursday afternoon by the president of her home country of Costa Rica, Luis Guillermo Solís. Figueres comes from a prominent Costa Rican political dynasty. Her father served three terms as president of the country, and was credited with shepherding the small nation towards democracy, unusual in Latin America at that time. She kept a framed photograph of him on the wall of her office at the UNFCCC’s headquarters in Bonn. For Figueres, care for the environment has always been a personal as well as a professional quest. She told the Guardian ahead of the Paris talks that she had been spurred by concern for the world that her children would grow up in, and had a personal epiphany when the Costa Rican golden frog, which she remembered vividly from her own childhood, had been declared extinct."
"A boom in shipping is aggravating air pollution in China and other nations in east Asia, causing thousands of deaths a year in a region with eight of the world’s 10 biggest container ports, scientists have said. Ship traffic, often overlooked compared to cars and factories that are far bigger causes of smog, has more than doubled off east Asia since 2005 and some pollution from the fuel oil of ships wafts inland, scientists said on Monday.   The Chinese-led study estimated that sulphur dioxide, which generates acid rain, and other pollution from ships caused an estimated 24,000 premature deaths a year in east Asia, mainly from heart and lung diseases and cancer.  About three-quarters of deaths were in China, and others mainly in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and South Korea, according to the study published in the journal Nature Climate Change based on satellite data-tracking of almost 19,000 vessels.  The death toll is a tiny though rising share of an estimated one million deaths caused annually by air pollution in east Asia, the study found. Given many uncertainties, the number of deaths could be as low as 14,500 or as high as 37,500, it said.  “A few years ago in east Asia the levels of shipping just weren’t that large. Now they’re huge,” Drew Shindell, one of the study’s authors at Duke University in the United States, told Reuters.  China’s Shanghai container port is the world’s busiest and China will start to demand cleaner fuels for ships in coastal regions from 2019. Thousands of protests are sparked every year in China as a result of concerns about environmental degradation.  North America and parts of Europe already require that ships operating close to land use more costly, less polluting fuel with a sulphur content below 0.1%. The US Environmental Protection Agency expects the North American controls will prevent 14,000 premature deaths a year by 2020.  Worldwide, the UN’s International Maritime Organisation (IMO) plans to cut the sulphur limit for ships’ fuel to 0.5% from 2020 from a current 3.5%.  The curbs could be delayed to 2025 if member states decide that refineries are unable to adapt in time. Natasha Brown, an IMO spokeswoman in London, said a decision is due in October.  The study also found that emissions of carbon dioxide, the main manmade greenhouse gas, from shipping off east Asia had doubled in less than a decade to 16% of the industry’s global total in 2013.  Other air pollutants from ships have a cooling effect on global climate, however, by reflecting sunlight into space. The cooling is likely to predominate for about another eight years before warming takes over, it said."

"The latest draft version of the TTIP agreement could sabotage European efforts to save energy and switch to clean power, according to MEPs. A 14th round of the troubled negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) free trade deal between the EU and US is due to begin on Monday in Brussels.  A leak obtained by the Guardian shows that the EU will propose a rollback of mandatory energy savings measures, and major obstacles to any future pricing schemes designed to encourage the uptake of renewable energies. Environmental protections against fossil fuel extraction, logging and mining in the developing world would also come under pressure from articles in the proposed energy chapter.  Paul de Clerck, a spokesman for Friends of the Earth Europe, said the leaked document: “is in complete contradiction with Europe’s commitments to tackle climate change. It will flood the EU market with inefficient appliances, and consumers and the climate will foot the bill. The proposal will also discourage measures to promote renewable electricity production from wind and solar.” The European commission says that the free trade deal is intended to: “promote renewable energy and energy efficiency – areas that are crucial in terms of sustainability”. The bloc has also promised that any agreement would support its climate targets. In the period to 2020, these are binding for clean power and partly binding for energy efficiency, in the home appliance and building standards sectors. But the draft chapter obliges the two trade blocs to: “foster industry self-regulation of energy efficiency requirements for goods where such self-regulation is likely to deliver the policy objectives faster or in a less costly manner than mandatory requirements”. Campaigners fear that this could tip the balance in future policy debates and setback efforts to tackle climate change. Jack Hunter, a spokesman for the European Environmental Bureau said: “Legally-binding energy standards have done wonders to lower energy bills for homes and offices, so much so that energy use has dropped even as the British economy has grown and appliances have become more power-hungry.  “Voluntary agreements have a place, but are generally ‘business as usual’ and no substitute for the real thing. If they became the norm, it would seriously harm our fight against climate change.” Another passage in the draft text mandates that operators of energy networks grant access to gas and electricity “on commercial terms that are reasonable, transparent and non-discriminatory, including as between types of energy”. This could create an avenue for preventing the imposition of feed-in tariffs and other support schemes to encourage the uptake of clean energy, according to lawmakers in Brussels. The Green MEP Claude Turmes said: “These proposals are completely unacceptable. They would sabotage EU legislators’ ability to privilege renewables and energy efficiency over unsustainable fossil fuels. This is an attempt to undermine democracy in Europe.” The environmental law consultancy, ClientEarth, was concerned that the new proposal effectively derogated responsibility for urgent climate change actions agreed at COP21 to the business sector.  “Industry is not the right entity to lead the fight against climate change,” said ClientEarth’s lawyer, Laurens Ankersmit. “It is madness for the EU and the US to rely on it in this way.” The energy chapter negotiations began as part of an EU push for unlimited access to exports of the US’s relatively cheap liquefied natural gas, much of it derived from shale. The EU is committed to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 80% by 2050, as measured against 1990 levels – and pledged a 40% CO2 cut by 2030 at the Paris climate conference, last December. But the new text says that: “the Parties must agree on a legally binding commitment to eliminate all existing restrictions on the export of natural gas in trade between them as of the date of entry into force of the Agreement”. Other countries wanting to trade with the EU or US would also find themselves up against requirements that they remove trade barriers. The draft says: “The Parties shall cooperate to reduce or eliminate trade and investment distorting measures in third countries affecting energy and raw materials.” In 2013, the EU’s trade commissioner Karel de Gucht promised the multinational oil giant Exxon that the energy chapter would remove obstacles to its expansion plans in Africa and South America."
